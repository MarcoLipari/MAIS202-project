I get a sick feeling in my stomach when people mention the prayers of children and their pure belief in whatnot ... they're that way because it's been smashed into their brains every Sunday.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm saying that many of the various Societies for Imaginary Beings could provide a hell of a lot of help to OWS. You don't have to think their spiritual beliefs are reasonable; the only ""belief"" relevant in this is the religious duty to fight injustice, especially the exploitation of the poor. You don't have to agree with them in all things, to make common cause together.

Churches aren't just collections of beliefs. They're also large, interconnected communities of people. Religious leaders are community leaders, people trusted and respected especially on ethical matters. People who would normally dismiss protesters will reconsider if their rabbi is among the people getting arrested. A priest defending OWS can reach people who would never listen to us.


And churches are institutions with the infrastructure needed to communicate information, motivate and organize large groups of people under common cause, organize transportation and supplies and services, and do it all from a position that is *very* hard for the government to discredit or interfere with. Freeze an activist's accounts because you don't like what they're saying and no one knows about it but their followers; freeze the state bishop's accounts and all hell would break loose.

We're not talking about making OWS a religious event, we're talking about appealing to the tradition of progressive advocacy and defense of social justice, to find common cause and encourage people to join. ","1320105611"

Now, as you see, here we have both posted 'XY' in these threads, because it may be ambiguous as to which gender is posting, and we wanted to be clear. This isn't really necessary, and i don't think it would be presumptuous if many, many males did not post that they are males  when making non-sexist comments in this subreddit or others.

Very few of the Muslims that are already here (UK for me) actually want anything like the societies they left behind, and not all of the kids of immigrants stay in their parents religion, and of those who do many do so only in the same sense that many Christians in the UK do so.

Ah, so now, we come to the crux of the issue. Who holds the burden of proof for the existence of god? I don't have to prove that leprechauns don't exist, do I?

&gt;I bet you just assumed that because everyone else around you believes that.

No, I assumed it because rainbows are a function of the visible light spectrum refracting through water, not a trail that leads to a pot of gold.

I've never personally witnessed an electron moving through metal, does that mean it doesn't happen?

&gt;A-Theist means without God, which means that an Atheist has come to a conclusion on the unprovable question of whether of not God exists.

This, I agree with. However,

&gt;Since neither conclusion is provable, both conclusions require a certain amount of faith if you believe them.

It takes no faith to not believe in something. I don't think god is nonexistent, I simply remain unconvinced of his existence.

&gt;What you are calling agnostic atheism looks like simple agnosticism to me

You can define it however you want, You could call a car an airplane if you wanted. That doesn't change what the word actually means, however.

&gt;Gnostic - Of or relating to knowledge, esp. esoteric mystical knowledge.

&gt;Agnostic - A person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena

You could be agnostic and still be a theist, you could simply agree that 'nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena'","1320105635"

**Life as Scoots**

In the primordial soup that was western eSports, [Scott ""SirScoots"" Smith](http://twitter.com/#!/SirScoots) discovered professional gaming in the era of trite server sponsorships for hardcore Counter Strike players. The event logistics coordinator took his production talents and dropped it into the eSports soup to evolve the standard for competitive gaming production in the early ages of online streaming. Mr. Smith spent many years at GotFrag and then at MLG after GotFrag was aquired by the league.  Eventually he was asked to relocate and decided to move on to other ventures.

Seizing the opportunity [Alex Garfield](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC-bpaNgOOg), the current CEO of [Evil Geniuses](http://myeg.net/team/), picked up Sir Scoots as COO for his multi-platform competitive gaming organization. What would come from the wicked pair can only be described as the world's most established western eSports team. Although newer to the Starcraft Scene, EG's players are constantly in either the entertainment or tournament championship spotlight. 

Today SirScoots can be seen weekly as a co-host on the long running [Live on Three](http://onemoregame.tv/index.php/shows/lo3.html) talkshow, part of the [OneMoreGame TV](http://onemoregame.tv/) media company where he holds his second COO title. Scoots can also be seen as a spectator, interviewee, and team supporter at almost all western eSports events.

Last Updated: Thread is 5 hour old. 155 Questions.

Q:[Can you get Idra to sing a duet with Cella when he goes to Korea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzivv?context=3)
&gt;I will ask him, but he is not contractually obligated to sing.

Q:[What did you think of the whole Milkis thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzjs6?context=3)
&gt;I actually have not paid much attention to it this week, as I was prepping for the EGMCS stream.

Q:[Do you think Slasher's hair was short enough?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzk4e?context=3)
&gt;Since the bet was ""shave his head"" I would say no. :)

Q:[What does the next year of eSports mean for the growth of the whole scene?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzmsk?context=3)
&gt;I think 2012 is poised to be a huge growth year for the scene. I would think SC2 continues to grow for one. Add to that DotA2, CS:GO (crosses fingers) and some other titles and we could see some other areas really start to grow again as well.


Q:[Can you give us information on the salary HuK agreed to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vznbl?context=3)
&gt;He does in fact have a salary. ;)


Q:[You've been in e-Sports for a long time, is this something you see yourself doing until retirement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vznup?context=3)
&gt;Pro gaming is something I hope to be involved with until I retire to some remote island or die.

Q:[What has been your most memorable moment with team EG so far?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzp8q?context=3)
&gt;WCG China with our various players...amazing event! Justin Fucking Wong! Being at Blizzcon when Grubby proposed to Cass...in his jersey! ;) Hugging my best bud Alex Garfield when HuK won MLG!

Q:[Things have been dark on the news front with demuslim. What is coming up for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzpyy?context=3)
&gt;As everyone knows DeMusliM is back home taking care of paperwork. Hopefully MLG, maybe a few other events, and as previously talked about in news, some time in Korea!

Q:[Can you please inform us about LZ? Like I know he's still in EG but you rarely hear about him. Is EG bitter at him for switching from T to Z? Any plans to move him over to AZ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzqvv?context=3)
&gt;No one is bitter at him for switching back to the race he played in BW. :) LZ has some attachments to the area of the US he lives in, so that is why he does not live at the lair. He has and will come out from time to time and train with the rest of the guys.

Q:[With the recent drama over tournament winnings in SC2, what role do you and EG play in making sure players get properly compensated? Any insight on how other teams might do this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzser?context=3)
&gt;Unfortunately, players not getting their prize money is nothing new to pro gaming. :( We tend to represent our players when coordinating attendance at events etc, so that also means we assist in communications and paperwork when it is time for our players to receive prize money. I imagine most larger teams operate in the same capacity.

Q:[What is your opinion on tournaments organizers paying the players extremely late and what you would do to reduce the time it takes for players to get paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzttf?context=3)
&gt;I think 30 days is a perfect and standard window of time to receive payment in the real world, and it should be the same here.
One way to speed up the process would be to take all player paperwork from every player as part of registration process. No need chasing the winners down online after they have left your event if they could not even participate without the docs. :)

Q:[Will we be seeing the EG players that are going to Korea in the GSTL under the EG banner or an EG/SlayerS union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vztzr?context=3)
&gt;Colin is hard at work on that announcement... ;)

Q:[We met at Orlando, I was collecting signatures for the MLG Orlando /r/starcraft poster charity auction.
I have an even bigger charity idea in the works. Were can I contact you to inquire if you//EG could help me out and help make this even more amazing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzu3p?context=3)
&gt;Drop me a private message here?

Q:[What do you think will allow for CS to come back from the dead or will it just be dead for good?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzuwy?context=3)
&gt;1)A decent starting version of CS:GO

&gt;2)A listening and adjusting Valve

&gt;3)A supportive hardcore (1.6 and CSS)

&gt;4)A shitload of new gamers trying it and seeing what I saw years ago

&gt;5)A solid level of major events and leagues using it 

&gt;6)UGP :)

Q:[What do you actually do on a daily basis for EG? Give me a day in the life of sir scoots.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzycq?context=3)

:) I spend my days working on both EG and OMG duties. So if I am not at an event, I am generally dealing with any issues that arise, shipping stuff out or visiting the lair, helping produce the OMG shows, EGMC casts, tips/tricks etc, watching various streams and such of our players and events, and usually capped off with some gaming!

Q:[You've been in Esports for a long time. Where do you truly see Esports going in the next year and do you see more opportunity for professional gaming now than you did when Counterstrike was at its peak?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzyzm?context=3)
&gt;I see professional gaming as something that will continue to grow for sure. As I said prior, current popular games growing more + new games will make for a great growth year.
I see a much larger fanbase that ever before, so that alone makes for more opportunity than back when CS peaked.

Q:[I used to follow PysionicReaver and then some drama shit happened and he left. Could you clarify on what happened?
Also I know that EG has plans of going into Dota2 (it was announced I believe) any major stuff planned or still in the works and confidential?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2vzznf?context=3)
&gt;No idea what happened with him. He decided to make up some stories and then disappear. Bye?
We have announced our new team and I guess one of the major things planned for them is to train in China. :)

Q:[What do you do if there is a giant in your house that won't leave who wants to steal your cat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w000q?context=3)

Q:[Are there plans to expand the EG House and your guys' dedicated training facilities to more than your sc2 division?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w00h9?context=3)
&gt;The house has already been used by our WoW team to bootcamp before Blizzcon and we will continue to use it for other divisions when it makes sense to do so.

Q:[Moba games are very popular in china, do you see china opening up to the western scene in the next year? and if so do you think moba games will become more popular than starcraft 2?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w00rj?context=3)
&gt;They are already hugely popular in many areas, not just China. We are sending our team to China, so they better open up quick because Evil is coming! ;)

Q:[Where do you see E-Sports in 5 years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w01ju?context=3)
&gt;One year at a time! If anything, I see it still growing and with far more mainstream support than currently!


Q:[If you had an annual budget of $10 million for your own personal esports expenditures, what would be your top 3 things you would spend it on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w02ey?context=3)
&gt;hmm...that's a tough one to do quickly!

&gt;I would buy some TV production trucks MNF style for one! After that would require real thought to figure out the best way to spend that kind of money.

Q:[What did you do before you became involved in professional gaming?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lvtb9/ama_weekly_presents_scott_sirscoots_smith/c2w037w?context=3)
&gt;My career is in event planning and onsite event logistics.

I don't think it's malicious so much as they haven't considered the consequences of their beliefs, but who does these days? It's like when I'm talking to Christians and they explain that Jesus is about love and if you love him you get into heaven. If you look at it from this angle, it's not malicious, it's just stupid. They haven't gotten as far as, ""but what if you don't accept Jesus but live a good life and are very spiritual?"" Well we know the answer is well you go to hell of course, but then you see them look really uncomfortable about that realization. Now Christianity appears maliciously stupid.

Scaling happens in a significantly different fashion in SR, because depending on what lane you are in, and how many kills/cs you are getting, you can have a significantly different amount of gold and level than everyone else.

In Dominion, you're typically all the same level with about the same amount of gold, so people are building up high end items at the same time. This results in significantly more defense/offense than one would typically expect. This is particularly notable and problematic for AP carries, who typically have a bit of a level advantage on much of hte opposing team in SR.","1320105643"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Hey there ahg1177. I can't imagine the challenges you face in your life or the difficulties you have to deal with. I know that the Catholic Church's position is not one you are likely to desire, but I will mention a view here that may help you since you ask about reconcilliation.

From the Catholic Church's perspective, having homosexual tendencies or urges is not sinful on its own. Homosexual sexual acts are the sins. So the best answer I have heard on the matter here that resolves some of the challenges is to seek reconciliation if you have had sex and choose to be celibate:

&gt; **1 Cor 7:8** - *Now to the unmarried and to widows, I say: it is a good thing for them to remain as they are, as I do*

Celibacy in service of God is a calling to all people. It is a more difficult path but one that has its own rewards and St. Paul calls us all to follow if we can.

I hope you can find an answer that will resolve the dilemma for you.","1320105644"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Which really sucks. I quit playing several versions ago because I got sick and tired of having to start new worlds after weeks of gameplay just to enjoy the new updates. I spent about 50 hours on my epic world and it was fantastic. But with every new beta version update you have to start a new world or live in the past. My old world doesn't even work anymore because there were at least a hundred minecart boosters and other things which no longer work with the more current versions.

I will wait until the REAL game is finally released before I ever play again.

TL;DR - Release the damn game already!

Edit - I've heard many people make the assumption that since Notch has already made so much money and is still making more they have really started to slake off on the updates. If the guy was true to his customers he would use the money he is getting paid for the Beta (which is basically a PRE-PURCHASE) to hire more employees (or at least enough) to actually get the game finished.","1320105683"
"newzealand","t5_2qhma","My understanding (i.e. pre-RWC) is that Phil Goff will happily show up to any debate so long as John Key is there - so he's open to debating with the other parties... just as long as Key is there.

John Key insists that it's a two horse race, minor parties are irrelevant and he will therefore only debate Phil Goff.  We can glean at least two things from this:

1. Key's brain can only hold so many talking points so that he's only good for one-on-one, and that's what his script-writers have programmed him for.  Throw him a tricky curveball question, or confront him directly and watch him squirm - Goff made him squirm a few times actually.  Also, every time his OS crashes, he smirks as he reboots.  Should have paid attention to the Green's Open Source in IT policies.
2. Key is trying to get the presidential style campaign system embedded into NZ politics, the problem is he really lacks the genuine charisma to pull it off and just looks like an awkward tool.  Just look at National's opening address with a ""town hall"" meeting with a wholly National supporting rent-a-crowd and a tactically placed ethnic rainbow in the front row.  It was a confused PR disaster from a bunch of rank amateurs.","1320105683"

It is tougher to hold back if you are the more experienced/better player but it makes the other person enjoy gaming more if they can wade through enemies because you keep them healed and ready for action.

We've all been there before, too many teammates trying to capture a point where some teammates could have been better served defending a flag that was just lost. That happens because there's no real way to communicate orders. The commander served that purpose of assigning orders to squads so that all squads were serving a purpose that wasn't redundant. 

I'm not asking for the commander to come back - I think a lot of how DICE worked around it works really well - but the part of the commander that is most missed, assigning orders and organizing squads, is really lacking.

Police officers routinely engage in behavior to justify their reactions, even when it is other officers who are engage in the original behavior. There is no accountability. 

An undercover police officer who acts like a protestor, throws a rock, or starts a fight. 

It is not beyond the police to act like this, and in fact has been a part of their strategy which is what the 2003 quote is demonstrating, not to mention the years and years of this behavior. However if a police force was transparent and had uniformed officers present the level of accountability instantly goes up. Now you might argue that people won't tolerate a uniformed officer in their midst. However anyone, regardless of their uniformed status, who presents themselves in a respectful manner is much more likely to garner respect. 

I don't think this is a glorification of protesters, however it is questioning the ultimate motivation of a police force that hides officers amongst a group of people. What if these officers do initiate illegal behavior? It wouldn't be the first police force to use entrapment.

When someone get's term'd, a folder with their email address would dropped in step 1.  When working, it would be put into something like a step1.working folder.  Once that's doe, it gets dropped into step2, etc... until all steps are done.

Each step would log it's session any any check results into log files in that user's folder.

And the thing running the whole show would be a script that starts at step1... if it sees anyone, it moves them to step1.working, and starts them working.  Checks if anyone in 1.working is done, and moves them to step2 if so (and no errors).  Checks step2, and so on and so forth.

The immovable stone is defined by it's fixed position.  It is not fixed by infinite force Z, where Z+1 would counteract its stationary force.  The test for immovability is the exclusion of motion, so as long as Z=Z and movement is not possible, then the stone maintains the property of Z, being immobility.

I think 'infinite series', an imaginary yet malleable construct is seperate from 'infinite power', where the abstract power is not physical force, but the unintuitive 'power' to break logic.","1320105699"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Gut bacteria changes the amount of calories you absorb from food. It matters, but it also falls into the categories I established.

And please do some basic research into how you metabolize food- the process you're describing is simply not compatible with everything else we know about metabolism.

Unless the diet soda is making your digestion better and more efficient, allowing it to absorb things it previously couldn't, then the only thing you could possibly be talking about is insulin production.

You know what happens when your pancreas gets confused about whether or not it has sugar? You get diabetes. Otherwise, sugar you've got in your bloodstream is turned into glycogen, which is either used elsewhere or turned into fat. Always, and at the same rate.

Any explanation other than *eating more* or *exercising less* because of psychological factors would require that the human body become more efficient at absorbing and storing calories than it already is *because* of diet soda.

Its like my whole body went from ambient temperature to 110 degrees instantly (maybe because such a sudden arousal was unexpected? I dont know). But man I will be chasing that feeling for years, I have no idea how to get it back. 

One year for my birthday a girlfriend gave me a 'concubine for a day' gift card, redeemable to her, for anything I wanted sexually, all day. Best gift ever! Had sex for hours on end.

The thing is; i also write this plugin img2tab ([firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/img2tab/), [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kbbalffcbdlngpklndognfpcipmhdmod)).

I have ported the code to c# .net and it works with multiwall.

I could probably write a quick mash-up that will do what you want, perhaps next weekend.

As for how it would work

What I did is:

1. Download the url content, being the reddit html or rss.

2. Regex out every link you can find. (dont just do img tags or links) its not great for wallpaper.

3. Follow every link and hit test checking the mime-type.

4. If the mimetype is an image, then download it and check the resolution. probably discard it if iits area is quite small, like 250x250.

5. If its not an image, give recurse on the link. (sometimes the image is just 1 page away, like wallpaper sites or imgur)

6. This process can be really slow with pages with lots of hidden links like reddit. So basically you can just add a few hacks for common sites like reddit, which will help speed it up. Like for example, add a hack for imgur, that regex detects an imgur link and then just rewrites the direct image url for you instead of hit testing.

To be fair though, what you will get out from it in the end is that parsing out wallpaper is just hell, making it generic for any html is just too difficult, its better to have these custom wrappers around each different site.

For reddit its a big mixed bag of fish, probably best to just keep it to direct links and imgur links.

OR

Do all ur crawling server-side and let the client hit that for a top list.

The other problem I was concerned about is NSFW wallpaper that might automatically hit your desktop, thats why MultiWall is the way it is, I initially use reddit as a feed, but you just cant rely on nsfw tags etc, someone will eventually cop something inappropriate. Its better to only automatically display something moderated. Thats why it has a rating system etc.

Another thing worth mentioning is, MultiWall has its own feed which should contain most quality from this sub-reddit.
You could make use of its existing stream, its json and easy to use.

[MultiWall Stream](http://windowbox.me/multiwall/community/view.php)

I've made a forum post requesting your feature here:

Obviously I can do exactly what you want.

Guess where this is posted: in the COMPETITIVE DISCUSSIONS FORUM. Which no one, ever looks at. 
Almost everything, including champion feedback, lore, item, graphical feedback etc. is discussed in general discussion and that's why it is BY FAR the biggest LoL forum. Red's respond to anything in there, it has become the de-facto all encompassing forum and there is a long term precedent that it is where the community and riot interact the most.

However, Matt Marcou and Riot seemed scared to talk about this issue in the appropriate sphere (general discussion) where people will actually see it and try to hide a response in a hardly ever used forum so Marcou doesn't have to face the music.

Even disregarding the decision and whether it was the right choice to make (it wasn't) this cowardice in combination with their very heavy censoring of people who spoke out against them yesterday are, quite frankly, disgraceful. This is exactly what I didn't expect from them and is just making me more and more angry about this situation.

At the Ford dealership they want you to finance with Ford Credit, for example. It's not a charity or credit union. It's not that profit-taking on the car loan is just the domain of sleazy used car lots, everybody does it, it's just that the bad-credit specialists charge the worst interest.

And, just to play devil's advocate, what's the alternative? Cap car loans at 10% and thereby pretty much deny cars to people with bad credit? Then they can't get a car at all, and then they probably can't get a job.

**Â§ 46.2-613. Offenses relating to registration, licensing, and certificates of title; penalty.**

No person shall:

1. Operate or permit the operation of a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by him to be operated on a highway unless (i) it is registered, (ii) a certificate of title therefor has been issued, and (iii) it has displayed on it the license plate or plates and decal or decals, if any, assigned to it by the Department for the current registration period, subject to the exemptions mentioned in Article 5 (Â§ 46.2-655 et seq.) and Article 6 (Â§ 46.2-662 et seq.) of this chapter.

**Â§ 46.2-662. Temporary exemption for new resident operating vehicle registered in another state or country.**

A resident owner of any passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle, other than those provided for in Â§ 46.2-652, which has been duly registered for the current calendar year in another state or country and which at all times when operated in the Commonwealth displays the license plate or plates issued for the vehicle in the other state or country, may operate or permit the operation of the passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle within or partly within the Commonwealth for the first thirty days of his residency in the Commonwealth without registering the passenger car, pickup or panel truck, or motorcycle or paying any fees to the Commonwealth.

**Definitions that might be relevant:**

""Nonresident"" means every person who is not domiciled in the Commonwealth, except: (i) any foreign corporation that is authorized to do business in the Commonwealth by the State Corporation Commission shall be a resident of the Commonwealth for the purpose of this title; in the case of corporations incorporated in the Commonwealth but doing business outside the Commonwealth, only such principal place of business or branches located within the Commonwealth shall be dealt with as residents of the Commonwealth; (ii) a person who becomes engaged in a gainful occupation in the Commonwealth for a period exceeding 60 days shall be a resident for the purposes of this title except for the purposes of Chapter 3 (Â§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of this title; (iii) a person, other than a nonresident student as defined in this section, who has actually resided in the Commonwealth for a period of six months, whether employed or not, or who has registered a motor vehicle, listing an address in the Commonwealth in the application for registration shall be deemed a resident for the purposes of this title, except for the purposes of the Virginia Commercial Driver's License Act (Â§ 46.2-341.1 et seq.).

""Nonresident student"" means every nonresident person who is enrolled as a full-time student in an accredited institution of learning in the Commonwealth and who is not gainfully employed.

**TL;DR** Unless you're a student, you probably are a resident of Virginia and are required to register in the Commonwealth within 30 days","1320105745"

I'll echo the other folks saying ""do the reading,"" but also study. Here's how to study for tests and exams:

1. Start by reading through the whole assignment/chapter/book, whatever. Read the whole thing, straight through.

2. There's usually a study guide or questions at the end of the chapter or something your professor gave you; even if it's a list of what you'll be tested on. Try to answer all the questions in one pass; mark the ones you don't know or are unsure off.

3. Go back through the reading/assignment/book, but this time focus on the topics you struggled with. Skim everything else.

4. Answer the questions again; again note the ones you have trouble with.

5. Go through the reading again...
Repeat until you can answer all the questions. You don't have to do this all on the same day; in fact it's best if you spread this out over three or four days. If you find that there are questions you are just not getting or concepts you don't understand EMAIL THE PROFESSOR or ask about it in class.

6. The day of the test/exam, go over the study guide/questions again before class and cover any remaining difficult ones.

Ron Paul has one of the most, if not the most, consistent political views we have seen of any politician. He is not a hypocrite, he simply has views that he truly believes in (just like you do). He respects your views as you should respect his, and lets you and your local state decide how to enact those rules and regulations.

Darn!  So close!

&gt; *""Good and omni-good cannot mean the same thing[, as far as I can figure.  Can you explain what you mean?]""*

Sure!

While a human can only be good, there is no difference between a god that is omnibenevolent and a god that is good; a god that is not omnibenevolent is a god that allows suffering, and I don't consider that god to be good either.  I'd call it ""neutral"" at best or ""evil"" at worst.  However, as you might define your god to be ""goodness"" incarnate even if it allows or causes suffering, we would disagree on these terms.

To reduce confusion, it may help to further simplify the ""evidential problem of suffering:""

1. A powerful god can prevent suffering.
1. A knowledgeable god would be aware of suffering.
1. A good god would want to prevent suffering.
1. There is at least one instance of suffering in the world that could have been prevented by a god having all three of these traits without interfering with free will.

In fact, let's make it even simpler:

1. A god can prevent suffering.  (An entity that is not powerful enough to prevent suffering is not a god.)
1. A god would be aware of suffering. (An entity that is ignorant of suffering is not a god.)
1. A good god would want to prevent suffering.
1. There is at least one instance of suffering in the world that could have been prevented by a good god without interfering with free will.

&gt; *""You didn't provide any example. If you believe that anything you said in any way support the truthness of your fourth premise, please point me to it.""*

I mentioned [tsunamis.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/fmn9s/first_last_and_only_foray_into_ratheism/c2u59t5)

&gt; *""Augustine, more than a thousand years ago, dealt with this objection. It is not necessary that you are perfectly strong.""*

Can you link me or explain this to me?

&gt; *""It is only necessary that you are maximally strong, that is, that you are stronger than everything else.""*

I think there's a difference between being maximally strong and being the strongest.

&gt; *""All-powerful, all-knowing and all-good do not translate to your previous argument of omnipowerful, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. They are different concepts.""*

I was under the impression these terms were synonymous.  If you believe they are not, please explain the difference.  Or better yet, if you understand what I'm trying to say, just tell me which terms would reduce confusion.

&gt; *""Semantics is important if you are shifting meanings amidst your arguments.""*

Agreed.  However, when I say ""semantics,"" I'm saying the disagreement is a result of differences in definitions and not of any difference in actual philosophy.  I don't enjoy the former as they are meaningless.

&gt; *""Irrelevant. It is the only reason advanced by the Bible as for why you should worship God. It is also the only reason necessary.""*

If your holy book told me to worship my parents because my parents created me, but my parents physically or sexually abused me, I wouldn't worship my parents.  If your holy book told me not to worship Captain Picard, but Captain Picard was an outstanding Starfleet officer, I would respect Captain Picard.

In other words, I reserve my respect for those who earn it, and I respect ""good"" entities, not necessarily just powerful ones.  I don't see why I should respect your god just because a book says it exists and also says it created me and *also* says I should respect your god because it created me.

You might've noticed I ended up saying ""respect"" instead of ""worship.""  That's just the result of not knowing what it means to worship something.  I'd feel as though I would be lying if I said I would worship something just because it's powerful or kind.

&gt; *""In a way. The verb worship has more than one meaning, did you know?""*

Why do you worship them and in what way?

&gt; *""You didn't answer my question. How do you know that the tsunami isn't the best possible scenario?""*

I believe I did: humans' capacity to reduce naturally occurring suffering means a god did not.

&gt; *""Furthermore, how do you know that humans have actually reduced any suffering?""*

Example situation:

1. Sandwiches reduce hunger and contain many nutrients.
1. A child is suffering from starvation and malnutrition due to a natural drought in his area.  The child is in pain because of starvation and malnutrition.
1. I give the child sandwiches.
1. As a result of this sandwich, the child is no longer suffering from starvation and malnutrition.  The child is no longer in pain.

This or similar situations have occurred countless times throughout history.

I assume questioning the potential of humans to reduce any suffering whatsoever in response to natural disasters is the direct result of trying to protect the goodness of your god.  This is rationalization at its most extreme.  You have previously demonstrated excellent arguments, so I feel this argument is beneath you, to be honest.","1320105752"

Sometimes our sig. others see things in us that we can't.  Like how i've been ignoring my fitness and health, putting it off, while my GF is very active.  She's been talking to me about his for a while, and I've made various attempts, none too successful.  I keep thinking I'll take care of it soon, but that doesn't work.  It's taken her almost breaking up with me and us being on break (we still are), to realize that I need to get in shape, and now.  Its something that I've always wanted for myself deep down, but haven't applied it to my life.  She showed me that I may have let my lack of motivation to do something good for myself cause me to lose someone I love.  And even if she doesn't come back to me I've realized what I need to do and am doing it.  I've been exercising and eating less meat and food in general for weeks now and it feels amazing. I'm losing weight and in addition I just feel good about doing something good for myself.  Its win-win for me, because if she comes back after realizing that I actually can walk the walk (I do for most things, just not personal health), thats awesome.  but if she doesn't, I will be on my way to having a better body, which is probably the one major problem with my life now.  And i'll be hot :D

edit: we've been together for 2 years now, and she's explained thoroughly that it's not about looks (though i'm sure it is a little bit), but rather about health and well-being.

According to the article, the police obtained a search warrant because an informant claimed Antoine Black had stolen a police officer's gun.  While they were looking for the gun, they happened upon the cash and some drug paraphernalia.

If they don't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime, they shouldn't be able to keep the cash.  It looks like he has already won that battle, but they didn't give him all the money back.  They are claiming that they only took $30k, not $43k.

&gt; Marsico said the amount of money seized from Blackâs home was over-estimated initially and that the $28,980 figure is accurate. All cash that was taken was given back to Black after the arbitration ruling, he said.

As far as the stress goes, there are probably two main things to keep in mind: don't take anything personally (I did, and that's why I don't wait tables anymore), and try the best you can to stay out of the ridiculous drama/politics that working in a restaurant breeds.

&gt; ""In the 1920s the Japanese were being taught that their emperor, living in a 280-acre park in central Tokyo, was more than just a mere human being - he was called a living god. Children were educated to think of the emperor as a god in the form of a human being. In Japan it was in the interests of one group more than any other that the emperor be perceived as an all powerful living god - the armed forces.

You are the same level as me, so take all my comments with a large dose of salt.

Move 15 (M18) feels a bit off. I would think it better to leave the white group alone for now, until you know for sure if you want to remove the base or press it from above to force it live small and locally.

White seems to come out a bit better from the lower right corner approach on move 35 (P3). But I'm not familiar with how the high-wide pincer works, so no idea what the best moves for black would be in that area.

Move 49 (G12) looks like it is trying to build a moyo, but white is already inside it with the stone at G16. I think I would try to do something with white's left side instead. Like the 3-3 invasion that comes a bit later.

I really like move 86 (N7). Just at the point were it is really hard for black to take it, but playing defensively feels like a huge loss.

I think move 121 (H2) should have been used to invade/reduce the white moyo in the center. J6 looks like it can do the job.","1320105789"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I'm wondering if /atheism is filled with wrath

No. There's some anger at social injustices caused by religion sometimes, but I refuse to categorize memes and jokes as indicative of 'wrath'. Poking fun of silliness on the internet is not the ending of the movie 'Seven'.

&gt;or if you think every religion is stupid

I think every religion that I'm willing to call a religion is wrong and at least partly illogical, not necessarily stupid. If it values faith over critical thinking with regard to the important questions in life, I'm basically always going to call it detrimental.

&gt;It asks you to believe in nothing you haven't experienced, and the emphasis is openly about love, acceptance, truth, and compassion.

No, that's how you interpret and apply Buddhism. There are quite a lot of major countries and sects which are very different from yours, and devote themselves to spiritual rituals and acts, and have regularly engaged in violence. Even the Dalai Llama and his order ran a country in which opposing voices and political interests were suppressed, and the population kept poor for the glorification of the religious orders, until they got kicked out, at which point he becomes a lot more sympathetic because he has no power to abuse.

Yes, Buddhism as it is sometimes understood and applied can be reasonable and good. Much like many Catholics ignore the supernatural and amoral claims of their faith, and simply live their own good lives using the books selectively as inspiration. There's still some concepts common to Buddhism I disagree with, such as sublimation of desire and the concept that cosmic justice exists to substitute for human justice, but 'Buddhism' isn't a single religion or tenent and so I can't defend it as a general category, only individual beliefs.

If a book or philosophy contains true ideas, then they should be respected, whether they are religious or not. If those same books make supernatural claims and require rituals that don't make sense, they should be ignored, unless there is some good reason to do otherwise. Why not just do what others do, and take good ideas wherever you find them without having to identify with any religion?","1320105790"

The problem with this is that candy was invented at a specified point in time, therefore making candy not possible to exist without time. Therefore, the only logical conclusion we can come to is that candy exists and doesn't exist simultaneously when time is candy, thus breaking the laws of the universe as a whole, which would cease the universe from continuing existing in its current state.

So the final conclusion is that either Pinkie Pie has created an alternative universe in which the laws of science do not apply, or she has destroyed all universes as a whole.

They have so many trees down and they don't have enough subcontractors to remove them before they can work.

No, just having the most force doesn't make it cost-effective to use it, nor does it guarantee victory against *all* factions, unless you have an absolute majority of the power.

Also, this is just a fact of life, not a situation that anyone has created.

&gt;No, a state is an organized political community, living under a government. That's why I said that you'd be forming a de facto government, and not a legitimate one. But it is just one small step from there to an actual legitimate government.

I suppose you can call it a government because that's what it essentially is, or at least could be. The difference is that it is voluntary and not a monopoly, as opposed to a state.

&gt;Even by your rationale, no government would still have an anarchist ""state"", because it requires enough people to support it in order to work.

At worst it requires enough people to *not* support the state, but it doesn't require any kind of ideological support from the population like government today does. Most people are indifferent to politics as it is anyways.","1320105804"

I don't disagree with the ideology that you should be able to do what you'd like as long as you don't infringe upon the rights of someone else. I think that is a common thread among many different ideologies. If we followed that ideology, we wouldn't have these awful drug laws.

I think it's clear that a different ideology, which says you *can* infringe upon the rights of others as long as a majority legislators (in either a current or past session) state that it's okay, has already blown up in our faces. That's what we're dealing with now.

Of course, weapon damage is currently not in beta, and we have no debuff to test with, and of course everything is subject to change, but why not just say it the way it is currently.

1) weapon damage
2) self buffs (glass cannon, sparkflint)
3) attack
4) wizard damage%
5) debuffs (time warp, conflagration, bone chill, disruption)

We also currently have no way to confirm whether or not the self buffs (2) and debuffs (5) are additive or multiplicative.  I don't think that citing other games is valid at all for what Blizzard will do with damage in D3.  Citing D2 in particular is nutty because we know for sure that it is a completely different set of devs.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","&gt; It might've made Bonds a little bit better

Seriously? He had the bests most suspicious seasons of his career from ages 35-39, you can look at a hundred years of history and never see that kind of explosion held up over consecutive years. Ellsbury is 27 years old so thanks for following up on my point there. Also he only hit only 50+ homeruns once cause no one pitched to him, he put up his best god damn OPS of 1.368 over those 4 years! He was certainly a player of producing Pujols like 1000+ OPS numbers in his prime but as a 35-39 year old he put up UNGODLY NUMEBRS!

Another thing, anyone who works out knows Steroids don't affect everyone the same way, the kind in baseball was also primarily used for increasing muscle mass, increased muscle mass doesn't help most pitchers. I'll admit a certain level of skill is absolutely necessary to succeed at baseball, but more muscle mass = more power = farther hit balls which obviously leads to more home runs for a player who connects. Some players are good players cause they're quick, some are better cause they're stronger, Steroids have a known effect of increasing strength and obviously gave an advantage to big slow players who were the most valuable players at the time. We can't quantify these effects cause we don't have real data on who was on Roids and who wasn't thanks to not testing soon enough and designer roids that didn't show up in tests, but we certainly can look at the obvious cases like Bonds and know something was up, those seasons just don't happen. 

If you're that in love with the home run I think I know why your stupid porch is 314 feet and doesn't even curve out like most baseball walls. ","1320105838"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","My goals are overall fitness, but I'd like to gain muscle mass.

I'm fairly experienced in the gym, I believe. I would still consider myself very much a beginner. I started lifting seriously about 3 years ago, however there was a long time where I didn't lift, and fell off the wagon due to a wrist injury (not lifting related). I would say over the last 3 years I have a solid year and a half experience. I'm fairly weak at the moment because I'm just coming back.

Most of my experience is around isolation lifts. I typically do something like back/bi, cardio, chest/tri, rest, shoulders/legs, cardio, rest (typically doing core on most days).

I'm wanting to get more into compound lifts and 'big boy' lifts such as squats and deadlifts. 

I'm a little bit overweight (6'1 228 lbs), and I came down from being 300 lbs a few years ago, so burning fat is still a goal of mine, which is persuading me to move more towards the full body route. I don't typically count reps, I just go until fatigued, but if I'm doing, say, more than 10-12 reps then I'll add weight.

Just for an idea on a few lifts -

For curls I'm at about 90 lbs for 6-8 reps (3 sets)

For bench I'm at about 215 max on bar. I usually bench dumbbells, I'm currently at about 150 lbs (75lb dumbbells) for 6-8 reps (3 sets)

For military press I'm fairly weak at about 120 lbs for 6-8 reps (3 sets)

So those are some ideas. I'm quite weak on squats, I just did those last weekend and I had a hard time doing more than 120lbs more than 4-5 times when going real deep. My legs are fairly week.

Can you elaborate a bit on why this workout seems bad and poorly focused for any goal?

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I agree that our penal system is not in any way meant to rehabilitate criminals, and it's a shame.  

A psychological evaluation could theoretically be used to fight pre-crime.  But our legal system is opposed to such an institution.  Propensity does not equal the intent or even the likelihood to commit a crime.  

I don't think I need to bring this up, but obviously such a psychological evaluation would be nearly impossible to come up with in reality (I realize we're speaking in theory).  It would introduce a level of subjectivity to the law as well.  Depending on who has the discretion, you may have an *appointed* official making the decision (someone in the police force, for example).  So now you've forfeited guaranteed second amendment rights to the whim of someone who wasn't even an elected official.  

And that's really the crux of it, is the second amendment was designed to protect joe schmo, even if he has the latent characteristics of a future criminal.  Not saying that ideology will result in the fewest crimes, but we are bound to it by the bill of rights (somewhat), so it's very unlikely we would ever implement something like that.  

I would postulate that the number of people who applied and got their CCW, who subsequently committed their first crime using a gun simply because of the availability of the gun, is statistically insignificant.  However, once again I did originally say ""more people"" should get it, so we would need to consider the possibility of this happening with someone selected from a semi-random selection of the populace.  So it might be a higher number, who knows?  

But my main point is, the ideology ingrained in our legal code holds personal liberty higher than personal safety.  ","1320105864"

Last thing: ask your doctor about sleeping aids. Personally, mine reccomended Melatonin, which you can get over the counter. From how I understand it, it's more of a vitamin than a drug. It doesn't knock you out, it just gets your body ready for sleep. For me, the key was sleeping normally. When you're tired everything is harder, even when you're mentally healthy.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I've seen cases where people break into homes, steal collections, and pawn them because it's quick cash.  Why would he sell a gun?  Because he can buy a cheaper one that does the same job.  Do you ever wonder why most confiscated weapons are Hi points, Brycos, Jennings, Rohms, old-ass revolvers etc.? Is it JUST because criminals are poor? But if that's true, then your idea of stealing weapons off base/someone's house makes no sense otherwise we'd have tons of guys walking around with high-quality weapons and not the six fucking Hi Point 380s and 2 Smith and Wesson sigmas we got last month.

A good Beretta could get you close to $400 at a pawn shop or face to face in a private sale (not just criminal to criminal). Sell it, buy a hi point from a gun trader board for $100 (or even legally since not all criminals are necessarily felons already) and you profited $300 and still have a gun which you can use. This shit happens all the time. An old guy got his house broken into a few weeks back in the local area and had his collection stolen which included Collectible Colt SAA revolvers, and a .338 Lapua rifle. Guess what showed up at two pawn shops 30 miles outside the city? 

And no, guns don't get stolen ""all the time"" from base armories. Those things are monitored and regulated tightly. I know because I go to one every morning.  Does it happen? No shit, but it's always, ALWAYS been some dipshit junior enlisted and his buddies who want new toys.  Those Aks and SVDs stolen out of Cali a few months back?  Just watch; it'll come back on one of the guys who work at the armory.


And no, it's not a moot point.  A slick fucking lawyer can take something you're so sure about, and make you look unreliable. Was it an M9? Yes? Oh, did it have this marking, did you see the rail?  Oh, did it say this or this?  Oh you don't know?  But you're so sure about everything else?  It happens like that, as stupid as it sounds.  When giving a statement about a robbery, it's best to describe what the weapon is in general terms: It was a pistol, black, full-size, possibly 9mm. It was a small, silver revolver, possibly a small caliber. It was a small hunting knife, black handle. Etc.  Don't set yourself up to get screwed, and never make assumptions.","1320105869"
"Hunting","t5_2qlkx","Looks like a good choice.  The anti-dry fire is a indispensable feature - it's not like a bow where you know the arrow is in place because you don't really see it in a crossbow while aiming.  This could save you a lot since a dry-fire can ruin your crossbow.  
The power stroke is adequate and the physical weight is light so you won't feel worn out lugging it around like most of the heavy crossbows out there.
I would go for the 165lb if you are sticking to 30  yards or less - when shooting much further you risk the deer jumping, ducking or dodging the bolt and a smart old doe reacts very fast. 
The reason for choosing the lighter draw weight one, and both are good choices, is that a crossbow has a lot of tension and you will find that your serving on the string will separate faster with a heavier bow and you are only gaining about 20-fps - most, especially heavy, crossbows need a new serving between 50-100 shots as it is.  There are bound to be great advances in strings, bow weight reductions and quieter crossbows in the near future so you will probably want to trade up when the improvements become irresistible.  BTW, I took a doe last year - ground shot, pass through @ 28 yds - with my Parker Enforcer ;-)","1320105869"

Your question about how he figures some things out and knows others intuitively is tricky. I didn't put as much thought into how he would discover these details as I could have, I was kind of getting myself warmed up for tomorrow and just putting words to a page. I imagined the character to be adept at quickly making sense of reality, since he is constantly thrown into new ones...it's become a sort of skill that he's acquired and brings with him from one blink to the next. I didn't communicate this since I didn't have the narrative toolset to do so, the result being I guess he just kind of stumbles upon some very deep concepts when he shouldn't.

Ohhhh, I get it. Asshole Ron Paul wants to get rid of the loans that are the cheapest for students to pay off. He would get rid of subsidized Federal loans that not only allow students to have a low interest rate of 4%, but don't start collecting interest until after they graduate. No, Ron Paul wants students to pay more.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Former Mormon missionary here, seems you were an average Joe with respect to Mormon doctrine and history before your mission. I was pretty well versed in Mormon doctrine and history beforehand and never felt someone could ask too many questions or shied away from the inquisitive types. I even encountered some great atheist!

I was in Guatemala and you give a good picture of what it's like to present religion to the under educated people who come from a very superstitious, primarily catholic, background. I served for a year in a wealthy part of Guatemala and where majority of people had decent education and where very hip on American/Western culture. 

Believe it or not this was the are I had by far the most success with converts. I happened to be very good at the ""Commitment Pattern"" you mentioned, which is really nothing more than glorified ""Sales Tactics"", which worked great for me when I returned.

Every kind of learning has to be done incrementally, religion is no exception. Think about it, ""give them milk before meat"" is basically, start with the basics and then add more complexity. Sounds like every subject I've every learned about. Try starting off with Algebra before basic Arithmetic.

I don't think there is anything inherently wrong or unethical about religious proselytizing, Mormonism included.  I was seriously indoctrinated from childhood and believed very firmly in the doctrines. And sought to back them up with as much logic or evidence as I could muster. I didn't expect people, uneducated or educated, to initially be well versed in their new religion. It would be nice if everyone were, but seeing as most people aren't, it's wasn't much different than the status quo.

"comics","t5_2qh0s","You're a stormtrooper, working your nine-to-five on the Tattoine patrol, when you get redeployment orders from command - you've been assigned to the new Death Star quagmire that's been stop-and-start for the past thirty years. It's a bad idea from the get-go, but you get paid whether it works or not. After all, the rebels aren't exactly the best funded group in the universe, and the whole station's guarded at *every* level. Who's going to infiltrate it?

Then, one day, it happens. That stupid Corellian YT freighter shows up, with a pirate, a kid, a hairball, two comic relief droids, and an old man in a bathrobe. *The cake is about to get walked*, you think to yourself. So a bunch of your buddies open fire on them and *sweet tapdancing Mothra he's got a laser sword*! And it's *bouncing your fellow stormtroopers' blaster bolts back at them*! Your comrades-in-arms are getting gunned down by their own shots!

You're in position. You can't run away. You can't throw down your weapon. You have to take aim. You have to shoot. But then it occurs to you - He can't bounce your shot back if it's nowhere near him.

Sure, it makes you look incompetent, but you're a faceless grunt on the most economically ill-advised venture since they built that giant statue of Palpatine back on Coruscant. You know people around here get killed for sympathizing with the rebels, or badmouthing Lord Vader's philosophy, but simple incompetence seems to be a downright positive trait in the Empire. Besides, in a worst-case-scenario, you can always blame it on a Jedi mind trick. Hell, Vader would probably like that better than saying ""I missed.""

So you aim, and you shoot around the old man and his pals, taking great care not to get any of your shots within a 2-meter radius of them. And you live to deposit another paycheck with Tarkin's signature on it.

And when they leave, you finally decide that you could probably cope with this assignment after all, and you stop putting in applications to be transferred to Cloud City. Sure, your supervisor says you could get the transfer tomorrow if you wanted, but then you'd lose your place in the R&amp;R rotation, and you wouldn't get to see the scheduled station demo on Yavin 4 - and succeed or fail, it's bound to be a fireworks show.","1320105878"

that is not how it works. when anyone pays 100% attention to anyone it is creepy.

when my gf and i go out i typically pay more attention to whoever we're out with because i see them less. my time with them is limited whereas i'll be talking to my gf on the car ride home and before we go to bed.

also i like to be the center of attention. you can't do that if you're sticking to one person. OP's bf may be a flirt or he may just be highly social. the exact same guy, if viewed positively, could be described as getting along great with his gf's friends.

we need more information before we can judge. if the OP is insecure and making a mountain out of a molehill this is her problem. if the bf is being inappropriate then it is his problem. we just can't know.

&gt; If you think he is flirting then he is flirting, trust yourself

this is bad advice. people her age are often insecure, which can drive them to create issues that aren't there. this wouldn't be the first time ""friendly"" and ""flirty"" were confused if the bf is indeed just being friendly. trusting oneself over getting outside opinions can be a recipe for disaster.","1320105879"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The first problem with your logic is that the dopamine is but one theory of schizophrenia, and is by no means the most scientifically supported one at this point.  Honestly the most significant argument FOR the dopamine hypothesis is that D2 blockers provide symptom reduction in many patients.  However as I'm sure you can guess, that's poor reasoning to conclude that dopamine is therefore the CAUSE of schizophrenia when it could simply be a mediating factor or could be completely unrelated to the pathogenesis. 

Now, as for the rest of your points, dopamine blockade *does* produce an increase in dopamine release which is what partially accounts for extra-pyramidal side effects like dyskinesia, it's also why newer (atypical) antipsychotic meds try to more selectively target certain dopamine receptors and avoid others.  With that said, I think where you've gone wrong is that not ALL D2 receptors are inhibitory, some are autoreceptors and others are excitatory or inhibitory.  Hope this helps somewhat.","1320105906"

I read legendary_ironwood as implying consumption, not waste, but both of those concepts must absolutely bookend what you identify as creation: extraction -&gt; consumption -&gt; creation/transformation -&gt; waste. It would in fact be surprising if resource usage was not strongly correlated to GDP.

If the US Government needs to borrow money.  The *Treasury* sells *Treasury* bonds at auction.  The federal reserve does not ever buy treasury bonds from the treasury, but instead busy them on the open market when it wants to perform open market operations.  The treasury bonds that the treasury issues have interest payments assosiated with them, so whoever owns the treasury bonds recieves an interest payment each year.  If the Fed owns a treasury bond, it receives an interest payment each year.  This income is what the fed uses to fund its operations, but then it refunds all payments it received, minus the cost of operating its facilities and paying its people, to the treasury.  Considering that the fed also receives income from foreign securities that it refunds to the treasury, I think that it actually gives the treasury back more money than it got paid every year.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;so the attitude of a citizen should dictate their tax rate?

Uhm, no.  No one is saying that.  Moore is arguing that all high income earners be taxed more, himself included.

&gt;Don't you think, as a sign of good faith and solidarity, Moore should be the first among his rich friends to cease to be a rich friend?

Why would becoming poor be a sign of good faith and solidarity?  The idea that being rich somehow separates Moore from the 99% is false.  Just as false as saying there is a link between Democrats and the 99% movement.

&gt;There is a link where he could donate all the profits he makes to the government, beyond those he needs to make more excellent documentaries.

Ah, so Moore should donate all his money because he thinks top income earners are not taxed at a fair rate? Stop being childish.

&gt;What does a rich person owe to a non-rich person? Specifics would be great.

Again, a misrepresentation of the argument being made.  The idea is that everyone benefits from stable society and therefore everyone owes their fair share.  Those that benefit the most should pay back the most.

High income earners could not have made a dime on the free market without any of the following government supports of the free market:

    Public roads.
    Rural electrification.
    Government subsidized telephone wiring.
    Satellite communications.
    Police protection.
    Military protection.
    A criminal justice system.
    Fire protection.
    Paramedic protection.
    An educated workforce.
    An immunized workforce.
    Protection against plagues by the Centers for Disease Control.
    Public-funded business loans, foreclosure loans and subsidies.
    Protection from business fraud and unfair business practices.
    The protection of intellectual property through patents and copyrights.
    Student loans.

Yes, and you even indicate this is a reference to historical standards when you say ""as in the good old days.""

&gt;No mention of make chastity can be found either, even though it was also reasonably reduce problems, which doesn't do wonders for her views on equality.

Assuming you mean ""male chastity,"" it's completely irrelevant to the discussion at hand.  Insofar as she could have mentioned it, it too was to protect *women*, not men.

&gt;You mean if we disregard that marital rape was perfectly legal?

Married women weren't chaste.

&gt;And if we disregard more conservative views of sex and women's purity as virgins?

Hence part of why rape was considered a serious crime; a raped woman was ""damaged goods.""

&gt;The insight that stranger rape is relatively rare is quite modern, which likely hid many rapes by friends and family.

Maybe, but since we don't know to what extent that may have been true, it's a little pointless to even mention it, isn't it?

&gt;So the whole notion that sexual freedom is what causing women to start falsely accusing men of rape in large numbers is a shaky assumption at best.

It's getting really tiresome telling you that's not what was said.  She said that sexual freedom *allows* women to falsely accuse men.  It gives them greater opportunity to do so.  In theory, in whatever numbers they want, though she never claimed an actual figure.

&gt;The way sexual freedom in general hinges on the behavior of a small minority doesn't speak well for her views of women's freedom either.

I'm going to start making a game out of trying to guess how you're going to misinterpret any given comment next.  First, is it ""large numbers"" or a ""small minority?""  She didn't actually give any number at all.  The point isn't how many might be doing it.  The point is not only that they can, but that they are *encouraged* to do so by people with a vested (monetary) interest in inflating rape numbers.  Just so you don't misinterpret me (even though you will anyway), I am not saying rape activists are all money-grubbing harpies taking advantage of women's fear of rape to make a buck.  I am just saying, as a matter of principle, I do not trust people whose funding and jobs depend on issues that they are meant to be reducing or eliminating, and yes, I do think this will eventually become a problem for the MRM too (though that's a long way away).","1320105925"

âThe human thirst for the transcendent, the numinous â even the ecstatic â is too universal and too important to be entrusted to the cultish and the archaic and the superstitious. In this honest and serious book of self-examination and critical scrutiny, Stephen Batchelor adds the universe of Buddhism to the many fields in which received truth and blind faith are now giving way to ethical and scientific humanism, in which lies our only real hope.â

**Sam Harris** on Buddhism:

""One could surely argue that the Buddhist tradition, taken as a whole, represents the richest source of contemplative wisdom that any civilization has produced. In a world that has long been terrorized by fratricidal Sky-God religions, the ascendance of Buddhism would surely be a welcome development.""  [Source](http://www.samharris.org/site/full_text/killing-the-buddha/).  He then goes on to clarify ""...To talk about 'Buddhism,' therefore, inevitably imparts a false sense of the Buddhaâs teaching to others. So insofar as we maintain a discourse as âBuddhists,â we ensure that the wisdom of the Buddha will do little to inform the development of civilization in the twenty-first century.""

"dotnet","t5_2qh3h","&gt; What's the alternative to this? 

Smarter business objects and *not* insisting on zero code-behind. 

The vast majority of the time your UI elements are going to be data bound directly to the models. (The VM is just there to find those models in the first place.) 

Generally speaking there are four things I see in a view-model

1. Service calls
2. Formatting
3. UI Manipulation
4. Business logic

Generally speaking service calls can be moved into the main VM. When you invoke the ICommand associated with them just pass the object to be saved as the CommandParameter.

Formatting should be done with value converters whenever possible. If that isn't possible, considering having the model expose the formatted value directly. (I do this especially for calculated values like Entity.PointsAvaialble - Entity.PointsSpent).

UI Manipulation doesn't belong in the view-model at all. A major reason for having a view-model is to make your code unit testable, which you lose if you have to build a UI. If you need to mucks with specific controls just use code behind.

Business logic. This one can be tricky. If the logic is generic and not service related, shove it into the entities. It is only applies to the one view-model, that is to say other view-models using the same entity would be broken by the logic, then you are kinda stuck.

"malegrooming","t5_2s4uu","&gt; I should trim and then shave with a regular razor.

Yes, the reason for this is if you are very bushy -- it will take a very long time using a razor only. If you're broke / low on funds -- absolutely you can do it. I've done it -- it just takes a ridiculous amount of time because you shave like 1/4"" and have to rinse all the hairs out.. over and over and over.

&gt; Once I reach testicle territory, things gets fishy

My method, which isn't very researched or thought out mind you, is to do it in four stages really. Left, right, center, back/bottom. If I don't keep up with it -- it seems impossible to get it perfectly shaven. The feel, however, is fucking amazing.

If you have the body groomer, keeping it with a #1 clip, you can shave anywhere safely without real concern. Do it slowly though as the speed of the clippers are not as fast and if you move too fast it will yoink your hair out. That fucking hurts. Please, allow me to say it again, it fucking hurts. Take your time. If you get the body groomer, consider getting after market blades as, at least for me, they seemed *significantly* better than the stock ones it came with.

If you have a full on afro in the balls, start with the #3 clip and work your way down if you have to move slow... Standard hair trimmers also work.. just keep them fuckers away from your nuts. When I was 14 I decided to try.. and in my infinite wisdom... yeah... there was blood and pain.. and misery. oh the misery. This is why I was so reluctant to give Body Groomer a shot.. but it's actually pretty damn good.

&gt; I feel after when I take a shower or put lotion on there.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","Okay, so planing for the best and assuming you become an RN you will have to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) which is the governing body for nurses in the UK. They do normally require one years registered practice before you can apply and you will also have to complete an overseas Nursing program. I don't know much about the training in the US, but I do believe it is accepted by the NMC. You can get more information [here](http://www.nmc-uk.org/Registration/Joining-the-register/Trained-outside-the-EU--EEA/)

As for finding work, well that's harder to answer. The NHS (the biggest employer in Britain) is not recruiting a large amount in hospitals at the moment, and tend to open a lot of positions to internal applicants only. That being said there are jobs available. The advise given to most UK nurses qualifying at the moment is ""go for any job available"", the idea being once your in, you can reapply to the area you want. But that's just how things are at the moment. By the time you come over they may start a massive recruitment drive; it's impossible to tell.

Anyway, best of luck, and let us know how it goes.","1320105938"

If you've liked this girl for 9 months I would probably get away... a girl like this will only cause hell if you get into a relationship with her.

As AMerrickanGirl said, I think she may be using this flirting/touching to keep you around because she's deep down insecure that guys won't like her if there's nothing sexual.  If it hasn't developed after 9 months, I wouldn't expect it to go any further.

And don't be hard on yourself - you've cuddle pantsless with her and everything!  It's not that you didn't make any moves, but more that it just didn't happen.

Still, loans are necessary, but making money off of money is strangely contradictory. The whole system developed out of a certain need, no doubt, but the end result is it being hijacked to benefit the few and not society as a whole. Also I have to question how stable a system really is, if loans are required instead of allowing individuals to gain financial stability without debt. We've shifted our priorities from making stuff to making money and unfortunately just money alone doesn't cut it. It's a race to the exponential. The interest will never go down, it will always be stacked upon the principal. There will never be enough money to cover the debt, therefore, it's in our interest to make things, instead of making money appear out of nowhere.","1320105940"

How do I suggest we get the electorate to behave? Well, for one, we can repeal the Citizens United ruling. We can also place term limits on elected officials. Another step to take would be to force any politicians to accept and agree to have their opponent who lost in the election follow them around wherever they go (GPS tracker included) and ensure they aren't being corrupt.

And honestly that last one, while impossible, would do the trick. It's a dog eat dog world, they'd tattle on each other like kindergartners fighting over play-doh.","1320105959"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","You don't need to convince me. I'm an avid customer on the iTunes / Mac App Store.

Apple has managed to sell the music industry's product better than the music industry itself, bunch of mouth-breathing knuckle-draggers. People pay for music like never before, but that's not what we learn from the movie.

What the video doesn't say is that Apple takes care of the hosting, handles the payments, offers the product on -every- system running the software, which is every Mac sold, makes it super easy and convenient to purchase the product without having to leave your seat.

As a piece of software iTunes is extremely sophisticated

As a piece of engineering, iTunes is cutting edge

As a retail outlet, the experience is second to none (no commercials, no nagging, no fucking you over with extra fees, no ambiguity).

The features you don't want, you don't have to use. iTunes, and this is from the perspective of having used all versions between iTunes 1 and 10 inclusive, is the piece of software that so far has let me down exactly 0 times. It's an amazing piece of software.

What the movie also doesn't say is that if you don't want to use iTunes, you don't have to. Apple isn't forcing you. In truth, I've never had the urge to try something else, because iTunes does everything I need in a music player, and more. But if I buy a different piece of software I could use that, no problem.","1320105966"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","DoubleTap57, It seems to me that you are really in a great position to bargain. You've made up your mind and it doesn't really matter what others have signed on for. Salary is extremely independent and as an employer I'd always give you the lowest examples I have. That is - my success stories of what I got people for! Also education doesn't count for crap unless you're a doctor. 1-2 years full time experience = a masters degree in my mind. I just want you to have some sort of degree so I know you can sit down and do your job as told. Like you did when studying.

With the career ""path"" you outline now I'd say go for your initial goal of 38-40K. But seriously, I can write you a novel on how to make this happen but I'll try keeping it short. This is a technique that I use in business in general and it is almost flawless.

You call or show up in person and the first question you ask is ""Will you hire me?"" He may think this is a weird question or he may answer yes. If he answers no, then the game is up and you can leave. If he thinks it's a weird question you say ""What I mean is, I have the skills you are looking for and you've made me an offer. It seems to me that the only thing we lack to agree on is the price of my time."" If he says yes, you simply say ""Ok, then it seems to me that we only lack to agree on the price of my time.""

Next you ask ""What can I give you that will make you consider paying my asking price?"". This question is extremely ambiguous and can be answered in many ways. In any which way he answers, the key is to isolate his points and cater to them. The only answer that can kill the conversation at this point is ""I want nothing else, you have my offer"".

When you've isolated his points you should try coming to a conclusion on each point and evaluate whether this has value to him and what it costs you. This can i.e. be certain extra responsibilities or willingness to be flexible with weekend hours.

Once there is nothing left you then say, ""I have given you all you've asked for, can we make a deal?"" He should say ""Yes"". And then you say, ""I wanted a salary in the lower 40s are you willing to pay me that?"" he should be ready to increase above the 35K as he has now given you extra responsibilities etc. He'll probably counter and you'll end up around 38K or maybe even 40K depending on you negotiation skills.

I can promise you that he will be taken aback by the extremely straight forward tone you employ and he will want you more. It's like being on a date with the really hot chick. If you show confidence and don't sucker up and lick her feet she wants you more which in turn increases your chance of getting the job at the pay you want. Also he seems like *the* boss so an answer like ""I'm bound by corporate to not go higher"" is bullshit.

Now the great way about this tactic is that you know, that by the end of this conversation, be it over the phone or in person, you will either have a new job or not.

But you need to do it now and not later. Don't give them the chance to make up their mind saying no.

* Why is Riot's hand so far in the cookie jar? Do they have to sanction all the tournaments? Does no one else want to host competitive LoL tournaments? To me this feels like it hurts the scene's growth, kind of like the mother who won't let go of the child to allow it to grow independently 
* This was obviously a mistake, a huge mistake. Screw spirit of competition, fix the problems. 
* Why is this not a documented change by someone @ WCG? 
* How can WCG and Riot (since riot has a boner for monitoring everything about their competitive play) let this slip? Especially the person playing qualifiers for two countries. That makes absolutely no sense.

This isn't good business. Normally most people would say, ""eh it's a game, it happens,"" but it's a little different when E-sports has grown to a point where someone could potentially make a living off of playing the game. ","1320105974"

I hope that brings some comfort. I don't place too much importance on the opinions of such folk in my day to day life, and I try not to here.

Culture is created by both the vocal and the silent. Exercise a voice by down voting, or by speaking up at those times you have the energy or inclination.

Also, reddit is now too big to worry about culture-policing on the whole. The old Reddit survives in many places. 2xc is one, truereddit is another, and there are many more. Seek out those places, frontpage them, remove the rest, and enjoy the sanity. Then work to keep those spaces functional.

- More private sector jobs = completely new tax revenues

- More public sector jobs = Taxes pay these jobs anyways..... so you are getting a portion of the stimulus back in taxes.

- More semi-private sector jobs = These are federal contractors.  Feds give $ to a private corporation for a service or good.  Only a % goes towards the good or service, the rest is profit.  Does a *good* corporation use it to hire more workers or does it give a bonus to management? Towards lobby?  These jobs are a plague.  Very inefficient.... if its mostly to a bonus.  As everyone knows, lately - the % goes to bonuses.

Knee-jerk reaction I have had - if you create a business that hires workers - less/no tax.  If you just invest in 401K, mutual funds, stocks, etc.... its tax deferred still but going forward, taxed heavily.

&gt;72 percent of Limbaughâs elderly listeners are men and thus are statistically likely to âstroke outâ sometime in Pres. Obamaâs second term, assuming he wins one.

However, I think the primary reason the average age of viewers for the MSM is that the younger generation is more likely to watch or get their news online. I for one love The Rachel Maddow Show - but I watch on the MSNBC website cause I don't have cable TV. In fact I haven't had any cable or satellite tv for 4 years. I watch and get all my favorite tv shows, movies and news online. I bet this would be a common theme among young people - personally I don't think it bodes well for the media as their viewers on cable die out.

Maybe she's abusive anyway, who knows, and that's a tough situation to be rational in (I can relate), but ultimately you need to understand your own faults. You're both victims - she's lashing out because she has a son who doesn't appear to love/respect her and isn't what she wants him to be (someone she can be proud of, be successful, be safe [this is the religious part]). It seems that the religion thing is only one aspect of your family problems.

Living at home, smoking weed, and being a dick to your Mom, regardless of her religious affiliation, isn't cool. If you want to be elitist for being atheist, you don't need to be mean to someone who is lashing out because they care about you (we're sometimes meanest to the ones we love) and doesn't know how to fix the problem.

So, be a fucking adult and look in the damned mirror, apologize, and reset. You need to hold yourself to a high standard in everything you do, not just in your belief system to make you feel smarter than everyone else, if you want to be a good human being (See: Secular Humanism).

And don't be a damned mooch - if she's putting you up and you don't need it, then the least you can do is not smoke weed in her damned house and be a bit appreciative. You want to watch Bill Maher and smoke, go right on ahead and pay the rent dude.","1320105996"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The DOE enforces what they are directed to by congress. That is part of their job. If not them, another entity would be made to do it.

So then get rid of DOE and no one would enforce the crazy standards that congress makes in education.

&gt; Because then you have regions of the country with incredibly poorly educated or misinformed masses that can't contribute to society, can't interact well with others outside of their state, and can't add anything to the nation.

That will happen no matter what kind of legislation passes. The only difference is that the schools will lose accreditation, and those that actually try to learn pay the price.

&gt; That's nice and all, but if every state is teaching entirely different curriculum then no education is going to be worth a damn from one state to the next. It's already getting to be a problem, especially with what Texas is doing. They are effectively ruining their children's understanding of the world around them by the changes they are putting through, removing things from history.

&gt;On top of this are the states that have an ongoing ""war on science"". Creationism is not science.

That would be nice, but Congress would never pass a bill removing creationism from schools. Every state in the south will be in an uproar. You can't force someone to get an education, and limiting those that actually want it will only hurt education overall. That's one of the main points that the Freedom Writers made.

&gt; I'm not sure why you think this will make schools competitive. Please explain?

I'm sorry, ""competitive"" was just the first word I could think of. I'll try to expand:

The purpose of having different jurisdictions (states) for laws wasn't only to allow local issues to be addressed quicker, but for experiment grounds for long-term solutions. For example, lets say my state (NH) somehow creates a law that legalizes marijuana. Suddenly, crime rates drop %25 (I don't really know or care why). Other states tend to notice these things and adapt the laws themselves.

Now lets say Texas creates a law that prohibits teaching evolution and requires 4 consecutive years of religious studies. Suddenly graduation rates drop down by %10 and students going to college drop down by %15. At that point, Texas will (maybe/possibly/hopefully) redact the law and other states will know ""Hmm, that wasn't a good idea"".

Think of it as natural selection, except by laws. The anti-confederalists gave the power to experiment with the laws to the states. Education was specifically meant to be a state power due to it being ever-changing. Federally mandated education has not ever worked.

&gt; There is already an increasing divide of education, and the DOE is needed more than ever.

Just want to emphasize; you can not force someone to get an education they don't want.

I wouldn't vote for Ron Paul either (he may not be insane, but he is still crazy), and I generally just see a ""Anyone but Obama"" attitude from his supporters, but I don't think that federal education is at all a good thing.","1320106004"

So you decide to flip a bunch of the eggs so that they make a picture of your favorite author. Good job! It's black and white, but you're a good artist and there are a lot of eggs so the picture works well.

Electronic ink is a layered material that uses very small spheres that are black on one side and light on the other to make a picture. On either side of the layer of colored balls, tiny wires are configured so that when electricity flows through them, they turn either the dark or light side of the balls towards the front of the screen. By selecting which areas of the screen attract the dark side of the balls, you can make a picture. The cool thing about e-ink is that once you turn the balls, they pretty much stay there, so really only takes energy to change the image but not to keep it there, so the batteries last a really long time (unlike LCD screens which always need power). Also, because you're seeing an image of actual dark and light spots, it looks more like ink on a piece of paper.","1320106007"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; as far as the catholic church is concerned i was told at a visit to one of their churches years ago that they believe the heavens are sealed, and that god does not communicate with the earth anymore. the pope is elected to be the one who basically gets to decide what god meant in the scriptures because they don't have a prophet to ask him or recieve new revelation.

Actually it is the position of the catholic church that everything the pope says is *infallible* (catholics see footnote), ensured by god to be correct, even if the pope is not actually speaking from direct divine comment. I'd call that a distinction without a difference.

Regardless, there is a word most of us use for people who say they hear the voice of god: *schizophrenics*.

&gt; regardless, i learned how to be truly happy by following the book of mormons teachings.

Good for you that you're happy. Now, can you do anything about the fact that the church has worked hard to ensure I can't get married? And maybe woo back the guy I wanted to marry who gave up on me because the church has been too successful at stopping me for too long? I mean, since they've basically ruined my life, it'd be nice if they tried to make amends.

-----
Footnote: Yes, I know that the pope used to have to explicitly declare that he was speaking infallibly. However, the vatican changed the rules during JP2 and now ostensibly everything the pope says is infallible, and since the pope says so you're not allowed to question it. ","1320106012"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;*I agree that people are more likely to hold onto a currency that is likely to increase in value. Why is that, specifically, a bad thing?*

It's good if it happens in moderation. It's bad if it's affecting the economy badly. You see if money is kept safe to the point where even keeping cash under the bed is a worthwhile investment (since money just gains value by sitting there), then it has been removed from the economy. People have a choice of what to do with their money - if their money is increasing in value then they are more likely to save it than to use it buy goods and services.

In short, saving a moderate amount of money is fine. Saving huge amounts, however, on an economy wide scale, will reduce the amount of goods and services produced.

If you're like me and you aim for a 0% CPI (or GDP deflator) then, yes, the deflation will be hardly noticed by the economy at large (at least once they get used to it, of course).","1320106014"

It sounds like you may benefit from reanalyzing your quit. Why did you quit in the first place and what did you hope to gain? What kind of techniques do you think would help get you through the cravings? What have you tried that didn't work and why do you think that is? What have you tried that did work?

Quitting is different for everyone so you'll have to find what works for you. It's a lot of work, I know, but you can't be miserable the rest of your life and you don't have to be! 

5 days is a long time to be without cigarettes and you've probably learned a lot from this experience. You absolutely can do this! Remember to always reach out for support, like you have here- sometimes just talking about it or finding other people in the same situation can make all the difference. 

And lastly, no, unfortunately there is no such thing as just one cigarette. You started smoking just one cigarette and that was many, many cigarettes ago.

The truth is that I believe some version of a 2 state solution would work. The Israeli Palestinian conflict, to me, recalls what happened when India gained independence from Britain. The problem was that once they got independence, there was a Hindi face on a very diverse country. Enter Pakistan. 

The problem is that when fighting a colonial power, we tend to give a face to the land that is not accurate. So the Jewish Israeli's that got independence, don't truly represent everyone in Palestine.

Now, things have progressed to the point where Israel is an established country, but they must recognize the rights of the people who were oppressed with them and do not fit into the mold of their new country.

The problem is that extremists on both sides believe that everything should be theirs.","1320106021"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Extremely large breasts are a source of considerable attention. Some women try to hide or mask their breasts with special clothing, including minimizing brassieres. Females may be subject to unwanted attention and psychological problems. Depression is common among sufferers.
In the case of a 12-year-old Japanese girl reported in 1993, her ""massively enlarged"" breasts caused her ""intense psychological problems, incapacitating her in school activities and social relations.""

Actress Soleil Moon Frye, who starred as a child in the sitcom Punky Brewster, reported in an interview with People magazine that boys taunted her, calling her ""Hey, Punky Boobster!"" It affected her professional and social life negatively. ""People started to think of me as a bimbo,"" she said in the interview. ""I couldn't sit up straight without people looking at me like I was a prostitute,"" Frye said.

Fifteen-year-old Lauren Tyner commented, ""I canât even count how many rude comments or times of unwanted attention Iâve gotten because of my breasts,"" she said. ""Youâre self-conscious about everything you do. I came home crying a couple of times. And it was just getting ridiculous to shop.""

Finding large bra sizes and styles that fit is challenging. Also, larger bras are more costly, and can be challenging to find, not to mention they can be unflattering to the wearer. Ill-fitting bras with narrow straps can cause chronic irritation, redness, and indentations in the shoulders. Skin rashes under the breasts are common, particularly during warm weather. Heavy breasts may cause headaches, neck pain, upper and lower back pain, and numbness or tingling in the fingers.","1320106033"

But we don't need more speculators to be prosperous, we need to produce more goods &amp; services from the same inputs. 

Which is another way of saying: we need technological progress or better resource usage. 

On the whole Speculation is bad because it encourages inefficent resource alloocation. 

It encourages people to buy things only in the hope they will rise in value (the bigger fool theory) rather than invest in production of things they expect other people will want to buy and consume.

&gt;Deflation is always bad.

It is sometimes bad, but not by any means ""always"".

Despite the fact that part or all of every other consumer device is manufactured in Asia, most of them by the same contractors Apple uses, how many other technology companies do you know of that take these steps?

Furthermore, Apple responded to reports of Foxconn employees committing suicide by investigating the working conditions in person, and then getting Foxconn to improve working conditions for its workers, including raising pay by 30%.

""Send the Yellow Jackets to a watery grave.""

I feel that speaks for itself. I can give Bama a hard time every now and then if I so choose.

If you did your research (and I don't mean that rudely, just saying), you'd know Georgia drew first blood (literally), and they deserve every shout of THWG. Look it up; it really is a good rivalry story. Likewise, I call myself ""a hell of an engineer"" every Saturday. If that doesn't count as pride, I don't know what does.

As for Clemson, they're also a long time rival. Why can't we trash-talk our rivals?

At the end of the day, though, yeah... I've been a bit of a jerk. Probably uncalled for at times. As my mother is an Alabama alumna, I've been to Bryant-Denny many, many times. I've enjoyed the games, as well, but I still find some things strange about the Bama fan culture. I won't list them because that's unnecessary, but when I've joked about this very topic (Bear), she's chuckled and said ""he'll never die!"" It's not that big of a deal.

TL;DR

I don't hate Alabama so much as I saw an Auburn fan and thought I'd yuck it up with a Bama joke or two. Relax.","1320106083"

 Many states already have optional midterms and finals. You just have to think about the difference between learning for the class (presumably, actually learning content as per the class description) and learning for the standardized test (knowing facts the state deems ""important""). So much pressure is put on the teachers to account for their teaching via how well the students do on the standardized test.  As someone who often felt overwhelmed by the work and desire for good grades in my AP and Honors classes, not having to take a midterm for them was a load off my back.

As a pre-service teacher with an eye for bullshit, I could go on all day about the problems with standardized tests. But, since the state would rather not get rid of those, this action is just a symbol for what is so wrong with the education system in the U.S.","1320106084"

&gt;You are OS-SIS--Set in Stone. You're 21st Century technology married to a 20th Century business model. But we've moved on. We don't just want wireless. We want stringless. As a matter of fact, we want it DIY. We're responsible adults. We drive cars. We vote. We can definitely join together to make a new kind of wireless network. One for us. One, in fact, that is us. In other words, we have our own Operating System. It's called Freedom, and it works.

I was going to make the same note as you with the exception that being drunk and being inebriated are different.

Also as you noted wine was cut with water and neat wine was seldom imbibed in other cultures around the time of Jesus though I've not seen anything specifically about Jewish culture and drinking at that time.

The Romans, known for their drunken debauchery, apparently found it scandalous that people would drink neat wine. Not because they'd get drunk but because they'd get *too* drunk, the idea was to spin it out - there was a certain [weaker] mix for feasts and a [stronger] mix for orgies, etc..","1320106103"

*Edit/ After re-reading your original post, I think you got busted. Where the video starts out at is where I made the U-Turn, which is where your link from Google Maps shows on that corner street. I only recorded what I did because of the construction talk that you were talking about. Getting off I-35W, it gets up to 60, but then drops to 50mph because of the school zone, which is where you probably got busted at (in the *school* zone area)

So, I traveled both ways and I couldn't see a 50mph sigh. There were, 65, 55 and 30mph signs, but that's all. So either you confused typing in your letter here to us 50, instead of 55, OR the 50mph ""signs"" that this police guy said were whited out. Therefore, inadequate speed posting, is what I would probably fight this with.

 I'm currently uploading the videos to YouTube. I didn't snap any pictures because I was feeling pretty sick today. Also, please forgive how bumpy it is. My truck is a work truck and isn't that smooth, plus I was holding my phone with one had while driving. You can clearly see all road signs if you pause the video. Even the ones that seemed to be speed signs that were blank/covered. 

If you actually need pictures, let me know and I'll go back tomorrow after work and get them :D. If not, then I hope the videos suffice. Also sorry about the music, I thought I had the mic on mute, but I couldn't tell. Also pay no attention to the end of the first video... :/

Hope I helped! No payment is required. I find that to be pointless when so much wrong is in this world, so keep your $30 and do something fun with it. However, if you are one of those nutty people that demand to pay everyone for some mundane task, then next time you are up in Ft.Worth, you can buy me a beer :)

"SAHP","t5_2rsj9","I have a picky 5 year old that doesn't like veggies, and a 15 month old that eats everything I give him. For the 5 year old, he is told that this is what's for dinner, I don't run a restaurant, eat it or go hungry. We are vegan and he doesn't like many veggies, which makes it a challenge, so here's what we've done:

In the morning I make smoothies with pineapple juice, strawberries, blueberries, one banana, and a handful of either spinach or kale. He has no clue its in there and drinks it up! 

I make a vegan mac and 'trees' that has no cheese in it.  It's got potatoes, carrots and onions and it's another sneaky way to get him his veggies. (you can find the recipe by googling mac and cheese recipe from veg news magazine...it's sooo good)

I also blend up spinach in pasta sauce for spaghetti and pizzas. 

The three things you are feeding her don't really have any nutritional value, so I'd mix them up a bit by adding things to them. Try adding mushrooms or spinach to her quesadillas by cutting them up so small she won't even notice them and see what happens. 

Please don't take this the wrong way, but she's a picky eater because you make her the same things over and over. If she's hungry enough, she'll eat! I would avoid making separate meals for her. She will eat what you guys eat eventually. 

I have a 17 year old also, and when he was a baby i gave him all the veggie baby foods out there, and once he tried the banana baby food, he didn't want to eat the veggie foods anymore. I panicked and thought he'd starve, so i fed him bananas for like a week straight (still trying to feed him veggie foods first though). I think it was my mom that told me to just hold out and not offer him the bananas anymore and sure enough, he went back to eating the veggie foods like before. You just need to be strong and not give in. Just add veggies to the rotation and see what happens.

As such, it came off a bit harsher than it should have been, and it made some erroneous assumptions. This note is the only way I'm changing it, so that the replies can still make sense]*

&gt; You may not hate, however, it appears, you're not making an effort to understand or empathize.

I frankly find that pretty offensive. I'm not going to defend how much I understand and empathize with the LGBT community, nor am I going to defend how much ""effort"" I've put into it. But I will say that the callous assumption that I just plain don't care is highly offensive to me.

&gt; Members of the LGBT community commonly feel that this is how they were born, and we know that its not something changeable.

I say this in love, and but since we're talking scientific evidence, I have to point this out. You are arguing a scientific fact from your feelings. Feelings are not evidence in science.

&gt; You make the comparison of homosexuality to gluttony, likening the 2 as sins just as grievous as the other. But a glutton can stop being a glutton, a homosexual cannot stop being a homosexual.

This is not the place to argue this. I will say two things, and then we have to stop debating (because this isn't the place for it): (1) There's a lot that goes into gluttony, including mental disorders, which means that it's not always possible for a glutton to stop struggling with the compulsion to overeat. (2) I do believe a homosexual can stop being homosexual, though they may or may not lose the orientation (once again, the difference is identity). For one, I know people who *have* stopped (though some [but not all] still struggle with the orientation).

&gt; You will argue that its not a sin to be a homosexual that its a sin to commit the act.

No. I believe being a homosexual is wrong, because it refuses to acknowledge that the homosexual act is a sin. I do not necessarily believe that the orientation is a sin, so long as it is resisted.

&gt; The thing is, imagine the tables were reversed, and imagine that you believed, in your heart of hearts, that you could never marry or be intimate with another person for fear of eternal damnation. How would that make you feel?

The same way I feel every time that happens to me - feels bad, man. Believe it or not, but I have actually been in love and I've had strong sexual feelings (not that sexual feelings and love are the same) for women. And I've had to say no. It sucks. I'm aware of this.

What's more, my feelings don't change my *convictions* which are based on what I believe to be the Word of God. That Word says that some things should not be done.

&gt; Then imagine that you do anyway, you reject what the community around you says.

I don't do that.

&gt; Being gay isn't like premarital sex. Premarital sex you can keep a secret. Being a glutton you can stop.

Again, I don't buy it. For one, I know a *lot* of people who have kept premarital sex a secret. I also know a lot of people who have kept their sexual orientation a secret. I've covered gluttony.

&gt; Living as a gay person, that sin is your scarlet letter, you cannot hide it, you cannot run from it.

Very dramatic. Which comes from some very deep feelings of hurt. I understand that. And I know it sucks to really, really, *really* want something but to know that it's wrong. I'm not a stranger to this.

&gt; You may judge those who sin, but you judge homosexuals as sinners forever.

I disagree.

I feel like this is going to get non-civil if this continues. Your core identity is homosexual, so anything I say, no matter how loving, is going to feel like an attack on who you are. I suggest we both stop right now.

And again, this isn't the place to debate religion. I've said my piece on this subject. If we continue, I think this will escalate. So I'm just going to stop responding to this particular thread of discussion. I might still post in other parts of it, but I'm not walking down a path of hate with you.","1320106118"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;As for the stimulus package, part of the promise made by all the politicians who supported it was a longer term recovery in employment.

Which, according to them, will be achieved the moment unemployment falls below pre-crisis levels. This is a political promise, worth jack shit and intended to sell the bill, which was essential, to avoid having a meltdown on their hands, without actually saying so. They win either way, so long as a collapse has been averted.

&gt;However, I don't see how spending is going to kickstart you out of debt.

That's why I made a point of calling you out to be clueless. The Recovery act has NOTHING to do with debt, yet you brought it up anyway. The Obama administration wasn't motivated by deficits and loans, it was motivated by collapsing markets and unemployment. 

And no, it's not that you don't see how stimulus can help, you just don't want to see how spending can get you out of debt. And to back-up your claim, you brought up an outright degenerate example that had absolutely nothing to do with my original argument - outside of being called a stimulus package.

And the U.S. has no interest what-so-ever of getting out of debt. Debt is turnover, almost half the U.S. economy is debt. America's success IS its exceptional ability to utilize debt to it's fullest. And so long as the government and companies can pay interest, which the U.S. and it's firms can easily, there is no benefit in getting out of debt.

Is the game better or worse for them? Impossible to say. Planeswalker cards are, as a rule, much more powerful than most other cards. When a planeswalker is on the battlefield, interactions around that card tend to define the line of gameplay. I like that they add complexity to the game when most other design changes have been to reduce complexity. At the same time, I'm not really a fan of the manner in which they do so.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","Right, but will his value go up by much more than $5 next year? I'm asking because I've never done an auction.

What I do know is that in a 12-Team snake draft, I took notice when he fell to me in Round 9. That means he was going in Round 7-8ish in most drafts. I wouldn't draft him before Round 6 next year unless I see a major change.

His value just won't change that much because he was all-hype coming into his rookie year. So while he may be a sleeper next year, I don't think he is a great keeper unless you got him for much less most people did.

If he's going for $18 next year and you keep him for $15, that's not really a great deal is it. There should be much, much better values to be had right? Or am I just way off base on how the auction format works?

**tl;dr** - $5 is a big portion of Daniel Thomas' draft value next season, enough to offset the fact that he was a little bit cheaper before this season than he will be next fall.","1320106130"

Some actors/characters don't seem to be as good or fitting as they should be. The CDC episode was a bit too *Resident Evil* for the series.

It has its faults, but I find it enjoyable enough, and judging by the end of episode 3, I think it will get better whenever they find Sophia (which better be very soon). 

I wasn't too happy with Shane sticking around in season one, but I'm actually loving what they're doing with him. I still hope the end result  is similar to the comics (looks like it will be), but I think the additional character development of Shane is great.

The idea that everyone who can't get 100% of their DV each day is lazy is an utter farce and you should literally be ashamed of believing that. I work at a Title 1 school and the number of kids who only eat the two meals a day the school provides is startling. We won't even start on the issues of nutrition education, access to health care providers who can help formulate a healthy diet, and the fact that there is probably 25x the advertising for fast food shit as there is for even grocery stores, let alone healthy food. And then, there's the homeless, who even if they knew how to eat properly, don't have anywhere to make food, and the minimum wage earners, who working double overtime still don't make a living wage and probably don't have time to actually fix food. The number of things stacked against poor people in this country is ludicrous, and this whole ""lazy"" idea literally makes me cringe.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The CRC32 takes up a significant amount of time when decoding gzip files (sample profile of gzip -dc &gt;/dev/null of a 700MB tarball):

    46.44%     gzip  gzip               [.] inflate_codes
    33.80%     gzip  gzip               [.] updcrc
    12.06%     gzip  gzip               [.] inflate_stored
     2.04%     gzip  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] copy_user_generic_string
     2.02%     gzip  gzip               [.] huft_build
     1.31%     gzip  libc-2.14.1.so     [.] 0x118770        
     0.34%     gzip  gzip               [.] inflate_dynamic

This was [known](http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html#faq39) to [Mark Adler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adler) who wrote the decompression code. That is why the zlib stream uses [adler-32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler-32) instead of [gzip stream](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-gzip.html#member-format)'s crc32. HTTP allows to use zlib stream instead of gzip stream for transparent compression of transmitted html, but because of a misinterpretation of the [RFC](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.5), Microsoft software used the [raw deflate format](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html) instead of the [zlib stream](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-zlib.html#format) (=deflate+checksum), so for inter-operability purposes, everyone now uses the gzip transfer encoding. Your Chrome and Firefox pay this performance premium on every page load to this day.

The Linux Kernel contains a crc32 routine that is significantly faster (on my core2) than the one used by gzip/zlib.

The faster code uses a table of 1024 uint32_t's instead of the common routine that uses only 256 uint32_t's.

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git;a=blob;f=lib/crc32.c;hb=HEAD

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gzip.git/tree/util.c

The Linux code is GPLv2, which is why you can't just copy it into gzip/zlib. But if someone can find the source of the optimization or get permission from the copyright holder, it should be done.

**Note**: the crc32 used in gzip is the old one used in ethernet, not the crc32**c** which has [hardware support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#cite_ref-5) on [newer Intel chips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_\(microarchitecture\)) (released 2nd half of 2009). They are incompatible. Newly designed archive formats should use the newer checksum because it provides better protection and should be faster on new hardware that has hardware support. Unfortunately, xz [uses](http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-file-format-1.0.4.txt) the same [old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) crc32 (0xEDB88320).","1320106142"

I think it's relevant here. It's a long read, but worthwhile I think.

A summary from the blogger who posted the sermon:

&gt;Christmas is suited for sharing the gospel with family and friends.

&gt;Aim to share the story of Godâs grace in your life.

&gt;By sharing we edify believers.

&gt;By sharing we reach lost friends and family.

&gt;Be alert for one-on-one opportunities to share your story.

&gt;Donât expect this sharing to be easy.

&gt;Overcome this fear by sharing to honor your Savior.

&gt;Share your story with gratitude to God.

&gt;Share your story with humility.

&gt;Share your story truthfullyâdonât embellish it.

&gt;Tell your story seriouslyâdonât share it flippantly.

&gt;Donât neglect your personal devotions during Christmas.

&gt;Rest upon the Holy Spiritâs help to share.

&gt;Remember that this story you share over the holidays is the story that will be on your lips eternally.","1320106162"

The reason that silver hair is associated with the Targaryens to the Westerosi is that it's only common in pureblood Targaryens. (Essos seems to have more folks of Valyrian descent.)

"roguelikes","t5_2rhpi","Auto-explore is huge. Zangband had auto-run and macros, but auto-explore makes it so much easier. Now it's hard to try any of the RL that don't have this.

DCSS is mostly very balanced, even thought at the later stages of the game balancing is hard since characters are so beefed up. In Zangband there was game-breaking combinations, like summon spells for breeding and summoning monsters.

Zangband had powerful items, but also powerful unique monsters. Killing Morgoroth and Sauron gave the game a finale. In DCSS you can mostly plow through the unique monsters, and almost all unique items you dump at Lair 1 and regret wasting a good scroll. Phial of Galadriel gave a name to the biggest website about Roguelikes, DCSS items don't come close to this.

The copyrights don't matter. DOTA copied every known fantasy genre, that's part of what made it so popular around the world. If you don't the brain of J.R.R Tolkien and decades to develop a mythology, you have to borrow from somewhere. Unfortunately the current dev is justifying this change with quote: '*For some, âdwarfâ evokes the image of axe, shield, beard, ale. I tend to think of âgarden dwarfâ and âsnow whiteâ*'. Sigh.

Some really good features have also been chopped from DCSS, like light sources. Having a limited area of light added a fog-of-war effect to the game and created suspension. When your last torch ran out, it was time to panic. Some of the new variants already have things that DCSS is missing, like stunning ascii-graphics in Brogue, and tactical game mechanics like in DoomRL.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","In preschool we had a scheduled nap-time around 2pm or so. We were all given these little itchy blankets and lay down in the main play room. The caregivers/teachers would then walk around draw all the curtains, so it was quite dark.

Supervision during nap-time was not constant, so there was opportunity to talk to a non-sleepy neighbor between patrols of the guard.

On one occasion, a girl that I proposed the infamous ""I'll show you mine, if you show me yours."" This seemed a great bargain, and I began the operation of removing my pants beneath the covers with my clumsy four-year-old fingers.

It was at this point, that I noticed the oldest and crustiest teacher come into the room.  I didn't really know what I was getting into, but was sure it was illicit; I immediately froze and feigned sleep.
Perhaps the teacher heard my thumping heart, because as she passed me she pulled off my blanket to reveal my hands covering my groin and my pants at my ankles. I fear she may have fallen under a misapprehension when she declared, ""We don't do that sort of thing here.""

**TL;DR almost managed a tryst in preschool, only to be foiled by a teacher who thought I was masturbating.**

"education","t5_2qhlm","&gt;How do you know if a lesson plan is ""good?""

If the students learn.

&gt;How do you know if a lesson plan is ~~""good?""~~""great?""  

Student engagement and learning.  Also differentiating since every student is at different levels and you ~~must~~ should cater to every child based on levels.  I use ALOT of theory to achieve e this from bloom's to MI to ZPD.  That first education class is not worthless, you just need to think through how to implement the theory.

&gt;How do you/would you present a lesson plan?

You don't present a lesson plan, you present a lesson.  Think about the difference.  You have seen lesson plans in action through your whole schooling experience.

&gt;In what circumstances would you deviate from a lesson plan and start ""winging it?""

When it comes down to it, I'm always winging it, I just have a rough outline of how/what I'm winging. I hope that makes sense--basically I don't write down how exactly I'm explaining things but what I will explain.  ""I will review the notes"" instead of a step-by-step play of how I explain each exact part.

&gt;What qualities make an effective lesson plan?

I find ""assessment"" is the most critical part.

&gt;Why are lesson plans important? 

In my eyes, they are are not because I already know my idea before I write it down.  It's important to the administration so they know what my idea is.  Just like an English teacher cannot grade your ideas unless you write that essay.  It's a necessary evil.  *it becomes tedious when I have 4 preps a day and am required to have a lesson plan for each*

&gt;Should school administrators ever get involved with lesson planning? Why/why not?

If there is a teacher who is failing, then it's important for involvement.  If I am not failing, it's a waste of time for them to intervene.

&gt; Is there a specific lesson plan format that you follow, and if so, describe it.

It's provided by the entity that requires the lesson plan.  I have one for my school I teach at.  The basics (the things I find extremely important:  1) Objective 2) instruction outline 3)assessment 4) differentiating.  ","1320106205"

- the goal of defense is to defend.  not turn a profit.
- the goal of health care is to heal.  not turn a profit.
- the goal of education is to educate.  not turn a profit.
- the goal of incarceration is to reform and punish.  not turn a profit.

when the goal becomes corrupted into turning a profit, that's when all the veniality of man gets unleashed so that profit is made at the expense of the purported goal.

as for:

&gt;However, the ""social shaming"" mechanism you propose (I won't even start on the free speech infringement problems of gov't policy) is exactly how democratic discussion forums work.

a point to observe is that reddit is not the world.  or even america.  there's a degree of filtering that already occurs just to be present here.

but your notion assumes that the majority will be right - or end up being right if all ideas are just aired.

this is NOT true.

sometimes you get a confederacy of dunces.  sometimes you get slavery.  sometimes you get the segregated south.  sometimes you get nazi germany.

again - in my estimation, sometimes, pure democracy without any other checks and balances - because of the frailty of man - is INTRINSICALLY THE PROBLEM.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","Before you ever get to pill memory you've already bought into (to be fair, there are disagreements about some of these among homeopaths):

* similia similibus curantur (like cures like), the notion that disease can be cured by exposure to a substance which causes the same symptoms.  Hahnemann got the idea while working with a cure for malaria which causes side effects similar to malaria symptoms.  It also stops the malaria parasites from reproducing.  This aspect of homeopathy is a testable sciencey hypothesis.  It's been tested and found to be unsupported by the evidence.  In cases where it holds the fact that it causes the symptoms of the disease is unrelated to the mechanism by which the disease is cured.
* potentization, the idea that the effectiveness of the cure can be increased by diluting it in water or alcohol by factors up to 10^60 (a 1 followed by 60 zeros), so long as you strike the container against an surface 10 times with each dilution.  Ten shall be the number thou shalt strike, and the number of the striking shall be ten. Eleven shalt thou not strike, neither strike thee nine, excepting that thou then proceed to ten. Twelve is right out.  This is magical thinking.
* since there is unlikely to be even a single molecule of the active ingredient (the one that causes the symptoms) in a solution that has been diluted beyond 10^24 or so, you need for the solution to somehow retain some characteristic of the active ingredient which is no longer present.  This is at odds with what is known about liquids.  That's a polite way to say it ain't true.

Once you've bought into a discredited hypothesis, a heavy dose of magical thinking, and ideas contrary to well established scientific knowledge about the physics and chemistry of water, not to mention biology, how hard is it to add one more bit of nonsense?

I think the guy is smart for recognizing that this girl has a tendency toward drama. He probably saved himself a lot of bullshit by breaking this off before he got any more emotionally invested in the relationship.

Personally I would be pissed off if my bf went out of his way to make a date with me only to cancel at the last minute so he can 'be alone with some other guy.'  Shit like that requires an explanation and some apologies.  I don't think it has anything to do with being insecure.  

It's primarily about a lack of respect for your partner. It's fine to have friends, but when you are going out of your way to throw those relationships in your partner's face just to get a rise out of them...I think it shows a lack of character.

Honestly:  I really don't care what your video looks like; I only care about the music.   Most of the time when I click on music videos I switch to another tab and read.  I guess some people think the video matters.  I really don't understand why people care.  In my not-so-humble opinion, the music should speak for itself.

Before I get to the music, let me state that I don't like a lot of music.  Most of it is absolute crap.  I can't believe people actually like it!   I have maybe 1,500 songs that I actually like and listen to regularly.  Maybe it's a brain tumor :-P

That said, I liked your music.  Your growl is awesome!  I would enjoy it even more if you toned it down just a bit so I can actually understand what you're saying.  You have a decent voice -- save the unintelligible stuff for simple words.

The guitar solo needs work.. I like that change of pace in the middle of the song but something is missing...

I look forward to hearing more from your band.  I even tried listening to the other stuff on your page -- but the live stuff was so horribly distorted that I didn't bother.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","1. It seems to me that posing your question in a way that makes my beliefs seem to be a farce is not a reasonable way to conduct a discussion. I assume you have no interest in an answer.

2. Your understanding of relationships between mythological Greek figures is way off.

3. The way you have posed your question makes it difficult to answer. I don't think you're even asking about a sacrifice anymore. I assume you don't want a discussion of Greek mythology but are mainly asking what makes my religion ""better"" than that of ancient Greeks. I will discuss the latter, though again I assume I'm dealing with a troll.

Let's look at an example considering the simplest form a belief that I (personally) would consider Christian faith. The first building block that has to be accepted for faith is feeling the presence of God. Therein lies the fundamental schism. I made the move from agnostic to theist because I could not deny the presence I felt. Even when I was an atheist, I couldn't really take offense to others feeling a sense of oneness with the world, or universe, or something greater, or whatever. I think if you start making trouble for people at the fundamental belief level, you're just a rude individual.

The second step for believing in most modern religions is an understanding that that presence that interconnects and influences is 100% benevolent. Now, that's a real leap. And, in case you are truly curious about Greek Mythology, it stops here. Their gods just exist with no real purpose. They also have a fluctuating moral code. At this point, I can only speak for myself, and even in the worst facets of life (i.e. the death of my mother), I could only see beauty. The gift of enjoying life. The gift of enjoying relationships. The gift of free will. Even in the most adverse of conditions, those things still exist. I find that cause enough to believe in a benevolent entity and so do billions of others. I know here many atheists would bring up, ""Well, what about bad thing A? What about this bad thing B?"" I'm not saying this is you, but to those that respond with that, have you even TRIED seeing it through the eyes of someone who believes the physical is relatively unimportant? Or are you just attempting to jump into a further argument without cause?

The next step, perfection, is a logical one (in an ""if""-type logical construct, that is). If you believe in a benevolent entity whose will molds existence, which one is the ""correct"" will (if any): (1) man's, who we know to make greedy, irrational decisions, or (2) the benevolent entity's? You may ask why there must be a ""correct"" will, but if you think about it, any compromise between the two is just a loss of the benevolent will.

Existence, benevolence, and perfection are all rather common traits of modern religion. From there, the Christian logic follows that we feel a communal, positive relationship with that entity (God) that you could call impersonal love, the love that He shares despite the individual receiver of that love. But how can the perfect, benevolent being have love for that which struggles against His will. All Christians (I think) from that point believe in a ""sacrifice"".

That is where Christians differ. Personally, I think that if we're going to stick with the idea that one must believe in Christ to live in fellowship with God forever, then the most simple understanding is this: God made a simple (not requiring actual action) sacrifice to accept us and positively affect our lives. One must acknowledge and act upon that sacrifice (bettering themselves spiritually) to attain fellowship, and Jesus the man saved mankind by teaching that sacrifice so vehemently that he lost his life doing it, subsequently moving the world to understanding and belief.

That is the most basic. Then you can get into beliefs that Christ was a necessary sacrificial means to an end, and that sacrifice is what's important, not Christ. Or that it was necessary for the God-man to be sacrificed. It can actually get rather complicated. Believe it or not, Christians differ on even this point. But the essential ingredient is believing in God's sacrifice to be in fellowship with us.

Christianity is the logical conclusion of many, GIVEN the assumptions of existence, benevolence, perfection, and sacrifice. Logically, other faith systems either have different assumptions or do not follow logic correctly. Christians believe their religion is correct based on assumptions they can feel. You can't really argue against what a person FEELS. You can argue how they interpret those feelings, but really, the difference isn't that complicated. Your disagreement with a believing individual may simply be based on the starting principal, feeling the existence of a higher presence. You don't feel it, so you think everything that follows from it is mad. I feel it, and it gives a lot of positive things to my life. As a Christian, I assume you are just deadened to the feeling (as I used to be), or you are ignoring it. My hope is that you feel it at some point. I don't think that can be construed as a negative thing.

If you were actually looking for this answer, Greek mythology satisfied one of the above assumptions, existence. The Greeks used their Gods to explain the world. Personally, I think over time, humans have had a greater chance to analyze their belief and further understand their assumptions. I think we have developed from fewer, simpler assumptions to grander ones.

Whew. I hope that is legitimately helpful.

TL;DR Christianity is the logical conclusion to a series of (what you may call illogical) assumptions. Greek mythology is the result of a much simpler, (and most believe) outdated set of assumptions.","1320106244"

The thing is, Bill Gates probably won't go to McDonalds for his subsistence because he's rich - therefore, he'll spend a lot more money than a poorer person on food, but maybe not relatively so.  So a poor person may spend $5 dollars a day on food - Bill Gates will spend $50 or $100, or $1000 a day on food - getting some rare plant imported from Guatemala or something.  But you are comparing a poor person with the absolute richest person in the country.  Of course speaking of relative dollar worth will be thrown out the window with such a ridiculous wealth difference.","1320106248"

&gt;Without running into trouble with the law, Blagojevich would be eligible to get a state pension of about $65,000 a year. If he loses that pension, he still would be eligible for a refund of about $128,000 in personal contributions he made to the stateâs retirement fund for his four years as a lawmaker and six years as governor.

This just screams *scam*. He paid in less than he would get in two years!


It's the same for all pensions. They are a ripoff. If state employees want to get reimbursed like Blago is going to, then that's fine with me. If they want to suck the life out of our state, they can get lost.","1320106252"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A colon, or an em dash.

A colon is used in this context to connect a list and a descriptor for that list to each other. For instance, ""this is the shopping list: eggs, butter and milk,"" or ""greed, corruption and wrath: these were the sins of Bob."" It can also be used to link a phrase (which is a subject without a verb or vice versa) to the actor of a sentence, such as in ""Tim knew of only one place: Georgia,"" or ""Only one thing kept the company afloat: stolen time."" A semicolon is used to link two related sentences together, such as ""the cake was surely almost done baking; Julia stared impatiently at the oven."" An em dash (â) can be used for any of these purposes, but which one to use is dependent upon the context of the sentence and your choice as a writer, but it tends to signify a more indirect link between the ideas it connects. For instance, ""I wasn't one to hang around a place like that for too longâI'd had some bad interactions with those types of people in the past,"" or ""I only had one thing on my mindâthe death of Steven McKay."" It can also be used to explain a part of a sentence by cutting away from the sentence without the disconnection that parentheses imply, such as in the sentence ""Julia stared at the fishâan exotic fish that was apparently common along the eastern coast of Mexicoâand said, 'fishy fish, you and me are gonna go a long way.'""

A lot of my examples are prose-y; the formality of your writing can play an important part in choosing the correct punctuation. But the fluidity of word choice and punctuation choice is what makes English so much fun!","1320106252"

I am not a huge fan of this book as it is a little dry and sort of jumps all over the place, but he sourced his introduction very well sourced in his section on just this. Sadly there is no google books preview that you can use :(.

Otherwise, Thomas Mastnak is quite good for concepts regarding crusading.

Mastnak, Tomaz. *Crusading Peace: Christendom, the Muslim World, and Western Political Order*. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002.

I wrote a paper on the origin of crusading last year and I would be happy to post the rest of my Bibliography if that would help you. Again, not 100% sure what you are writing about, so this is probably a little off topic for you... but hey it may help a bit

Oh the other textbook I used in my class on the crusades which is quite an enjoyable read is *The Crusades* by Thomas Asbridge. [For which there is a Google Books Preview :D](http://books.google.ca/books?id=_fL3jwjhyQ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=asbridge&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hjivTtygJISBsgKN5bWeAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) It is a full history of the crusades, but you may be able to use a chapter out of it or something.

"politics","t5_2cneq","As citizens of this world we need to finally realize we're all in this together. Western capitalism sets an example that perpetuates inequality around the world. We need to change that and set an example that shows we are no longer complacent and will not stand by a system that robs the world of value without giving anything back. People aren't lazy, most people work for what they get and they are getting increasingly less for their labour while the leaders reap the disparity. 

This Occupy movement isn't going to stop and we need as many informed people with level heads as possible to steer it in the right direction. Everyone needs to get involved because there's a chance to change things here for the better that hasn't been seen for decades and that's why the response by the establishment is going to continue to ramp up and get increasingly violent in its attempt to discredit the movement.

People may have supported the Arab spring, but not many clued into the fact that it was our complacency and lack of knowledge of how our global capitalist system actually operates that perpetuated those conditions that led to revolution in the first place.

A new revolution has to start here and spread because our system is the source of the disparity seen around the world. We are the public opinion. We are the main silent contributors to a system that funnels wealth away from the less fortunate. We need to speak up for something more worthwhile for every person who lives and breathes on this planet.","1320106255"

&gt;When I said in the post that women are human âbut Iâm not sure what you are,â I was still talking about how the culture of masculinization essentially tells men that they arenât human â instead, theyâre savage beasts barely held in check by civilization (and most men are perfectly willing to go along with that because it grants them privileges).
&gt;
&gt;I vehemently disagree that when somebody hates or despises an oppressor it is âno differentâ than hate from the oppressor. I would even say that it is healthy for members of an oppressed group to (occasionally?) hate their oppressors, since itâs a sign that they havenât completely internalized their own subjugation.

Specifically, she is drawing attention to this phenomenon:

&gt;It seems to me that when women are enraged itâs considered a huge problem, even if weâre only talking, but when men actually engage in deliberate cruelty and violence towards women itâs somehow not as serious.

I understand the personal need and use of religon; however, I don't approve of intolerance of any kid, the monopolizing of beliefs and psychological abuse from those who are 'overly religious'.  It's when people get it in their minds that they have to change the whole world to their views, ways of life, etc that I don't approve of. When people go door to door and bother me and waste my time to hell me that my own life, that they dont know if, is miserable and incomplete and that i'm going to suffer an eternity of punishment is when it bothers me. I do not wish to change them, why change me? I have no agenda to make others to submit to my ways that only work for me. I would be just as bad as I was when I was christian. To each his own and the world is better off with different points of views.

Another thing I disapprove of is when people in general hold up progress, most commonly it's religion that does this. It bothers me deeply when I hear my little siblings say that they hate science and would just rather go off and not live questioning things.","1320106277"

This is something that has been a problem in ESPORTS for many many years and is nothing new. I have talked to players not only in the SC world but in other games as well and it universally seems to be a problem. With no one to really keep the companies in line the sponsors can basically do whatever they want.

As Totalbiscuit has said, this is why community members such as himself and others who run their own tournaments have begun trying to raise money for the players. Some times we catch a lot of flak for not doing everything perfect, but the idea is to skip the 50 middle men (trust me when I say trying to run tournaments with big sponsors involves a LOT of middlemen and a LOT of bullshit) and get right to what matters, supporting the players.

Good luck getting paid for any tournaments you are owed up on. I've heard from many many players that it is not easy.","1320106290"

"masculism","t5_2rb6c","&gt;""Nigga"" and ""nigger"" are actually two different words with two different meanings.

My apologies.  I like language and studying words and I was unaware there was a phonetic separation between the two words.  Thank you for making me aware of this, and I will remember it.

Perhaps ""gays"" and ""faggot"" would have been a better example.  Or simply ""women"" and ""bitch,"" though women don't usually call each other that, when it's used positively, it's a self-reference.

&gt;But on the overall context; we would gladly give up ""nigga"" if that meant we could also get rid of ""nigger."" We had a funeral for the word, but like vampires and zombies; the damn world will not let the word die.

I could be wrong, but it does seem to be falling out of fashion.  Yeah, it's used a lot by people trying to sound offensive on reddit or other anonymous forums, or on XBoxLive, but I think the casual use in everyday conversation is diminishing every generation.

But keep on looking on ebay. I suggest you read [Liberalguy's guide to ebay](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/l7nce/guide_to_buying_watches_on_ebay/), as well as our FAQ.   
Personally, I'd take a look at other brands (well.. that's mainly because I have a 40s Seamaster - which I absolutely love). From the 40s to the 70s there were made a lot of great watches. Any vintage watch of a well known swiss brand is worth a second look.   
  
Some advice I can give you right now:     

* Movement should be super clean.   

* Expect to spend additional money on service, specially if the movement is anything but pristine.  
 
* Watch straps are dirt cheap, and can be had anywhere.   

* Don't expect all parts to be original, or from the same watch. Crown, face, even hands. Stuff like this is often replaced on good looking vintage pieces.   

* Never go into a bidding war over a watch you really like. Your dream piece will show up many more times.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","If you pressurize carbon dioxide in contact with water, it will partition into the water (an attempt to reach equilibrium).  This is [Henry's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law), iirc.

You can facilitate the march towards equilibrium by a more intimate mixing of the gas and liquid phases - you could shake up the container or bubbles CO2 gas through the liquid.  Both these approaches increase the surface area between the gas and liquid, which leads to an overall increase in CO2 transfer rate because even if the flux is constant, flux is a per area rate of transfer; more interfacial area, faster overall transfer.

Fun fact: when you shake a can or bottle of soda and it fizzes out when you open it, you didn't actually 'create' more gas to build up the pressure.  Instead you merely displaced the dissolved CO2 from the liquid into the gas-phase.

It's also fun to think about what makes a soda go flat (temperature, fluid level, container size, time, etc.)","1320106303"

There **can** be a problem with having mismatched desires.  For example, my wife is really vanilla, I have a lot of kinky desires, and I can't seem to let them go.  But the problem there isn't that she's vanilla; it's either that we probably shouldn't have hooked up in the first place (but 20 years ago, I thought I could be vanilla), or that I can't put my love for her above my carnal desires.

If the two of you are content with where you're at, then that's great.  If you're worried, sit down with her some time and say ""Honey, does it bother you that I'm not as into kinky things like anal or handcuffs or spanking as you are?  And please be honest with me.""  If the two of you can communicate openly, and if you're both flexible, it shouldn't be a problem.

And also, (a) if you love her enough to do things to please her even though they aren't #1 on your list, and (b) if doing them doesn't weird you out too much, then go ahead and incorporate them sometimes.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Wow please disregard justaverage's comment for completely generalizing the wait staff population.  I can vouch that not me or anyone at my restaurant are prima donna that he speaks of.

For starters I have never thought myself better than any other staff, especially since they're the ones helping you make tips.  That's just plain dumb.

Second, I won't remember if someone leaves me a bad tip.  I may feel a little sour, but I certainly won't remember them.  Maybe if I serve them a couple times in a row I MIGHT remember (still haven't remembered one), but I will guarantee I do remember awesome customers who were pleasant to serve, regardless of tips.

Third, theft really?  The restaurant I work at barely makes their overhead, so the last thing I want to do is run them out of business.  The wait staff I kid you not spend sometimes half an hour crunching numbers to make sure that we were balancing the register and all money accounted for.  And that typically means we're the last ones out with the owner.

Fourth, if you do drugs on the job at any job, you'll get fired.  Period.  No respectable server would do that.

Lastly, after making an average of 18% tips, at the end of the night I'd be happy if I average 10$/hr after tip share.  Most of the times I work mornings and I'd be lucky to make 50$ in tips after a 7hr shift (we pool tips, so average is a little low).  But you know what, I love my job.  I like taking care of people and making sure everyone is satisfied.  I get an adrenaline rush catering to people, and delight when describing dishes to people who haven't eaten at an Asian restaurant.

To finish off, I'm tired of the waiter hating bullshit that constantly floats here on reddit.  It's like hate fuel, as soon as someone claims they're a waiter and repeats the same repetitive horrible description to justify they're meaningless hate for servers they gather round and circle jerk all over him.  Do people really think that waiters live some glamorous drug filled lifestyle fit for a paparazzi riddled celebrity?  Almost all servers are working their asses off to make ends meet, or else they wouldn't be a server but instead a paying customer.","1320106320"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Last year, I went out with some ""friends"" on halloween. We were 14 and I said we're too damn old for trick or treating. While 2 of them were at my door talking to me while I was getting my shoes on I hear someone shouting ""Oi!"" from about 4 doors up. One of them had grabbed a shit load of sweets from my neighbour. I instantly ran out the door and grabbed him and asked him what the fuck he was doing. I dragged him up the road and made him apologise.

My neighbor was okay with it, he just gave them a lecture about other kids that want some. After that, I suggested we get the fuck away from my mum's house.

Later that night, houses were egged and bins were set on fire.
At 2 different points in time I had suggested we get away from the ""scene of the crime"".
The first time, I started walking off around the corner and put my hood up and, I shit you not, I saw a PCSO car 5 seconds later. They drove straight past me.

The second time, everyone was sitting in the bus stop across the road while I was taking a leak on the other side. This was while the bin was on fire. A riot van cam just after I had finished urinating and the 12 year old in the group was about 7 ft away from me so I told he to come with me and as we walked away under their noses I told him to *not* look back and that we'll call someone I knew who lived in the flats opposite the bus top to see how it ended.","1320106331"

For example, this idea that we were all born Christian... Where does it come from?  Please define what you believe a Christian is and then tell me if you think that a newborn baby fits that description.  It is my belief that people are not born with a concept of God.  God is something invented by man and taught to children.  Therefore, people are not born Christian.  Also, what about people born into households of other religions?  What about people born into Muslim households for example?  Saying that all people are born Christian just doesn't make sense.","1320106335"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;So the Soviets built up conventional and nuclear forces because they feared being overwhelmed by the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and its allies did the same. Do you know how close we came to mutual annihilation?

Did you read what I said?  The Soviets had double the amount of nuclear weapons as the US, overwhelmingly superior numbers in their forward deployed conventional forces and they had a history of grinding nations under their control to dust.  The best minds in the UK, France, Canada, US and the rest of the free world knew that the only way war could be avoided was to through the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.  To say otherwise is pretty arrogant because 1. it **worked** and 2. those people were contemporaries with the Soviets and understood the threat in a lot clearer way than this generation does because they saw it with their own eyes.  

&gt;I'm not advocating appeasement a la Neville Chamberlain, and I honestly don't know if, by 1939, there was an alternative to fighting Hitler, but those things didn't just suddenly occur; they were the result of decades of decisions and forces.

What does WW2 have to do with this conversation?

&gt;Examples would be the Ohio Class submarine, spy satilites, the SR-71, Stealth Technology, etc... I said specifically that advanced aerospace technology is something that we might well not have
&gt;

Again, you aren't even responding to the point I made...

&gt;Here's the reference to ""we will bury you""

Yet again, you're not responding to my point, which was:

""The Wikipedia page I am looking at says different, but regardless of where the incident took place, a man with the capability of launching thousands of nuclear warheads at us, who controlled something like 50 armored divisions in Europe said, 'We will bury you' while banging his shoe on something! You know how it directly translated? It meant, 'We will bury you'.

People who don't take threats like that seriously don't live long.""

This is the link to the Wikipedia page I was looking at: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-banging_incident)

&gt;My option to corrupt dictators would have been supporting the governments that the people themselves chose (e.g. Allende) and not helping corporations (e.g. United Fruit) influence and control the political and economic lives.
&gt;
&gt;That is, the U.S. didn't really care about the human rights and development in many, many countries, as long as those countries were ""on our side"" and stood with us against The Enemy. Most of South and Central America, large swathes of Africa, goons in the Middle East. There are more than enough examples.

So what you're saying is that you would have chosen my second option, which was to the ignore nations with corrupt dictators that were unwilling to reform at our request?  If we would have done that, the Soviets most assuredly would have swooped in and those nations would have come under their influence or control.  How would that have improved the lives of the people living there?

It's as simple as this:  Bad people were at risk of coming under the control of more powerful, really, really bad people.  If that would have happened, it would have made the world a less safe place.  Since the bad people weren't going to renounce their evil ways and become good if we asked them to, we had to play nice with them to make sure the really, really bad people didn't expand their sphere of influence and make the world a less safe place.

"linux","t5_2qh1a"," &gt; Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.

If a program can not complete my singular purpose, then it matters not what else it can do. I ignore terms of service entirely anyway. 

&gt; Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.

I know not and care not *how* it works, I care *that* it works. Additionally, as a designer, rather than as a coder, there is very little scope for altering anything under linux. I can't actually change a program's UI, I can only draw up a wireframe so that someone else can code it into place, and given how little regard programmers have for designers, the odds of anyone listening to my suggestions are minimal. So functionally, open source is no more changeable for me than closed source. 

&gt; Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.

I pirate things, functionally it makes no difference what licence they come under, I will share it anyway. 

&gt; Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

I do not have the skills to alter the program, and even if I did, the legality of distribution makes no difference to me.

So im about 19 and working somewhere in Holland, The place had lots of students coming to work there, So I meet this one girl who is like 16/17 and seems quite down to earth, even though she was an anti toker, Didnt like weed or getting high at all, Now normally considering that I pretty much smoke from morning till evening this wouldnt fly, Just so happened this particular girl was as healthy and fine to boot, So week or two go buy, slow enough, She mentions shes a lesbian, So I get deflated, Flip a coin if Im going to save myself from pride and believe her when she invites me over to her house. So me being the optimist I am I decided to head over see whats going down, Her parents were going to Carnival (south Holland festival thing a party goes on for a few days) Anyway, Day Im supposed to go, I eat a 4 gram ball of Afghan black hash, Thinking that by the time I get there (half hour train and I took it a good 3 hours before going) Id be at least starting to be a bit stoned so at least no matter what goes down, I'll have a laugh, So she meets me at the train station and I jump on the back of her bike as she cycles towards her house,. Chatting normal, Seems in great form, Pull up to a swanky enough looking house and opens door etc, oh side note, I didnt wear my cap, took out an earring I used to wear to look my best, you know appearance and all that new there was  a slight chance parents would be there for 5 minutes. 

So there I am, a friend of a Dutch lesbian visiting her house, THE moment Im in the front room I feel theres something strange going on, just felt it, cant explain, She puts her arm around me and smiles and says this is *name* my boyfriend* in i like like you way :P Ive told you so much about, I was abit confused but thought whatever, offered my hand quick enough and said Nice to meet you, (I speak alright dutch) but I choose to speak English, Father is a bear of a man with a mustache and the mother is bigger lol, Never forget it, Yet the daughter was tall, but nothing like them, Anyway. Skipping awakward hour with questions while the while im becoming more and more stoned. Im sitting on the couch with her alone, Drinking shots of some weird liquorish drink, She explains she doesnt want her parents to worry shes a lesbian. 

I think what ever by now Im getting high enough thats its all funny and it was enjoyable, A laugh etc. All of a sudden a thought crosses my mind, Has she ever had sex with a man before, So I ask her, She says Nope. Never since Im a young girl felt attracted to them, just didnt cross my mind.. My reply to the effect off ""Thats all fine and dandy but if youve never had sex with a man you can never be 100% sure"" See her litter intoxicated brain clicking over drive and comes up with lets go up stairs. Last side note, Father and Mother had warned me not to go upstairs, had plain as day said your welcome in my home but not up the stairs. So up the stairs we went, I thought bedroom, but no, Bathroom, Only room in the house with a lock. 

So by this stage im a 8 and simply DTF , So I start completely forgetting to be in virgin mode, started really just going for it, with a condom on, So Im asking her to do this, move there, leg that way etc lol.. oblivious to the bored and sorta disgusted expression on her face lol... So as shes lieing on her back on the floor missionary she gets the chance to tell me shes already decided not into it, I ask, look started now can I not quickly finish.. She laughs and actually smiles for the first time, and says yes. score 1 for being honest. Anyway, I see panic on her face before im finished, Her footsteps downstairs, Her name being called, She looks freaked I through my jeans on. Sit on the edge of the bath, Could hear my brain screaming at me, You are fucked, 

Those Dutch Giants are coming and you aint going nowhere, So the father is already going up the streps when I grab a hand full of gel in my hand from the sink and glob loads of it into my hair, Father opens the door and with a big red face and goes whats going on, pokerface.jpg Your daughter thought my hair would like nice with gel in it, I said not too but she insisted. *smile* Didnt take more then 1 second for him to say get out, I was flying at this stage lol.. Somehow its the father cycling me the the train station, he leaves me with a warning never to return, sounded like a good idea to me aswell, Sitting on the train home to my city, I realise I still have the condom on from the bathroom, lol... Present for you mister train bin, stop before my city two dudes get on and im telling them what happened, One of them ""likes"" Irish people and speaking english, INSISTS on the Irish pub, being in the good mood I was , off we went, so sitting there with my two new train buddies, I notice a long haird nordic looking girl, beautiful, who I recognize, believe it or not, but I got on a bus in dublin ireland with the same girl a few years before, I asked her do you remember me?

First is the preference issue.  Personally, I would never spend $220 on an EVGA card with a two year warranty when you could get [one of these](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Productcompare.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100007709%20600030348%20600094002%20600107147&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;bop=And&amp;CompareItemList=48|14-121-425^14-121-425-TS%2C14-127-565^14-127-565-TS%2C14-125-363^14-125-363-TS%2C14-121-424^14-121-424-TS) for around the same price and they all have nicer, quieter cooling solutions than the EVGA and the same warranty period.  Some of them even come overclocked.  Of course, if you want the best, get [this Sparkle](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814187151) or [this MSI](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127578).

Second, the quality issue.  Run like hell from that PSU.  Apevia makes absolute shit.  I'd be surprised if their PSU put out 350w, let alone 500w.  You're asking for trouble with it.  On the sidebar is the Trusted Parts and Reviews Database and the Power Supply Resources and Discussion.  Take a good look at both when you're choosing your PSU.  I won't suggest one now since you won't buy until Christmas, but, in general, Seasonic, PC Power &amp; Cooling, Enermax, Corsair, NZXT, Thortech, and a few others sell good quality, reliable units.","1320106349"

If you're suffering from [actual overtraining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtraining), then I'd rather rest totally rather than risk not getting better.  Think of it as a way to get rid of those small nagging not-quite-injuries. 

Anecdote: What is widely considered the world's best female cross-country skier, Marit BjÃ¸rgen, was so overtrained that she essentially wasted an  entire year in training. While skiing is not entirely analogous, she changed her training to be mainly about low-intensity work and technique, and emerged as the world's best skier for years, and I believe she will continue to be for a number of years.

That being said, I don't have specific experience in being _severely_ overtrained, but I'm not sure I'd treat it as a DIY-er.  If you still treat it as DIY, Brian Mac has [some material](http://www.brianmac.co.uk/overtrn.htm) on it - in particular, look at the questionnaire at the middle of the page.  You could try that.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","&gt; (so ~2/3 of the area is between 100 and 140.

That will work for normal distributions, but not necessarily the lognormal distribution; it depends on just how skewed it is. In the example given the distribution is not very skew so it will actually give quite close to 2/3 between those limits

&gt; I can make some log-normal looking graphs but I can't make a good function to generate the parameters.

If you look at the [wikipedia page for the lognormal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution), you can see that the mode (the peak) is M=exp(Î¼-Ï^2 ) and you can work out that the variance is V = M^2 exp(3Ï^2 ) (exp(Ï^2 ) -1)

It's not clear why the guess would be the most likely time, but anyway

so ln(M) = Î¼ - Ï^2 = ln(120)

and V/M^2 = exp(3Ï^2 ) (exp(Ï^2 ) -1) = 1/6^2 

the second of which you can solve numerically - e.g. by Newton's method

since in this case Ï^2  is a lot smaller than 1, to a rough approximation,

exp(3Ï^2 ) (exp(Ï^2 ) -1) = (1 + 3Ï^2 ) . Ï^2  which gives a quadratic in Ï^2 you can solve, giving a starting value not far from Ï^2  = 1/36; might as well use that instead

Finding the original root iteratively gives Ï^2 â 0.02541  (or Ï  â  0.1594)

and then Î¼ â ln(120) + 0.02541 = 4.813

In [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/), the single line:

curve( dlnorm(x, 4.813, 0.1594), from=60, to=200, col=3, lwd=2)

produces the curve here:

http://i.imgur.com/2rXpZ.png

It would be a simple task in [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) to write a function to take the mode and the standard deviation, find the root for the parameter Ï^2 (e.g. by a single call to uniroot), compute Ï and then find Î¼ and then draw the density.

(On the other hand, you could do it just about as easily in a variety of other packages.)

You might also like to consider the gamma density, which often looks similar to the lognormal when the standard deviation is relatively small compared to the mode.


(Edit: here's some very rough example [**R**](http://cran.r-project.org/) code; it assumes that the standard deviation is smaller than a particular multiple of the mode (no more than 5.87 times as big as the mode) in setting up the interval for the uniroot call; you can make the c(0,1) say c(0,20) if you need to, but the bound there is already getting *really* skew, and the lognormal probably doesn't do what you want by then anyway

     logNormDenMS &lt;- function(mode,sd) {
       V &lt;- (sd/mode)^2
       sigSq &lt;- uniroot(function(x){exp(3*x)*(exp(x)-1)-V}, c(0,1))$root
       sigma &lt;- sqrt(sigSq)
       mu &lt;- log(mode)+sigma^2
       curve(dlnorm(x,mu,sigma),from=mode-2.5*sd,to=mode+3.5*sd,col=3,lwd=2)
       }

That function works on your example. That is  `logNormDenMS(120,20)`  gives the curve linked above.
A smarter idea would be to just pass back a list or data frame with mu and sigma in it and call the function to draw it afterward; that would give opportunity to do more with it. )

It is the ability to satisfy our needs and wants.

If our wealth is increasing as you say, that means more and more of our needs and wants are being satisfied through consuming more and more goods and services.

But those goods and services must first be produced. So the true source of rising wealth is our ability to produce more from less.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","It's an interesting role reversal, but it's hard to comment on it without having been there. Were they really being hostile, or were you alienating yourself and then feeling like everyone was hostile?

People will act as strangers towards others they don't know, and towards others they feel different. This goes both ways. The best and easiest way to crack this barrier is to spend some time hanging out with the friend who invited you, so that you can get to gradually meet others on a more personal level. Ignore the labels, even those that apply to yourself. Only introduce your date, forget about sexuality, smile, dance, and enjoy your time. Otherwise, this little bit will continue to drill into your head until you feel not only out of place, but unwelcomed.

Living where I am, I can't say that it would be strange or even wrong for people who don't conform to the gay label (including straight, bisexual, pan, etc.) to attend a ""Gay Party"", but it's possible that in an area where being gay is a major taboo, having a straight couple at a gay party might make them feel uncomfortable because they feel it's an exclusive event for a minority.

the simple fact is that pros typically need relatively cheap things like bays and ports, but not always dual hex core mega processors etc - maybe if Apple offered a base config of the Pro that offered the bays and ports of the current box but made cheap CPU/RAM/HDD available, it might be a more appealing machine?

This is a simplified example. Now I get a random number generator to generate me a number in the set 0 through 5000000. It's still only going to give me ""yes"" or ""no"". No matter how much randomness I inject into the input side, I'm still only going to get one of two options. One could say that the answer is ""randomly"" chosen, but given the same input, the answer would be the same. If I randomly get a 5000, I'll get ""yes"".

edit: here's an excerpt from the article:

&gt;Finally, lower courts have not limited use of this new power only to
the Iqbal paradigm. Rather, they have increased demand for greater facts
in all manner of complaints, beyond civil rights and certainly as to run-of-the-mill civil rights actions. The unfortunate result will be a higher,
often-insurmountable pleading burden for plaintiffs, increased use of
Rule 12(b)(6) as a costly litigation tool, and increased defendant
success in using that tool to defeat claims that can be properly evaluated
only after discovery.

&gt;The substantive consequence will be a significant decrease in
vindication of federal constitutional and civil rights, and of the values
and principles underlying those rights. We can predict less private
attorney general activity, less exposure of governmental wrongdoing, less
enforcement of constitutional and civil rights, and less opportunity to
even make a serious inquiry into the underlying facts and events for
failure to clear the pleading hurdle.

&gt;Importantly, this decrease in substantive enforcement stems from
procedureâfrom imposing burdens on plaintiffs to present substantial
factual detail at the outset of litigation, even detail they do not and
cannot know, and from empowering courts to form their own
conclusions about alleged misconduct based on factual allegations. It

Wow.  That's possibly the most ironic thing I've seen today.  


&gt; the hardware isn't subpar, it IS par.

It was SUBpar when it was *released*.  As in, there were better options for every individual component in there at the time it hit the streets, and as far as PCs go, things have only been improving.


&gt; A console doesn't need to run an operating system 

The Xbox runs a modified version of windows - XP, if memory serves - and the Playstation a modified version of Linux.  


&gt; The funny part is, a console from 5 years ago can play any new game that comes out for it

That's because the game was developed with the console hardware in mind - ""gimped,"" to use the popular word for this practice.  

Meanwhile, in PC land, games like Witcher 2 come out that AREN'T gimped and are built to modern ""Par"" hardware standards, and the effort to even get that to turn *ON* on the Xbox 360 is already a year old with no tangible results in sight.  


&gt; unlike a 5 year old computer, which, even if you bought a top of the line machine back then, would probably be able to only play bf3 on minimum settings, at best.

You do know that, on the PC, the bare minimum settings for BF3 have a tagline that reads ""comparable to what you would see on a console""?

There might be a lot of good reasons to play on a console (I have and use both).  But technological superiority is **certainly** not one of them.","1320106392"

If ""fairness"" in your relationship means forcing her to play defense once in a while, then so be it. This might provide an incentive for her to recognize your positions in the future.

And if it doesn't, you can at least ease your burden of bitterness over her forcing her way all the time.","1320106403"

I'm referring to the EU law about that topic). It's not the exact same case, because the constitutional court (""Bundesverfassungsgericht"") is strongly connected with the government, but however, this court decided that, against the EU regulations, data preservation will not be practiced in Germany. I think that was in 2007. One political theorist we dealt with in school put it somehow like ""While the government tries to put the aspect of safety on the very top of our legal system, disregarding the freedom of the citizens, the constitutional court is doing the exact opposite.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Humans have relatively low mitochondrial diversity compared to the other great apes, and reports of this are mostly responsible for the belief that humans have low genetic diversity. However, mtDNA makes up just a few millionths of the human genome,[17] and as a single locus, carries little statistical weight.

When allele frequency data are used to estimate genetic diversity within a population, a frequently reported statistic is the average number of alleles per locus (A), but because rare alleles do not contribute much to overall diversity, the most informative statistic is average heterozygosity (H). This is estimated from both the number of alleles and the frequencies at which they occur, and is generally defined as the percentage of individuals in a population that are heterozygous (have two different alleles) at a random locus. In general, genetic diversity is synonymous with mean heterozygosity.

Keeping the preceding caveats in mind, these are qualitative guidelines suggested by Sewall Wright for interpreting FST:

âThe range 0 to 0.05 may be considered as indicating little genetic differentiation.
The range 0.05 to 0.15 indicates moderate genetic differentiation.
The range 0.15 to 0.25 indicates great genetic differentiation.
Values of FST above 0.25 indicate very great genetic differentiation.â

It should be noted that high phenotypic diversity in some domestic animals (such as the Asian dogs) is mostly the result of selective breeding for quantitative traits, rather than the long-term allopatry or local adaptation that leads to morphological distinctiveness in ânaturalâ populations. As expected, the average microsatellite distance between these dog breeds as measured by Neiâs genetic distance DA (0.194) [100] is correspondingly smaller than the average distance between fourteen human populations (0.322). [101]

Human FST values of 12-15% are typical not just for microsatellites, but also for classical protein polymorphisms,[102] autosomal RFLPs[103] and Alu insertions.[104] Values for mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome are substantially higher. It would seem, then, that the level of genetic differentiation among human populations is not especially small, and in fact is entirely adequate for race designation, particularly when coupled with consistent morphological differences.

I would honestly argue the world is mad, by any definition. That it itself does not yield my point of view as accurate or sane by comparison, it only makes it a different point of view.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","If he was playing in the mid 90s, those are far from the biggest changes.  Those are the biggest changes in the past 2 or 3 years, but the biggest changes since the mid 90s come from the huge 6th ed rule overhaul.  In fact, if he doesn't know the result of that overhaul, some of the changes you mentioned won't even make sense to him. The combat damage on the stack rule for instance didn't even exist back then because... well, see below.

**To the OP**: So, the biggest changes since the mid 90s?  The introduction of the stack (which had the side effect of killing the interrupt card type.  Now all interrupts are instants).  If you do not know about the stack, I would really suggest you read on it.  It's pretty central to how spells and abilities are played.  There is no more ""fast effects"", ""interrupts"" and, if you played when they were introduced, no more ""mana source"" (as a card type).

Compared to that, all other changes are minor.  Some may catch you off guard at first.  For instance, the legend rule changed (now called the legendary rule, because instead of being a creature type, ""legend"" has become a super type called ""legendary"" which can be applied to any permanent type), now if you play a legendary permanent with the same name as a legendary permanent already in play, *both* are put into the greaveyard.  Another that confused some of my returning friends was that a blocking creature that becomes tapped still deals combat damage.

A lot has changed since you started playing and I highly suggest you check the rules all over again.  In many ways, it will feel like you are learning a new game.  You still tap lands to make mana and play spells and you still attack with creatures, but the underlying mechanics have changed dramatically.  In most cases, the changes were good, especially the ones that changed the game *you* were used to.  I do not agree with some of the more recent changes, but those are changes to rules that probably didn't even exist when you played, so you won't be bothered by those.

-=edit=- Oh, there was also a pretty huge creature type overhaul a few years back, so if you play with old cards, make sure you check if they kept their creature type.

**TL;DR** Planeswalkers, removal of mana burn, terminology changes and changes to combat damage are nothing compared to the changes that happened when 6th edition came out.  Many of the things you seem to think have been there forever didn't even exist when OP was playing and some of the stuff that was central to the game back then, you probably never heard of.","1320106424"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","As others have said, it reduces ""jaggies"" in an image. Note that antialiasing can't add information or detail to a image; it can only smooth out what already there. Increasing the resolution is a better way of improving image quality, since it allows more detail to be shown on the screen.

Antialiasing is also costly in terms of GPU processing; it never ""hurts"" image quality to turn it on, but it can have a negative impact on framerates. Having a high framerate is more important than getting rid of jaggies, since it helps with responsive input and the general fluidity of the game.

Bigger numbers mean more antialiasing. However, the high levels give diminishing returns. The difference between x4 and x8 is very subtle, and the difference between x8 and x16 is hardly noticeable.

In conclusion:

* Only turn on antialiasing if you are already running at your monitor's max resolution and above 60fps
* You don't need to turn antialiasing up more than x4

&gt;""No,"" 

No to what? No, the oregon bottle bill isn't the majority approach? No, something other than 11 out of 51 jurisdictions have adopted it? 

BrainRampage suggested op (""The Drinker"") move to Portland (Oregon, though Maine would also work for this) because there's a $0.05 deposit refund for recycling bottles in Portland. And BrainRampage calculated The Drinker would get to ""pocket"" $260/year from the $0.05 refunds. 

There are, as far as I can see, only two options:

1. BrainRampage understands how the system works. i.e. understands the five cents you get when you recycle a bottle is actually a refund of your own five cents you put down as a deposit against the return of the bottle and is suggesting The Drinker try to pull off a version of Newman and Kramer's scam from [The Bottle Deposit] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bottle_Deposit)

2. BrainRampage is unaware of how the system works. i.e. doesn't know the five cents you get when recycling a bottle in Portland is the refund of a deposit. i think this reading is far more likely since BrainRampage says ""and get paid $260/year just for drinking beer."" but makes no mention of the costs of running the Newman scam. 

otherwise, I'm having trouble envisioning what being ""IN Oregon"" has to do with it. in Oregon, you don't get paid to drink your own beer. in Oregon you pay a 5 cent deposit on every bottle of beer you purchase. in Oregon you can get that 5 cent deposit back upon turning the bottle in for recycling. i don't understand how providing a no interest loan to your local liquor store could be seen as getting paid to drink beer, even in PDX","1320106449"

Home made bread was the best. Canned pate, cheese and sardines were considered a highly valued treat. You get used to it after a while though - its much easier when temptation is not there. I missed ice and a good steak once in a while. But before this trip I thought I could never be a vegetarian. Now I now I could. Nothing major broke. We had to do some minor fixes to the wind vane which wasn't adjusting properly and we lost the front hatch leaving Moorea and had to improvise one with a tarp and some wood we found in Suwarrow. We didn't really do any special exercise but just from going up and down hatches, regular sailing activity and forced controlled calorie intake it wasnt hard to keep in shape. Kim jumped sometimes during her watch and I would go walking around for hours whenever we were on land. We were 4. Tom&amp;Kim from Karaka, Alex and me (Martin). I'm definitely the best singer. When we were on Karaka and we were playing instruments I'd be the one to sing. Some of my favorite singing songs are So Long Marianne, Something Changed and Wicked Game. I don't know if we NEED time off each other, but after 4 months at sea you build a high tolerance for ego grinding. My favorite memory is probably the time we spent in SUWARROW (you can read my blog entry about it) - Stevenson once called it the most romantic island in the world and its not an overstatement. Ill probably stay in Australia about 3 months.

Any county or state with a supermajority in one denomination can rewrite the state constitution to become a genuine theocracy. Paul: [""The First amendment ... cannot possibly be interpreted to apply to \[a city.\]""](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html)

No. These are the implications of the laws we've written. If we wanted different results, we should've written different laws. 

Brown: segregation violated the equal protection clause. 

Roe: abortion is protected by the natural right to privacy, which is ""retained by the people"" and thus prohibited to the states. 

Bush: the recount was flawed, late, and ill-founded. (I disagree with this decision, but I'm not going to pretend it's ""legislation"" just because the results are ugly.)

Citizens United: corporate personhood x political spending as protected speech = fuck our campaign finance laws. This will most likely be overturned with legislation, an amendment, or a superceding decision declaring that corporations aren't legal persons. 

Perry: the equal protection clause demands gender neutrality as well as racial neutrality. I just hope SCOTUS eventually sees how simple and obvious this one is, because it's an exact parallel to Loving v. Virginia. ","1320106455"

Dear Tikao,
 
Thank you for your email, which was received by the Human Rights Commission.
 
I apologise for the delay in our response, which was caused by a heavy workload.
 
We appreciate your expressing concerns to us on the subject of human rights abuses in Kenya, and for sending us a link to a video showing attacks on people accused of witchcraft.
 
I note that the video you referred us to was first reported in 2008 or 2009, when the issue of public lynching of people suspected of witchcraft in Kenya was the subject of media attention. You can find information, including news reports from the time, using a guided keyword search on an internet search engine such as Google, e.g:

The New Zealand Human Rights Commission is a government agency mandated by the Human Rights Act 1993, domestic New Zealand legislation. This legislation provides that the Commission is able to provide a dispute resolution service to resolve disputes relating to unlawful discrimination in New Zealand. Its jurisdiction does not extend to matters from other jurisdictions.  
 
I can confirm that a record of your approach is held within the Commissionâs records. This database is used at a broader level, without using identifying information, to inform our work.
 
Yours sincerely
 
Paul Warhurst   Information Advisor | Kaikorero
Human Rights Commission | Te KÄhui Tika Tangata

Look, I wish more people were fully supportive of homosexuality **and** gay rights, but at the point where you're trying to change what people like and dislike, you're becoming what you've fought against.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","While you maybe right about the June quals not having Jatt, it's a moot point still.  

Why?  [Because he played for the USA last year](http://na.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=199806&amp;highlight=whale)

&gt;(10) Disciples Of Tha Whale Lord (1st Round BYE)
&gt;Poisonidon *
&gt;**Jatt**
&gt;Torsen12
&gt;Cirque
&gt;Guardsman Bob
&gt;Smgzy
&gt;Stepn

Now you may ask, so? that was last year!

Lets look at the rules:

&gt;In case a player has multiple citizenships and/or has recently obtained citizenship, he/she may not represent more than one country at the WCG Grand Final. **Choice of country is locked once he/she has participated in any of the official WCG competition in a certain country.** This decision cannot be overturned until next yearâs competitions.

So basically, if you really want to get technical, Jatt's representation of the USA was still in place before the 2011 August Canada Quals.  Since it couldn't be change till 2011 anyway, and Dignitas *asked* if he could dual participate and they *gave him the go ahead*, its still WCG's fault.

A easy job to get into is driving a taxi, but it costs a bit of cash, you gotta have a decent grasp of Norwegian and you gotta find someone who holds a taxi license and is willing to give you a chance to drive.

3. Norway is expensive, unless you can get a job that gives you a place to stay you are going to need some saved up cash, a rough estimate is around 700 dollars in rent (if you are in the city, you can expect a tiny or very shitty apartment for that) and about half of that for food and other stuff, so lets say 1000 dollars a month if you are living as cheap as you can.

Robert Kirkman has stated he wants the two entities to be separate works. Which I'm all down for. In the comic Rick is pretty much 2 personalities. On one hand he's altruistic and trying to keep his group as ""human"" as possible. On the other side he's a survivor and does whatever is necessary to keep his group alive. WHATEVER IS NECESSARY. This makes it incredibly difficult to villify Rick. What I think what we are seeing in the show is applying these 2 personalities to two people making it extremely easy to villify Shane. We can stand him up next to Rick and say: ""See you don't need to be a dick!"" I don't hate Shane for the decision he made, though, you can see him starting to hate himself for it.

    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main() { printf(""%f\n"", 3); }

What does this print? I can tell you that newbies are absolutely baffled when this prints out `0.000000`. They are even more baffled when they forget a parameter to printf (e.g. `printf(""%d"")`) and their code segfaults. Newbies are typically horrible at isolating the error in their code, so to try and figure out where they went wrong, and they scratch their heads for hours tracing the execution of their program, trying to find a place where the printed variable got set to 0.

In comparison, Haskell's printf is a breath of fresh air. 

    ghci&gt; import Text.Printf
    ghci&gt; printf ""%f\n"" 3
    *** Exception: Printf.printf: bad argument
    ghci&gt; printf ""%f\n""
    *** Exception: Printf.printf: argument list ended prematurely
    ghci&gt; printf ""%f\n"" 3.0
    3.0

Also, null pointer exceptions are not novice-friendly for the same reason: it is very difficult for a novice to track down the place where the reference got set to null, and/or failed to get set to something other than null.

Creating new data types, and even generics, are a *lot* more noob-friendly in Haskell. Try doing the following in imperative languages, and (as a noob) you'll get all kinds of headaches, either dealing with null pointers, or loss of type safety.

    data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

Pattern matching is fairly easy for a novice to pick up; it's a shame we don't have this feature in more languages.

"SF4","t5_2r4cj","Re: Charging, I play Chun, there's quite a bit of charging.  I don't know how much of a new player you are (maybe you know what I'm going to say already) but here goes.  Basically, new players tend to think of charging as something that you have to do separately from something else.  For example, they tend to think, you do a sweep, then you start charging.  Chun li throws a fireball, then she charges for the next one, etc.

Start thinking of charging as something you should ALWAYS be doing unless the situation prevents it.  If you want to play a charge character, your default mode should be charging, unless you need to walk forward or etc. 

For example - throw a fireball?  As soon as you hit the button, you should be charging again, while the fireball animation is still going.  Jump up to do an air-throw?  As soon as you leave the ground, you're already back to charging (even as you hit the button to throw).  That is how guile's keep their fireball pressure - as soon as that sonic boom goes off, they've already started charging for the next one.

Also, remember that down-back counts as both a down charge and a back charge.  You don't need to walk back in order to charge - that's what new players tend to do all the time online.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Before I respond I want to be clear that I am not saying that Paul is unelectable because he is a congressman. I made the smaller point that his being a 12 term congressman does not tell us much about his electability. 

We also need to be careful in drawing too much from this kind of analysis. We have a very small number of presidential elections and very few candidates. Any election is going to give us a first something or other. (As an aside I'd love to see statistics of congressmen getting elected governor.)

That said, I do think that there are many reasons why a congressman is unlikely to get elected to the presidency. House districts are local and congressmen engage in retail politics. They rarely have to work at building a coalition to get elected, instead they deal with a very narrow constituency. Furthermore the House does not generate leaders. 438 members and only 5 in leadership. 

&gt;Ron Paul, with his impassioned nationwide (and growing) following, is unique.

There is no particular evidence of any growing following. His support in polls has been pretty flat, about 9% +/- 4. ","1320106518"

Suicide/violent incidents were extremely rare.

I'm actually surprised you see it as so important for a teenager to have sex while in high school.  Plenty of kids were dating and messing around, which certainly helps tame the hormones.  But there was little social pressure to have sex (in fact, pressure went the other way).  No one I knew became clinically depressed or anxious because they weren't banging their SO.. And to be honest, if someone told me they were, I'd probably laugh in their face at the ridiculousness.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Diversity implies willful ignorance, otherwise we would all think the exact same. It implies lots of world-views, many of them based on faulty or erroneous premises and ridiculous beliefs. If you say diversity is ok, then you seem to be bound to accepting even the nasty things people think. Come up with a way to be accepting of diversity, tolerant of differing views, yet also able to discriminate and condemn people for following their intuitions or religion. I just don't see how to walk that line, and I will readily submit that you will never find a way to do so that isn't blatantly hypocritical. 

Enlightenment is just a bullshit value-laden term that means nothing. Are you cultured, are you wise, are you morally superior? If you think you understand enlightenment because you read a definition, I think you're both full of shit and stupid. It's just empty language. 

I think there is great personal value in trying new things, meeting new people, seeing the world through their eyes. But ONLY personal value in those things. But if someone else wants to live like a hermit, doing what makes them happy, and they hurt no one in carrying this out, who am I, and more importantly who are you, to say he's wrong? You seem perfectly willing to judge one group for attempting to dictate how they live their lives by calling them willfully ignorant, while saying we should all get a chance to be ourselves(gay people should be able to live openly without discrimination, right?). Or is all this thinking, reasoning and principles business not your thing? 

And here you are using this enlightenment bullshit to pretend that what you value subjectively has objective value. It doesn't, you're just using double-speak in an attempt to strong-arm your side while having zero substance to back it up. YOU like these things, YOU value them, and that's awesome for you, but it means nothing for anyone else. Just because you like it doesn't mean anyone else has to or should. 

Great, be disgusted, that's what you get to do and they get to do what they want. However, you being disgusted or offended doesn't grant you any special status to tell others they have to change. Just let people be who they want to be as long as it's not hurting and oppressive others. Why is this point so lost on this crowd? Why do I have to hammer this obvious point into your thick skull?

I got stuck near what I guessed was the end (and it was). It was where you have to get to Talia, who is taken by The Joker and all the snipers are around the area. Well I went over and tried to take some out and was taken out almost instantly. I did this about 5 times and I was getting frustrated - I couldn't even taken one guy out. So I thought that ""maybe I'm not suppose to take them out. So I tried sneaking into the movie theater, but was also taken out quickly. At this point, I gave up and look up a guide. 

Well at the time, there was only one guide on GameFAQ. The way the writer had it set up was by chapters and they were broken down in the key part of that chapter - totally the discretion of the writer. Anyway, I figured it was near the end and yep, it was the second-to-last chapter (Talia and Joker or something obvious like that). Well the first next (and last) chapter was called Clayface. Which made me go ""Hmmm..."" because up to this point, nothing has even been mentioned about him in the game. But my thought-process ended there. It didn't try to figure out why the last chapter was called Clayface. I just shrugged it off. 

So I finally take out the snipers and get inside. More plot is revealed. And in a very Saw-ish way, it's revealed that the health looking Joker was Clayface. It was at this point I went ""OHHHHHH!"" and everything clicked. ""Wow, I had ruined the game for myself and didn't even know it."" I'm usually quite good at picking up on this kind of stuff so I was a bit disappointed with myself that I let this one slip. But it was quite an awesome (the game) experience.

**TL;DR**: Gave away the ending of the game to myself but didn't know it. ","1320106553"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Sounds like he likes 3rd person stuff so I recommend Dead Space 1/2 firstly. Maybe Splinter Cell:Conviction.

I don't play a ton of 3rd person games though, as far as 1st person goes:

-Bioshock. Amazing atmosphere, great story, good fun.

-Half Life 2, if he doesn't mind a game that's a few years old (amazing story/characters/world though)

-I'm tempted to say MW2 or the upcoming MW3 if he likes ""cinematic"" stuff, as those games are full of very hollywood-esque set pieces.

-The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is coming out soon, which i am most excited for. If your dad likes open world stuff like RDD, he might like it, although it's much bigger and less directed (you kinda just do what you want, but the wonder of exploring the world is like none other). Basically there is main story/quest line, 4 factions (Theives guild, The Companions for fighters, The Dark Brotherhood for assassins, and the College of Winterhold for mages) which each have their own quest lines that are typically almost as long as the main story, and there are also tons of side quests that kinda stand alone. You can choose to do all, some, or none of these quests/quest lines whenever you want. Rarely are you ever forced in any direction and plenty of people play for hours just exploring/leveling/dungeon crawling/side questing before even touching the main quest or any factions. However, if your dad likes plot and story, they are certainly there for him to pursue.

-Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas. Same developers as Skyrim, so it's very open world and full of exploration, but they I think they are more accessible than The Elder Scrolls, as the world isn't so fantasy based and packed with tons of history and lore.","1320106553"

"masculism","t5_2rb6c","As for the number of actual rapes, I think it's closer to the 1 in 20 that was ""the norm"" before that infamous Ms. Magazine study (which, if you took out all the ""drunk rape"" findings and findings of rape where the women said they had not been raped, would have given, IIRC, a 1 in 23 or 24 figure.

The reason I would discount the findings with women who said they hadn't been raped is because there are two people involved in a rape, and the crime of rape depends on two states of mind--the victim's state of nonconsent (actus reus) and the perpetrator's (or a reasonable person's) awareness that the victim was not consenting (mens rea). Without mens rea, unwanted sex--even if it feels like rape--is not actually rape. It's unwanted sex. I honestly feel the women involved were in a better position to judge both their own state of mind and the man's than the survey takers were.

One of the best studies (though it has been criticized for its use of lie detectors) was Kanin's investigation of rape complaints over a decade in a small urban area. He found a 41% false rate, based on victim recantations either preceding an offer of polygraph testing, or after a failed polygraph. There is a lot of debate that polygraphs are unreliable, however, they are *quantifiably unreliable*. The most common figure I've seen placed on false findings is 85%--completely unreliable for use in determining truth on a single-case basis (which is why they are inadmissible as evidence in court), but a margin of error that can be accounted for over a larger test population. So it may be that 85% of that 41% are actually false. Not as high as 41%, but still nothing to sneeze at. 

And that makes sense, if one considers there are no barriers of shame or trauma involved in making a *false* claim of rape. False claims of rape are almost always made in order to solve a larger problem for the accuser than the accusation generates.

It's my belief that because of those barriers, and others, the majority of actual rapes go unreported. 

The one study (Lisak) that feminists seem unable to write off as not credible but had a higher finding than 2% was one that found 6% were false. However, the reports that study deemed false were those that were proven beyond a reasonable doubt as false--in other words, the false reports that would most likely result in convictions if the accusers were prosecuted. This left a huge percentage of ""unfounded or unprovable"" rapes that were thrown back in the pile of ""rapes that actually happened"". There's very little acknowledgement that if 6% of reported rapes result in conviction because it's hard to prove a rape, and 6% of false accusations would have led to convictions (and false accusations would likely be just as hard to prove), that it's as ridiculous to assume that the other 88% of reported rapes are all actual rapes as it is to assume they are all false.

But this is the highest number feminists will allow to be placed on the prevalence of false accusations--6% of absolutely, controvertibly verifiable-to-a-criminal-justice-standard reports. All the rest go back into the tally of actual rapes that actually occurred. 

You will find not a single MRA who will EVER claim that because only 6% of reports result in conviction, the other 94% of rape reports are false accusations. You will, however, find that the inverse is generally true among feminists.","1320106557"

Yes, the reason you should not choose the portfolio with the highest 3yr return is that past performance is not an indication of future performance. 

The only time you should concern yourself terribly with things like ""which fund has the highest 3yr return?"" is if you have a time machine and you plan to be investing 3 years ago.

What you want to really be looking at is which funds have the lowest fees and expense ratios, because those will eat your principle alive. Once you've found a set of funds with an appropriately low expense ratio, then pick a few that are broad-market indexes across a few different markets (say, one for bonds, one for national equities, one for international equities), and then invest in those.

You can't beat the market, but if you invest in the entire market you pretty much can't lose (at least in the long term).","1320106571"

Take a lesson from Existentialism.  You are responsible for your own happiness.  You cannot blame your unhappiness on anything including genes, disease, or any factors beyond your control.  Being bipolar is absurd but life is absurd in general.  We must deal with the angst that arises due to this absurdity and the way to deal with this angst is to derive your own meaning of what it means to be alive, and from this meaning, live out the life that circumstances have created.

I am choosing not to live my life via a meaning that is derived from my mental illness.  Instead, I search for another meaning that's going to make my existence fulfilling.  Take your medicine, but give up the label of being sick.","1320106578"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in Florida for spring break earlier this year. Four Lokos are still legal there, which are the paydirt blackouts-in-a-can which have been banned here in NY.

I have my sister's friend's I.D. It is fully authentic, and I look mostly like the picture, kind of. Being 20, I still look old enough, and most gas station attendants don't give two shits to question it. They just see an ID and accept.

So here in Florida, I grab 6 of these Four Lokos and some red gatorades to replace them with (cant drink on the beach), and head to the counter. The woman there stares at my ID incredulously for a long time. I can already tell where this is going.

She asks, ""Spell your last name.""

Fuck. My sister's friend has some 15 character Polish last name. I take a stab in the dark. I've never been quizzed on it before. I failed miserably.

She tells me, ""You're not getting this ID back.""

I pause, my heart drops. Fuck. She begins taking two of the cans, as it is all she can hold, and moves them over to the other part of the counter behind the register.

The counter is one of the super-high ones you sometimes see at sketchy inner-city gas stations. Her face must have been 3 feet higher than mine. The top of the counter was roughly eye level with me.

""Do you still want the Gatorade?"" she asks. She grabs another two cans and places them out of reach behind the register.

""No thanks,"" I reply. She grabs the last two cans, and as predicted, goes to place them by the others.

I vault the fuck up onto the counter and jump over. She screams. I grab my ID and jump back, and fucking bolt. *I fucking bolt*. Never have ran so hard so fast. She yelled something on the way out about calling the police.

My friend had been waiting outside the gas station for me to make the purchase. He sees me flying out of the doors empty-handed. I yell, ""RUN!""

He's a fucking derped dumbass. He asks, ""Why?"" I'm already across the parking lot. I repeat, ""JUST FUCKING RUN?! WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING ME?!""

He shrugged his shoulders and lightheartedly jogs. I left him behind. I did not get very far before cops were at the gas station, they were crawling all over the boardwalk area.

My friend nearly got caught and finally his sense kicked in and decided maybe this was an emergency. 

I love this story though. One great memory from this vacation. Later, on the beach we made some friends who bought us our drinks anyway.","1320106599"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;I don't know what I'm talking about?

Yep. You're talking about hypnosis. You haven't researched hypnosis and actually don't know what other people refer to when they say ""hypnosis"". In other words, you don't know what hypnosis is. 

It follows that you don't know what you're talking about. *Literally*.

&gt;Your entire profession is laughed at by the actual professionals.

*My profession* is engineering. I have degrees in engineering and physics. 

Someone close to me was suffering from depression, so I took it upon myself to figure out how depression works and *fix it*. At that point, ""hypnosis"" rang as much BS flags for me as it does for you, but my search ended up pointing me in the direction of hypnosis and I *changed my mind*.

The profession of *hypnotherapy* has plenty of people with credentials, but since you aren't listening, I won't present this further.

This is most likely the last response I'll give you, but I have some advice on how to deal with quacks and how to reason in general.

* If at any point someone claims that you're talking past each other. *shut up and listen*. Figure out what is *actually* being claimed.

* Pay attention to how much evidence is required to change your beliefs, and how much you're willing to count it. Sometimes it makes sense to say ""I can't be bothered with your details"", but be honest about it. That way you don't look like a douche, and if it turns out to be something where you should count the evidence, you can notice that.

* Decide whether you're attempting to make them look foolish or convince them and choose your strategy based on that. If you want to make them look foolish, state the strongest arguments against their position and do it kindly so as not to look like a douche. If you want to actually have a discussion, start all the way back where you agree and then find out at which point you part ways. *That* is where you have to argue if you want to make progress.

* Avoiding your ""opponent's"" strong points leaves you unable to notice when they should be taken seriously. You should be capable of responding to their *strongest* points.

* Even when you know your ""opponent"" is wrong, at least *notice* if they're being coherent and making better points than you would have expected a priori.

Had a girlfriend senior year in high school.  Completely no sex with her.  Long story short, she was a relative nut and things grew sour between us.  We had a mutual friend who was known to do shit to fuck with people.  Anyway, this friend decided to get my girlfriend psyched about breaking up with me.  She did so on my graduation day.  Honestly felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.    
    
Fast forward to that night.  Graduated, went out with a few friends (all female), dropped off two of them, and the last one was telling me she wanted to fuck badly.  The last one was the friend who broke up my girlfriend and I.  It clicked that she pulled that shit just to sleep with me, but after realizing she wasn't joking, we rented a motel room and fucked.    
Not very good sex to be honest, but at least I got sex which I wouldn't have with my frigid bitch ex.    
On a side note, nothing else happened between us.  She denied the whole thing even happened afterward and I moved on happily enough.  Don't need to stay with a back stabbing bitch like that anyway.","1320106607"

I take it you are not familiar with reading them. If you have issues with those citations, you have issues with the authors of the paper you provided as evidence of your position. Here is a hint - quote marks tend to delineate where a quote begins and ends. 

This makes me suspect you still haven't gone and read this paper yet. It was obvious you hadn't when you first raised it. YOUR AUTHORS are making the statements you seem to be attributing to me. I don't think I can make it clearer than that.

I'd ask you which of those studies in particular you have issues with, but you haven't read any of those either I am willing to bet, just as you had only read a masculinist blog and not the paper you so dramatically misinterpreted. But I have no wish to go further down the rabbit hole with you.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Okay, I've move the loop asking the user to play the game again outside of playGame and into main. I've also moved the logic for maintaining the win/loss counts into main as well. 

The issue I am now running into is that when the user enters Y to play again the program won't start the craps game again. Any ideas?
***************************************************



#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

/*
Write a program that simulates the game of craps, which is played with two dice.
On the first roll, the player wins if the sum of the dice is 7 or 11. The player loses if the sum is 2, 3,
or 12. Any other roll is called the ""point"" and the game continues. On each subsequent roll, the player wins
if he or she rolls the point again. The player loses by rolling 7. Any other roll is ignored and the game
continues. At the end of each game, the program will ask the user whether or not to play the game again.
When the user enters a response other than y or Y, the program will display the number of wins and losses and then
terminate.

You rolled: 8
Your point is 8
You rolled: 3
You rolled: 10
You rolled: 8
You win!

Play Again? y

You rolled: 6
Your point is 6
You rolled: 5
You rolled: 12
You rolled: 3
You rolled: 7
You Lose!

Play Again? y

You rolled: 11
You win!

Play Again? n

Wins: 2 Losses: 1

Write your program as three functions: main, rollDice, and playGame. Here are
the prototypes for the latter of two functions:

int roll_dice(void);
bool play_game(void);

rollDice should generate two random numbers, each between 1 and 6, and return their
sum. playGame should play one craps game(calling rollDice to determine the outcome of
each dice roll); it will return true if the player wins and false if the player loses.
playGame is also responsible for displaying messages showing the results of the player's
dice rolls. main will call play_game repeatedly, keeping track of the number of wins and
losses and displaying the ""you win"" and ""you lose"" messages.

Hint: Use the rand function to generate random numbers. See the deal.c program for an
example of how to call rand and the related srand function.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","I've given this some thought, and my theory is that they just don't *need* the niche specialist market anymore.  A decade or so ago, it was the only thing keeping them going: having at least some market dominance or leadership in graphics, publishing, video etc.

These days Apple is predominantly a consumer company, and its former main market probably only represents a tiny bit of its business.  The Apple eco-system is well established among consumers.

Today we no longer have a ""trickle down"" technology economy, we have a ""trickle up"" consumer economy, where consumer devices now influence higher end products.  Plus a lot of former professional creative services have been predominantly consumerised:  we all take our own photos and videos these days, we edit them ourselves and publish them on YouTube, we make our own music and put it up on SoundCloud.  Wedding photographers and videographers are pretty much the blacksmiths and thatchers of the 21st century creative economy.

All this I think spells ""what's the point?"" for the higher end products.  If you're a major Hollywood animation studio, you would probably invest in a system that is so customised that it possibly doesn't make much difference whether it's built of Mac or Linux or hackintosh or whatever.  Large scale video operations such as TV networks rarely if ever use Macs en masse: they're too expensive - they don't *need* such powerful machines for basic desktop editing/""online newsrooms"".

I also think Apple actually took a look at the video industry, and recognised that it isn't cost effective for the vast majority of content to edit things in the ""old way"" any more.  It's much more about pushing stuff out quickly and efficiently.  That's why FCPX may end up being perceived as more clever than at its initial reception.

So while I don't know enough about music to be as certain about Logic X, I would still say there is a very good chance that it will be ""dumbed down"" as FCPX has been.

Things change, and you can decide to stay, or leave. I'm leaving for Debian, and Xfce. It takes a bit more tweaking to get what I want, but I've been tweaking Ubuntu more and more lately, so it isn't much of a difference.

I wish Ubuntu well. While it doesn't click for me anymore, it very well may for other people. The market will decide whether the changes work or not, and other developers can use the ideas that do work, or at least learn from the ones that don't.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;But really, there isn't enough work that needs to be done for everyone of working age to stay busy for 40 hours a week.

People like to talk shit on the OWS movement because the protesters should just ""work harder"" / ""get a job"" / whatever else. These people fail to see that the capitalist system we are in right now doesn't *need* any more jobs. The people who should theoretically create jobs so they could get more money, now can just get more money without creating more jobs. But, of course, criticizing capitalism or saying a more socialist policy might work better necessarily means you hate 'Murica and freedom. 

&gt;So every time we increase productivity somewhere, we have to come up with new busy-work for people to do, or we have to resist that productivity increase like Luddites

The counter-argument is that those displaced workers will find new work in new industries. For example, a machine that displaces farm workers needs workers to build it, so the farm workers can work in the machine-building industry. The problem with this argument is that it assumes the amount of workers displaced will equal the amount of jobs created. I haven't seen that assumption supported, and it seems untrue to me. Workers that are displaced by technological innovations can work in the industry that supports the new technology, but that industry will already be more technologically advanced than the industry they were pushed out of. Therefore, it won't need as many workers. ","1320106635"

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Apologies it was amusing that you chose a non-BBC channel that actually was connected to the BBC :)  not meant to be a dig in fact I only found out about that relationship the other day.  I suppose technically though as it is owned by BBC Worldwide it is a normal commercial station and does not get funding from the license fee.

Anyhoo I am not anti-BBC or license fee to a point but I am semi-hypocritical as I have not had a TV for over 10 years but love radio 4 (no I don't watch the iPlayer as I think it would be taking the piss) and to be perfectly honest if TV licensing had not spent the last 10 years causing me shit and hassle I would have bought a license just for radio 4 (hence hypocrisy but there is no radio license anymore) but when I heard and read Capita's press releases over their ""pursuit"" of non-license holders and having being on the receiving end of literature that is bordering on threatening I decided that even though I like the BBC I did not want to appear on a Capita spreadsheet in the ""win"" column or in effect support their tactics. For me, it is not a financial point but a moral point over ethical behavior.

Also as this is a legislated revenue collection I don't think it is appropriate for a private company to be making money from it.    Unless it has changed recently then you used to pay more by direct debit (added up) than an outright fee and when this was questioned on Feedback the TV licensing representative said that you were charged for the year and you paid more by direct debit as you were paying the interest on your whole year debt.

TLDR:  No TV here, would pay anyway, not with current payment structure.","1320106636"

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","Look, it was a only a question. I have never lived/worked in a place where an employer could legitimately fire you because you have a beard or a piercing or whatever and it struck me. They still do it, but if an ex-employee sues, the employer loses. And people often don't know that because they don't know their rights. I was trying to tell you that you could do it even if your employer doesn't agree (after all, a clean and maintained beard doesn't project any negative image) but I forgot about jurisdictional differences it seems.

I never defended such theory that employers should give much to employees because of its relative wealth. I don't agree with that. These laws are about the fact that, even if an employer can legitimately decide to project a certain image by imposing some norms (like a uniform and an obligation to look clean, for instance), these norms can't dictate the rest of your life as you normally spend only about 1/3 of your life at your job and have the right to do whatever you want outside the office. And while I tend to agree with this reasoning (probably because it's been the law for a long time and laws tend to reflect a society's opinion), it wasn't even the point. It was just a question.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;likely

these are all terms associated with things that are not clearly defined and are flexible, and you seem to use them a lot. You say that one group or another USUALLY has a tendency to do this or that, but **why** does that mean that they should? if a woman is capable of being a lumberjack, why the fuck shouldn't she? Likewise, if a man is capable of being a master chef [and for fuck's sake, THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM], why the fuck shouldn't he? 

and seriously, how does this

&gt;The way our brains and bodies are wired to develop are barely different from a few thousand years ago, and not that much at all from earlier eras. I think it hurts us as a culture to pretend we are all carbon copies of some androgynous human, and that we can't smartly and effectively divide labor, especially in the context of a household. I'm not saying it should be law, some girls grew up around mechanics and know cars really well, maybe some guys mother had a sewing company and he's awesome at sewing, but I feel we're being less effective today as people will shun tasks they would be suited to or take on tasks that they wouldn't be just to prove a point.

Friends of mine back in the day used to play what they called ""ask a mexican"", stand out said and say cerveza until someone does the deed. This time though, some random black guy came over and said if we drove him over to buy some weed, he would do the deed. 

We pull up to the place, a rough area in elgin, and he gives my buddy, Lee, 20 bucks and tells him not to talk to any one or give the money anyone but him and he goes inside. Another car pulls up one spot away and starts asking questions about what were looking for. Lee gets out starts talking to him and gives him the money. And then asks for the weed, dude in the car starts screaming about us being with the ""po leece"" and to ""fuck off"" while he pulls away with the money. 

Dude comes outside and starts going off about why he gave away the money, going on about ""stupid white boy"". Ends up buying them a 30 pack of Red Dog beer. ","1320106644"

This measurement if always conserved. If system A and B interact to form A' and B', then A+B=A'+B'. The change of energy of both A and B is always zero even if energy was transferred between them.

Of note, you're going to get lots of answers to this, because frankly energy is pretty poorly defined and current definitions are fairly ad hoc or tautological. However this is more a failure of human language than anything else.

Rush is great because the goal and the method to achieve them is clear. The 2 MCOMs are your only objectives. Destroy/Defend them and win, lose otherwise. Overwhelm with force or be sneaky.

Conquest though, takes added depth. Flanking isn't limited to right path, left path, or up the middle. Flanking can mean going beyond the enemy points to capture a back flag. Decisions extend beyond just ""Attack/Defend this"". SL's have to make decisions. What's more helpful to my team... defending this flag or capturing another flag? You have more objectives, and thus more ways of winning. Even prioritizing flags can make the difference: do we go for A, which is close to the enemy base but has a tank, or go for B which has no vehicles but an elevation advantage? One good squad can't win the round, your team overall has to be better than your enemy's.","1320106648"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Hey I actually just read a theory for this.  In Richard Dawkins' book ""The Selfish Gene"" he puts forth this theory:

At some point after sexual reproduction began but before the genders had formed, each organism would perform meiosis and create a sex cell with half the chromosomes.  Any two of these organisms could reproduce by having two sex cells join each other.

Organisms which equipped their sex cells with a greater supply of nutrients began to arise as it gave their offspring a greater advantage early on and allowed them a greater chance of survival.  This phenomenon gave rise to sex cells getting bigger and bigger as they competed to make their offspring better.  This then gave rise to a new archetype of a ""greedy"" type sex cell.  By spending a signficantly less amount of resources on each sex cell, but instead creating a large number, an organism could gain the advantage of quick sex cells capable of high mobility and the ability to find and merge with the larger sex cell archetype.  Each of the two strategies began to significantly outperform ""standard"" sex cells and so they were pushed out of the gene pool.  Taken to an extreme over a large enough amount of time, we end with eggs and sperms - the most significant differentiator between genders.","1320106651"

Are you claiming that the fact that they did something good somehow validate their religious ideas? If so, I'm afraid I don't understand this line of reasoning.

Reductio Ad Absurdum is a [legitimate philosophical criticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) of a position. It says ""when I follow your logic to its reasonable conclusion, I end up with a logical contradiction (an absurdity)"". It seems that you know the name of the machine, but not how it works.

Well; good news. You can read an ancient version of the bible in the original greek (see the codex sinaiticus) . Go cross-reference the contradictions I provided with that pre-english version. I'll wait...

You don't even understand your own religion's history. The whole problem with christianity is that there *are* ancient versions of it, which contain all the inconsistencies and problems in the contemporary translations. Even more damning, we have contemporaneous accounts from the period that don't mention anything supposedly happening at the time.  You are somehow arguing that the contradictions in the bible make it believable? That doesn't even make sense. Who is this omnipotent being who can't manage to manage his spin correctly?

&gt; right about everything

I'm glad you brought that up, because it's the brilliance of the scientific method: we **aren't** right about everything. But we're going to be right about more tomorrow than we are today if we follow the scientific method. When you practice science, you monotonically increase your understanding of the universe. That was exactly my original point: destroy all scientific understanding, and you will eventually return to exactly where we are now. Destroy all religions, and you will never again hear about a jewish zombie who was his own father and can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master.

Another big epiphany I had when I deconverted: billions of people have a conviction that equaled the faith I had in jesus christ. Yet they believed in allah (or judaism; or whatever). So one of two things must be true by necessity: either they are somehow less faithful, or faith is inadequate to guide us. It's obvious to me that the latter is the case.

And after all this discussion, you have yet to offer a single argument for the existence of god. What are you waiting for?","1320106666"

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","* In GNOME 2, you only need one click on the corresponding workspace to immediately switch to it. In Unity, you need one click on the workspaces icon, then doubleclick on the corresponding workspace.
* In GNOME 2, you had shortcuts to specific workspaces (I had Alt+1/2/3/4/etc bound). It appears to be broken in Unity and GNOME 3 in 11.10 (I'm currently trying to understand what's really going on to file a bug, as it doesn't seem that it was done on purpose - even though the only documented shortcuts for both environments is ctrl+alt+arrows and nothing else)
* In GNOME 2, you could easily move a window to a specific workspace when right-clicking on its titlebar... even if the window was maximised. Now, you need to use the keyboard shortcut, or open the workspaces view (see previous point) or un-maximise it to be able to right click on the titlebar.

These are the main reasons why I dislike both GNOME 3 and Unity. There are workarounds for these issues, but it's annoying that these issues exist to begin with, since it used to work fine with GNOME 2.","1320106668"

I was able to do 182 FSB x 20 on the uncore for the longest time. For reference, it's recommend you do at least 2x whatever your RAM multiplier is set to (mine's at 8x).

So now I am getting random restarts, and the occasional CPU related BSOD error. I tried bumping up the QPI/Vtt vcore without success.

Then I lowered the multiplier to 17x, and enabled the ""enhanced vdroop"" and so far so good. No more crashes for now.

In any case, with the i7 920, and 3 channels of DDR with 6 sticks, it takes quite a bit of voltage to make it stable. It's possible I've damaged it with time and heat.

So I spent a little time at the grocery store today.  I came home and started cooking.  Over the course of today and tomorrow, I will have made:
Crab and Clam Chowder
Chicken Tortilla Soup
Chicken Enchiladas
Macaroni and Cheese (side of ratatouille)
Creamy Corn Chowder
Baked Potato Soup
Chili
Beef Stew

Between them all, I'll have made 70 single serve dishes.  What we don't eat for dinner over the next few days will be packaged up and put into the freezer, where it will make quick and easy lunches for the next two-three months (my husband doesn't eat left overs, but Mom and I do).  

All told, with a side salad, it comes out to about $2-2.50 a meal.  I know that's high for most of the people here, but for me, it's worth it - I use good quality ingredients and imo, the food tastes fantastic. Plus now I won't be in a situation of being hungry with nothing good to eat (I love having a lot of variety).  

I used a few short cuts - packaged crab from the butcher, a whole roasted chicken, and chicken bullion to supplement the homemade stock I had on hand.

Anyway, I hope that helps.  Devoting a day to cooking takes a lot, but for me, it's really, really worth it.

Like I said, the problem is that the distinction is becoming so obscure.  I have my own problem accepting certain music as jazz myself too. For example Becca Stevens' music sounds like folk pop to me and not jazz, (and you'll probably agree with considering what you just wrote), and yet her CDs are reviewed in allaboutjazz.com and she somewhat falls under the jazz umbrella.

http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/musician.php?id=25792

Also, when I listen to Taylor Eigsti's album (With Becca Stevens on vocals), I wonder just how much of it is pop and jazz.. because to me, it's leaning more on the pop side than jazz in it's focus.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ktfwLMivUw&amp;feature=related

Considering that the debate about what is/isn't jazz has been going on throughout history, and people like Wynton Marsallis said ""post-1965 avant-garde playing to be outside of jazz""  I feel like I should have more liberal view on what jazz is, and ultimately let history and consensus decide... and I have a feeling that the consensus and perception of jazz is going to change rapidly in our generation.","1320106680"

I only say this because I actually went through a period of my life where I considered killing myself, and if some radfem cunt like this one told me I'd be doing the world a favor by killing myself, I probably wouldn't be here today. The types of stuff that these sick fucks are allowed to get away with sicken me, and I can only imagine how many young men, especially boys, end up becoming traumatized by this type of stuff.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I like working on high-level stuff.  I like being able to make applications quickly and easily that are useful at doing comparatively complex things, like viewing a webpage or a PDF or controlling my media center.

I also enjoy doing low-level stuff -- I like finding the fastest way to do a particular thing, like calculate the intersection of two arrays.  And then I like putting that in a function and forgetting about it so that I can get back to doing the high level stuff.

I love regular expressions, interfacing with relational databases, being able to easily append new objects onto arrays.  I like being able to parse JSON, XML, and so forth by transforming it into a DOM or similar structure and just flying through it to extract what I need.  I like being able to make a useful and compliant UI that won't confound or frustrate users with a minimum of actual UI work, so I can concentrate on adding important features.  I like writing as little code as possible, because it means I'm less likely to make mistakes and will have more time to fix the mistakes I make, and less will need to be changed to deal with changes, new technologies, or to add or remove features.

I like being able to concentrate on high-level structure.  I can make several classes, subclass appropriately, add in the appropriate polymorphisms to create a stable, extensible, and readable system that ends up being a genuine joy to maintain.  I love being able to write functions/class methods that are just wrappers around a few lines of code but that, thanks to the emergent nature of our business, can be reused by many other methods, yielding a readable and, again, maintainable system.

I don't feel that using frameworks/libraries stifles my creativity.  I try to express my creativity through creating features (even if they're not *ex nihilo* -- and, let's face it, very few ideas in CS are in *nihilo* anymore) and making them available to end users in a way that's intuitive, sensible, useful, attractive... I don't care about doing things my way, or doing things the right way, because ultimately software is e*valu*ated -- there's a value judgment, and if every user thinks I wrote a piece of shit, well, I wrote a piece of shit.

I sometimes dream about writing my own programming language, rewriting my little hobby stack machine to make it a grownup VM like Java's, maybe making a complete development environment that manages to combine functional programming with Object-Oriented languages/design methodologies [if you have any idea how to do this, let me know].  But then I think about C, and Scheme, and Python, and Haskell, and I think... you know, there's no real need for me to do this.  

But there are a lot of end users with dreams of solving some of their problems with software, and so that's what I try to do.  Ideally, I'll invent a thing or two that people don't even know they need :)  And I'll be able to do that a lot easier, and with a lot less pain to both me and my user base, with the wealth of existing feature-rich and time-tested code out there.

This is just one man's opinion, but I've seen it quite a bit where teams run or throw to the backup when the defense isn't expecting it.

Top 2:
McCoy
AP

afterwards comes, Fred Jackson in a close 3rd then McFadden when healthy and Forte.

Honestly AP is probably the best runner of the bunch, but when you take into account Fred Jackson and McCoy's ability to block/catch out of the backfield, it's pretty close.

The thing that I have to say about McCoy and Peterson that separate them from the rest is that, they really have the ability to create something out of nothing.  Peterson does this by being so much more physically gifted than anyone on the field, and McCoy has probably the best moves I've seen since Barry Sanders, defenders are so worried about bringing him down, that they never really seem to hit him hard(have you seen how he runs with the ball out away from his body, swinging it like a baseball or something? yet he doesn't fumble the ball)

The only knack I can see people having about McCoy is that he isn't as much of a goal line back as the other 4, but if you look closely he actually has scored more than anyone else.  I mean, the man has scored 10 touchdowns in 7 games, yet isn't getting any recognition.","1320106705"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I'm thinking the easiest (easy being VERY relative here) way to do this from a programming standpoint would be to pull EXTREMELY highres topographical data (i.e. from satellites) and then use that information to generate a 3D map. You already have paths for all of the drivable roads across your 3D maps from google, and you could probably analyze albedos to refine that data on your 3D model of the world. From there, you'd need to texture everything which would be an unimaginable amount of work - you have the streetviews which you can try to map to buildings, but the result wouldn't be too pretty. Either way you're talking huge amounts of work and huge amounts of graphical files and data to crunch through, there's nothing saying this isn't feasable though.

I know there's crude things out there already like [this](http://geoquake.jp/en/webgame/DrivingSimulatorGM/) and [this](http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/2010/05/drive_the_a-team_van_in_google_eart.html), and google already has [3D modeled nearly all of new york city](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k2_HHrk8Y8) iirc.

Those stories are the foundation of the faith, not the stories people wrote about a hundred years before or after Jesus.

You can deny it all you want, but until you find a Native American who can trace their DNA to Israel, Mormonism looks like a hoax. [Here's one of the most recent studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2762527/?tool=pmcentrez)

Not to mention, you can also **disprove** with the Book of Abraham. Egyptologists have examined the text and found that there is ZERO similarities with what Joseph Smith wrote. NONE. It's nothing more than a common funeral text. His description of the fascimilies was also completely, 100% wrong. Moreover, they've carbon dated the document to the 1st century A.D.-- which is like 1,000 years after Abraham would have lived. And if that isn't enough, the text is littered with numerous anachronisms.  Everywhere you turn, it shows the text is a fraud. 

Moreover, there's TONS of anachronisms all throughout the Book of Mormon. Not only does it have tons of stuff we KNOW did not exist on the continent before Columbus, but it also lacks all the content/characteristics that SHOULD be there. And remember, this supposedly is ""the most accurate book in the world"", lol. There's also tons of plagiarisms, linguistic errors, extremely repetitive text/concepts, laughable errors, etc.  But mostly, Smith tried too hard to make the Book of Mormon sound like the KJV, and it came off poorly.  If I may quote Mark Twain on the Book of Mormon:

*The book seems to be merely a prosy detail of imaginary history, with the Old Testament for a model; followed by a tedious plagiarism of the New Testament.  The author labored to give his words and phrases the quaint, old-fashioned sound and structure of our King James's translation of the Scriptures; and the result is a mongrel--half modern glibness, and half ancient simplicity and gravity.  The latter is awkward and constrained; the former natural, but grotesque by the contrast.  Whenever he found his speech growing too modern--which was about every sentence or twoâhe ladled in a few such Scriptural phrases as ""exceeding sore,"" ""and it came to pass,"" etc., and made things satisfactory again.  ""And it came to pass"" was his pet.  If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet.*

Let's also not forget that Joseph Smith, the Prophet, was conned into believed the Kinderhook Plates were authentic, that he a con artist who took money in a scheme known as glass looking (and was actually arrested, charged before the State of New York, and found guilty), and that he polygamous who was married to a 14 year old girl and numerous other women who were already married. 

So no, Mormonism isn't like mainstream Christianity. It isn't just faith. It can be disproven, and it can be ripped apart.","1320106729"

She's equally likely to be an 'entitled bitch' as a she is to be a reasonable, hard-working person, with a spouse who would find this hilarious.  *With no evidence in either direction, you went with 'entitled bitch'.*  That's called ""bias"".

Not knowing anything about you, I don't know whether your bias is against people in general (that you assume all people are crappy; would you assume a guy who did something like this an asshole?), or women in particular.  I do know that the general tone of reddit is sexist.  Commenters were quick to judge this poster (she's lazy, entitled, etc) in a way that I just don't see when guys post comparable material.  

I can't speak for the person who posted your comment to SRS, or the mods, since I'm not involved in this subreddit (though I agree with it's stance and most of the posts), but I was really irritated by your comment because it's just another ""women be bitches"" snark.

Sort of. The Leopold is the ""update"" to the Filco, designed by the person who first designed the Filco. Filco is Japanese, Leopold is South Korean.

&gt; The Leopold has nicer key caps

Only in that it doesn't have the terrible coating Filcos had until the MT2.

&gt; but the Filco's insides are much nicer.

Nope, the only really noticeable difference is that the few stabilized keys on the Leopold are stabilized differently - it's less snappy, but not in any bad way. And, if anything, the Leopold is supposed to have a better PCB design. The Leopold looks better than the Filco by far - this coming from someone with both. No annoying logo, caps lock/scroll lock lights streamlined under the keycaps so there're no ugly lights underneath the top right row of keys. I have replaced all my keycaps with engraved PBS ones, and the Leopold looks much better.

&gt; Most of the users on geekhack (forum devoted to keyboard enthusiasts) prefer Filco.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No throwaways as I hardly post to begin with. So here goes my tale of how in one night I was the happiest man on God's good earth (because all the craziest and most carnal desires of mine became a reality). As I go through this tale of debauchery...you'll figure out all the stuff I had always wanted to try.

Some time ago I get an email from one of my old buddies. This guy, we'll call him Ken, is my blood brother. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. Although I haven't see this dude physically in years we have kept in touch.

My email from Ken states that he is coming home. He had been serving a few tours overseas and this time he would hit me up for some overdue partying. As he put it, he wanted to stop by my place before going home to see me and to ""get some sand out of his ass, dust off his dick, and destroy every woman with a functional vagina in a 10 mile radius"". His TL;DR was that he needed to get laid after this deployment.

To sum up a happy reunion, and him sleeping for two days on my couch, we were ready to hit the town. We were dressed slick, tons of cash to blow, and a whole town of bars and drunks chick to go viking on.

We hop from club to club. We are getting hammered and drinking everything behind the bars. Me and him even pick up a few chicks here and there with our bar hopping and get down to business in back alleys, restrooms, stranger's cars, and Ken even did it on a dance floor.

The night was going great and aforementioned activities of drinking bottles dry and fucking chicks til they were cross eyed went on for a few hours.

As the night went on we decided to cool our jets and head to a strip club. Word from another person I know said the a-list performed at this one club at the exact day and moment we got there. So why not check it out.

It was a fucking blast. Boobs everywhere and in our faces, asses grinding all up on us, and a number of ""special treatments"" were given up to us because my buddy the war hero. He didn't have to say shit, his Globe and Anchor tat and a number of his easily viewable scars had ladies melting in his fingers. However, as time passed they stopped serving alcohol and the dancing died down. we got ready to head home but were too drunk to drive and decided to keep drinking in the strip club parking lot and then we'd sleep it off in the car.

At that time these three ladies came out into the parking lot. The same ladies that had stuck like glue to us in the club. A bit of flirty lovey-dovey talk and they were driving us, in my car, to their place  for a surprise. We really hoped for sex (with them) because we were too drunk to do anything else. This was when shit got real.

When we get there my buddy wanders off with a girl wrapped around each arm upstairs. Moments later all I hear are ""OHHH YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHH"", moaning, and this pounding sound that I thought was furniture breaking. As well as grunting sounds as I'm sure my buddy was trying to keep pace despite all the drinking he'd done.

I on the other hand go up stairs with this knock-out bombshell who looks like Selina Kyle (Catwoman) from Batman. I have always though of that character as one of the hottest (although fictional) chicks of all time. Now, I would score with a look alike (1). This was one fantasy I had always hoped for. One that got an even bigger bonus when I told her and she went and put on this latex catsuit and all the trimmings (2). So here I am lying in this soft, and very comfortable bed with a chick that looks like a sexy comic book character with this drop-dead latex out fit on. My life could not get any better. Well, it did, and it also got kind of crazy.

I found out she worked part time as a Dominatrix (3) and was into BDSM in her personal life (4). She said she mostly worked on women but she liked me enough and I was drunk enough to only say ""Sweet"". So we started making out and thing got rough. She was biting and clawing a bit and would try to pin me down. Then she unzipped this piece of her outfit so her goods were exposed, then she did mine and we did the business.

Minutes go by and she says she wants to go freshen up and that she'll be back. She is in the bathroom with the door closed and I am laying partially naked and dazed on her comfortable-ass bed (seriously...I think it was made from hunted angels and happy thoughts at this point). Then this chick comes in with a bag of mcdonalds. She is just in lingerie and I swear she had the most beautiful black skin I had ever seen, it was like chocolate pudding from Jell-O. No joke...I wanted to lick her to see if there was flavor.

She just sets down the bag after giving off a slightly surprised expression ans says who the food is for. The name she said wasn't the one with whom I had been in bed with. Perhaps I just knew a stage name, a fake name, and now her real name. Whatever.

A few moments go by and my lovely lady, who I will just call Selina now, comes out with another risque dominatrix outfit holding a leash with a girl collared on the other hand. This chick is on her knees and elbows with a leater-ish blindfold and a gag in her mouth. my jaw drops at this point onto the ridiculously comfy bed.

She tells me that this ""pet"" is one her girlfriends who loves being a submissive bitch who dislikes being with men unless she is helpless against them (5?). I sober up really quick. I am turned on and confused out of my mind. Behind her I can see her walk-in closet and a dog kennel, I see a bag of mcdonalds for someone I do not know. Holy Shit! This chick, Selina, kept another chick who is her girlfriend in a kennel with jell-o pudding girl to keep an eye on her (6?) *my drunk brain rationalizing. I had a moment of ""the fuck"" followed by ""HAWT"".

so to sum up the rest of the night it went a little like this:
-Selina takes the mcdonalds food and feeds it to her pet (by chewing it up first and spitting it into her mouth. she did this with soda as well by swishing the soda and not chewing on it).
-Pet is made to walk around while prodded with this electrical rod and a horse crop thing.
-Selina starts 69-ing me and pet licks my dick and anus (weird but really felt good)
-Pet gets slapped around, spanked, as well as other punishments.
-Selina uses all these vibrator and butt plug things on the girl. I get to do this too...It was strange and satisfying to do it I'll admit.
-Jell-O girl comes back and joins in by facesitting on pet (seriously, as I think back, I never learned that girls name).
-Jell-O and Selina take strap-ons and uses pet like a rip saw between them. This chick is getting throat fucked and then with a push ass fucked back and forth. back and forth. While I watch a squeeze a few off.
-Pet is then made to clean up my cum. That chick licked it up like a dog eating peanut butter.
-Selina gives me hand jobs and does that prostate thing to where I cum on pets open-mouth face.
-Pet is tied up and I give her the business in her throat, ass, and pussy (this was really awkward...as there was some weird thing going on in my head about ""is this cool?"" and ""is this really consensual?"").
-Pet takes and licks my discarded shoes clean. The same shoes I had been in all fucking night.
-Jell-O continues to torture pet by pulling on her nipples and pussy lips (I don't know the proper term for that body) with clamps hooked to chains).
***Throughout this whole thing, half the time this chick is either crying or just taking it alongside a lot of verbal abuse. It was crazy.
-Tons of other things happen that were just...WOW.
-Last but not least was the Coup De Grace. Jell-O was on her back on the bed with her strap on in pets ass. I was on top of pet with my dick in her pussy (i also had these ring things on that I never knew existed but felt really good), and Selina was behind me with a strap on. This had me worried for a bit but with all that prostate stuff I was down. Then, I had this remote for butt plugs that were in Selina and Jell-O. The higher the voltage, the wilder the pounding went for everyone.

Jell-O would spasm out and just go to town on Pets ass and having that done to me by Selina I went crazy on Pets kitty. It was just this crazy gang-bang and I was the only dude. I swear to god I must have been grinning ear to ear when I was rocking back and forth like crazy from Selina in my rear and getting into Pet from the front.

*This is interaction is fantasy 7-1000 completed. Threesome, foursome, gangbanging, more bdsm stuff, anonymous sex, among others.

The next day I wake up with Selina on my arm. She has on some of her sexy outfit still on and I just admire the view, especially her piercings (1001). Jell-O is on my other side pretty much all over me. Then there is pet at our feet balled up on top of the covers...still wearing these shackle things and her blindfold(1002) (as I think back i never saw her eyes).

I had the greatest smile on my face because I had lived like a rock star.

TL;DR: In one night I was part of a foursome that did a lot of crazy BDSM stuff. It was great. Also, I got to bang a chick that looked like Selina Kyle from the Batman comics by DC.","1320106746"

"politics","t5_2cneq","There are almost twice the number of white people below the poverty line as black people in the US. Using the numbers found on Wikipedia, there are about 9.6 million black Americans below the poverty line and 19.2 million white Americans below the poverty line. So, if ""irrespective of race, [poor areas] have an increase in violence"" then whites would be committing violence at a race twice that of blacks. So either we are catching all the black criminals and ignoring all the white ones, or there is something systemically wrong with black culture in America.

Much, much, much higher violent crime as well.

I mean, MUCH MUCH MUCH higher. To the magntitude of 12.6% of the population committing ~60% of all violent crime. Meanwhile south and north dakota represent basically the top 10 poorest areas of the united states, are majority white, and have no crime rates to speak of when compared to similar black communities.

If blacks were not committing more violent crimes they would not see such ""dramatically"" higher conviction rates. Racism may account for a longer incarceration, policy brutality etc... but it cannot just magically conjure up victims that have been raped, robbed, and murdered.

The only places where it's legal in the US to smoke on the job are in rural areas in states that have no state-wide indoor workplace smoking ban laws. 

And there are very few states these days that have no state-wide smoking ban. The ones that do often leave it to localites to decide, most of which forbid smoking indoors at work.

Even within those localities that do allow smoking, company policies ban it. And those company policies can be strict -- some even ban it outdoors on their grounds and/or ban smokers from being hired.

Our graduates are incredible individuals!

It is a great program, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, but our students definitely start out beyond rough around the edges.  Some have been taught by family and friends not just how to steal, but how to be very good at stealing.  It takes time to help students change their ways, especially if it is the one area they feel they are talented.

No need for you to instigate this ""I know it better and let everyone know by asking calculating questions"" farce. OP made it clear what his understanding of a real amp is and obviously he wants the flexibility and the effects and thus his POD was the right choice for him. There is nothing here for you to question.

And he didn't say anything about needing an amp to gig let alone play paying gigs without a PA system. The POD HD does just fine and if you get into any of these situations, you are not stuck for options: you can add your own speakers to it and you are good to go and you will still be very flexible in terms of sounds and have less junk to carry around. This is also why the AxeFX is so popular amongst quite a few touring pros and lots of semi-pro players who just need a lot of different sounds.

&gt; outstandingly good amp for $500

This is an absolutely ridiculous claim and your understanding of ""outstandingly good"" is probably a hybrid Crate combo because you don't get any serious, high quality tube amps new at that price and that is still FAAAR from ""outstanding"". And even used is going to be a big stretch. And then you don't have even a tenth of the options and flexibility available. And Watts have little to do with the price of high quality guitar amps.

Having a consistent set of rules is vital for any competition to be taken seriously.  Otherwise, the outcome of the competition seems _arbitrary_ and subject to the whims of the organizers.  

The general lack of concern for rules and for punishment of transgressions is evidence that the organizers did not really care to have the tournament taken seriously.  This is incredibly unfair to the players involved, many of whom have staked their livelihoods to the success of LoL as an eSport.

Why bother sinking hours and hours into practice if a tournament organizer is going to arbitrarily rule against you?  Why follow rules if breaking them is not punished?

And I don't think you understand how probability works. Occam's razor isn't just something that can be helpful at times and at other times ignored, it's a mathematical theorem that each additional complication to a story makes it less likely. Of course it doesn't affect reality, but it is vital to *our understanding* of reality. And the fact that anyone is choosing an explanation other than the most likely one is a serious red flag, that simply isn't how it works. Also, the number of eyewitnesses who left accounts for us to read is *at most* 5, if we ignore the fact that some of the gospels probably had a common source and that Paul probably didn't actually see anything.

If you just had 100 people figure out how we should deal with unemployment, then they can ask for the help of the 1,000 people who have been observing the discussion for their ideas towards how to implement that solution and then take action.

It doesn't excuse it but maybe I could understand if you said you were in Texas at some NASCAR themed mechanical-bull owning establishment, but this was at a gay bar, which really has me in some cognitive dissonance. Would this guy react the same way to a drag queen? 

I've never been in a situation as bad as this, but when people start gay bashing around me, I'll usually just add that I think people should be able to do whatever they want, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, just like you'd want to do yourself. That usually disarms the situation and we move on since I'm coming out as a gay ally, so maybe they don't want to offend me. 

You could be straight up with people like this and ask why they hate trans people so much. Usually you can phrase it in a way that you come across completely neutral. 

If I had to guess, this guy is so entrenched in manliness and what he thinks it takes to be a man that (assuming this was an MtF at the bar), she just shook him to the core that it is possible to doubt and even work-around the sex organs you were born with, let alone want to be a woman.

You could also be one hell of a pilot - among the best our armed forces has to offer.

No astronaut wants to permanently leave the earth (as that entails death).

Ohio State offers some of the best academics in its region of the country, and Ohio University was just ranked the #1 party school in the country. 
Ohio is also home to some of the best high school and college athletics in the country. 

The dichotomy of ""Work Hard, Play Hard"" is definitely alive and well in many other aspects of Ohio life as well.

BUT by far: The best thing about Ohio is the PEOPLE!

I notice these general trends AROUND the 42 degree latitude line [not considering southern states]:

- Western US: 
Strangers judge you by what you do (career), and will think less of you if they view themselves to be more important. People seem to care more about themselves than others.

- Eastern US: 
Strangers don't really give a fuck about you or what you do unless you have a relationship with them already. They will think low of you regardless of many factors; they will avoid interaction if possible. People tend to focus on their success before all else.

- Midwestern US: Strangers are genuinely interested in each other, they will strike up conversations that go beyond socially-awkward small-talk like the weather. People tend to give the benefit-of-the-doubt to strangers. People tend to focus on community values and use happiness (not $) as a measure of success.

Ohio will always seem like a winner to me, I may be slightly biased because I was raised here.
 
Yet, I have traveled to 23 countries and more than half of the US States so it is reasonable to assume that I may have a broader perspective than the average Redditor.

If you want a government that serves all the people equally, then you have to have a political system where each person has an equal voice in deciding who will be put in power.

* Study at least 4 times a week for at least 1 hour. Take many breaks.
* Get at least 8 hours of sleep and eat breakfast, not eating breakfast reduces your concentration.
* Recording Lectures is a great way to stay ahead, I started this about a year ago, best decision I made. Sometimes they talk too fast or you lose concentration while taking notes and you even might just miss an important point for no reason.
* Be organized, have a calendar on when your assignments are due.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","""learning to read music will only teach you how to interpret another players music""

Yes, though it's not limited to non-recorded music at all - nearly all modern music has been transcribed by someone somewhere into standard notation, you just have to know where to look. Tabs don't tell you which note you're playing - it only tells you which fret to put your finger on. Tabs are pretty much useless to every other musician except guitarists and bassists. 

""i suggest learning things mainly by ear along with a little sheet music and tab.""

Agreed, though minus the tabs. 

""if you thing im wrong try learning Rage against the machine songs by only reading sheet music or tab.""

That's impossible to state from reddit.  For one thing, you don't know how many unique people actually hold that opinion.

&gt;30 seconds of Googling on your very first example of a big MRA blog gave me this: Rape is not Special and Neither are You Not only is rape rare, it's ""not actually that big a deal"".

Did you actually read the article?  He never claims rape is rare, just that it's not as epidemic as rape activists would have you believe.  His claim that it's not that big a deal is an effort to tone down some of the panicked and emotional rhetoric surrounding rape and treat it like the assault it is-- a shitty experience, but not as bad as dying, and not the end of the world.

&gt;What's Jezebel 's ""very few in number""? 1 in 20? That's pretty rare, and well within what some studies show. It seems like you're making a big thing out of a vague definition here.

I'm making a point out of their wording.  The AVFM post that offended you so much never said that rapes were ""very few in number.""

&gt;There are studies that support the 2% figure from Shakesville as well.

Credible ones?

&gt;The 50% study that apparently equaled a recanted claim to a false claim seems to be a prime example of this. It's not hard to think of reasons why rape victims give up and withdraw their statements.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Yea the simple fact is, from the perspective of EVERYONE, even the WCG website and emails to the players, it was a Bo3 games (1 game advantage to upper bracket), and both Canada and USA had completed their finals with that format.

At this point the only mention of Bo3 sets was in the admins minds (so to speak).
How hard would it have been to say, ""well both Canada and USA tournies are done, the players have shaken hands, the finals weren't run quite how we had planned but we didn't tell the players so I guess we can leave it at that as both the community and the players are satisfied with how the tournament was run.""

Why didn't this happen? It is inconsistent and unfair to change to HIDDEN rules when both the Canada and USA quals were completed to the rules set out by the WCG website. WCG screwed up once by not communicating their plans but screwed up 10x as hard by changing to hidden rules after the fact.

Actually, that's somewhat of a simplification. First of all, the rule of thirds itself does not exist in classical painting. There are similar arrangements but they are a) not on the third and b) only a part of a much more complex composition. I couldn't name you a single painting where the main compositional device was placing something on a third. 

It would be considered unbalanced which is why the simplest compositional rule in painting is probably the steelyard composition which consists of placing something of weight a little off-center which will be balanced out by something lighter and smaller on the opposite side, much closer to the edge.

Used in isolation, I don't really believe that the rule of thirds buys you all that much and it's not strong enough to carry an image all by itself. Lines and the layering of different planes (foreground, midground and background) are often more important.","1320106831"

After market crazy fuel systems ~$1000 run inline pumps from a fuel cell, so they will sometimes mount the fuel pump and filter just behind the fuel tank near the bottom so that the pump can suck from that low.

I see maybe a filter, but not one big enough for a serious fuel system.  My best guess unfortunately is that this is one of those stupid flamethrower systems that launches flames out the tail pipe.

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","The fact is that our police think they are above the law.  The federal government needs to step in and send the National Guard to guard the citizens and their right to protest, or the UN needs to do something.

Libya provided more social programs and had less income inequality than we did at the time the uprising started there.  Our country is far worse than even the most pragmatic of us would care to admit.

The violence and deprivation of rights may not be that bad right now, but what happened in Oakland a few days ago and what happened last night in Richmond, as well as hundreds of other incidences of unwarranted, illegal police violence and action against peaceful protesters indicates that the police, and most importantly the politicians directing those police, believe they do not need to follow the law.  When that happens the basic humanitarian rights of the people are trampled.  

If a nation has no regard for the basic humanitarian and civil rights of their people it is time for the UN to take action.  First they would have to draft a resolution and give the United States fair notice to resolve it themselves.  Then after that failed they could authorize the use of troops inside of the country.  We would probably lose our spot at the table though in the process.

The fact is that the UN is about 50% under US control anyway.  The chance of this happening is minimal.  The idea is more to point out that if this were a third-world country doing this the UN *would* intervene.  But the big bad US of A doesn't have to follow their own rules.  Just like the cops.  That is the general theme of things.

And yes, if I cannot trust those sitting in the seats of our government to behave according to the laws, and instead use violence and coercion to suppress those who would draw attention to their hypocrisy, then it would seam reasonable that an organization designed to keep the peace could be of assistance in protecting our citizens from abuses of power.  It is not like we would be asking Mexican soldiers to come here, they would be UN peacekeeping troops.  Sure, they may be Mexican in their nation of origin, but they are UN troops.  WE are part of the UN so they are just as much OUR soldiers as they are Mexican soldiers.  

Your concern is akin to asking ""You want to call the FBI in on a KIDNAPPING CASE?""  It is a matter of jurisdiction.  We agreed to be part of the UN, and thereby be subject to their rules.  If they determine that our country is in need of peacekeeping troops then we have agreed to let them do it.  

We also have the only veto in the UN too, so even if a resolution does pass we can always shoot it down. 

As I said, it is more of a symbolic point that tends to illustrate the absurdity of how the government is treating us.","1320106852"

"politics","t5_2cneq","One of Krugman's main points in the article cited by the OP is that military spending is not the most preferable fiscal stimulus because it consists of implements of destruction or at best weapons that will never be used. He clearly favors investment in infrastructure and human capital to military spending. Pulling up his past descriptions of military spending as a workable fiscal stimulus in the past doesn't overcome the fact that in the above column and various other writings he has said that it is not his *preferred* fiscal stimulus.

&gt; it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""

Krugman says nothing about the *destruction* of Europe (not to mention China, Japan and other areas of the world) being a public works program. His claim is that the U.S. government brought the U.S. economy to full employment by building war machines in the United States.

&gt; how long are you people going to be dazzled by his Nobel Prize and New York Times column?

I for one consider the Nobel Prizes a political circle-jerk. The Norwegian Nobel people like Obama and Gore, so they gave them prizes. The Swedes who issue the prize for economics could very conceivably have given it to Krugman because they like his politics. I don't give any consideration to what any of the Nobel people think.","1320106858"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I was going to blindly come in here and comment regarding this, but then decided to read said article first...and then comment

Having worked directly for DoD contractors, it's obvious that military spending DOES create jobs.  He is correct in this assertion.  Maybe they are going to waste - in much of the ""burying crates of money for the private sector to dig up"", but there are some important distinctions.

The military has generally always had the ""try anything once"" approach to research.  This has led to a lot of waste, and some pretty damn cool inventions.  Sometimes, shoveling money into nondenominational research produces some awesome stuff.  I find fault with his alternatives though.  DoD contractors only hire American citizens, and they support very top-tier educations.  Many of the top mathematicians and physicists  work for the DoD doing whatever it is they do - and those skills have absolutely no use to ""infrastructure"" projects that he proposes.  You can't just dump people who work on satellites, guidance systems, lasers, and rail guns into some renewable energy company.

The thing that bothers me most, is the basis for his argument is that the GOP are being hypocritical.  Well that's obvious to pretty much everyone, and so even entertaining that notion as a basis for an argument gives credence to their argument.

Krugman shouldn't even mention the GOP, since they are just as guilty of funding the military as the Dems - and as I see it, cutting the R&amp;D funding would be disastrous.  What can be cut though, is the multi-billion dollar air conditioning bills we pay so the tents are cool in Afghanistan.","1320106859"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In Norway (which had the horrible shooting a couple months ago), the max sentence is 25 years. 

I am torn on this issue. 20 years is an awful long time. I personally think that prison shouldn't be about punishment but about rehabilitation into society. However, society seems to always want vengeance more than anything else.

Sure there is the argument of keeping the person from doing it again. But, if we truly think someone would do that again after 20 years of being locked-up (and hopefully rehabilitated and counseled), they don't belong in prison. They belong in a mental institution. However, that decision should be made based on an unbiased evaluation that doesn't take past crimes (for which they completed their sentence) into account.

Then again, from what I have just read about the Japanese prison system, it is pretty bad. I kind of doubt that he would be rehabilitated and it probably would be a good idea to keep the guy locked up. Kind of sucks that in effect the reason he should remain locked up is because of [the conditions he faced] while locked up.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Basically you saying that if we assume that god is all-powerful, then we must throw objectivity out because nothing can be verified.  This postulation though serves no real purpose except to question perceptions.

This is a epistemological question though really not a metaphyscial one.  A kind of RenÃ© Descartes question on existence but instead the question is good really good or bad really bad.  Or in philosophy: The ding an sich of lying is in our scope of the ""phenomenal"" world bad while the transcendent ""noumenal"" is really unknown except by God and thus the ""sich"" of lying can not be really known as good or evil thus we can't know if god lies or not (See Kant and German Idealism of Epistemology for more explanation of the terms)

While this is all very interesting, it really has nothing to do with God and whether he lies or not.  And his all powerfulness really doesn't predicate or not predicate the possibility of God lying.

If you really want a counter argument though, I would just use the ontological proof from the link I sent you.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","&gt; Focus has been turned mostly to self improvement and feeling good about your life (which leads to being an awesome person and naturally having women become interested and attracted to you)

Definitely a competing model, and one that I don't think will work. But seeing as I can't prove it, already being a success in the original model, the only way would be to have teach-a-thons comparing the success of the two methods on fresh students. 

How awesome would that be? I wonder if I'd get my ass kicked by better teachers alone ;-) Either way, I don't see it happening.

&gt; This should be translated to ""always be in state""

It depends on your meaning, but I'm leaning towards No.

I meant it's okay to sarge down, depressed, empty, lonely, or any other emotion (including positive ones). You don't have to be on. You just have to accept that's what you have to work with right now, and there's no shame in it or need to change it.

Does that mean ""always on""? I'd rather it be described as ""always off"". I have a feeling guys are trying way too hard - not to meet women (you HAVE to go out and meet women) but to impress them or prove they have some magic sauce.

I think this kind of thinking was huge way back when A New Earth and that other book had hit the community. Now I think a lot of it is garbage, but being in the now (aka not beating yourself up over your emotional mood swings and accepting them) makes whatever mood you're in, attractive.

&gt; downvoted without any replies

People do -not- like what I have to say here; it was always a bit to the side 6 years ago or so but now I've skewed even further from common opinion. But, sometimes I'm quite a prick on purpose so it's probably deserved ;-) No harm done.

The way that I see it is there is no rationale behind peoples blind faith. Why so many of my closest friends and family believe the story of Joseph Smith and The Book of Mormon. It is obviously fictional. C'mon people. Joseph Smith wasn't a perfect man. Whatever he was (delusional, con man, delusional...) he isn't the shining paragon of what the LDS church stands for. I find it hard sometimes to go to church every sunday when I know that it was my own friends that were the ones who blindly supported Proposition 8 simply because a man on a pedestal told them to. There was no questioning, no objective thought, no look back. Pisses me off down to my core and saddens me. That isn't the legacy that I want my church to claim. It isn't what Christianity and religion is about. I know so many people who's lives have been changed for good though, and through coming into the church. People quit smoking, drinking (and getting drunk and abusing/cheating on their family), and in general are better people. For me what draws me to my church isn't the spiritual part but the human part. Giving to your neighbor. Helping the needy.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","No. Do not try to make this work. End it.


This is a relationship used as substitute.  The result is usually increasingly wild swings between inadequacy and intensity. Your relationship follows that course.


She is using attraction, love and a relationship as a substitute for internal confidence, as antidote to insecurity. Thatâs why she is by nature clingy, always needing a partner to shore her up. You noticed it early, and it turned you off. You see it again in her pattern â she seeks someone else out as soon as she breaks up. She uses love to shore her insecurities up. Talking about all her problems, even if imagined, focuses the conversation on her, heightening the intensity of the support. 


Youâve been using love as a substitute for loneliness. You were not in love with her. You saw her as relief for loneliness, and you left her the first time for good reason. You didnât go back because you felt sorry for her. You went back because you were alone for 4 months, and that sucked, opening your feelings up to conscious justification by any relevant means available â and feeling sorry about the impact on her was the justification you used. There is no such thing as âimmature to long relationshipsâ. A short relationship turns into a long one as love matures.  Yours wonât, because what you feel isnât really mature love.


Intensity is very important unconscious component. Clingy people, and lonely people, feel the intensity of a new romance as antidote. But it doesnât last if real love, free of other purposes, isnât present. And each breakup, each cheating, each quarrel, causes hurt and damage, which is then briefly drowned in the intensity of reunion, of making up.  But the damage doesnât go away, and relationship is still founded on insufficient true emotional connection. So when the intensity abates, attentions wander, emotional crimes are committed, and the cycle starts again.  Each of battles a toxic soup of inadequate long term feelings for each other, mistrust, fondness and real appreciation, and hurt. Each of you reacts to reactions built on previous reactions.


Intensity canât be maintained in a stable relationship, and isnât needed.


Do not go back.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The story makes very little sense when you read the article.  From the previous link about this yesterday, the Chinese caption reads ""æ ç"", which literally translates to ""tree bear"".  I have no idea what they call koalas in China (the lack of creativity in naming exotic animals means this might be what they're called), but apparently things called tree bears exist as well, and the picture from the other article is taken from the top, where you can't see the bear's nose or any defining koala features.  Also, the article mentions that the bear was being sold for consumption for ï¿¥139, which is something like $22.  The notion that an obscure restaurant in China can afford to illegally ship koalas from Australia and still make a profit off a $22 dish makes me wonder how koalas aren't facing extinction already.  

I also share the sentiment that there's no reason why you can't eat koalas if you can eat a cow or pig.  There is no moral way to justify killing anything for consumption if you really want to go down that slippery slope.  I understand the concern that the animals are being housed inhumanely, but quite honestly this practice isn't uncommon in the developing world, and it really is only in developed nations where you can readily afford ""humane"" measures.  Chinese culture does play a large role in insisting the animal be fresh, but that isn't a cultural norm which is immutable, and things are changing.  After all, it was *Chinese* uproar which banned a dog eating festival, as indicated in the article.","1320106919"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I was diagnosed with dyslexia when very young, and twice since I've been retested. 

The thing a lot of people seem to misunderstand when it comes to dyslexia, and related conditions, is that it doesn't mean you're bad at ...spelling, for example, but rather that you're not as good as you should be. It's a discrepancy between ability. Some dyslexics appear completely normal, but if tested you see that they are superiorly intelligent in some areas but comparatively bad at something such as memory. My memory and some other abilities are below average (but not particularly awful, which in itself is worrying, must mean most people are thick as shit), whilst my perception skills and verbal comprehension is above average.

I think people who are interested in something get good at it, regardless of their natural ability. If you like reading, you'll get better at it. I think the only reason I'm able to read and write adequately is internet forums. I have a genuine interest in what other people think, I like discussing opinions, arguing, etc. Without that, there is no way I'd be able to read and write, because I wouldn't give enough of a shit to have got better at it.

I have to use a spellchecker numerous times in every post I make and I continuously make the same mistakes. In ways, the spellchecker allows me to suck, but it also allows me to be understood. Really though, it's how you string a sentence together that matters, not spelling... So when ""grammar Nazis"" pick out some word to correct me, it really pisses me off. It's pedantic. The important thing is you know what I meant.","1320106924"

For a ""mainly gaming rig"" 16GB of RAM is pointless.  You also generally get a worse overclock with four sticks of RAM than two.  Additionally, 1866MHz RAM isn't worth it.  You'll see marginal performance gains from 1600MHz to 1866MHz while paying a premium.  Not only that, but good 1600MHz RAM should overclock to 1866MHz.  Get 8GB of 1600MHz RAM and be happy with it.  

The FX-6100 is ok, but a power hog when overclocking.  I'd go for a 955, 960T, or 1090T instead since they overclock well and aren't too power intensive when overclocked.  Overclocked and with a pair of 6970s, you wouldn't need more than 750w.  Of course, if you're just going for max OC, grab an H80/H100 and a new FX CPU with a big PSU (850-1000w if you plan on Crossfire) and go to town.  ","1320106925"

2) Stop attacking women for not dating you.

3) Rape is never funny -- unless it involves a clown.  (But not if Kevin Smith directs it, that's just some soul-crushing shit.)

4) Stop saying false rape claims *never* happen.  Say that they're *very, very unlikely.*

5) Stop saying men can't be raped.  By women.

6) *Rape culture* is not a constructive opening to lay discourse anymore than *The Predominant White Culture.*  Granted, both may be quite accurate and succinct methods of talking about something anyway, but they won't help things.

7) Stop attacking men for having one night stands.  *With you,* especially.

8) Stop attacking women for having one night stands.  *With anyone,* but especially you and people who are not you.

9) Stop posting naked pictures of your ex.

10) Stop blaming the person who had sex with your fiance(e) for having sex with your fiance(e).  Unless they're your best friend.

11) Stop assuming that being nice is anything but the minimum requirement.

12) Stop any statement that includes the words ""But [so and so] KNEW!"" when you didn't actually say anything.  Seriously.

13) 16 year olds?  Only if you're 16.

14) 13 year olds?  Yeah, I'm not even going there.

15) Did you read that somewhere?  Not sure where?  Then you're probably wrong.

16) If you want to go on a date, ask someone.  If you don't, don't expect to go on a date.

17) Not everyone's attractive to most people, and not even *in their own special way.*  Most people are somewhere between ugly and plain.  But everyone has value.

18) Seddit.  Not even once.

19) There is no 19.  EDIT: Yes there is.  Ugly people, learn to have sex with ugly people.  It'll save you stress.

20) Racism.  You're not helping.  Read a book.

21) The Lowest Common Denominator is the **lowest common denominator.**

22) Cameras.  Above the waist.

23) Hands.  Not without permission.

24) Eyes.  Good luck.

25) Reddit *may not be racist or sexist.*  Accept that.  It may be brimming with a majority of racists or a majority of sexists or a majority of sexist racists.  Or those are the people who comment most.  Then again, so is the entire Western World.  So it's possible the entire Western World is sexist and/or racist.  Or not.  See how that works?

&gt;I wouldn't specifically recommend doing it every day because I do know that batteries only have a set number of power cycles

The source I showed that the battery's life is EXTENDED 50% by NOT deep cycling (ie keep in range of 50-100%.) Until I see evidence to the contrary, I recommend not doing deep cycles ever.

&gt;if it kills the battery within my 2 year AppleCare warranty, I'll just get a replacement.

That's nice for you to have that option, but it doesn't change whether something is good or bad for the battery.

&gt;BTW, I only did the complete power cycle once,

Yes, I read that in your post. I doubt once will be highly detrimental, but it is worse than NOT doing it. It also promotes the idea that deep cycles are somehow 'good' for your battery, when the evidence suggests otherwise.

I have seen no evidence to back claims that Li-ion batteries benefit from deep cycles (only that it is detrimental). I suspect it is a legacy from other battery types, such as Ni-Cad, where deep cycling DOES rejuvenate the battery for well established, scientific reasons. The only 'good' reason that I have seen for a deep cycle is that the battery meter will be more accurate.

"custommagic","t5_2sbcz","Second submission. It's just a very splashy idea, I'm not sure how to turn it into a printable card:

&gt; **Seal of the Guildpact**, [](/5)

&gt; Legendary Artifact

&gt; Whenever an instant or sorcery is cast by any player from his or her hand, exile it instead and put a Spirit creature token with power and toughness equal to its converted mana cost on the battlefield under that player's control. That creature has the same colors as exiled spell. When that creature dies, its controller may cast exiled spell without paying its mana cost. If he or she doesn't, put exiled spell into graveyard.

&gt; *Memories of the broken Guildpact sometimes return to the material word to enforce it.*

It turns spells into Spirits. When such Spirit dies, its magic is released.

It's main form of protection is that Shatter targetted at it becomes 2/2 red Spirit token. It still dies to Oblivion Ring, killing own Spirit token, Manic Vandal, Sylvok Replica, etc.

There are obvious complications for spells with [](/X) in cost, kickers etc. - you can cast Fireball for [](/8)[](/R) to make 9/9 Spirit but it will deal 0 damage once Spirit embodying it dies etc.

It's meant to be a Johnny card, not tournament card.","1320106948"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I was applying diminishing returns rather loosely

* In that you were not actually applying the economic principle of diminishing returns? 

&gt; Once you hit a certain amount, as you gather more money, you get less stuff from that money.

* Not true. The investment returns you receive increases (per unit). 

&gt; Anyways, you seemed to have picked up on my thought process there.

* I understand what you are arguing...It is about how the value of money is subjective. The economic law of diminishing returns does not apply to what you are saying. 

* The value of money (per unit) is subjectively more valuable to poor people. This is simply because poor people use the vast majority of their money for survival items(food, shelter, ect). If I were given the opportunity to bet a $1000 with a 60% chance of doubling it...It would be dumb for me not to. However, for a poor person it would be dumb to do so...As they would essentially be betting their life against a $1000. I agree with what you are saying totally. This does not change the fact that capital represents forgoing consumption and thus, it is necessary to offer incentives to both me and the poor person to save. 

&gt; How is actual capitalism not conducive to monopolies? 

* [The assertion that free markets lead to monopoly](http://mises.org/daily/621) is wildly incorrect. If the market is allowed to work freely over time, an apparent monopolist soon discovers that it indeed has competition. A company operating in a market economy looks like a monopoly only under myopically static analysis. A broader definition of any industry will show that there is plenty of competition, just as a narrow enough definition will show that any brand name product has some monopoly characteristics, such as a popular brand of ice cream.

* On a related note...Can you name a monopoly that existed for an extended period of time and instituted monopoly pricing..*without* using violent force or government force? 

&gt; As for mutually beneficial, would you say its fair that one party benefits much more than another? 

* Sure...

&gt;  Also how would everyone be worse off? I invest in a factory in a foreign country, I pay the laborers an amount close to the value of the product they made, and I make a small profit

* We are leaving out an important actor. The employee, the owner and the ???? 

* Now this actor who we left out...Would be worse off in this situation.

&gt; It seems like if you just limit the profit margins the workers would be better off, and if the workers are better off society would be better off. They can then turn around and consume more

* What could they consume more of? If all industries were run in such a fashion, things would be more expensive and thus, these workers would have less purchasing power. 

* If demand goes up while supply remains relatively fixed...What happens to prices? 

&gt;  But if you keep wages depressed, you also keep demand depressed, thereby limiting the amount of money you can make off of other people.

* Sure...If you do not include wages in input costs.

LaRussa is an odd one to figure.  For a long time he had the reputation as the guy who had only won one when he should have won three with the A's between 1988 and 1990, and he only added to that reputation from 2000-2005 with the Cardinals, having a contender every year that couldn't seem to get it done in the postseason.

He graduated from college in April after four years with a 3.4 GPA with a bachelors in psychology (yes, I know), and minors in anthropology, philosophy, and German. Since then he has applied to four jobs. When he didn't get any. He told me point blank, ""I'm stupid, my GPA isn't good enough, I am never going to get a good enough job, I'm done applying."" This is the only thing I want to change... and I want to change it because it is harmful to his own self. That way of thinking is not healthy for anyone, giving up and not believing in yourself is not healthy. I just want him to have a healthier mentality not change entirely.

 I am aware that I am not a trained psychologist, my SO actually says this to me all the time, I'm not asking him to open up so that I can analyze him and change him. I just honestly believe that sometimes having a listening ear is an amazing thing. I just want him to talk to me and to feel comfortable with talking to me about most anything. I want him to trust that I wont hurt him with what he shares.

Thank you for the apology. I sort of figured something about this hit a nerve. I know that forcing him to talk to me about every tiny thing is not the way to go about it. When he is upset I simply ask whats wrong, if he says, ""A friend pissed me off."" I ask if he wants to talk if he says no I let it go. That's something he can do himself or with the person who he has the issue with. It's when I say one thing and he goes off and yells at me that I try to resolve the problem, because I feel like I did something and I am able to help resolve the issue by apologizing or explaining why I did whatever it is that I did. That's when these conversations turn into clusterfucks and he refuses to simply tell me what I did to make him upset so I can't resolve the issue.","1320106963"

You should read up a bit on moral hazard.  In this instance, ""free"" means ""free to the consumer"".

&gt;limit the number of daily downvotes a user can make, or perhaps make it so users have a ""ratio"" whereby they can only downvote as many times as they've upvoted that day.

I don't like how this could limit the ability of people who are downvoting worthless shit instead of people who are ""abusing"" the downvotes.

&gt;have a dropdown list of the first 10 or so usernames that downvoted, so the OP or anyone else can at least address them personally if they feel strongly enough about it. Maybe this could even be done so that a reply to that comment allows one to pick one of the usernames in the downvote dropdown list at random (with that username thereby linked in the reply) and if that user doesn't respond with an explanation their downvote is then nullified.

"Poetry","t5_2qhhu","Okay, here's how I would like this to be handled.

This will be the first workshop group being created.  More will be created as others are required.

This one will be called a specific name ___________ (you decide) and will have ______ number of members (i suggest 5-6) in it.  Once the members are decided and name picked I will put the link to the creation thread permanently on the sidebar.

From then on out, when someone in the group has a poem they would like to share, they would create a self post with the poem, submit it and then send the link with a quick note to all the members of that group VIA the permanent sidebar link.  In the meantime I will try to find some way to make a system for messaging all the members at once but in the meantime you just have to use the old fashion - OPEN UP the userpage and send message (with the link) to all your members and THEN ALSO send the same message to the mod link (http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Poetry).

Now, making a self post with this will give a great area for commenting and such but it would also let others comment as well and SHOW THEM how real work shopping is done.  I know you may have the inclination to do this in some hidden way but if we are ever going to make this a rockin' subreddit where feedback is popular we need to show people how this is done and have a system by which we work.

This self post will be added to the self post linked on your VW sidebar page.  I suggest that be a CLEAN submission that you make once this process of setting up is done so that it has clear member names and links, clear links to new submissions and so forth.

I will promise that all threads used in work shopping will be free of flaming and bullshit as I will personally bring down the hammer and remove shitty comments.

If this is acceptable please let me know.  I know this all sounds maybe confusing but I have been on reddit since forever and have a good idea how to make this work smoothly and with as least stress as possible.

Once we work this all out, it will be tight :)","1320106989"

I do not consider Nobel Peace Prize as a sign or a proof of ""pacifism"" or persons intentions or doings towards humanity(or humans in that matter).

I do consider that batshit insane of the conductions towards serf in Tibet under Dalai Lamas rule. Beside of the point that serf were slaves for example learning to read as a serf was punishable by death. Common practice of dicipline towards serfs was torture and mutilation for example cutting off nose or arms. BTW The Lhasa torture chamber in resides in the Potala Palace the same palace that Dalai Lama used to live. I do consider that batshit insane for not only to own a torture chamber but actually torture ""people"" in there(serf were no considered people because they were so low according to Lamas religion that it was punishable to them even watch Lama to the face and killing them was not against the law except if the killer was a serf too). And I don't even go to the batshit insane religion of Tibetian Buddhism with reincarnation and believes on caste system.

One cannot be expected to know what their partner is feeling, or thinking, or whether they scare themselves, or if they might regret something later.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;I have never been in such a passionate, loving relationship

Just as a side note, passion runs both ways.

While I can't necessarily disagree with what others are saying because every situation is different, I can provide my personal point of view as a girlfriend who isn't stable.

As a little bit of a background, I am at a point in my life where I am emotionally and possibly mentally unstable and it took such a toll my boyfriend that he had to break up with me. I love him more than anything, but because of the way I was raised and other childhood traumas, I've never learned how to act the way a girlfriend should. Though I love him more than anything, my actions donât always show that and he therefore he sometimes doesnât feel that I care about him the way I do. 
When he confronted me about my self esteem/negativity/anxiety/etc. he told me he couldn't be with me because he felt staying in the serious relationship made me think it was okay to not get help and that he couldn't condone the behavior I was displaying without feeling guilty. He also couldn't let me drag him down with me. It was sort of an eye opener for me and I knew I couldnât let myself loose him, and I realized I had a problem and I couldnât let my behavior continue. We decided I start going to therapy which is starting to help a ton, and he has been incredibly supportive of me getting better. We are still dating exclusively, though not officially.

Personally, the way I see it is that she is ultimately the only one responsible for her actions. You are not going to be able to make her realize anything or change the way she thinks or acts, whether her actions are out of utter selfishness or because she has a deeper underlying problem. Only she will be able to change and that will only happen if she actually truly wants to. I suggest sitting her down and having a serious conversation about all of this and judging by her actions and responses to how you feel and what you have to say, make a decision together. If she is not going to be able to make a positive change or start to take steps to do that, you need to leave her. There is only so much you can do.

Also, though you love her and care about her very much, please please please donât let thoughts of what she will do post break up sway any decision you may make. If she makes a bad decision after a break up, there is nothing you can do but get over it.

Guy gets seriously injured right in front of the police. It's fairly clear in the video that there's no pressing danger to the cops, but they do nothing about this injured person.

Then one of them decides to get the prick of the year award and throw a flash-bang at the people that ran back towards the tear gas and exploding flash-bangs to help the guy.

The ""few bad apples"" argument breaks down at two points here. First, if the majority of the cops were good people at least one of them would have seen an emergency situation that was taking place just a few feet away from them and done something about it.

Second, at least one of them would have arrested a prick that had just thrown a flash-bang directly on top of an already injured person. But that didn't happen. They all just held their line, just stood there while an officer was actively trying to prevent an injured person from getting medical treatment.

When the video came out was this person thrown to the wolves? Was he fired for showing a complete disregard for the lives he was hired to protect? Nope. Nothing has happened. He's being protected.

So, maybe not every cop in America is a complete dick, but a huge number of them seem to be content to cover up for the dicks, and they're hardly better.","1320107014"

Mentioning ladder thoery except to mock it (and even then) is met with swift mockery and even punishment. There's an attitude of if you're having girl problems, the problem isn't the girls. This and other things has led SA to have a much more diverse cast of characters than I think anyone would have dreamed of in 2002.

Like how no one tells Spielberg what his next movie is going to be, they just throw money at him, or he uses his own. Valve is the kind of developer the industry needs more of. These people push the boundaries of game design, games as art and the technology involved. They are true visionaries and the Call of Duty guys could still learn a TON from Valve.

I mean, CoD are great games, they smooth, fun, fast, good looking and well designed, they just are severely lacking what I consider the most important aspect of video games and that's creativity. They just make military shooter... yaaaaawwwwn... Been there, done that. 

NOW Half-Life! Mind-blowing! Never done any of that shit!

Miscarriages are hard to cope with, sadly I only have limited experience with it. For what's it worth, you have my sympathy..

Now the husband thing.. I'm assuming from what I've read you both can be grumpy which leads to discussions getting heated quickly. I think he does these things to prevent it from getting worse.. getting angry or starting to yell. I'm not saying it's a good excuse or if that is his motivation.. but that's my hunch. There's other problems you have with him, where he doesn't seem to care about.. which sounds like he's holding back things that are on his mind. Maybe he has trouble with the miscarriages aswell?

I'd advice to try and start a neutral conversation.. just both put your cards on the table without getting defensive over it. Having such a conversation is pretty hard since people go for the defensive very fast and that leads to arguments. If he wants to, let him talk first about the things that bother him.. acknowledge his opinion and then add your own perspective to it, really put emphasis that it's your perspective and that his is equally valuable. Try to both work on a solution from there.. it takes two to make it work. When you talk about the things that bother you, just calmly state what.. and ask what he thinks about, that you want to better understand why that happens.

It sounds like allot of work, and it is.. I've had conversations that lasted up to 4 to 5 hours talking like this, but it is worth it. It's a nice feeling to be able to talk in a constructive way. Going for a walk together helps too.. people feel more open and relaxed when they walk and talk at the same time, so that's something you can try aswell.

In either way, I hope you can sort things out and that you'll have an uneventful year :)","1320107047"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It seems a lot of Ex-Mormons are answering, but as the OP asked for a Mormon to answer, I suppose I shall answer. I am a twenty-five year old Latter-Day Saint (Mormon.) When I was 19 I went to Illinois and served as a Mormon missionary for two years. So perhaps with that my opinion has some weight?

There seams to be two things I need to answer here. The first is how we can even begin to believe the story with the specific questions tied to the story of Joseph Smith. The second would be the actual answer of how I can possibly believe the story of Joseph Smith at all. 

As for the plates that no one saw, one of the first pages in the Book of Mormon is the signature of 11 people who swore they saw the plates that had the appearance of gold. Is that proof? Of course not.

Joseph Smith had the first book which he translated from the plates lost/stolen (116 pages known as the Book of Lehi.) Let's consider something for a moment, religious zealots at the time got pretty railed up when there was a punk kid claiming he saw God. Blasphemy! Joseph Smith was in quite the predicament having lost these pages. Maybe he was a false prophet, a liar, and he really couldn't reproduce the pages (this also implies he didn't have an original copy that he was reading from, and therefore was making it up as he went. I'll talk about this later.) The other maybe, is that Joseph Smith was worried that if he reproduced the 116 pages, that people would then reveal the stolen pages having made changes to the original, and ""prove"" he was a fake. If that were the case, your question would be an even bigger blow would it not? 'How can any Mormon believe Joseph Smith's story when he was proven a liar when he ""re-translated"" and came up with a completely different story!?' So either way, it was quite the predicament for Joseph.

The last thing I wanted to address was how in the world I believe any of this. I have never met Joseph Smith. I've never heard him tell his tale. All I had to go by was the Book of Mormon. When presented with the story of Mormonism, I had to find for myself if it was legit or not. I've read the Book of Mormon. I don't find it to be man made. I don't find it the imagination of a man in his early twenties. I certainly can't believe anyone could rattle it off of the top of their head! It's too intrinsic, it's too uplifting, it's teachings are inspiring and draw me closer to Christ. 

Mormonism isn't an answer for -how- we got here, but an answer for -who- we are. What mankind's heritage is. It's an answer for how to find lasting happiness :)

I stopped by with my (at the time) girlfriend and she got a chicken nugget meal and I got a McFlurry they said the total was ~$20. When I asked how it was the much the guy just stared at me and finally shrugged and said ""you got a mcflurry"". I'm aware what I ordered, but I don't know how a $3 drink somehow costs me $13. The manager ended up getting involved he said it was my fault and that I should be happy he is even taking it off the order.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In 1929 President Anthony W. Ivins of the LDS church's First Presidency cautioned church members: The Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples â¦ who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent.

 LDS scholars also say that the DNA taken from modern day Israelis has been intermixed with DNA from many other nations, thus they do not contain the same traits that Israelites had when Lehi left Israel (Stubbs 2003). Also, modern Native Americans have intermixed, which has changed their DNA from that of their ancestors' as well. It is also noted by LDS researchers that another factor affecting genetic diversity of New World inhabitants is the fact that 90% of the population died as the result of disease introduced by the Spaniards and others after their arrival (Coe 2002, p. 231).[12]

Unfortunately no matter how great science is right now there is no way they can really prove DNA from thousands of years ago.  While some of it is traceable, things change over time.","1320107085"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;This is exactly why we can't choose either god existing or it not existing. We have no evidence to suggest either.

Sorry if I was unclear, my first statement about god was to avoid make a claim on its likelihood because of the lack of definition. You cannot judge possibility of existence until you define the nature of that existence. *However*, some definitions of god that people use CAN be judged, and many of those are 0% probabilities because of their contradictory nature. The ones with &gt;0% probability have a tendency to be vague and not useful.

&gt;They are both philosophical arguments

Actually, the anthropic principle is more useful because it (very boiled down) says that we emerged from natural processes in a non-unique environment, therefore it is likely that somewhere else in this vast cosmos, something else has developed with some vaguely similar qualities. 

Most of the arguments I've seen have a habit of defining god in a non-useful or very limiting way to attempt to make an awkward inductive argument that god must exist. ","1320107097"

Select what you like/need from Dips, Pullups, Abs, Obliques, Hypers, Curls, Tricep Extensions. Maybe a GHR if you need posterior chain work.

"education","t5_2qhlm","2nd year teacher here (high school) with a few tips


&lt;What qualities make an effective lesson plan?
-content objectives and language objectives (look up SIOP)
-clearly stated, measurable, meaningful SWBAT goals ex: Student will be able to define 5 plant structure terms with 90% accuracy.
-include a hands-on activity
-don't spend more than 10-15 minutes on a lecture
-break up activities (on an average day in my class, students walk in, answer the warmup on the board where they also see what the content and language objectives are (as well as our activities), I will either lecture for 10 minutes while student take notes (this occurs at most 3 times a week), students work on an activity related to the lecture/unit, perhaps a lab, reading activity, worksheet, discussion (anything really!). I have the privilege of teaching horticulture/plant science so I take my students out to the greenhouse on occasion to break instruction up.)
-make sure your lesson plan is easy to read and you use the same format 


&lt;How do you/would you present a lesson plan?
-I type mine up ahead of time or I jot them down on a piece of paper on my desk. I then write the activities on the board for each class so they are not surprised by anything
-If I am presenting a lesson plan to an administrator, I am sure to have it complete and include any applicable state standards


&lt;Why are lesson plans important?
-They help organize your thoughts
-You can reuse them/modify them for next year to help improve instruction
-You can share them with colleagues
-If you write thorough lesson plans (like I sometimes do) they impress administrators


&lt;In what circumstances would you deviate from a lesson plan and start ""winging it?""
-often, whenever you come upon a ""teachable moment"" use it, the more relatable you can make material the better
-I usually stick with the general activities outlined on the board for students, but if a question is asked that is relavent and will engage students to use higher level thinking skills, we will discuss
-When writing a lesson plan, anticipate what types of answers you will get from questions you ask


&lt;How much time and effort do you/would you put into a lesson plan?
-When I was learning how to write lesson plans, it would take me forever. I had to connect state standards to everything I was planning to teach and there are A LOT of standards! I thought I would never get better. I did, second year in to it, I still modify and create new lessons, although I am teaching the same class I did last year.
-It takes a lot less time when you have more practice. You will improve, it just takes time


&lt;How do you know if a lesson plan is ""good?""
-It has hands-on, engaging activities that teach to all modalities. Make sure you reach auditory, tactile, visual, kinesthetic learners. 
-Make sure you are reviewing material, don't teach a lesson and never review! 
-A good lesson plan includes any handouts, powerpoints, videos, websites, and books that you use. This helps immensely when you re-use/modify later. 
-LASTLY- you'll know it's ""good"" once you test it out. practice on your roommate, ask the questions out loud. teach it!


&lt;Is there a specific lesson plan format that you follow, and if so, describe it.
-Your professor should provide you with ""bare-bones"" lesson plan formats, test them out, improve upon them. Make them work for you.
-I have examples of my lesson plans, if you would like I will share them. 


&lt;Should school administrators ever get involved with lesson planning? Why/why not?
-When I am observed by an administrator (2-3 times a year as a ""conditional"" new teacher), I meet with him (pre-conference) and describe my lesson, share handouts, and he asks questions. It is a lot easier if you have a hard copy of your lesson plan than verbally explaining, it is easier for documentation. He then observes me, we meet for a post-conference and discuss things that went well, what I could improve on etc. (tip for these: It is important to show self-reflection) Having a lesson plan that an administrator can give you tips on what to add or improve upon is awesome.
-What else is awesome? asking your administrator questions. They are busy, but when they know what is going on in your class (good OR bad), they form a better relationship with you. If I have a question, I either ask my mentor teacher, who is experienced, a teacher who teaches a similar subject, or an administrator. I work in a big school and I feel it is important they know who you are and know what you are up to.


If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask.

We made eye contact, he waved to let me go, and I smiled. I can't believe it didn't go further than that, because I was incredibly nervous.

Another time, the clerk scrutinized my id and told me he didn't think it was real. I said something to the effect of ""no look, the hologram is how you can tell it's legit"". As I reached over somewhat innocently to point, I grabbed the id and got the fuck out of there.

My credits are transferrable, however, this is my senior year, with me graduating at the end of the Spring semester. If I transfer out now, I lose some credits and am forced to go to school for an additional year, so I'm forced to stay if I want my degrees.
* Right now, this is my fourth alcohol violation. That sounds like a lot, and it makes me sound like an alcoholic, but all the times i've been caught have been for reasons that are competely bs. My first violation, I did jello shots and my roommate ratted me out. Second time, roommate left empties in his portion of the room that I didnt see and when the R.A. came in my room, he saw them and blamed me for them. Third time, it was the last day of the school year last year and a ""friend"" reported me for having 3 beers while watching the NFL draft. This is my fourth and I got busted for an empty can for additional B.S. reasons. 
*  Thank you for suggesting I fight it, in which I am. I have my Hearing tomorrow morning, where I argue in front of a 3-student panel who are ""prepped"" about the student handbook from the deans of housing. Basically, when the Police was in my room, he took the can out of my personal drawer, and put it in a garbage bag, in which he took. There literally was a sip in the can, which was backwash, but if I can properly argue that it was empty, I could face less severe charges. Also, even if I am found guilty of having alcoholic paraphanelia in my room, I can also fight some of the charges and substitute some of my own.
*  In that case, I am apologising that this was a complete accident, it was one empty can and that this is my senior year. I am set to graduate soon. Instead of, (can I say ""in lieu of"" as a synonym for instead of?) me getting kicked off campus and fined, I willingly will take the fine, do 25 hours of community service, and go to every Freshman Seminar class and do a lecture and discussion on the consequences of drinking alcohol.
*  I find this completely unfair that all these charges are being placed against me. I am a 23 year old double major who has spent the last few years of my life on this campus and am very active (chair on a committee on Student Senate and on Res. Council). I just had one empty can in my room and the first reaction these guys have is to ban me from campus other than going to class.

* Thank you for responding to my post, Sir.","1320107152"

"surfing","t5_2qmde","&gt;[Lake Nicaragua, despite being a freshwater lake, has sawfish, tarpon, and sharks.[1] Initially, scientists thought the sharks in the lake belonged to an endemic species, the Lake Nicaragua Shark (Carcharhinus nicaraguensis). In 1961, following comparisons of specimens, the Lake Nicaragua Shark was synonymized with the widespread Bull shark (C. leucas),[3] a species also known for entering freshwater elsewhere around the world.[4] It had been presumed that the sharks were trapped within the lake, but this was found to be incorrect in the late 1960s, when it was discovered that they were able to jump along the rapids of the San Juan River (which connects Lake Nicaragua and the Caribbean Sea), almost like salmon.[5] As evidence of these movements, bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean (and vice versa), with some taking as little as 7â11 days to complete the journey.[3]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nicaragua)

I'm guessing that because it can survive being frozen doesn't mean it'll survive in the wild at normal temperatures.   Competition from other organisms, being eaten by them (ie:worms), or heat from thermophilic activity accounts for the reduction.  

In the study I linked, they inoculated one of the vats of biosolids with salmonella and even in the control tanks the #'s decreased severely over a relatively short time.

[You really need to hear the actual song](http://grooveshark.com/s/Stella/2CncFb?src=5).

To start with, it's *36 minutes long*. It's written as [program music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_music) (loosely defined, a soundtrack for a non-visual work) based on the story of [Night on the Galactic Railroad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_on_the_Galactic_Railroad), a Japanese classic novel written in the 1920s. As such, the piece follows the classical dramatic arc: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement, with the climax hitting generally around the golden ratio. The whole piece is constantly working up these grand, sweeping themes, sustaining them for a few seconds, and then collapsing back into atonality and stuttering rhythms and glitchy distortion. Every victory gets a little farther than the last, until it breaks apart almost completely and gets super creepy and depressing (starting around 21:00), and then spends the next three minutes building and building in this massive crescendo, until it finally breaks into the climax (22:50), at which point it's completely unstoppable and basically just blows your mind for several minutes, before finally letting down smoothly and transitioning into the denouement.

In contrast, this video is the first 6 minutes of the song, heavily (and somewhat awkwardly) edited down to 3 minutes and 20 seconds, played over top of some rather frenetic images of a girl in high school doing high school things. It's completely removed the depth and context of the music and tried to replace it with flashing text and After Effects. The context and narrative suggested by the video content is nowhere near as powerful as the narrative that *already existed* in the piece before it was cut down to less than a tenth of its original length.","1320107168"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Having a considerable amount of gay and lesbian friends might have something to do with it, not necessarily because of a lack of peer pressure but because you were used to thinking of romantic relationships as not having clear gender roles. 

I honestly don't remember many specific things that were said to me about shoes or height, other than the ""frame well"" comment which was from my first boyfriend's mother. I do remember seeing an essay about it in one of my favorite ""guide to being a girl"" type books where they acknowledged it might be an issue. I vaguely recall being teased  by my friends because I was so much taller than the rather short guy I liked in middle school. I worried a lot about how my size made me appear next to other girls. 

It wasn't until late high school that being tall actually became somewhat of an asset â you get the nice long legs and something of the ""model"" look â but I was never willowy enough to satisfy myself and still felt like I was always too big and masculine to be attractive to most guys. It didn't help that I felt like I didn't know how to dress in an attractive, feminine way or that I was loud and assertive, because those traits also masculinized me. 

I guess I just grew up being insecure about being too masculine, and height is a big component of that for me. I've always been a feminist and in theory support challenging the status quo and the social construct of gender, but I think this is just something that started in my youth that I can't totally shake. I get crushes on guys that are shorter than me all the time, but really I'd prefer to be with someone near my height but taller, for both of the reasons I mentioned â psyschological hangups and physical comfort.

I've only been with two guys, though, so my sample size is quite small.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I think we(I was once a server, therefore, always a server) feel like primadonnas because we have to deal with the customers, and we get USED to the 20% tips, and begin relying on them as salary. We also think we are the only ones who CAN deal with the customers, which gives us that 'edge.' 


You see, most of us would not work there at the wage the owner pays. Even here in CA, where it is mandated minimum wage, I would not have applied if I didn't get tips. Instead, it is based on commission- that makes us work harder, want to stay longer, and actually do more than 'necessary' for the customer. 


The customer, in turn, pays the wages FOR the owner- pretty nice set up for the owner once you think about it. Like you said, around 80% of what I made was straight out of the customers pocket, not the place I worked. 


So yes, if they forced me to stay an hour later and clean at minimum wage, how dare them. I earned this job. If I wanted to make minimum wage, I would work at a place a little less stresful, because, Let's face it, serving is hard. I still have nightmares I have been triple-sat in a 10 table section and forgot to put in everyone's order. Not everyone can serve, it is a special skill set you can either slowly learn, or pick up. 


Customer service in general sucks, but most of it is in a relaxing environment. Serving requires you to be walking/running, talked down to by customers, yelled at by chefs/managers/food runners/bussers/other servers, while trying to remember 50 things, all with a smile on your face. Not everyone can do this.


There is also a strong dichotomy between the servers and everyone else. Serving is a temporary job for most. They don't give a flying fuck about the owner, the sales, the customers, ect. They just want something to help pay for drugs/beer/rent for the 5 years they attend college. Managers,owners, chefs, and sometimes bussers, are in it for the long term. So it is up to the owner to figure out a way to keep the server happy without feeling entitled, which is probably very, very hard. 


TL/DR- Servers are spoiled college kids not in it for the career v everyone else, but they are hired because of the skills the job requires, thus creating premadonnas. ","1320107177"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; ""Putting aside that ""sin"" in itself is a concept I cannot relate to...""

This is interesting.  Honestly, I suspect that many Christians don't actually have any understanding of 'sin' as a concept.  But, aside from that, I suspect you can relate to it.  The problem is that I doubt you have had the chance to learn what 'sin' actually means.

The shortest, simplest, most approachable of it's meanings, (I believe there are three different words in the bible that have been translated to be the word 'sin' in the english version, and each has a slightly different definition and contextual meaning within it's original language, time, and culture), is simply - imperfection.

Specifically, I believe it is commonly translated as ""To miss the mark"", (which has a subtle, but very important, difference from simply being 'not perfect').

This is something we can all relate to.  We all fall short.  We all fail in what we strive for.  We all 'miss the mark'.

When Scripture leads us to say that we are born sinners.. This is what we are saying.   We are all born imperfect.  We are all born 'missing the mark' in some way.  This is a simple truth.  We live in an imperfect world.

So, behind everything, behind the rejection of sin and our acceptance of our sinful nature is the simple recognition that we are not perfect.  We will fail, we have failed, we are failing even now.  We will alwayse fall short of the mark.

However, the other side of that is the injunction that in spite of these things we must never cease to strive.  We must never embrace our imperfection and use it as excuse to abandon the mark entirely.  We will always miss the mark, but we must always strive for it anyway.

There is more to it, but in the end I think you will find that the theology behind sin and our sinfull nature isn't that different from the secular take on morality and humanism, (either from application or from recognition of human nature, our drives, and how we shoudl strive to step above those things for the greater good).

These are absolutely concepts that anyone can relate to, even those who reject religion entirely.","1320107183"

No you don't. In Silverstone they were fighting over 4th and 5th, Hamilton finished 4th, Massa 5th. Hardly ""removed him from viable contention"". In Singapore he clipped his rear tyre, seriously, watch that again and tell me it was malicious. If he had been 20cm further back there would have been no contact and he didn't deserve a penalty. In Japan they BARELY touched and Massa was the one sending one up the outside that time. No real damage was done and he finished only 2 places behind Hamilton. As for India, Massa took himself out. Tell yourself he would have done well all you want but fact of the matter is, he made the SAME stupid mistake he made less than 24hrs ago and did the same damage. He had that coming.

&gt;watch the Monaco video again and tell me he didn't remove Massa from the race.

He didn't remove massa from the race. Into the hairpin, yes, he drove into the side of him but he had the inside line and massa gave him no room (not that there was room for massa to give) and then into the tunnel, well, I think it's YOU who needs to watch the video again. Hamilton is behind coming into the corner, he gets better drive and a slipstream, pulls alongside massa. Massa gets on the dirty line, loses control and shunts into the wall. They did not make contact in the tunnel so how did he ""remove"" him from the race? By nudging him at 20 mph three corners ago? 

They've had their squabbles but they are very often racing each other, that's the nature of the sport. Michael Schumacher and Vitaly Petrov have tripped over each other a few times now because they, too, are racing for the same places and are therefore fighting over the same piece of track.

&gt;Fuck Louis Hamilton. He's a little bitch with entitlement issues. It's why his team absolutely hates him, and its obvious every time he talks to a reporter or speaks in a post-race interview.

Fuck you. You're being a bit of an obnoxious little prick yourself; do you think his job is easy? His team doesn't hate him and I tell ya what, if McLaren drop Lewis before Ferrari drop Massa I will eat my hat.

If he's not your favourite driver, fine, but honestly I have massive respect for all the drivers and what they do out there on the track. They're the only people in the world who can do it and it takes years of training, huge amounts of talent and balls of steel. Calling Lewis Hamilton a little bitch because you don't like the way he drives makes you the little bitch, I'm afraid.","1320107186"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Copying this from a comment I made earlier:

Anyways, here's what to do if you join a server and see it happening:

1. File an abuse report (default key is F7). Valve is taking this shit seriously this year; they've sent out numerous e-mails detailing the registration system, plus what happens if you're found to be cheating. Even one report could get their server blacklisted indefinitely. Since servers are tied to a single Steam ID, it will also make any future servers set up on that Steam ID instantly blacklisted. Admins abusing their power to noclip or slay anyone trying to legitimately get a gift is something that was specifically stated in e-mails and being a blacklist-worthy infraction.

2. Leave the server. It obviously wasn't worth your time anyways.

3. Blacklist the server. If the server is Quickplay-enabled, a single blacklist drops their rating dramatically, as does players joining and leaving in quick succession.

4. Find a private community to play on. Private communities usually don't have the abuse problem pubs do because when you have a very small intake of new players, alienating enough regulars can end up killing your server. I run a private community, and I can attest to that fact (though my regulars aren't leaving from admin abuse, just opinionated assholes alienating everyone).

Step 4 is obviously gonna be the hardest part, but it'll probably be worth it in the long run, especially for any future events Valve has planned.","1320107199"

"Objectivism","t5_2qjr6","Childs makes an error.  There is nothing incompatible between Objectivism an anarchism.   In fact, you cannot be an Objectivist and NOT be an anarchist... because a state cannot exist without violating people's rights.

Show me a state that exists on a purely voluntary basis-- that makes no demand that its subjects live for its sake, and that deals with all men based in a just way, and I'll show you a company offering its services.  By definition a government has a monopoly on ""justice"" over a geographic area, but the very existence of a monopoly-- created and enforced at the point of a gun-- is the act of subjugating the population in that geographic area, and thus a violation of justice. 

A government cannot exist without demanding that others live for its sake, and if it did-- if a government restricted itself to offering services that people voluntarily could choose or refuse, and only took payment from those who chose to use the services, then you would not be showing me a government, you would be showing me a service corporation.

To fail to be an anarchist is for an objectivist to say that somehow, the entirety of objectivism, and the book, Atlas Shrugged, which spends most of its time concerned with the method by which governments trick people into accepting a moral system that is unjust-- is really a philosophy that makes a magical exception for those who put on hats and claim to be part of a ""government"". 

If you're going to make that claim, show it to me.  In Atlas Shrugged. (not in the writings of a second hander who cannot be bothered to make an argument, like peikoff.)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","My family lived in England for a year when I was in 2nd grade (1st form) and I went to a British school, so I'm at least somewhat familiar with both languages.  I was also kind of a spelling/grammar/syntax nerd as a kid.  No surprise that I ended up as a programmer, since we HAVE to be careful about spelling and syntax!

My favorite story of US/UK language mixups is when my dad complimented a coworker on his ""suspenders"".  Apparently suspenders are braces, and garter belts are suspenders.  No idea what braces are, probably still braces.

Another humorous mixup: Me, a fobby American in my very first athletics class at my new British school.  We were playing football.  I thought I was doing pretty well since I knew athletics=PE and football=soccer.  Unfortunately I didn't actually know anything *else* about football, so when the teacher asked us to ""dribble"" the ball I dribbled it like a basketball.  Whoops.  That was when I learned to just watch what everyone else was doing and copy them.

When we moved on to tennis, they asked if I had any trainers.  Well no, I'm just a poor American kid, I can't afford a trainer just for tennis.  Oh, you mean *tennis shoes*.  At least in this one situation, Americans have the more accurate terminology.","1320107209"

If you leave your wife for this new girl, trust me, you'll be going through this with the new girl in about 7 years from now.

This is the part where you *work* on your marriage, you make an effort to be romantic even if it seems forced, you do stuff together, you do something to spice up your sex life.  It's hard when things have got into a rut, but the only way to make things better is to force it for awhile then it'll start to be natural.

Oh, and the girl, if she is being adorable in every way, is absolutely helping you to feel this way about her, it's not accidental, she wants you and has targeted you.  She seems great because she's figured out what you find attractive in her, and she is playing to that, apparently quite successfully.  Platonic friends don't do that so much.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok, I've been in exactly the same situation, so I'm just going to be blunt:

If it really bothers you how much affection your gf is showing towards this actor, talk to her about it. Just sit her down and let her know exactly how it makes you feel every time she fawns over him. I know for me, it really made me insecure, and like you, I thought that I was just being too sensitive. But honestly, it still tore me up inside every single time. I *couldn't* just make that go away. The best I could do was hide it and pretend everything was alright.

Now phase 2 is the toughie. If, after you tell her the situation, she continues to swoon every time ol' wats-his-face shows up on screen, or, God forbid, she *goes out of her way* to swoon *more* for him, then you should get out quickly. It'll hurt like hell, but you deserve better. Just think about it, at this point she *knows* that it hurts you every time it happens. If she still does it, she is *knowingly* hurting you, and that is a big red flag.

For me, this happened in my first real relationship, and I had always heard that there needed to be a lot of compromising in order to make it work. The problem came up when I discovered I was doing all the compromising and she hadn't changed one damn thing. *I* was expected to change the way I felt when *she* would emotionally throw herself at this guy. Of course, your situation could be entirely different from mine, but I just thought I'd let you know my personal experience which seemed to echo yours.

**tl;dr**: Talk to your girl. If she won't compromise for you, then you probably deserve better.","1320107219"

After some prodding, I  attended the local club (official rules, more formal) every once in a while, and a while later played in my first tournament (where I won the entry level division). I played a few tournaments after that, with good-to-mixed results, and then left the scene because of a girl.

Very infrequently. Under 10 games in the last two years, I'd say. The last game I played was with a friend (tournament player) who was moving out of town and wanted some farewell games. I won 6-1, HA!

I'm from Canada, which has a decent sized competitive scene. A lot travel south of the border for tournaments, too (and the other way around).

lol. This is my favorite set.

&gt;I decide to try out more direct approaches.

By this do you mean going in and trying to use all physical?  Or is it more of a ""Hey.  I think you're hot.  C'mere"" type of open?

&gt;Breaking Rapport Tonality

Granted, I haven't been in enough sets with you to know, but how is your rapport before you break it?  Because your BL is so strong, you may tend to come across as aloof.  In which case girls may be reacting with a defense mechanism of ""Oh, he's too good for me.  I should blow him out before he does the same to me.""  My suggestion would be to soften up just a bit going in.  Not your BL, but with your verbals.  Then, once you get into rapport and not before, break it.  See how that works.

All that said, you're the best judge of what you're doing wrong.  Look at the sets that have worked for you the past week and try to deconstruct them.  i.e., the flappers.  How did you open them and how did they respond?  What were you saying to them?  How were you positioned?  What was your BL?  Maybe you'll have a list of two to three things that worked.  Take those with you into your next set and see if they work again.  Keep adding onto your cake until it's piled to the sky.

Finally, I have two words for you: ""Penis opener.""

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","It works like this.

Omnipotence is impossible because (let's pretend a female god claims to be omnipotent):

1. If she can create a rock she can not lift, she is not all powerful. There is something that exists or could exist that she can not lift.
2. If she can not create a rock she can't lift, there is something she can not create making her less than all powerful.

This paradox that makes it clear that omnipotence impossible.

To your point, I don't think it matters if this un-liftable rock is created or not. The contradiction makes omnipotence impossible not the act of finally creating that rock she can't lift.

Your other point boils down to omnipotence means all powerful even to the point where it overrules logical contradictions. When you do this you have left the rational discussion, abandoned logic and created a semantic argument focused on the meaning of omnipotence rather than if it is possible or not.

On a side note, I don't think there is paradox like this for omniscience which means there is no logical (at least as far as I know) reason omniscience is impossible.","1320107256"

If you make sure that your shit is covered I honestly don't care, but I personally don't like seeing little 16 year olds or big 26 year olds walking around with their thongs hanging out of their ass like a flag.

We stayed together all the way through college, then after we graduated, we ended up breaking up. It might be because the time apart led us to grow into two different people. I felt like she didn't even ""know"" me anymore.

Also, I missed out on a LOT during college. I didn't even flirt with other people. I feel kind of ""forever aloner"" now that i barley have much time or contact with people of similar interest (personal problem). But what I'm trying to say is college is a time to be experiencing things and thinking for yourself, not putting things on the shelf for later. This is a very free time in your life.

If you do decide to break things off, be clean about it. No one knows what can happen in the future. Also, don't get into another relationship the following week. Think about what you want for a while until the shock blows over.

It's very rare for LDR to work out, but if they have a chance then both parties have to be FULLY into it.

* Create a list to post jobs
* Create a map for the calculation results (hence all jobs must have a unique ID, a guid would suffice) 
* Consumers update the map when done
* Some piece of code (lets call it Coordinator for lack of better name) subscribe to the job list. Every time a record it pop'ed with wnp_next it will receive a delete event
* If a record is pop'ed from the job list but the result is not written to the map (it's a idempotent write) in, say, 10 seconds, the Coordinator re-post the job to the list.

The fact real failure here is not that they shorted the securities they sold; it's the fact that they failed to disclose that Citi is shorting them at the same time. Normally, this is a tiny mistake that is inconsequential, but since shit hit the fan and everyone is pointing fingers, Citi can't get away with it.

Let's be honest though... if Citi did everything by the book and disclosed that they shorted these securities, it would be one like in a 100 page document. 99.99% of investors would have gleaned over it and not thought much more.","1320107299"

This is begging the question.  The entire point is that rape is only considered a heinous crime just below, on par, or worse than murder (depending on who you ask) because rape activists have lobbied and campaigned to make it so.  You can't prove that rape isn't a special crime because feminists say so because if you ask anyone, they'll tell you rape is a special crime-- because feminists told them that.","1320107305"

With your build, you hit a few plateaus (you are somewhat weak around the time that you get your zeal, immediately before IE, then again before armor pen, if the enemy team is stacking armor). In other words, Voyboy can trust that he will be competitive with his opponents throughout pretty much every game, whereas for you, if you fall behind, you may have quite a bit of trouble catching up.

As a general rule, Phantom Dancer is not a great item to rush. I like to think of it as hitting somebody with a balloon vs hitting somebody with a sledge hammer. You will do better if you hit someone with a sledge hammer a couple times instead of hitting them with a balloon a whole lot.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","""Logical operators are not defined on points. But still, supposing â¥ for a proof by contradiction is ridiculous! What are you trying to prove here? Â¬â¥?""

Fair enough. I should have defined p to be a point and applied the operator to the statement ""p exists"". Thus, if the operator is not the case for the statement ""p exists"", p both exists and doesn't. Also, I assumed not-T and showed this to be absurd. Thus, T. You say ""T applies to everything"" but you deny that T applies to the world. I'm afraid I don't understand your reasoning. Anyway, we consider p U (R without p). (Note that I tried to type R [backslash] {p}, but Reddit removed the backslash. Thus, I edited my original comment, presumably after you first read it, by replacing all instance of ""R [backslash] {p}"" with ""R without p"".) If p both exists and doesn't exist, we have p U (R without p) is both R and is some other reality not-p U (R without p). Thus, we have two contradictory realities. There can only be one reality however, namely what Langan would term ""the unisect of (p U (R without p)) and (not-p U (R without not-p))"". Ergo, assuming that there's a single inconsistency of the form A = not-A in reality ends up meaning that there's a greater reality containing the inconsistency. Applying the argument repeatedly results in an absurd succession of ever-greater realities. QED.

As for what reality means, I have already provided the definition, âReality is the perceptual aggregate including (1) all scientific observations that ever were and ever will be, and (2) the entire abstract and/or cognitive explanatory infrastructure of perception.â

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I'll second AzMoo's opinion. My introduction to Linux was on Slackware in 1995 as a hobby. I had no unix experience but it looked interesting.
Getting the operating system to the command line INSTALLED was a challenge; I didn't understand the terminlogy, I knew almost nothing about hardware...... there were sooo many things I didn't know. l There was no graphical interface, you had to choose every module you wanted to install ---and that's a chore when you don't understand the modules description (the internet in 1996 wasn't the internet you see today). it probably took me about two weeks to get the system installed to where I could logged into it. maybe another week to successfully log into a bbs. and maybe a month to get X running and configured to my liking.  I had to learn to compile tiny kernels. I learned a lot during this process. But I had to read an awful lot, but it was a hobby and I enjoyed the process.
If I were starting this today using Redhat, I wouldn't have learned near as much because the installation and setup routines are automatic and hides the messy details from you. But it's learning those messy details that can make you stand out from the crowd.

One thing led to another, and she eventually begged for me to fuck her. We did our business, it lasted a while because I was drunk and couldn't finish, so I eventually passed out. When I woke up in the morning, she was on the couch, and told me not to tell anyone about our encounter. I figured she just didn't want her ex to know about it. Anyway, I told some of my friends later that day, and subsequently found out why she didn't want me telling anyone - because she had a thing going on with one of my friends. He was pissed and called her out on it. She ended up coming to my house in a crying, screaming rage. She tried to punch me a few times, and eventually broke my screen door window.

"education","t5_2qhlm","*    What qualities make an effective lesson plan?

Are you saying this is different from an effective lesson?  An effective lesson plan has easy to follow steps (which is to your benefit) and clearly explains what is going on (for the hypothetical observer)

*    How do you/would you present a lesson plan?

I have a template for each class in an Excel document.  At the top is the date and class, then the objectives, then the standards it meets, then the content, activities, closure, and then a section for notes for myself.

    Why are lesson plans important?

To plan your activities and your content ahead of time, to make sure you're doing all of the necessary things teachers need to do like differentiating, appealing to different learning styles, using higher order thinking skills, etc.

*     In what circumstances would you deviate from a lesson plan and start ""winging it?""

  When it becomes my planned activity isn't teaching effectively or when it becomes apparent that the students need some prior knowledge re-taught.

*    How much time and effort do you/would you put into a lesson plan?

It takes me about half an hour to plan for an 80 minute class.  But the template helps a lot.

*     How do you know if a lesson plan is ""good?""

  If it has activities, appeals to different learning styles, differentiates, etc., as above.  As for if a *lesson* is good, if the students are engaged and productive.

*    Is there a specific lesson plan format that you follow, and if so, describe it.

The plan I'm using now is a slightly modified version from Differentiated Instructional Strategies: One Size Doesn't Fit All.  As for the description, see above.

*    Should school administrators ever get involved with lesson planning? Why/why not?

  As others have said, lesson plans show administrators what is going on in your classroom.  That said, an effective, high-quality *lesson* may not necessarily have a beautifully written *lesson plan*.  You may have engaging activities that teach your students plenty, but on your lesson plan it may only appear as some shorthand notes to yourself.","1320107336"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked there in high school and determined that the smell comes from the bread. 

You are probably aware that the bread comes as frozen dough logs and is then cooked in the store. It is not really bread; I think of it as ""quasi"" bread. Like Quasimodo. When cleaning out the cooling racks, I discovered that the crumbs that fall onto the rails begin to ferment (because of all the hot steamy rolls that provide an ideal decomposing environment). This fermenting ""quasi"" bread has a very distinct and strong odor, and ever since I smelled it, I know where the more faint but still intense odor of Subway comes from. It made me hate Subway for about 5 years, but not anymore. I like it. 

So the smell probably comes from fermenting bread crumbs and also just the bread in general as it's being cooked. 

Edit: I should elaborate on why I don't think that Subway bread is real bread. Part of my position just comes from experiencing the bread on an almost daily basis-- an intuition. But also, I think I heard that the bread has no dairy or eggs in it. I should see if that's true. And then there is the obvious reason to doubt it-- why does it make that strange smell?

Edit2: [Here are the bread ingredients (pdf)](http://www.subway.com/Nutrition/Files/usProdIngredients.pdf). No dairy or eggs. Does that mean anything? 

Edit3: I have been informed that bread does not often have eggs and milk. I do not know bread, apparently. But cake has milk and eggs, so I extrapolated. The point is that the smell is bread, and if you want to smell the ""essence of Subway"" stick your face in a cooling rack and sniff the fermenting crumbs.","1320107344"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Virtually ALL meat can be classified as ""free range"". Contrary to popular belief raising meat production livestock in ""cages"" is not cost effective. Pretty much all beef (sans veal) is ""grass fed"" and ""free range"", chickens are raised in massive (sometimes more than a acre in size) barns that are fully open inside. The animals can move around all they want, but they have a life about 3 months long. Hogs are also raised in ""pens"", smaller but they can still move around plenty. 

""free range"" has nothing at all to do with ""what is in the meat"". Again it is illegal to use hormones in meat animal production. Only dairy uses hormones as it is legal to use. When people talk about ""hormones in the meat"" I know they have no idea what they are talking about. Just like ""free range"" also indicated no actual clue about what the term actually means. Antibiotics are comon in poultry production because chickens are walking disease factories. They will up and die (even ""organic free range, local poultry"") love to get sick and kick it when ever possible. Young birds are very fragile and even chicken raised on Organic Joe's Humane Free Range Chicken Farm will try to get sick and die every freakin day of the week. Having raised livestock I can say everything is done for a reason and all the trendy terms and ""kindness"" lables (free range, organic, all natural) are 9 times out of 10 nothing more than a marketing campaign of total BS.","1320107358"

Hence, I say something slanderously negative, and then ask your opinion. That is poisoning the well. If I provide evidence showing that half of the NT is faked, and then ask how it can be used as canon, that is not poisoning the well. If I provided that claim with the sole intent of discrediting Christians and not having a legitimate discussion, that is poisoning the well.(and it must have an implicit conclusion, such as all of Christianity is therefore fake) Do you see the difference?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh man I get way too determined sometimes. For the vast majority of things in life, if you try hard at them then you can succeed. If you try hard and fail, then the solution is to get your ass back up and try again until you are successful. I was taught to work that way and it's worked great for me for most things.

But it does not work when you're trying to win a girl over. And it's very difficult for me to get that out of my head.

Last girl I was trying to woo I did not know when to give up. Admittedly she was leading me on quite a bit with the amount of attention she showed me, and she was Socially Awkward Penguin incarnate so she hadn't really made her intentions (or lack-of) as clear as she should. But still, I should have left it alone.

She had a boyfriend who she'd met online who lived on the other side of the country (Canada, so not a small country) and who she had only met once. The fellow was still in high school and she was 22 or so at the time. The oddness of this led me to believe that I could totally seduce her away from him, since it really did not sound like this was a serious thing. 

Anyway I just kept trying at it. I never actually made a physical move because I didn't want to force her into cheating on him, I just wanted her to dump him and run away with me into the sunset. I asked her a couple times if she would do so, and she declined. She left to go off to Europe to study there for a few months and I packed her an adorable parting gift filled with a bunch of carefully crafted items (inside jokes, things I knew she'd need, etc), along with a note once more stating my intentions.

The best was that while she was away in Europe, valentines day passed. She mentioned that she was bummed that she was going to be alone over there on Valentines day, so I navigated some very confusing Dutch florist websites, did some super sleuthing to find out where she was staying and managed to send some flowers over to her place on Valentines. My grand romantic gesture did not have the desired effect.

**tl;dr:** Girl had a boyfriend, I refused to take no for an answer, bothered her for a year and sent her flowers while she was away in a foreign country. Did not go as planned.

It was a sunny bright day so she had to look at me more intently to see my face and I think she looked me up and down a bit and then just turned back around to the original direction she was facing.  She said something else that I can't quite recall but I said ""I just thought you were cute and wanted to say hi and talk - what's your name?""

That's not the actual point.

The cerumen is there to catch particles before they can accumulate and clog your ears, then skin grows outward about at the speed of nail growth and push the particles out.

What happens when you use a cotton swab is that while inserting it, you push some cerumen in at the same time you take some out (there is no manner of mechanical removal of cerumen that doesn't push on it). If you do that repeatedly, You just keep tapping it in, and the cerumen can come to accumulate, leading to clogging, hearing loss, and infections.

Even if you were capable of not pushing it in, you would remove the keratin layer that controls PH prevents yeasts, fungi, and bacteria from developping in your ear, leading to incurable chronic otitis.","1320107371"

In the world today, all that really matters is money circulation. If the war industry all of sudden ceased to produce and consume, the global economy would be in a very bad state. People need to start seeing the real way the world works as it is today. It's very cold, very calculated, very vindictive. If more people realized this, the Occupy movement would begin doubling the amount of protesters every day. The UN, Congress, various governments around the world are all theatrics to make people believe that humanitarian issues are actually being considered. All that is really in consideration is the ebb and flow of the global economy.

Side note: I'm not paranoid, I'm not crazy, I'm not an angry person. I've wrestled with this for most of my adult life and I actually am in despair that I cannot say ""I'm a crazy, paranoid, lunatic"". This is how the world works and what really upsets me is that people continually and intentionally ignore it because it upsets them too much. When you're upset that much about something systemically wrong with the world, you're supposed to speak up about it. But things have just continued on as usual for decades.

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","SG1 gets better and better as it goes along.  The show loses its footing a bit in season 7 but is still entertaining.

The others are all pretty good, but each show has its own identity and style.  Atlantis is more light-hearted than SG1 and some people interpret that as too cheesy.  Universe was **much** darker than both shows and that turned off a lot of people.  The 1.5 seasons of SGU are pretty poor but its worth watching for the story, because the last half of season two is *really* good.

Avoid the animated series, it is Stargate in name alone.

Generally speaking this is a fair point. But there's a big difference between a romantic relationship and other varieties. For example, sex is generally an element. Her religious views may make that a problem. Another thing to consider is that they are unique insofar as a ""successful"" one tends to end in marriage, which is often followed by children. How they'll be raised matters very much. And where there is a chasm in religious belief, there is ample opportunity for conflict of what is appropriate parenting. So, while I have a few christian friends, and numerous associates and colleagues towards whom I'm perfectly cordial, I would tend to avoid getting romantically involved with anybody of faith.

I'm probably still on some gang task force's surveillance for all I know.  I went to college and used that as an excuse for why I wasn't around as much.  People seemed to be OK with that, or at least, not very upset.  I'd show up to parties and hang around with people, but remove myself from the criminal aspect of it.  Eventually, it became kind of obvious that I didn't want to be putting in work anymore and started getting harassed and threatened about it.  It got to the point that I left the state and started over elsewhere.  It's been a while since that happened so I doubt they're too serious about finding me.

2. Somewhat.  My dad is a former member and was in the gang when I was.  Because he was respected, I was bothered about it, but when I said no to certain things and he backed me up on it, the issue wasn't raised again.  I also have several cousins and two brothers in the gang.  I got that same kind of support from them.  Some girls in gangs are there as sexual play things, but once you earn a name for yourself, a lot of that pressure (verbal or physical) goes away and you're respected.

3. Drugs, extortion (I'd say this is a big one right along with drugs.  Gangs will demand money from businesses, especially small, local ones, for protection), car theft to chop shops, robbery, guns.","1320107381"

For example, in the US, since the Clinton administration, employers have to provide health insurance to all full-time employees.  That's why all the unskilled jobs are now part-time or under the table, which of course leads to many people having two jobs or more.  When insurance is provided by the employer, the employee generally can't choose to get insurance elsewhere.  Just because private companies are involved, that doesn't mean it's ""libertarian"", and just because there are government mandates involved, that doesn't mean it's ""socialism"".  It's just dysfunctional.

"education","t5_2qhlm","-What qualities make an effective lesson plan?

A clearly defined objective and engaging activities to present that objective. 

 -How do you/would you present a lesson plan?

Because I plan for an entire school, four times a week (I teach two specials for 200+kids) My lesson plans for each class boils down to an object for each class and a short phrase/description of how I'm going to teach that activity. 
    
-Why are lesson plans important?
   I would be lost without them. It helps me organize my thoughts for the week, as well as my overarching goals for my curriculum. 

- In what circumstances would you deviate from a lesson plan and start ""winging it?""

   If I'm really truly sure that my kids have no idea what is going on, or if it feels like I'm failing big time. 

-How much time and effort do you/would you put into a lesson plan?
 I usually spend 3-5 hours on a weekend doing my plans for the week. 

 -How do you know if a lesson plan is ""good?""
  If my kids demonstrate that they learned what I said I was teaching.
   
- Is there a specific lesson plan format that you follow, and if so, describe it.

I do a modified madeline hunter plan for observations, but other than that I do not follow a formal template unless I need to turn in formal lesson plans for when my boss observes me. I found that once I was 2/3 years out, formal lesson plans actually hinder your ability to be effective. 
    
-Should school administrators ever get involved with lesson planning? Why/why not?

 Only if there's a teacher who needs the help. Most of the time people's planning styles differ so wildly that it doesn't make sense to impose someone's style on someone else- it might make them less effective.

"food","t5_2qh55","Most soups freeze just fine.  One exception is one of my faves, beer broccoli cheese but it keeps well in the fridge for a week or more. 

The Whole Paycheck market had chanterelles on sale for $4.99 / lb. so I got a bunch of those and some button mushrooms and some shitaakes too.  I had some leeks so I used those but onion would work fine too, sauteed in butter.  Saute most of the coarsely chopped shroom in butter until they just start to brown.  Add fresh thyme leaves from half a dozen sprigs. Add water or vegetable broth or better yet mushroom broth.  Simmer for ... however long you like.  Thicken with beurre manie or Wondra flour.  Add some cream to gild the lily. Correct seasoning. Have with a crusty roll and some greens.  FABulous lunch.   

Today I simmered some smoke pork neck bones in a big pot of water for an hour or two. Remove the bones to cool. In another big pot saute mirepoix - 50% diced onion, 1/4 each diced carrot and celery - in butter or olive oyl until tender. I like to add some extra carrots too. Pick the meat off the bones.  BTW, you can do this with ham hocks as well.  You can add some flour to the veg and cook for a few minutes at this stage OR you can thicken it later. Add the meat to the pot and season liberally with fresh ground black pepper. DO NOT ADD SALT - the broth may be quite salty. Add the broth to the pot and bring to the boil. If you re using soaked, dried beans add them at this point. Reduce heat and simmer for a good while.  If you didn't use dried beans, add canned white beans - cannelini or navy or great northern. If you didn't add flour earlier, thicken it now with beurre manie or Wondra flour.  Remember - when thickening with flour, the soup MUST come to the boil to activate the flour. 

Google ""hearty soups"", you'll find some good ones. ","1320107405"

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","From my understanding, the point of 'transmission' is a realisation / awareness achieved by the student. (I am not discounting that a transfer of something intangible could happen)

This concept is used in the Bujinkan's Godan test, where the student meditates before rolling out of the way of a sword cut coming from behind. The traditional stories say the 'transmission' of the master's teachings occurs before the sword cut, and in that moment of awareness, the student knows when to roll away. 

I've been fortunate enough to have seen the Godan test undertaken by a number of people. You can see the difference in those who are successful. Through their relaxation and awareness, they are tuned in to 'something'. In this particular case, I do not necessarily think it is the teaching of the person swinging the sword (now a wooden sword, thankfully).

I think it is more of a case where the student tunes into their own self and ceases separating body, spirit and mind. Through this stillness and peace, and being in a state of 'receiving', they come to a point of self realization and awareness. Through self reflection and listening to our own body, we can become our own teacher. 

So in a nutshell, I think the transfer is the point at which your teacher, who is guiding you down a path, puts you into an environment where you can achieve awareness.","1320107418"

But the employer can apply to have the protection removed and anyone striking without that protection could be sacked. So you have a balance between the employer being able to protect themselves and the employees being able to stand up for themselves.

Note that with the Qantas dispute, they could have applied to have the protection removed but they knew they wouldn't get it because it wasn't causing enough problems to be able to support such an application. The only action the pilots union had taken was to wear red ties and engineers were on an overtime ban (which they lifted) so the unions were actually obeying the law and being quite generous to the company. The stop work meetings were also held with the legally required notice. That's why Qantas went down the road it did (holding the economy to ransom all but forces the FWA to ban all industrial action).","1320107421"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I had to read up on agorist counter-economics. I just skimmed the wikis, but I do agree that separating ourselves from this 'mainstream' economy is an extremely powerful act. Although I also see that as a form of protest. I also see that the grey/black markets provide a freer market than our mainstream market will probably ever provide. I think bartering and competitive currencies are great, and I hope the idea of local food and energy becomes more common.

Agreed. It is a form of protest, and pretty effective too.  It's a great addition to the effort to end corporatism. The black and gray markets are growing and have been since this whole fiasco started.  The other prong of that attack centers around tax avoidance, so it takes away additional power from the government to just bail out institutions.  The dollar begins to matter less when you're not using it and are using something like bitcoin or some other currency instead.

&gt;As a tangent, I'm very excited to see that Oakland is arranging what may end up being the first of many massive strike on November 2nd. I wonder if you're anti-union. I want the whole country to strike and refuse to spend a single penny. I want 10,000 people sit-ins on freeway exchanges and airport runways.

No, I'm not anti-union.  What I don't like is the fact that they have US laws backing them up and they can attach themselves to industry and compel people to join; OTOH corporations get special privileges as well - that is, the privilege to externalize their losses - so I see no reason to protest one without protesting the other.  I'd rather neither group had special privileges and I don't think there's a good balance there, but I certainly don't oppose unions because I oppose people getting together and demanding better working conditions and more pay.  I see nothing wrong with that in principle. I just oppose government-mandated preferential treatment.  

&gt;Can you explain to me how the state is inherently violent? I'm not sure exactly what you mean. I certainly don't support initiating wars, period. I don't support the drug war. I support the concept of income tax to an extent. I don't support a company trashing the environment (even if they own the land) because the pollution always affects other people and disrespectful to this spaceship we call Earth. I don't support corporations writing bills for our representatives to pass into laws. I have doubts as to whether any corporation should ever be bigger than the government. I don't support the TSA, but I might support the idea of privatizing it even less (it would be heavily subsidized, and still theatrics.). I don't trust the government to regulate the internet, but I also highly distrust the corporations to regulate themselves, on our infrastructure no less.

Well, the way I see it government has a monopoly on violence, and that should only be applied against people who are violent.  There should be a certain level of care in choosing such solutions.  The good guy doesn't go out and shoot people for smoking pot or engaging in any other behavior that doesn't harm others.  I feel if you have to force someone to do something at the point of a gun or threaten them with imprisonment, it probably isn't a good idea to begin with.  Nevertheless, I agree with everything you said here.

&gt;I'm afraid that you're right: The protests will become more violent, but I also think it's past due. It's not because the movement is inherently violent though. It's because the 1% know how pissed the rest of us are going to be when we finally figure out how badly they've been taking advantage of us. They've spent the last decade preparingâ¦ Deploying LRADs and microwave pain rays and Rapiscanners. Trying to keep us ignorant for as long as possible as they militarize our police forces and loot our economy. They've known the day is coming for longer than we have. In part, the violence will also be an effort to emulate the struggles and courage of the people in the Middle East recently. I feel that the situations are clearly apples to oranges, but also that the struggle is the same.

This is why I principally call for counter-economics.  There are voluntary ways to deprive rich people of their wealth *without* just taking it from them - no violence necessary.  If rich people are all using dollars and then the 99% switches to another currency and refuses the currency of the rich in such an economy, then you have made all of their money worthless without even laying a finger on them.  Refuse their currency and then they can't buy anything.

  If you think the rich don't provide value, stop accepting their currency.  Stop playing their game.  If a competing currency is sufficiently well-protected from confiscation, none of your hard work will flow into their coffers either because the banks can't just conjure it out of the ether.  It's a revolution without violence or coercion.  If our current monetary system isn't benefiting people in a fair way, then I don't see why the 99% should be forced to deal in it and keep playing a game that's stacked against them.  They need to create their own game, and violence should only be employed if someone tries to violently *prevent them from voluntarily trading with each other*.

&gt;By requesting a permit to be issued from the entity that you wish to criticize, does that not lend credibility to the entity itself? Where should 10,000 or 100,000 or 1,000,000 people gather to exercise their rights?

On public property where their rights should be fully protected and on private property where it's allowed.  I don't agree with running into banks and raising hell though (just be calm, collected, and withdraw your money in peace and then leave), and I don't agree with blocking roadways and bridges so other people can't move freely.  They have the right to travel without being detained or forced to serve as a captive audience as well, after all.

&gt;I look forward to your reply and to future discussions. I may not reply, as it has become rather time consuming! Thanks for the discussion. :-)

No problem.  You have some very interesting ideas.

Some ladies have very easy pregnancies and can really focus on the whole joy etc etc, while some ladies have trouble during pregnancy. Neither camp loves their kids more or less. Neither camp is a winner or loser at the pregnancy game.

There are many aspects of pregnancy that can be cool, really touching, and there are other aspects that are just fucking gross, that no one cross-stitches on a pillow.

Another thing to keep in mind is that pregnancy hormones are powerful things. I mean, the government should regulate them as controlled substances.

[this](http://perfecthealthdiet.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Food-Plate-600dpi.jpg) chart is a good breakdown. paleo is my destination as well and i pretty much eat paleo now because i regularly include starches into my diet. i find as long as you avoid crappy carbs like grains and sugar, you should still be in control of your cravings and will still be able to resist bad carbs.","1320107452"

But if someone doesn't want to believe that, fine, they can remain willfully ignorant. So long as they don't try to teach the alternatives as science, I don't care what they believe. 

Also, being raised in Salt Lake City, I've had plenty of interactions with Mormons.  Hell, I was inches from being baptized into the church when I was a child.  The fact that the religion is fairly young in comparison to Catholicism or any other religion is going to immediately make it more open to scrutiny.  How do you feel about Scientology?

"science","t5_mouw","Calorie restriction, or CR as some practitioners call it, is not new. Most of the early adopters started doing it after the results came back on the increased lifespan of calorie restricted mice, some of those people being the actual researchers.

The problem, if I recall correctly, is that the greater the restriction, the more pronounced the effect. The most motivated have gone to the extreme of using software and monitoring their ""output"" to get their calorie intake as low as possible while trying to avoid malnutrition. 

The goal seemed to be less than 1000 calories a day. At this point, you suffer from muscle atrophy, lethargy, cold sensitivity, etc. Because you lack ""padding"" in the form of soft tissue, many types of seating become uncomfortable.

Its rather extreme.

As one simple counter point, answer this: How long did the biblical flood last?  How do you reconcile that with a local flood?

"javahelp","t5_2t1jq","What you are referring to is [Variable Scope](http://www.java2s.com/Tutorial/Java/0020__Language/VariableScope.htm). You can read more about it at that link or searching on Google.

A good rule of thumb is that a variable can only be referenced within the bracketed section it was created and within the inner sections it might contain. What you have to watch our for is if you create another variable with the same name. Silly example:

    for (int i=0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        if (i==9) {
            int i=0;
            // if you refer to i in this code section
            // you get the 0 version
        }
        // if you refer to i out here
        // you get the version from the for statement
    }
    // the i variable will be gone here since it is outside the for loop
    // unless it was declared elsewhere previously

Not sure why it is misinterpreting my less than sign '&lt;' there, but hopefully that gives you an idea.

Try to avoid using the same variable names generally, except for the ones in 'for' statements or other throwaway cases. In the code above, if I really needed a variable to do something if i==9, I would name the second variable 'j'.","1320107458"

While there is a lot of potential for food production in the suburbs (simply because of all those yards), if we really wanted them to be sustainable, we'd move all the suburban dwellers into the city, where'd theyll lower their footprint whether they know it or not .  I think the values of the smart growth movement (mixed-use areas, walkability, urban density, directing development into the urban core and away from undeveloped land, etc) are very much aligned with the principles of permaculture, but im not sure where permaculture would fit food production into the equation.  
I mean, lets say theres a block of vacant buildings in the urban core.  Would permaculture turn that space into a forest garden? or would it move people into the building, thus decreasing the suburban population, and then convert the newly emptied suburban ring into the food forest? 
And for that matter, would the city have a growth boundary? Growth boundaries are essentially imposing a concrete line into a dynamic system, which permaculture doesn't do, but its also limiting development and protecting wild lands.  ","1320107462"

Even gluten intolerance or celic issues can have bizarre manifestations.  I recently read a study about a number of women who had repeated infertility problems or miscarriages ended up (long story short) find out that it was a problem with gluten.  They eliminated gluten and were able to conceive in about six months.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","&gt;What's your favorite setup?

Pilot

* Upgrade: Air Radar
* Gadget: Extinguisher
* Weapon: Heat Seekers

Gunner

* Upgrade: Maintenance
* Gadget: Thermal Optics
* Weapon: TV Missile

&gt;What setup gets you the most points?

The one I use currently :D . For pilot air radar lets me see all vehicles within a certain area which is really nice. Extinguisher lets me stay in the air longer than flares do. If I get down below 50% I can pop extinguisher and heal up somewhere away from the action. With IR Flares you have to land and repair once you get down past 50%. Heat Seekers are the only weapon for the pilot and that is a must.

For gunner maintenance helps the helicopter recover faster which helps out. Thermal optics light up any vehicle and person (they show up as white). This really helps with people cause it is hard to see them usually when flying. TV Missile is the last unlock and it has a further range than guided missiles and can travel a further distance than guided missiles. You don't have to be as close to your target to hit it. Use guided missiles when you don't have TV missiles.

&gt;What one tip helped you get all teh unlocks?

Practice. I first learned how to fly during the second CO-OP mission. My partner went AFK and I did the whole mission in the pilot seat. After that I just kept playing on a Caspian Border only server. Getting all the unlocks. One thing that you really need to get down is control of the helicopter. Being able to slowly hover over to a tank unleash a volley of rockets behind it disabling it, flying past it and quickly turning around, firing another volley of rockets to finish it off is a really good skill to learn. (This also helps with those pesky AA tanks, sneak up behind it and doing this technique helps take them down quickly without really damaging yourself).

&gt;How do all-unlocked choppers stand up to all-unlocked jets?

I don't really know because I don't think I have fought an all-unlocked jet. However jets can be annoying if they see you from far away. The best tactic is to get down low and fly fast in the direction the jet is coming from. They turn around slowly so if you fly under them going in the opposite direction as them, they usually lose sight of you.","1320107487"

Well, there was once an awesome company called Westwood Studios that made some *really* awesome video games. Command and Conquer (Tiberium Dawn), Tiberium Sun, Red Alert, Red Alert 2 (: Yuri's Revenge), Earth and Beyond (ok...buggy as shit, but a really fun MMO in a lot of ways, and very clever in that subtle WW way), and Renegade.

What did EA do to this awesome game developer? They closed them. Fuck EA until the end of time. And, to add insult to injury, they released these abominations under the C&amp;C Title like ""Generals"" (In the Warhammer realm, we'd call this a heresy). And Tiberium...something 4. And ""Kane's Wrath"". I will give them credit for bringing back Joseph Kucan...but not enough to every buy, play, or recommend those games.

"StonerEngineering","t5_2slm7","If you're using a dremel, you probably just start with a smaller hole and grind your way outward until you reach your size.

The best/easiest/most reliable way to get a good clean hole which is very round and of the proper size would be to use diamond bore bits, but those aren't really made for use with a dremel.  Good with a drill, best with a drill press.  Just make sure you hold everything steady, don't change angles while you're drilling and don't go too fast.  Then go even slower when you're about to break through.

Also, if you want your diamond bits to last, it's best to work wet.  I used to build a little dam out of clay around where I was drilling the hole, and fill it with water.  This lubricates the cut and cools the tool, both of which improve the cleanliness of the finished hole and the life of your tool.

I forget the exact sizing for the holes though... I think that it's something like 1/4"" larger than your downstem OD for the standard grommets you get at a headshop.  If you have/ can get a hole of a pair of calipers, it'd be pretty easy to measure the OD of the grommet on the downstem.  Then drill your hole very slightly smaller than that (Like .05"" on the diameter)","1320107504"

"swtor","t5_2qxih","I keep seeing you use this r/gaming comparison, but there's something you're either not noticing or are deliberately not mentioning.

r/gaming is a very generalized concept.  The scope of what could possibly be considered relevant there is enormous.  When you couple this with a such a high number of subscribers, eventually you're just not going to be able to connect with that much of the people reading the subreddit with anything specific to one game.  Amusing memes, comics, etc, however, will appeal to a larger segment of the population because even if it's related to a game they don't play they can still get a laugh.

With this subreddit, that sort of massive scope and wildly varying tastes among readers just is not going to happen.  We're dealing with one specific game, and no matter how popular SWTOR becomes this subreddit will never even begin to approach the 800,000+ readers r/gaming has.  Hell, even r/wow only has a little over 24,000 right now.  The overall size of a subreddit regarding the subject matter it covers, and how many people are reading it, contribute, I think, a great deal to how much it turns into ""meme central"" to use your term.","1320107513"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; The crown is still rusty because all the polish was used on the jewels.

So basically, you're ignoring the point about heavy-handed central planning being involved (not exactly representative of ""economic liberalization"") and instead going to complain that too much focus was given to the East coast.

In that case,

real effort and focus is being moved Westward. E.g. A lot of planning is going into making Chengdu into a tech hub, for instance.

It's easy for casual, cynical observers to claim that ""oh, all the money is going to be lost to corruption"", but as someone with family in Chengdu and who visits often, I can say that the change is visible and undeniable.

They're trying to do what took decades of evolution for US economic power centers. Rather than just let certain cities ""liberalize"", they need to build the social and physical infrastructure and then ""sell"" the place to foreign investors. Sure, perhaps if we wait many, many decades, Chengdu may have naturally evolved into a global tech hub like Silicon Valley, but instead, the Party and even more impatient people like yourself want immediate results. It makes sense for them to want to push for this, because Chengdu and other major population centers deeper in the mainland are not coastal cities and transportation costs are much higher. Technology, software, services, etc are weightless and not burdened by transportation costs, so they aren't as unattractive to certain foreign corporations as east coast cities.

There are reasons why certain cities were picked and others weren't. It wasn't random. Major population centers like Chengdu can be successful, but not for the same reasons Shanghai can. That's understandable, isn't it?

This is just one of many examples of effort shifting concentration of investment westward, and to anyone paying attention to the nation-wide implementation of Hu's ""Harmonious Society"", it was obvious and foreseeable. What you're essentially complaining about is that this isn't going fast enough?","1320107520"

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","Said this a few times before, but this argument happens so often.

One side says that rage comics, memes add little to the subreddit. Typical arguments include calling the content incredibly shallow, provoking anecdotal and shallower-yet ""Oh yeah, that happened to me too!"" types of discussions, where a lot is typed, but *nothing is really being said*.

Another side will say that reddit is democracy with typical arguments such as ""if you don't like it, you can just downvote or hide the content you don't like"" - which never really works once the subscriber count hits somewhere over 10,000. Hiding content doesn't really matter either, since all the ""discussion"" is happening in threads you can no longer see, and you can't keep up to date with all the stupid memes people are referencing, which is a blessing and a curse.

Another side will defend the posts, their reasoning being that if people didn't like it, people wouldn't upvote it, which is similar to the previous argument. They'd usually say that anything tangentially-somewhat-almost-kinda related to the Battlefield series is considered 'acceptable', and that they like having a laugh every now and then and it shouldn't always be serious business.

Another side will suggest the subreddit be split in two, or three... but this subreddit is not big enough for that yet, and realistically never will be.

One of the core arguments for *both* sides will be that memes and other such content are ""easily digestible"". One side feels that it's (as I mentioned before) too shallow and attracts lots of quick glances upvotes, leaving more lengthier posts unread (because you can upvote 10 memes before you read 1 decent post). The other side will feel that it's an effective method of communication, capable of creating discussions, and connecting people through the portrayal of abstract concepts, experiences, feelings, or *whatever* without having to actually *say* anything.

We go round and round until the mods either do nothing, or pick a side, then switch sides briefly due to the backlash, and then end up back in the middle with something posted up on the sidebar. Nothing is ever resolved, *unless* the mods actually moderate, which won't happen.","1320107535"

Instead, think what it empowers others to do, that you might directly benefit from.

Phone not supported by your carrier anymore? Free software enables someone to create a version of the latest mobile operating system that will run on your ageing device, bringing you all the benefits the newer system has to offer.

Need to use a piece of hardware to get something done? What if the company has crappy drivers, or doesn't care about updating drivers for older hardware. These things may even have security vulnerabilities that leave you exposed to viruses. If they are free software, someone can fix them, and protect you in the process.

Just because you can modify the code, doesn't mean you should do. But you better believe it's in your best interests for things to be free from corporate (or individual) control.

Imagine if you bought a house and couldn't decorate the walls, upgrade the kitchen to what you wanted, or change your bathroom suite to something more to your taste.

Dwayne Bowe is a strong WR who is hard to stop, but the Chargers DBs are rather pedestrian, so there's no real compelling matchup here as those guys are simply serviceable. 

Barry Richardson is a decent RT and Shaun Philips is a stud, so there might be a good battle there trying to protect Cassel.

None of the Chiefs RBs are particularly special, but then again, neither are any of the Chargers LBs.

Brandon Flowers is a good CB and the Chargers could have trouble throwing at him, but Rivers is good and even if it's Floyd and not Vincent Jackson, I doubt it'll be that big of a deal.

Ryan Mathews shredded these guys last time. While Derrick Johnson is a pretty special LB, he plays on the weak inside and Mathews likes to go on the strong side.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","My problem is Marcou's complete failure to protect the legitimacy of LoL as an e-Sport.

Here's what I added onto the thread, I feel Reddit might appreciate the conversation more than the LoL forums:

&gt;You've [Matt Marcou] done a serious disservice to anyone who has invested any time to this game as a credible, high-end, competitive e-sport. You should be at the forefront of defending the legitimacy of LoL at high level play, and you have failed in that regard.

&gt;Egregious manipulation of the rules, whether you are directly guilty of such infraction, seriously discredit League in the eyes of viewers and sponsors. As e-Sports Manager, it is your job to ensure that LoL provides a fun and credible experience for the audience AND players.

&gt;Don't forget that LoL isn't the only MOBA on the scene; DotA 2 is on the horizon and it is built from the group up to be e-Sports friendly. How can League compete and thrive against such titles when Riot does not care to defend the legitimacy of its flagship game?

The district manger should have figured something was up when 6 of the 9 staff quit after this guy took over the job from the last store manager.  He was definitely a first grade asshole.  

The other two I spent at a store in the same mall selling neck ties and women's scarves.  The only customer service experience that's actually worth remembering is talking to an older gentleman when the store was slow.  We started talking about WW2 and he told me that two of his brothers were killed in it, including one who got mowed down by machine gun fire before he could get off the boat on D-day.  Kind of ruined the rest of the day for me, but nice chatting with him.

I guess I'm old enough to look back on my retail days with rose coloured glasses, but all in all, it was an interesting time that helped me to figure out some of the crazy things that people do - especially around the holidays.

Buying bottled water is hardly a solution. Here in the first world, as you say, I have a right to drinking water that comes straight to my house.... and I see no reason why there should be any medicinal additives in it.

**You've not answered my questions.** And please do because I'm curious:

* If we switched to a system whereby water was not fluoridated, but you had, by law, to ingest fluoride supplements every time you drank water out of the tap, would you concede?

* If not: why not and what's the difference?

* If yes: how about other supplements -- magnesium, calcium, vitamin C?

* Why not add lithium to water? The risks, much like fluoride, are negligible; and the benefits are well supported by evidence: lower impulsivity and aggression through the population. â More people die of violent crimes than do of tooth decay... so, if anything, adding lithium to our water supply should get an even higher rating of approval from you.

Replace the amperage rating stickers so they are indistinguishable from the originals.  Whenever they un-frugally use too much electricity, the breakers will trip automatically, shutting off the power.

*  To help heating and cooling efficiency, keep hot or cold air inside the house by sealing all the windows shut with 2-part epoxy.

*  Replace all of the spark plugs in all of the family cars.  Then, re-gap the old plugs to twice the manufacturer gap rating.  Install the re-gapped plugs as needed to keep the family using only one car.  This encourages carpooling and reduces transportation costs.

*  To conserve water, never shower or flush the toilet.  

*  If your family has pets, secretly poison them all with D-Con to save money on pet food and veterinary care.  The same remedy can reduce spending on home care for deadbeat grandparents still living at home.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","CV offers you global vision every minute or so? It gives you the early game  advantage seeing what items your enemy picks, can act as a ward for your lane as well as any other lane. 

CV, if the support is familiar with the enemy jungler route, can be used to track the jungler. This means your team can counter jungler him or know when to expect ganks, effectively making him useless. 

CV also provide vision inside bushes rendering bush juking worthless. Compared to all of the other summoner spells, with the exception of flash, CV is probably the most powerful spell due to its short CD.

If CV were to grant true vision, why not just drop it at the team fights to avoid shaco and eve ganks? Chasing an enemy? Good thing you can see where the shrooms and other traps are.

Why not as noticeable in solo queue, CV is extremely powerful in organized teams, especially in higher levels of play.","1320107572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll be able to at least switch to suboxone if I have to, for myself or someone else. Even if I can't, I'm not really afraid of suicide as an escape.

And I don't see a purpose in life as a whole, much less in my individual life. Human life will come to an end at some point, with very little impact in the large scheme of things being affected. True, I probably won't make any great medical discoveries, but I probably wouldn't have done so any way. I'm going to school to be a god damn CPA.

The only purpose I will ever have is those close to me, and right now, they don't mind. Like I said, I would quit instantly if I had a kid or a pregnant partner, but I have no intention of getting myself in that situation.
 
I hope you don't get frustrated talking with me. From what I've discovered about myself, mainly through the introspection this thread has invoked, life is much less sacred to me than your ""average""....redditor at least. I'm assuming with my current disposition, there's not much that can be said to make me stop. There's not much said that can make me feel like my life ever had purpose to begin with.

I'm the son of 2 Junkies. Nephew of a Junkie. Boyfriend of a Junkie. Best friend of a Junkie. Friend to multiple Junkies. And we can't forget all of those alcoholics in my life who just never got the chance to enjoy being Junkies.

I chose to be a junkie. It's what I want to be right now. I don't want to ever be dopesick, but it comes with the territory. My life is a waste. But I don't think it's anymore of a waste than the majority of the other 7 billion people on this planet. I mean hey, at least I'm nice, generous, productive, and a good friend. I don't think there's much more to say unless you can think of something.","1320107593"

Since haskell favors function composition, a seasoned programmer will combine a pair of curried functions, will lift the result, map it and filter inline whenever he needs it. A python programer will define a function to curry and compose both functions, and another one for the lift.

So, haskell expresivity and haskell power is newbie-unfriendly.","1320107604"

Human nature has nothing to do with our hang ups about nudity or sex. It has only recently (with the growing popularity of monotheistic religions) become unacceptable to be nude. My *opinion* of the matter is that society's codes of conduct stem from religion, not human nature. When you look at what is considered ""bad"", it is often from a religious stand point (ie: having sex before marriage, nudity, menstrual cycles, magic, sex in general, anything out of the ordinary basically.) 
If you look at the Greek and Romans you will notice that they were unabashed by a lack of clothing (hence why you see nudity in much of their art) they understood the beauty of the human form and I believe that has to do with their polytheistic society.

I am sympathetic to the goals of OWS in general, however not every organization tries to hold itself to such high ideals when it comes to public protest. Their voices need to be heard, but there also need to be rules to make sure that the demonstrations do not begin to interfere with the day to day activities of the area. 

Furthermore, in the event that two or more groups wish to protest opposite causes at the same time, these rules that we have already setup aim to provide the opposing platforms with equal public footing. Making special arrangements for a group because they are more well liked in the public eye may seem noble, but this would open the floodgates to a myriad of public debate about what constitutes a cause worthy of special treatment. It's far better, in my opinion, to leverage a flat law that states the treatment of all groups rather than the ones we believe are special.  ","1320107621"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; One of Krugman's main points in the article cited by the OP is that military spending is not the most preferable fiscal stimulus because it consists of implements of destruction or at best weapons that will never be used. He clearly favors investment in infrastructure and human capital to military spending. Pulling up his past descriptions of military spending as a workable fiscal stimulus in the past doesn't overcome the fact that in the above column and various other writings he has said that it is not his preferred fiscal stimulus.

you should find it alarming that he considers the act of destroying humans and the things they build a ""fiscal stimulus"" at all.

&gt; Krugman says nothing about the destruction of Europe (not to mention China, Japan and other areas of the world) being a public works program. His claim is that the U.S. government brought the U.S. economy to full employment by building war machines in the United States.

it should inform you as to the total emptiness of his conscience, that he considers the construction of a war machine to be a net positive for an economy.  **war does not contribute anything to an economy - it simply redirects money that would have gone to fund schools, businesses, firefighters, etc., to building weapons and destroying innocent people's lives.**

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Blue carpet juniper!   Mall-bought blue carpet junipers are often no more than sticks in dirt, but that doesn't seem to be an issue here.  Good looking starter, some roots just above the soil line.

The pot looks like it has water on the right side, making me think the pot is a split style with a water/rock section separated from the dirt on the left.  If there is no hard separator and the dirt and water are in contact, the water will over-saturate the dirt on the left, causing the roots to rot.  So double check this, and drain the water if there isn't a solid divider and the soil is soaking.

Bonsai are generally potted in quick-draining soil with a mix of organic humus, rough grit, and sand to help drainage.  Keeping the soil from drying out completely is important, but you don't want it constantly wet either.  Junipers are a temperate species, and can handle some dry conditions - unlike another common starter bonsai species, the ficus.  You'll want to let the soil dry out visibly before watering *thoroughly* - I prefer filling a larger plastic tub and sitting the tree in it for ~~a minute~~ a few seconds to really get the soil wet without it all running off the top; but any sort of slow watering that will really wet everything will do the job.  edit: if those smaller stones/pebbles are glued on top of the soil, remove them.  if they're just sitting on top, that's cool.

Is there a drainage hole in the bottom of the pot?  If not, you'll need to switch pots.  If so, set up a larger tray with light rocks for this pot to sit in.  This does two things - increases the light hitting the tree, and also keeps the potted soil from sitting in the water after you've wet the soil (this would again promote root rot).  For some species, hydration trays (same as I just described, but with water in them all the time) are important to keep an area of humidity around the tree, but for this species, it shouldn't be needed.  Plus that water area in this pot should provide a little air humidity anyway!

What is the copper wire connected to?  does it just head into the dirt?  If so, it's likely holding the roots and the tree to the pot, and should be left alone.

Shaping the tree over time will employ both annual pruning and wiring; this is in a wind-swept style so far; a favorite for blue carpet juniper as they bend like this naturally.  The goal is to make the tree look aesthetically pleasing and old, with enough open spaces ""for the birds to fly through"".

I recommend getting a book on bonsai with species-specific recommendations.  I'm travelling at the moment, and don't have access to my books, but the things to look up:  Watering scheduling in summer and winter, re-potting schedule (with rules on root pruning restrictions), pruning schedule (and how to prune to limit the chance of infection), common pests and treatments.    One I really like is :  The Creative Art of Bonsai by Isabelle and RÃ©my Samson

As for the broader point, it's hard for an organization who preaches poverty in this life to receive glory in the next life to maintain relevance to a society which doesn't really believe in an afterlife and is frankly pissed that they have to deal with poverty in this life.

The MSI and Sparkle Calibre cards have great reputations.  The Sparkle cards actually seem to have a little bit better reputation with the more extreme overclockers.

If you're willing to spend that little extra, I'd also take a look at the Sapphire 6950 Toxic, MSI 6950 Twin Frozr III, or Sapphire 6950 Dirt3 Edition.  The first two should unlock to a 6970 and the third has a good chance of doing so.  The 6950 at stock is a better card than the GTX 560 Ti and a 6970 is even better.

It also fails to meet the ""Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives"" criterion, meaning that if X were winning and Y losing, adding an extra candidate Z could result in Y winning. In my opinion this is unreasonable behavior.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","That chart used data from player testimonies in other games. Don't get me wrong, I've disliked ESL as an organisation for a very long time, but as it's only recently come to your attention, it should probably be made clear that for the past ten+ years major organisations have not been paying out their prize pools. ESL was once heralded as one of the better organisations, with guaranteed prize money.

Also are you only taking StarCraft II into account? With SC2 being on the ESL stage for around a year and a half with the first few events being paid, we know that they probably have a maximum of a year withholding the money. Or are you taking into account other games aswell? Because, if so, then you should note that GOM have been known for being very late with their cheques for World of Warcraft when it was competitive.

In all honesty, winnings should be distributed into the bank accounts of the player as fast as possible. That's the ideal scenario, but for whatever reason a lot of major organisations don't work that way. Whether it be a year or two months, I don't see why they're not all tarred with the same brush, unless it's under exceptional circumstances.

Antimatter is the opposite of matter in every way, so it is repelled by a gravitational field. Therefore when you finish a donut, the hole actually floats away.

Religion has however been used to justify the killing of millions. If religious people accept religion then they're accepting the scientific method as a way of understanding the universe. Theology does evolve to a certain extent and yet we have many Christians who still believe the world is 6,000 years old and that homosexuals are evil. 

Science has a well defined way of testing the hypothesis, religion has no way of proving or disproving the majority of its claims. Given this fact it would seem wiser to trust what science has to say about the universe and less wise to trust religion has to say it.

Even 6 bins a day at $25 per bin is $150 a day. Granted you'll only have a job for a little bit as apple picking season doesn't last forever, but if $150 a day should be enough a decent standard of living.","1320107675"
"politics","t5_2cneq","This issue is a poison pill politically. 

The people who oppose Marijuana legalization are:

- Highly organized
- Able to make a purely emotional argument
- Able to distort and twist statistics pretty much at will, because they're playing to the confirmation bias of their target audience 
- Likely to be influenced in large part by this issue when it comes to the ballot box.

If Obama continues opposing legalization then it can't be used as a wedge issue in November 2012. I know that's disappointing but it's elementary electoral calculus. The political capital he stands to lose from supporting Marijuana are far, far greater than that which he'd gain by aligning with the pro-MJ movement.

Also I would like to bind the enemy timers to hotkeys as well. I think Shift + whatever would be the easiest way to hotkey those, but I can't find where that's possible.

I would also like a hotkey to hide/unhide so I can leave it on all the time in the background and just pop it back up when I jungle.

Also, adding more things to track (such as Flash, teleport, exhaust, etc.) would be awesome. I assume the majority of the coding is done you'd just need a good picture and then to add it so it can be called. I am useless at coding but if you need any help I would definitely be willing to test some stuff.

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","I would argue that Paul is the only candidate who isn't going to cut your benefits.  You see inflation has been running around 10% per year according to the formula that the government used in 1981.  According to their new formula it is much lower, around 2%.  So each year they increase the benefits by 2% (or change the threshold to get them by 2%).  So that is like an 8% cut every year.  You benefit checks buy less and less every year.

Paul is going to stabilize the monetary base.  This will allow the economy to surge.  Yes, he would like for his successors to cut the benefits (he isn't going to do it) eventually (I am thinking a decade or two) but by then the economy should be booming and you will be well-established in your career.

Basically Paul would like to cut benefits but he knows that you can't just suddenly cut benefits without replacing them with a booming economy.  So he is going to focus on getting the economy going and then hopefully future presidents will cut the benefits to keep the economy going even stronger.  Paul is the only candidate who won't cut your benefits.

edit: I know what it is like.  I have gotten quite a bit of government money over the years but I still strongly support Paul.","1320107696"

Normals are faces of triangles and describe which way it's facing and angle that light bounce off of it. Standard triangle works like just flat surface, but with special texture (normal map, or bump map) program will calculate how light is bouncing not from how triangle is positioned but what colours does normal map have. 

Bump maps measure how light/dark is a texture, while normal maps use colours to calculate angles and represent an object a bit more accurate. You can make normal maps from any texture by simple filters in photoshop (I thing you need to download a plugin for it), or just use unmodified texture as bump map. Other way is making very detailed 3D model with shitload of triangles, then creating low triangle model on top of that and ""bake"" angles of triangles into texture. ","1320107702"

Dyrus was the most mature about the situation and seemed most sincere in his desire just to go to Korea for the experience of it.

Its not like those people hate red haired, small boobed women, they just dont have an attraction to people with those traits.

I agree that famil laws are being abused in many jurisdictions, often in a sexist way. That should be fixed.

Whereas my friend who mills flour may do it quickly, but feeding her hopper and turning her mill might be hard work.

And on the other hand, as you say, some activities involve higher skill.  But what if that skill is not in high demand?

But this article did not mention the 'del'

So I went to Ovid, a medical article database:

the term 'del' did not show specific results but 50,000 articles contained 'del' in the title

I further refined the search with the term 'pain measurment' giving 158 articles.  Most seemed in spanish and italian (del is a word for them?)

I restricted the articles to english, this gave 8 articles.

All of the articles included references to spanish, italian texts, or had authors with 'del' in their name.  None contained a pain scale.

I conclude that 'del' is not a medical pain scale","1320107724"

Secondly, I have a question.

So I noticed you had said: ""I think part of the reason there's such a negative reaction to homosexuality is that most people assume that it means you're girly and are going to start walking around like Ru Paul telling every ""work it girl."" Part of that is to blame on the gay community for embracing this image. If people would realize that gay people are also everyday people who happen to like someone of the same sex then I think there would be more acceptance. That''s why I cringe everytime I see a gay-pride parade and there's a bunch of people walking around with feathers, doused in glitter or wearing assless chaps. Sure you can be who you want, but maybe it would be better to tone it down, until there's more acceptance.""

I'm not knocking you for this; I felt a similar way up until a few years ago and actually, if I had to pin myself down, I think I'd identify as a 5 or 5.5 on the Kinsey scale: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale . It sort of drives me nuts about the perception of LGBT people.

There isn't going to be a 'Huge Slayer Update' they are just adding content to the game to increase charm drop rates to slayer monsters in some way, either through a mini-game or something similar. There hasn't been a definitive piece of infomation on this topic.

Your confusing the 'huge magic update' with the new Slayer update, if the guy who had written the post had actually payed attention to what Mod Mark said they are actually introduce a mage based slayer dungeon, (the skinweaver spore hive) along with the ability to gain a new type of armour that has strong magic resistance (Replacement for Karils armour)

'Hub Island' was something that Mod Mark only briefly said was something that he would like to introduce in the future. And it wasn't even to introduce a 'Hub Island'. He said something along the lines of 'imagine being able to be shown a map infront of you showing all the possible routes you can take, just like when you see those airline routes on maps'

Nowhere was extra invent space ever mentioned at Runefest, in fact they talked alot about not allow extra invent space due to limitation in the java programming only allowing certain amounts of bytes in arrays. Each space in your bank and each space in your inventory takes up the same amount of space as a full quest. And paying for the backpack space is very 'un-jagex' like if they were to implement this it would be in a much more subtle way, possibly through a quest or activity.

Mounts I can confirm are NOT comming to Runescape anyway near within this year. I talked to a senior Mod quite extensively about this and there were two main reasons as to why they won't be implemented mounts any time soon. The first reason being is that the map is far too small for mounts, the map is designed around everything being of walking distance away and teleport spells and rest stops were introduced into the game to make there no need for faster travel. The other reason why they can't introduce mounts is for the reason that the game engine simply wouldn't be able to keep up with the fast amount of movement and the constant loading of area's.  It's not possible at the moment!

All the things that you mention are 1-6 weeks ago is also complete shit none of that apart from the Dominion Tower is confirmed and the 64-64 boss is only a rumor of the possible size of the Queen Black Dragon. The author obviously just saw the picture below and made up some complete bullcrap.

How do you squat without a spotter? What happens if you get stuck at the bottom? Is he referring to the use of safety rails?

This happened to me once, about a year ago when I was learning crossfit in my garage. I was stuck at the bottom of a heavy squat so I leant back and shrugged the barbell off my shoulders. The bar grazed the top of my arse on the way down, not enough to cause pain but enough to scare me away from doing *heavy* squats without a spotter or safety rails.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Perhaps you could give me an example of someone you consider fundamentalist.

Well, myself, at one point!  But here's a decent cheat sheet for Christian fundamentalism (the ""Five Fundamentals"" from the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in 1910): 

1) The inspiration of the Bible and the inerrancy of Scripture as a result of this.

2) The virgin birth of Christ.

3) The belief that Christ's death was the atonement for sin.

4) The bodily resurrection of Christ.

5) The historical reality of Christ's miracles.


In actuality, the first point is the most important one, lots of non-fundamentalist Christians accept the rest.  

I'm not being pejorative, or making this stuff up, this is a well documented religious movement that isn't limited to Christianity.  You might find this book enlightening:

http://www.amazon.com/Battle-God-Karen-Armstrong/dp/0345391691

And yes, most fundamentalists reject Ehrman and love Wright, although non-fundamentalist conservative Christians also like Wright a lot.

Really, the issue comes down to the debate over modernism, particularly related to the status of scripture.  

&gt;I know no one, besides the very liberal, that would call my tradition fundamentalist.

This is always an issue.  For example, Reformed Baptists would be pissed to find they are categorized alone with Mormons as being ""Christian restorationists"".  But it's true, these groups overlap.

And yes, as far as I am aware, the reformed evangelical movement is well within classical fundamentalism.  There is certainly nothing about the movement that disqualifies it from that categorization.

I don't have any details on the droid 4, but along with a different sized phone there would presumably be a different lapdock. His setup's pros is that he doesn't have to root to tether for a netbook and it is an all in 1-ish device. The cons are that the lapdock experience doesn't have a ton of apps as far as school apps and the such when you are in the webtop mode. He basically uses the lapdock as his netbook replacement, and has a laptop for his school work when he needs real applications.

The world of the British empire simply doesn't exist any more, one by one countries, either though a revolutionary act or simply a bill passed by parliament, accept their own ultimate responsibility for their country. 

Political culture has very little to do with every day life in our country. Canadians would not notice a change in our every day lives, except knowing that we are no longer playing along with a notion of the commonwealth that died with our constitution in everything but name.

The Church doesn't simply draw the line at intercourse.

The church knows going down (pardon the pun) a path makes it difficult to stop, hence why all of it should be avoided.  If you're looking to persuade him to get physical with you, you're asking him to betray his conscience- something NO ONE should be asked to do.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I've been level 70 Fiona for months, and I have to say that it's a lot easier than Demon's Souls that I beat recently.  Vindictus is still very skill based and a big change from the other ""free"" mmo's on the market.  The closest thing that I've played to it on the free mmo scene is Lunia Online, another skill based (but isometric and anime styled) beat em up.  Rusty Hearts may be similar but I haven't personally tried it.

It suffers from several things:

* Badly paced and slow updates with very little new content: this is as much Devcat's fault as it is Nexon's

* No dedicated servers:  Peer 2 Peer hosting for instances means that good hosts for later 8 man raids are a requirement, and might be a requirement (depending on your skill level) for earlier 4 man instances.  You can get away with it easier if your connection is moderately good.  If your connection is below mine (3.0 mbps dsl, 512k up) you may have to solo a lot or get someone else to host; I can barely host one or two other people without extreme lag.  This isn't too bad if you just want to hit up a random boat; but if you have one very specific battle you need to run, can't do it on your own, and can't host, you might be stuck waiting for a boat for a good half hour.  I recommend getting a nice guild to offset this kind of issue.

* Maintenance: is almost every week, every so often unannounced but usually on Tuesdays unless it's an emergency, almost always extended by 1 or 2 hours, sometimes extended multiple times.  

* Bad updates:  Updates can result in the game being more broken than before; I remember several patches where we had to endure randomly spiking pings and heavy lag constantly, before they would ""fix"" it later.  The fixes can take time on the level of weeks to come out.

* Some parts of the leveling process takes grinding.  Not that big a deal but notable.

* Sections of the game story are divided into ""boats,"" aka different locations and enemies that you fight.  Some of these are repeated:  some boats share mobs, some boats share environment and maps, mobs may be rebranded/recolored/reused

* Hilariously badly thought out events.  Their servers can't take the load as everyone hops on to partake in the 1 hour extra AP or EXP or whatnot.  I've had guildmates just logging off in frustration as their boats refuse to launch after multiple tries during these ""gifts to the players.""

* It's free to play and there's a heavy element of pay2win.  People who pay real money, or people who spend all day in front of the marketplace trading dyes, can making millions/tens of millions easily to net top weapons.  Enchanting weapons past a certain level almost requires you to pay for a protective rune, unless you're very very lucky.  To compare, an average player playing an hour or two every night will probably be pretty lucky to hit 5million gold + at level 50.  Some single enchant scrolls on the forum markets can go for that kind of price, easily (and that scroll might fail).  The most insane of the pay2win players talk in terms of hundreds of millions.



That being said, what it does it does very well.  There's definitely a challenging element to the gameplay, but it plateaus much lower than Demon's Souls does.  

It's still fun and I give it a cautious recommendation.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Well I've been curious to see if you could justify copyright infringement, and I'm still not sure if you've provided anything that supports the argument that your own personal desire to experience creative works supersede the rights of the artists (and co) that created the works to dictate the terms of compensation. It's not a head game, it's that you haven't demonstrated the morality in going against the wishes of the creators of a given form of entertainment by experiencing their works without paying them for it.

&gt;But similarly, none of the creators of those products have an inherent ""right"" to profit from them ...

I really think you're confusing an entitlement to profit from their creative works, that consumers are *forced* to purchase the works, with a right to profit from their creative works, should consumers *choose* to experience them. Music, movies, video games *are* property, in a modern, digital sense. As such, the creators most certainly do have a right to earn profit from those that want to experience the works.

And again, the likes of theft, counterfeiting and copyright infringement are not part of the concept of a free market. The notion of a free market operates on the understanding that all transactions are lawful and voluntary. EA never consented to you obtaining their game without you paying for it. And Razor never had the authority to distribute copies of EA's property for free.

Lastly, Razor doesn't have his own *version* of a game. He's provided his own code that allows you to play Electronic Arts' video game. He hasn't created a physics engine, hasn't created AI, hasn't recorded voice work, created levels, modelled weapons, designed textures, etc., etc., etc. What he offers is not a competing product, it is EA's game, albeit alongside additional code that he has incorporated into it. But the vast majority of what you obtain was not created by him, and that content is not his to offer. These are not two different games, with one studio giving theirs away for free. There is only one game. You are not choosing his version over EA's. You are only experiencing EA's game without paying them for it.","1320107772"

The diezels have a nice dark distortion that I have yet to get sick of. A number of great sounding metal bands use 'em - e.g. soilwork and tool. It's also got a bunch of awesome features:   MIDI control for channel selection, per-channel effects loops, and a gig-saving tube fault recovery feature. Comes with EL34s, which sound pretty good. One pain point is that it doesn't have an external bias control, which means you have to really open it up when you swap the tubes.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Actually, you're half right. Ethylene glycol itself is not toxic. It's metabolites, glycolic and oxalic acid are. The antidote for ethylene glycol is ethanol because ethanol has higher affinity for aldehyde dehydrogenase than ethylene glycol, therefore ethanol will compete with ethylene glycol and will prevent any ethylene glycol from metabolizing before it is cleared by the kidneys. Ethanol, however, will not prevent the toxic effect of glycolic or oxalic acid, so if you ingest ethanol too long after ethylene glycol, you'd be drunk and be close to death.

Many homeless people used to and still do this in hopes of getting ethanol from the hospital. Antifreeze is easy to acquire and relatively cheap. They'll ingest it, and go to an ER and doctors will give some whiskey. However, Doctors are smarter than that so instead of giving the patients what they want, they'll perform dialysis or give them fomepizole instead of liquor.","1320107773"

It's true that lurkers are able to deny spaces infinitely better than banelings, but I don't really think that's the point. Right now Zerg exerts map control through creep spread and threatening your mineral line. To hold a ramp at such and such cost/benefit is a very Terran mentality. If you watch good Zerg players, they force repositional play by going AROUND your main army. Terran and Protoss are denied the ability to move into spaces by the necessity to pull or leave some units back at home, which in turn gives the Zerg head-on engagement an advantage. You play Terran and Protoss like a wall (denying access here, pushing up there) and you should play Zerg like water (probing to find cracks and vulnerabilities, NEVER hitting their strongest point.)

Healthcare is a finite resource in the 21st century given the costs and any country can go broke providing all the services all the time. What is elective versus what is not and needed. Governments have to make these decisions. Even NHS does not cover everything a person in the UK could want. 

I as a healthy individual do not feel like footing the bill for someone who deliberately eats unhealthy and refuses to exercise. Why should my taxes go up for someone who abused his or her own liver with prolonged alcohol or drug abuse? 

This debate to me comes down to what can and cannot be covered. As more people are covered by government insurance, they must be ready to demand less and be willing to wait a little bit longer. Not that this argument would work in the UK or any country which has had the benefit of NHS for over 60 years or so, but in a country that prides itself for some reason on a low tax rate, you can't double that tax overnight and not expect a lot of anger.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This man isn't their biological grandfather. Despite blood relation or not this man does NOT deserve to be in their children's lives whatsoever, even moreso because he just married into the family. He has no right to experience the joys of having grandchildren even at a distance. Making a decision means that you have to face the consequences of your actions no matter how long those consequences may last. In this case, he won't be permitted to be around the children of the person (child) who he took advantage of and permanently scarred and destroyed. Everyone is focusing on protecting the kids, and yes that is one of THE most important things here, but OPs wife needs to be protected as well. She shouldn't have to deal with being around him or knowing that he is an active person in their life whom their children love. Yes it sounds like a horrible thing to say, but imagine if your stepfather raped you, and you watch your children love him as if nothing happened. Yes the children aren't aware and are too young to understand the severity of the actions, but it still doesn't make it any easier for the survivor to watch someone so close to their heart show affection for the very person who hurt them.","1320107794"

The thing about your pride argument is that you're not really considering the implications of a truly evil god.  Hell won't just be you in chains in a lake of fire while you grit your teeth and go, ""Graaah, curse you ggggoooodddd!""  No, truly evil god will tear apart your mind, piece by piece, and rebuild it.  He'll add little ideas and integrate them into your consciousness.  He'll make you really, really like raping people, it'll be a stronger urge than crack cocaine.  You'll hate yourself, but be completely unable to help it...  Slowly he'll make you forget about how much you loathe yourself, and you'll begin to enjoy it.  Then he'll send you back to earth and have you rape you own daughter, destroying her life, and you'll *love it*.  And every time you die, he sends you right back to do it all again.

Now, let me ask you again, would you prefer a) to live in bliss forever, but have to bow down for evil god, or b) to have your mind shredded and spend the rest of eternity cruelly murdering the innocent and raping children?

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I looked back and I can completely understand why it seems like there is a strange disconnect. I think I got a little excited about being able to talk about theory of mind and skipped a few steps in my thinking. I hope you won't mind if I try to explain this assuming you're older than 5, because a true 5 year old would struggle to understand TOM in the first place. 

How about this? Imagine you and everyone around you are part of a single consciousness. You have independent bodies, but your minds are the same. This one consciousness drives your actions, your motives, your thoughts, your wants and desires. You are part of a collective mind and you have no need to think your own thoughts, because whoever you interact with will be thinking the exact same thing. Their mental lives are identical to yours. Theory of mind would have no place here. You have no need to produce mental speech about what you are thinking, because you know it, and everyone around you already knows it.

But then, you begin to pull away from this 'hive mind.' Your thoughts differ from what everyone around you thinks. You must begin to understand that the people around you no longer think the exact same thing you do, be aware that there are other brains out there that are not connected to yours. You must begin to mentalise your thoughts, think them out with words, images, colours, what have you. Your language centres are just a mode of communication, but what happens in your head is entirely up to you. So now, you have developed a theory of mind. You understand that there are other brains out there different from yours, and they will not know what you are thinking but you have to mentally shape your thoughts yourself because you are the only source of your thoughts. People can no longer read your mind, and you can no longer read theirs. But you must communicate with them, so you vocalise your thoughts in your head to prepare yourself for speech or to reflect on your own interpretations to ensure smooth exchanges of information.

This is an extreme situation, but I hope it clarifies why I used theory of mind to explain why people can hear their own thoughts. I am not a psychologist or psychiatrist, I was just putting out my own speculations for Reddit to chew on. If you look at some of the other comments, there have been some great criticisms and responses to what I've said, so maybe that can help you understand it better as well!

Since many subs like to please, they might go along with it to please their partners, but start to feel like their needs are being ignored.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Define scientific field.  Does engineering plateau?  Even if, say, mechanical engineering has plateaued (which, I think, mechanical engineers would take issue with), advancements lead to whole new fields, and then computer engineering starts making huge advancements.  Medicine is a horrible example in this debate, since we're talking about the population level not exploding.  We don't need to extend life any longer, but very few key innovations will make huge advancements in extending the lifetime of the human race.  Desalination. Genetic engineering of crops (touchy subject, I know).  More efficient sources of energy. Not only that, but advancements only look like giant leaps in hindsight, and entire new fields erupt out of simple advancements.  Do you think Edison and Tesla knew what their advancement in the harnessing of electricity would bring and to what uses it would be put?!  Just think of how much more efficient cars have become in the last TEN years.  Once concepts like the Chevy Volt become standardized, their construction cheapened, and their energy use made even more efficient, we have less to worry about.  

This doesn't even encompass things we can't even dream of.  At the 1900's World Fair, people MARVELED at the new-fangled light bulb.  100 years later -&gt; computers.  We can't forget how MIND BLOWING and unimaginable these advancements were and how much they're exploded productivity in all industries.

Not only that, but issues like hunger are problems of human organization, not availability.  There's more than enough food in the world to feed everyone, but the rich just happen to have it and waste it.  Sure, this sucks and doesn't say much about our intelligence, but it shows we aren't really outstripping our resources (perhaps some, but not unsubstitutable ones).  

Population growth is slowing down, and is expected to plateau at the end of the century.  3 trillion more people, as crazy as it may sound, is NOT that much more, and nothing's going to shock the world into suddenly growing at a huge rate again.  Look at a map of the population of the world (like in the video).  We're all concentrated around tight, dense centers.  There's PLENTY of room in the world--drive through middle-america, central-asia, etc. to see.  If we can just improve the DISTRIBUTION of food across the world, then we'll be F.I.N.E..

NONE of this is to say that we shouldn't be ENVIRONMENTALLY conscious.   Saying that we, as the population of the world, have the capacity to destroy the world we're living in is very different from saying that the Earth simply cannot support 10 trillion people.","1320107815"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","There was a little bit of thought put behind rest/recovery (though maybe not the best thought).

I was split between the ideas of having 2 lifting days back to back (tues and weds) and having a day of rest between. Originally I opted to put them back to back because I wanted two full days of non-lifting (rest) before going all out on full-body. I also gave two full days of rest after the full body routine.

I'm not entirely sure how you concluded that it has no thought to exercises, that seems a little bit vague. If you mean that the isolation days seem random, my thought behind it was - when I do chest (which usually includes incline/decline) I am also exercising my tris and shoulders, so I opted to put them on the same day so I could hit them all to allow maximum time of rest before full body day. The same goes for back and bis, and legs are thrown in on back/bis because it seems like a bit too much to do chest/tri/shoulders/legs.

My goal is overall fitness combined with gain, which is why I figured that I will achieve better gains with splits, but better overall fitness (esp when it comes to losing fat) by including a full body day, because you burn more calories doing full body and it's better for losing weight.

So to say there is no thought behind it is wrong, maybe not the proper thought, or maybe it's inexperienced thought, but it's not 'without thought'.

I do appreciate your feedback though, so thanks for that.","1320107815"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'd love to offer up some highly researched scientific evidence as to explain this perception of my gender.

Unfortunately I lack the motivation and time required, so I'll just stick to my possibly fallible observations about straight human culture and reddit.

1. Men in our American culture (though I'm sure this permeates to men in other industrialized western cultures) are on a daily basis bombarded by sexual stimuli.
&gt;1. This can be anything from the 'over-sexed' representation of women in the news, movies, papers.
&gt;1. The women we see walking around a daily basis
&gt;1. The interactions we have with friends who talk about women

The point being here is that we're constantly reminded of women, and subsequently our physical and/or mental attraction to being around/with them.

2. Being with or without women is something any straight male who's seen or felt attracted to women can relate to.
&gt; 1. This is important to how women are treated on reddit. After all over 80% of redditors are male.
&gt; 2. How consistently is an 80% male demographic going to sing consistent praises of their wives, girlfriends, love interests?
&gt; 3. Versus using reddit as an anonymous tool to vent their sexual frustrations. Something they may or may not have people to talk about it with.

Men are going to vent, other men are going to relate, and some will take offense. That doesn't mean male redditors hate women. It means our male majority on occasion hive-minds around some aspect of the female gender and rips on it. Ever read those 'friend-zone' posts? 

I'm just happy every thread isn't like that, and most aren't.

3. Gross generalizations are misguided yet commonplace in a majority of societies
&gt; 1. I don't defend 'woman-hating' sympathies the same way I don't defend 'male-hating' sympathies.
&gt; 2. The reality is it happens.


**TL;DR:** I don't blame reddit when the occasional post over-generalizes the female gender; a gender that most men see, hear, want, don't have, love, and/or hate on a daily basis. Posted to a website that anonymously allows people to express feelings we may not want to vent to those who are close to us. Feelings which can be easily relatable to a 80% male demographic that gets over 20 million unique hits a day. Which only happens 'sometimes'.

Women, we love you. Our species can't exist without you. We jib, we jab, we bust each others balls when one of us is having problems about one of you. 

If anything I think reddit is a largely tolerant place albeit overly male. It's good to keep us in check with posts like these, but please understand that well, it happens.

We definitely need stronger regulations in the USA. There are a lot of places we need to fix and we are really bad at actually enforcing the rules! In theory, slaughterhouses shouldn't be that bad. In truth, they can be horrifying. Visiting one is what made my dad a vegetarian!

I got tired of it.  I mean, really fucking tired of it.  It was like one day I just woke up and realized how ridiculous and horrible it all was.  It didn't make sense to me anymore.  My family had/has a lot of gang ties and it just seemed like the natural thing to do, to make my family proud and for protection and friendship.  I didn't want to be doing the same thing over and over again every day.  You'd think gang life would be exciting, but honestly, it's pretty dull.  

&gt;What do you do now?

Sounds pretty Libertarian actually.

The economic status of Western Europe is because they tried austerity and it failed.  Had they bailed out their banks at the same time we did, this wouldn't be happening now, but they didn't have the political will to do so.  Germany's people didn't feel like paying for the Greece's (and others') debt (understandably) and it took the threat of another major economic downturn to get them to get their act together.  We've known this was needed for a long, long time.  Why do you think there have been news articles about Greece's impending default for the past year?  Why do you think the stock market shot up record levels the instant a deal to bail out the trouble European nations was struck?  Because people who study economics through the lens of practicality instead of ideology knew that the failing countries needed a bailout.","1320107831"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Alright, well still don't understand the distinction you are trying to make with those sources. The first one seems to verify that the word does in fact mean hate, has secondary definition as ""love less"" but its most common meaning seems to be hate. And I am really not inclined to trust a source such as the second when they have a clear objective at hand, even if they do make a point about the culture then more or less over-exaggerating things. The problem I have with buying into these christian sources and something I find on a lot of these christian bible study pages is this sentiment :  
âWhenever one finds in Scripture something that appears to be in error, as I have stated in the past, one should remember that three possibilities exist in regard to any apparent problem: (a) the existing copies of the original manuscript may not be totally accurate; (b) the present-day translation of the Hebrew or Greek Biblical text may be faulty; or (c) the translator's understanding of the Biblical text may be inadequate or incorrect.â

That is missing one crucial option....it could mean just what it says it means. As someone I came across said in regards to that approach...""Case in point, the Jews donât try and explain away the fact that Lot offered his daughters to be gang raped by the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, or the fact that Lotâs daughters committed incest with their father. No excuses of what it really meant, or how it is a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Is it embarrassing? Sure it is, was it a bad thing? Yes. Was it removed or changed in order to promote and protect the wholesomeness of Biblical persons? No.""

The word miseÃ³ is used 37-41 times (different results depending on where I look) in the new testament and in all cases the word in context of the text means hate or something closely correlated with hate. I wonder how is that in all cases in the NT the miseo means hate except in Luke 14, from looking around some opinions are that the Hebrews mistranslated a different word, MISEI,  on accident. 

If jesus said he was a vine, than yes ... that would be symbolism of some sort, and it would be clear that it was meant as such..But when he says ""do this and do that in this way"", its not clear at all that it is supposed to be symbolic or a metaphor. 

When the bible says that the punishment for doing something was stoning, they literally meant stoning, and for years and years that is how people read it and practiced it. I just I guess am confused to why all the sudden so much of the bible is metaphor and somehow that is supposed to be the true translation, when its apparent that in the past, close to the times when these things were written and people understand the languages they were written in, I don't see any evidence or haven't been present with anything that shows that they didn't take the entire book literally. 


Yes an accurate representation of the bible would be the best thing to try to take apart to get to the root of all of these issues, but the common christian's representation of the bible is also fair game (not that is what we are really dealing with here just making that point).

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","Only done online secret santaing once but it went off really well, here's how it happened:

1: Mods set up an official sign up thread and pinned it to the front page. A basic template was given for questions to answer (hobbies, favourite films / books / music, etc.) so people could get a feel for what the person would like with the additional question at the end: ""What questions would you like other people to answer?"" in case people needed the info for their presents (so if someone wanted to give a tee shirt, they would add the question ""What tee shirt size are you?""). People would be encouraged to go back and check for questions added after their post so they can edit it to answer them. Price and mailing limits are also set.

2: Mods ask for people's names and addresses, people PM them to the mods. Mods do a random match up, people get sent the name and address of the person you're meant to send a gift to. At this point, if you need more information from your benefactor that hasn't been answered by the ""other questions"" part of the thread, you communicate via the mods. Also contact the mods if you don't want the person you've been matched to (like if you know them IRL or if they've expressly asked not to be given the present you've already bought, that sort of thing).

3: People send gifts. If anyone can't send a gift, mods try to re-match them or, if it's too late (ie: their present has been sent or noone can change their benefactor at short notice) or if some selfish twat has disappeared off the face of the Earth, there are pre-appointed ""donor santas"" who'll give, but not receive for that benefactor (usually someone with easy access to cheap but nice presents). All disappearing types get blacklisted for future years, and people who couldn't send a present for one reason or another reimbursable the donor who took over if and when they can.

4: People recieve gifts. People post in the secret santa thread showing the forum what wonderful presents kind and caring people have sent them and any interesting wrapping or lovely notes that come with it. Fun is had by all.","1320107841"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There's an Australian standard on speed limits that clearly states that if the majority of the traffic do not obey the posted limit, then the limit is not legal. Of course, no government obeys that standard because it is not a law, but it's there.

The laws are of the people for the people. If it is impossible to convince the people that the law in question is valid, then the law is obviously flawed.

It's an interesting way to potentially kill the stupid drug laws. Get enough supporters to register for jury duty, and eventually the laws will fail.

I know that here, minor posession is decriminalised. You pay a modest fine (basically an idiot tax for being caught) and that's that. No recorded convictions, no further consequenses.

I belive this came about because it is difficult to convince Australians to lock people up for victimless crimes. We're a laid back mob who's culture is supposed to be ""fair go mate"".","1320107852"

"GetMotivated","t5_2rmfx","You know that at many colleges, you don't need to declare a major until you're a sophomore? That's right, you don't need to know what you want to be right now.

What you need to do is build a broad base of skills so that no matter WHAT you decide on later, you can do it. Almost every decent-paying job these days requires math and computer skills, so throw yourself at them like a Lapras using Body Slam. Communication skills are a must, so nail the reading/writing part of that English class, and do well enough with the Literature to write well about it. Foreign languages? Try and pick one up. Art? You'd be surprised how often I get asked to draw and color things when I'm subbing. 

Simply put, if you don't want to be anything, you must be good at EVERYTHING. That way, when you do decide, you can jump right in.. and if you decide wrong, it's easier to switch gears.

I knew I wanted to be a teacher from 16, about your age. I went through college and got out into the field, and found both that I can't get a job in it and that I don't enjoy it the way I thought I would. But I have solid enough math and computer skills that I'm getting clerical interviews now. Maybe being a secretary isn't what I want to do with my life, but it sounds fun and it's certainly better than being stuck subbing. 

TLDR:

I tell them that I'm not interested multiple times, but they keep at me, I finally tell them that I'm agnostic and I get told that I am going to burn in hell or that I need to convert and repent immediately.

Do you believe that? That is not at all true. I should hardly have to source something for this, but [here](http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1292/mormon-religion-demographics-beliefs-practices-politics). That LDS is not diverse does not completely negate it's legitimacy since it's a relatively new belief system, but on the long term...you bet it would. Don't people see the hypocrisy in competitive, isolated belief systems in the face of one Ultimate Truth? To claim to have a monopoly on legitimate methods of approaching this Ultimate Truth is pure lunacy. All religions are merely imaginary boxes containing arbitrarily chosen segments of an incredibly diverse range of life. They are traditions and like all traditions should be carefully scrutinized. I don't think anyone would argue that we do not live in a subjective reality, and so if anyone were to follow a religion per sÃ©, it should be one that is rich with the incorporation of the entire world's culture, and not a subsection of it. The idea being, that at that point, it's really not religion so much as it is a transcendence of that.

TL;DR: Mormons aren't diverse, but wherever you can feel a good sense of community is great, so long as you respect all life (ie: don't tell people how to live their lives).","1320107879"

**Repulsor Beam:** Replaces Uni-beam. These palm lasers hit high or low, and the strong version at a 45 degree angle.

**Repulsor Palm:** Forward + C, causes a wall bounce, unsafe so it's main use is combos.

**Repulsor Ball**: Can only be done in the air, Tony covers himself in a ball of energy and shoots in a direction determined by the button pressed. This hits multiple times and can be comboed afterwards.

**Orbital Strike:** Replaces 45 degree proton Cannon. Tony calls an orbital laser down on a location, the buttons used determines the location.

**Iron Army:** Replaces Iron Avenger. Tony grabs the opponent and uni-beams them into the air, where they are punched by different armors Tony has worn thorughout the years, each remote controlled. The super ends with Tony grabbing the opponents head and rocketing them back to the ground.


**Taskmaster:**

**Copycat:** If Taskmaster uses a normal counter against you, he gains a speed, defense, or damage up ala Rogue in MvC2. The power-up is dependant on the character he is fighting.


**Ryu:**

**Power-ed up normals:** When powered up the range on his normals increases, as each punch flows with blue energy.


**Cap:**

**Command Grab:** Cap flips around the opponent and allows a followup combo.

Japan recently had deflation, it was called the lost decade.

Before the Federal Reserve was created, America suffered a dollar with huge fluctuations, sometimes deflation, sometimes hyperinflation.  Going from a time directly after a major war is kind of silly, dolars are always at their lowest value after a war.  There was also deflation between 1920 and 1930.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar#Value

The mortgage crisis should be a good example of how bad deflation is.  People bought homes for a price with a mortgage, now they owe more on the mortgage then the home is worth.  This has resulted in people walikng away from homes, costing the banks money, complete slow down on building, and a lot of people who lost their life savings.

If you require some research for the spell, then it becomes a non-issue because you can't steal the player's gas after they take it. For the pylon issue, I'd hope that by the time it is too late for me to steal your gas, it's also too late for me to walk through your front door with a probe to make pylons in your base. If you let the probe in to make pylons that late, you are probably not worthy of a win.  Even if they do get a pylon in, worst case scenario is you have to pull some probes for 20 seconds and kill the pylon.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I do appreciate you taking the time to write all that out. I assure you I am not trolling, I merely find the idea of faith hilariously stupid. I could sugar coat it, but why bother? ""Hilariously stupid"" is pretty much the best description I can give you about my feelings towards it. Anyways, let me address your steps towards becoming a theist since you took the time to write it.

1. You claim to have felt ""something"". There is absolutely no reason to believe that this is a divine force or the presence of God. You're jumping from ""feelings I get"" straight to ""these feelings are from something greater"". This is begging the question. Also on this topic, I'd like to ask you why these feelings you get are any more a sign from ""something greater"" than a schizophrenic murderer who hears voices telling him to murder? 

2. I have a problem with your very first sentence. Why does a divine being have to be benevolent? On what basis are you making this claim? You also claim that Greek Gods ""exist with no real purpose"" which is just plain wrong. They created the mortals. Zeus controls the heaven. Poseidon controls the oceans, and Hades controls the underworld. Many of the Gods are in charge of something. Furthermore, your argument about how all these great things must come from a benevolent being is completely asinine. You attribute all these great things to a God, and then claim that bad things don't matter and can't be attributed to god, because they aren't physical. What the fuck? The good things are physical too, so then why do they matter in a discussion about god? This is such a bullshit cop-out argument. Surely you must be embarrassed by the complete lack of logic in it. Oh, and the fact that Greek gods have fluctuating moral codes? Really? You're using ""fluctuating moral code"" as an argument against other gods and FOR the Christian god? ***Really***!? Have you ever read the bible? 

3. Being that the rest of your argument is based on the incredibly faulty, and illogical premises of steps 1 and 2, there is no point in addressing your points any further, so I'll stop here, and instead I'll take a look about your TLDR summary: ""Christianity is the logical conclusion to a series of (what you may call illogical) assumptions."" You need to remove the brackets and simply change the statement to ""Christianity is the logical conclusion to a series of extremely illogical assumptions"". A conclusion formed by examining arguments based on faulty premises is just completely useless.","1320107902"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","It really depends on how much passive fury generation she gets. If its 1 per second, 100 seconds of idling for ult. maybe 40-50 seconds if you count in auto attacking from jungling? Not sure how many attacks on average are made in a jungle route. In any case, a 40 second ult would be very nice, especially if the flight goes over walls (I'm sure it would.) Atk speed might be a nice way to go for a jungle setup, if her base stats or dmg output can support it, since it will generate fury more quickly. 

Additionally, this may be one champ you dont necessarily want to get a wriggles on. If she kills creeps faster, that means fewer auto attacks to build fury with. On the other hand, her double bite can proc wriggles twice in a row with some luck, so she could potentially burst down buff mobs/dragon fairly quickly.

The biggest issue, would be that her ganks would be kinda meh until 6, and that her ult itself knocks them back. If she doesn't come in from behind, she could actually end up saving them by pushing them away from allies or just nearer to their turret.","1320107904"

18 You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but **you shall love your neighbor as yourself**: I am the LORD

"movies","t5_2qh3s","[Not the best source](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-lucifer-and-satan/), but some claim that Lucifer was one of the most holy angels. He is only referred to as Satan after the fall.

In some mythologies, Satan and Beelzebub are lesser demons or evil foot soldiers. Whereas, Lucifer, the fallen angel, and bringer of light is the supreme being of the all demons. (Can't find a source online for this, but I used to study this shit).

There are further theories that Lucifer refers to Pan, the pagan god of the wild who was widely worshiped. Christianity, (as others mentioned) doesn't refer to the fall directly or to both Lucifer and Satan in the bible. As Christianity spread in popularity, Pan was slowly morphed into an evil figure. In a way you could see the pre-Christian Pan and Lucifer as being the same and converging as Satan in the successful narrative. The terms are now basically interchangeable.","1320107912"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","The best way to boost your general ability to code is to have a project that other people expect you to finish.  For me, it was a project in my first internship. As a result you become extremely effective at googling things you don't understand and applying them until you do understand them. That's an invaluable skill.

I do have a CS degree, and I am a ""Software Engineer."" That's what you call someone who engineers software. Computer science deals with the study of efficiency, information theory, computability theory, and so on, whereas software engineering deals more with the process of delivering a quality product and producing quality code. It's tough to be a career computer scientist, you pretty much have to land some sort of research position. 

Learn one language of a couple of modern types of language, object oriented, scripting, database query languages, etc. For the most part, languages of a given type have similar constructs and translate fairly well, in many cases. You'll have to learn each language's quirks but it's easy enough to do in the first few weeks on the job if you're competent in a similar language.  The one caveat I'd add here is to take up a language that has you manage your own memory, that can be a requirement for many projects, but few languages in use today make you do it.","1320107916"

I learned some people had good results with LDN and I was also attracted by the fact that it works differently than all the other drugs I tried and also has very minimal side effects (you may have trouble sleeping/vivid dreams but they haven't really been bothering me so far. 

I've been on it for just over 2 weeks now and I know this is anecdotal but I did see improvement already which is encouraging. I'm on 1.5 mg currently planning to ramp to the recommended 4.5 over time. 

One thing to consider is that the main messed up part of my terminal ileum was removed so I had a sort of advantage I would say because the rest of my bowels weren't very damaged. 

Overall I'd say give it a shot, for me the risk/reward ratio seemed very attractive so I just went for it, I had to find an open minded doctor to prescribe it to me which I found through the Yahoo! LDN group ","1320107924"

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","Let me put it simple and sweet. Your body is the message in the Occupy Movement. The space we take up, our very presence is the very basic message of the Occupy Movement. 

Occupy 	

    1. Reside or have one's place of business in (a space.)

    2. Fill or take up (a space or time).

As a traveler one of the most powerful things I have discovered is the ability to remain quiet and stone faced. I was taught when entering a space remain silent, eyes forward, and never response to a threat- remain stone. Your eyes, your stare, is a powerful tool when you decide that you own a space. If you own your eyes and your stance it makes it very hard for an attacker to gain access to your being. The most powerful message is your body- the fact that you take up space- that you occupy- your body is the message and the one most primal- it takes up space.

I agree with the OP on these points: do not advance, to not approach and do not show aggression. Stand strong and occupy.","1320107926"

"VictoriaBC","t5_2rbsy","I am part of the media team. My views don't respresent everyone else here. The media teams also has a preference to use a variety of speakers to cast the wide variety of members, and the fact there is no ""leadership"" structure and that anyone is welcome to participate in any way they please. This prevents a well spoken spokesperson (though I did do a CBC Radio Interview).

There is a lengthy debate to be had about the value of a coherent message; if there is one, or how much that value swamps the value of being accepting of all individuals and messages. 

Basically, it goes like this:
Traditionalist says ""You need a coherent message; media will pay more attention, public will pay more attention, and you'll garner mainstream support."" 

However, that perspective also implies importance of some issues over others; and while I believe that, I don't think the Occupy Movement as a whole believes that, and I can't impose my will on others. There is a disadvantage to this in terms of getting a cohesive message out, you're correct, but there are gains, too.

Historically, social movements have done an incredibly poor job of being inclusive of their own minorities (The GLBTQ movement didn't include the T for a long time; the black civil rights movement was predominantly male-led, etcetera). This movement is deliberately trying to avoid that, to hear all voices.

Furthermore, it seems clear that, at least in america, there has been increasing media discussion of wealth inequality (if you follow the OccupyWallStreet subreddit, there was an infographic a while back about # of times wealth inequality was mentioned in media in unrelated stories (IE, stories about business, banks, government regulation, not occupy wall street) in week 1 of the movement, and week 5 of the movement...and the discussion shot up massively. 

Despite being inclusive of all voices (an advantage with a cost), the movement is still succeeding in communicating a message. It may not be perfectly clear, it's true; but it is getting clearer. The only people who get to pretend they are confused are the ones who are trying to be confused.","1320107931"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'd have to say if your Mormon friends felt guilty about drinking Dr Pepper, Mtn Dew, w/e... they didn't understand that aspect of their own religion. The whole ""caffeine"" thing is not a commandment, but just something that has stemmed from generations of confused members thinking that they can personally interpret the LDS Word of Wisdom, and then apply it to the general membership of the church.

If you went in to an interview with your Bishop/Stake President and told them you drank caffeine all day everyday, they would only be concerned with your health, it would in no way disqualify you from a calling or temple recommend.

I will admit that I have heard things like this from Bishops etc before, but you simply need understand that the same people that exist outside of the church exist within the church as well, meaning idiots. If you have a Bishop or authority telling you something like that, take it to another authority for a second opinion, and they will likely shed better light on it. Example: There was a bishop in Spain who began denying temple recommends if you didn't keep an active journal because you weren't ""following the prophet"" (who has advised the keeping of a journal) and therefore didn't qualify for a recommend.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I didn't intend for this to become a theological debate, but I welcome a little healthy civil discussion, so here goes: 

That is a great point.  I was hesitant to use the word 'allegory' up above for this reason. But again - I'm not denying that God created the universe, which is what I think that section of Genesis is about.  Again, only a fool would take that as historical account, because of what I mentioned above. You can't have light and photosynthesis without the sun!  And I am no Bible expert, but have read most of it and I don't recall Jesus referencing anything from the early book of Genesis - although he gets close when referencing Adam and Eve. If I am wrong I would like to know, though, for my own knowledge. 

Why do I believe the part about Jesus coming alive and performing miracles, but not the book of Genesis or some of the other, harsher versus (like you mentioned about the slaves, don't eat shellfish, stone your wife, etc.)? I believe it because it comes easy and natural to me - Jesus' message was love, where the message of some of those other verses were clearly reflexive on ancient, savage and brutal times. Christ's miracles are well documented in not only the four gospels but dozens of other texts from that time period.  Are there any other texts that cite the world was created in 7 days and that there was light and vegetation before the sun and stars were created? 

On top of it all, Jesus was one hell of a stoic philosopher. The Sermon on the Mount is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read. It'd be nice if his followers read a little closely to the things he taught - pray in secret, behind closed doors, let your yes be yes and your no be no, don't jerk people around, don't tell people if you are fasting or giving to the poor - basically, don't be a pompous, overzealous asshole. 

I guess my problem is this - I believe in God and choose to worship Him/Her/It as I see fit. That medium is through Christianity. If others have another way, that's cool too. I'd never get in anyone's face and tell them they're blatantly wrong about something so massively cosmic and oftentimes indescribable as the belief in a God.  

Food for thought: You note that if it is all allegorical, then Christ ceases to be the messiah - but what if when he said things like ""I am the way, the truth, and the light"" he simply meant that living a life that is similar to Christ - whatever your belief is - then you are saved? To me, that still makes Christ the Messiah. ","1320107940"

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","Physical therapist here.  

Here's the deal.  It's probably nothing, and taking a good rest break where you stick to high reps, low weight may be enough to get back to 100% again.  However, there could be some serious issues going on.  You may be like me, and have a spondylolysis, which caused my back to 'click' for years before I realized what was going on.  It wasn't too painful until I'd been transferring heavy patients on a regular basis and one day I couldn't handle the pain.  Finally got some x-rays done, as I thought it was a disc bulge.  Turned out my L5 vertebra is fractured, and likely had been for over a decade.  Every click I heard was the two bones moving across each other.  

At this point, nothing can be done, except a spinal fusion down the line, which I don't need currently because I'm not in pain anymore, but with the knowledge, I'm able to avoid the type of lifting that will cause me further damage.  

A doctor can at least rule out some rather important things for you.  If it's a disc issue, you can see a PT for it.  If it's a muscle strain, you can rest the back and let the muscle heal, doing light exercise for it.  If it's a fracture, you can permanently modify your lifting technique, or at least rest until it heals up.  Mine won't ever heal, but you may not be in the same boat as me.","1320107942"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I can give you my Catholic perspective. The Catholic Church (and science) teaches that the number of men and women with deep-seated homosexual tendencies is ""not negligible,"" i.e., a lot. Although this tendency (or orientation) is disordered, it is NOT considered intrinsically sinful. Thus, God LOVES you like everyone else, homosexually-inclined or not. So too are we taught as Catholics to love our homosexual brothers and sisters with respect and sensitivity, and to avoid any and all ""unjust discrimination."" 

However, homosexual ACTS are indeed contrary to natural law - they are sinful. This is why gay marriage will never be approved by the Catholic Church.

God calls everyone to pick up their cross and follow him and his laws - to constrict those parts of themselves that are sinful and self-destructive. For many, that's alcoholism, pride, lust, anger, food, willful ignorance - any number of things. For homosexuals, it happens to be an attraction toward the same sex that is contrary to natural law. 

You can very much be a homosexual Catholic, one that is loved and treasured by the Church - but you are called to aspire to abstinence. ","1320107946"

2. If you are fit, and you are taking in enough kcal, the extra squash on those days will be doable. Its like the 'doubles' routine in P90X.. mind you an intense game of squash will burn way more kcal then cardio x.

3. If you feel yourself burning out, either up the kcal, or drop the inentsity, duration or frequency of the extras.

4. Stick to the schedule in p90x, I know thats also #1, but trust me its worth it.

Good luck! Boast... boast!

That kind of disconnect, coupled with ""I don't want it on the wall"" is a danger sign. Relationships like this tend not to end well - there's a fracture in there, based on competing desires to change the other person, that simply won't heal. 

But I'm basing this on two sentences some guy wrote on reddit. That's why I politely asked the question instead of saying ""you need to ditch her.""

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well first off I can give you some numbers on density of certain astronomical phenomenon, (from wolfram-alpha):

* The Sun's core: (34 to 150) g/cm^3

*  White dwarf (Sirius B): 2.1Ã10^6 g/cm^3

* Neutron star: (8Ã10^13 to 2Ã10^15 ) g/cm^3

* Just for reference Water: 1 g/cm^3  and Granite: 2.6 g/cm^3

So the stone, assuming the 10,000 times density is correct, would be around the order of a white dwarf.

Now as for the more general question of what happens with very high density.

I have no objection to people thinking about me, so long as they're not thinking of killing me or something.  However, when you say to someone who you know is atheist that you'll pray for them, it really is a bit rude.  For example, when my parents say that to me, it makes me feel like they're saying, ""I really don't care about your beliefs and I'm going to remind you how I think you should be every chance I see you.""  Like I said, it seems to me like a passive aggressive remark.  While there's nothing really wrong with it, given the context it can be disrespectful.

So obviously, you can see I'm sensitive about it because of how it affects me in everyday life with disappointed parents.  Maybe you could try to think about it from a different angle.  If I were a satanist for example, would you be happy if I told you that I would pray to Satan for you?  

Also, what does it matter to me if there's no God?  I think that that's a very important issue, but I also think that's an issue for another time.","1320107966"

I was SO worried when it came time for day care, and my baby was seven months!! I cant imagine how difficult it must be to pick someone to care for your six week old ( which is still a newborn, in my opinion!)...

One important factor we looked at was ratio - we were comfortable with three babies per adult in the baby room, especially considering they had floating helpers if things got frantic. 

We chose centre over a home carer, because the facilities are tailor-made to be stimulating, safe, and hygienic. 

The thing that ultimately made the decision for us was how we ""clicked"" with the staff. Some places were nice, and had nice carers, but I felt sort of formal or stiff with them. But I felt so at ease with the manager and carers at our day care. Like we see kids the same way, you know? Be sure to pick someone you can really talk to - they will give you insights into your child's strengths and concerns, but only if you're comfortable enough to really chat at the end of each day. 

Most good centres will give you a written report every day. What he ate, when he slept, how many diaper changes, his mood, what he chose to play with that day...it's nice to keep these and refer back to see patterns in his behaviour. 

For what it's worth, our day care is part of an international chain called Bright Horizons, and I would highly recommend them,","1320107969"

"masculism","t5_2rb6c","Again, will you listen to how those feminists spin the data? ""Not every false allegation in statistics is necessarily that""? Did she at least add the corollary? That not every rape in the statistics is necessarily that? Should I bother to go and look?

And I see nothing particularly offensive about John the Other's piece on rape not being special. It isn't. It shouldn't be. It's a serious assault, and a hideous disrespect of someone's physical and sexual autonomy, but rape only deserves special status in a--and yes, I'm going to say it again, just to piss you off--society where women are held to an expectation of sexual chastity and fidelity.

200 years ago, if a woman was raped, all her value as a woman was gone. If she had consensual sex outside of marriage, all her value as a woman was gone. If she was raped within marriage by an outsider, all her value as a woman was gone. 

Women were expected to come as virgins to their marriage beds, and held to an absolute (onerous but not unfair double) standard of fidelity within marriage, because a man has no way of knowing beyond any doubt that the children his wife bears him are his own. In the days when men were held personally accountable for providing for and protecting wife and children, they had every right to know that the kids they were toiling in the coal mine all day to support were their own and not the milk-man's. And frankly, some researchers estimate that over 10% of men in the west, even now, are raising children not their own without their knowledge. 

Sexual purity was expected. Consensual sex before marriage, or grey-area-possibly-rape before marriage, resulted in shotgun weddings if the woman was lucky enough that the man wasn't already married. If she WAS raped, it didn't matter, she'd be marrying him anyway, because she was of no value to any other man. If she was raped, well, she should have fought harder to prevent being soiled, and couldn't be trusted to not let it happen again, so no decent man could be expected to take a chance on marrying her. Her social standing was destroyed. Her shame was very public unless the family managed to hush everything up. And god help her if she got pregnant.

None of those practical, real-world consequences really apply anymore. We're not supposed to care about women's sexual purity. No one is going to refuse to marry a woman because she was raped once. And even if she doesn't marry, she can provide herself a living instead of being a burden on family or stuck living in the street. She can even have children without stigma, and without a man's participation. Her life won't be destroyed in the same way as it would have been back then. 

So why are we still treating rape as a crime against all that is good and pure? Why aren't we treating it as a crime? Why are all the victims we see portrayed in popular culture the ""scrubbing for hours in the shower, flinching at sudden noises, psychologically devastated, SVU^TM"" variety? Where are the ones like me, who didn't see being sexually assaulted as a shitty experience I would avoid repeating if I could but not much more than that? Why are we not presenting a balanced picture in our portrayals and our discourse? Why is the only message women are allowed to see, and therefore allowed to internalize, that rape destroys you, that you might need years of therapy to recover from it (if you recover at all), and that it takes away your sense of self-worth?

Why? Because maybe there are people who want women to feel as if rape is everywhere, that it's way more likely to happen to them than it actually is--practically inevitable, really--and that when it does happen, the only ""appropriate"" reaction is to feel ashamed, devalued, and traumatized to the point that you can't function? Oh, and don't forget how much the police won't believe you. And don't forget, they don't believe you because they're bastards, not because false accusations are fairly common and they need to be sure your case is genuine--because we ALL know that false accusations are no more than 2%, or 6% at the most. And those other 94% of women were actually raped, and they didn't get justice, so you might as well not put yourself through the bother of reporting.

I had an account on there that was recently deleted and banned, which is how I was able to screencap this stuff.

Here's a summary of some of the stuff that I read:

""We should impose mandatory abortions on male babies.""
""We should teach our young girls to beat up boys (there was one chick who was bragging about her children putting their male peers in the hospital)""
""We should kill off all the men until they make up only ten percent of the global population.""
""We should blow up all the men's sheds (some Australian movement that I had never heard of before, feel free to Google it).""
""I wish it was legal to rape and abuse men. I'm so tired of seeing them do it to women, I want to give them a taste of their own medicine. Plus, it's something that I've always fantasized about. (The girl that said this was later berated for wanting to have sex with men.)""
""Eating meat is giving in to the patriarchy oppression of men because men are always the one's that kill the animals (a lot of these women are vegetarians/vegans and blame men for animal suffering)""
""Men are enforcing female infanticide to reduce the female population. (some crazy bitch that actually lurks this subreddit made this statement.)""
""I go to the playground with my little girls and look at all the young boys playing and feel disgusted. I hate every single one of those little shits because I know they are going to grow up to be rapists and abusers.""

Just a smidgen of what radfems actually say/believe. Like I said, I'd love to be able to say that they're just being satirical or something in these posts and sit here and laugh about this type of stuff with you, but they aren't. This is actually what they want to do.","1320107986"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I was sheltered. Never watched TMNT or Captain Planet or Dragonball Z, never celebrated H'ween, rarely went to friends' houses and only if it was planned days in advance when my parents knew their parents.

Socially, I'm still a LITTLE awkward, but not overly so (I can carry on conversations just fine with pretty much anyone). I'm definitely NOT dim-witted, and I still have a ""line,"" though it is pushed just a tad bit further than my parents had it set (and it was set pretty freakin high). I still don't curse, never smoked/drank though I would still likely drink in a social situation assuming I didn't drink enough to get drunk. Illegal drugs don't appeal to me. The only spot I'd likely ""fall under"" in is sex, which would only happen in deeply committed relationships (and protected) anyway, if not until marriage.

But my parents at least encouraged me to reason through things. When they set an arbitrary rule for no reason, I fought it until a reason was provided (and that wasn't just a teen thing, I've always done that lol). They showed HOW certain things could hurt me instead of just claiming death or eternal condemnation. Unfortunately, most religious people aren't nearly as reasonable as my parents are =(

Though you do need a bit of Japanese skill to play those. Also the racing games are pretty fun too, but luckily we have initial D machines in the US so we arent missing out on that. But the Gundam games and the competitive SF4 machines cannot be beat here. ","1320107990"
"vjing","t5_2s4gv","DLP - better blacks..useful for projection mapping content (ie you won't see it as much when the projector is projecting black)..this comes with a disadvantage of giving you color banding when using something like a DSLR to film your set though, I've found..but there are ways around this.

For most clubs you could get away with 2-3k lumens, I just did a 16'x9' screen with a panasonic 6k with a .8 throw lens and it was really nice...no question about whether it was bright enough(rental).

If I could buy one consumer sized projector it would be this: http://www.projectorcentral.com/BenQ-SP840.htm

1080p, 4000 lumens, really crisp image...I had a client buy 3 of them for a performance and they were really amazing little boxes for the price..decently bright image even like 40-50ft back..but blindingly bright and sharp if you were projecting like a 3ft image or something

LED is probably a good bet if you can find ones bright enough..I think epson has a couple of nifty looking slim hybrid ones that look really nice, and you can't beat 20,000 hours of lamp life

the more you can learn about cabling, throw ratio, lumens and the like, the better off you'll be

I just did a projection mapping show with a 20,000 lumen Barco from 100ft back and it was sort of bright enough, but we were projecting on red brick and it had to be like 9pm before it was reaally dark enough for it..also..not sure why this wasn't painfully obvious to me before, but lesson learned..double stacking projectors does not double their brightness (ie two 2000 lumens stacked will not equal 4000..itll be more like 2500 if you're lucky)

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","There was once a time when Langan was far less cynical when it came to commenters on his theory. However, two things in particular are worth noting when it comes to the Scientopia discussion.

1. He was angry because Mark had already made posts attacking the CTMU, not speculatively but as if he were completely familiar with the theory, twice, and these had been up for some time. Given that Langan feels his theory is enormously important, as I suspect most of you would agree it would be provided it is true, he really does not like people bashing it online, in part because he feels this is unethical in its own right, and in part because he feels this will attract wads of bad attention to the CTMU. Once again, regardless of your opinions of the CTMU, Langan is absolutely sure that it is correct in every aspect, and he thus defends it passionately.

2. Langan's goal is no longer simply to correct the people criticizing his theory. He does so, but he also fights dirty with them if they fight dirty with him. He does this because he knows from experience that regardless of how he carries out the argument, people aren't going to be keen on the CTMU (of course, its critics would say that this is because it's false), and because he wants to get the message across to his criticizers that he's onto them and that they're making a major ethical error. Of course, this comes across as threatening, which causes these people to ramp up their arguments to vicious levels, and the discussions tend to get out of hand.

You accuse the CTMU of being subjective, but I challenge you to quote a single thing in the 2002 paper that is directly relevant to the CTMU, i.e., that describes one of its new logical principles or objects of study, and that is subjective.","1320107991"

If the kids get a half-hour or hour spiel (bored to death), not as much candy and told everything they've been looking forward to is bad or evil, shame on their parents for taking them.

2. A holiday for kids to do some MINOR mischief, get candy, have fun dressing up and to walk around outside after dark, possibly after bed-time.  This may well be killed.

On the other hand, with the economy getting worse, many people probably can't afford to participate, trunk or treat, not requiring costumes for kids or the neighbors to buy candy may make logistical sense, although it feels wrong to me having grown up with a different holiday.","1320108025"

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","It depends on what you consider dressed well.

The jeans/t-shirt people are all over the place and so are the ""I just got out of bed sweatpants"" people. If you see someone dressed well it will usually be in some nicely fitting jeans, nice shoes like CDBs, &amp; a henley or nice shirt. 

It's very rare to see someone sport a blazer, but peacoats are quite popular. I rarely see people wearing shoes dressier than CDBs, and when they do, those shoes usually look awful with their outfits. 3 days ago in class, I saw someone wearing a pair of baggy jeans and a baggy t-shirt with some Allen Edmonds-esque black shoes. I vomited in my mouth a little.

You always want to dress well, but not go over the top. Personally, I think Chinos/Jeans with CDBs and a shirt is the best style you can have in college. The ladies will think you dress nicely and you don't look like you're trying too hard.","1320108028"
"Android","t5_2qlqh","I agree. 

In my case I'm using the tablets as kiosk devices so it's not creepy or anything, I do it in case they get stolen.

I'm also running a custom home screen launcher that hides the system bar (as shown in the link I posted above). If, the tablet reboots, it will always go to this home screen launcher and that launcher automatically opens the appropriate application it needs. This home screen launcher also ""provisions"" the device against a server, and when it does that, it allows me to update/install apps. There's a ""hidden"" button somewhere in the launcher that allows an administrator to go into the system settings (with a password).

If you want to lock the use of the device only to the application you want, then I'd recommend you do something similar to this so that they can't change anything, or mess with it.

Moreover, dehydration is often a cause of hangovers, so some people are less susceptible to the nastier effects of dehydration.  Personally, dehydration and loss of electrolytes seems to be the worst part of hangovers, which is why gatorade often works as a great hangover cure.","1320108031"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","""All they want is freedom and equal rights...right of return...legal right to Jerusalem.""

If freedom and peace were all they really wanted why didn't they take the many land deals that Israel offered them? Really, is the end goal statehood? What the rhetoric sounds like coming from their camp seems to suggest that they are not pro a Palestinian state, but rather anti-Israel. Negotiations usually involve giving a little and taking a little and right now I see both sides being incredibly stubborn. Crazy settlers on the Israeli side, and people firing rockets from Gaza clearly indicate something else is wrong.

Plus I am glad you find it ""funny"" that Hamas should be accountable. They have more control than you think, and are also widely held as a terrorist organization in the international community. The PLO, who are the negotiating party at the UN, are the internationally recognized body of the Palestinian people, not Hamas. Do you really think that all of a sudden Palestinian statehood is granted that every faction of the Palestinian people are going to be at odds? And you don't think that Israel isn't going to do something about this? 

My point initially, was that for them to aspire to statehood is a grand idea. But there are steps that need to be taken on the ground way before the PLO unilaterally decides to step in and make decisions for all Palestinians because honestly they do not represent all Palestinians. How about more negotiations and state building? I am pro a two state solution. To achieve this is going to be difficult and cannot be achieved by forcing Israel's hand on this. ","1320108034"

Long ago on 4chan around when we still thought ""Zerg rush"" was a funny meme, giant posts of japanese ascii art would be created as discussion threads and people would lazily saunter over to the ascii art board of 2ch, the original and japanese futaba board, and grab anything with a speech bubble to repost on 4chan as their own, just slightly modified to say something else (What can I say the roots of 4chan's morals and traditions run deep into the past).

One such conversation that took place was a particularly funny one between an ascii Osaka (from Azumanga Daioh) pictured as being on the phone, and a bear we know as pedobear also on the phone.  On 2ch, this bear was the mascot of their ""Nature"" board and hated Ronald Mc Donald presumably for leveling large parts of japan to raise cows for Mc Donald's or something, I'm fuzzy on the details of why (it's from the same Japanese image board who decided a collectable card character shares an apartment with Spiderman). This bear was lifted out of it's own memetic environment and dropped onto 4chan having a conversation over the phone with Osaka.  It being early 4chan, the conversation very quickly devolved into pedophilia and a few times a week another thread would pop up of this crazy bear making lewd, ""landshark""-esque calls to Osaka.  

They photoshopped some images depicting the bear being a pedophile, and set him back upon the internet to go viral as the most lovable pedophile since Aqualung so we could spend our time better on the study of the illusive ""Cockmongler.""

The rest is history, but THAT's why he's clawing Ronald Mc Donald, in japan he's a nature spirit in ascii art, he always was.","1320108035"

He just seemed to be suddenly in a state of shock!""16 Studies demonstrate that even though an infant may not cry during circumcision, the stress hormone level in the blood still increases dramatically, and medical researchers consider this change to be the most reliable indicator of pain response.17 Therefore, lack of crying does not mean that the infant feels no pain.

You guys helped me broaden the horizon of what I could make with these block dudes, considering I was in the mindset that the base should be a ""character"", and I figured this would go unnoticed in my other post. A couple of you suggested objects instead, like the companion cube and Bit. Someone else also suggested Ash and Pikachu. I was never big into Pokemon, but the name Ash did inspire me. Don't worry, his boomstick is strapped to his back. Here are [all six figures](http://i.imgur.com/FtlpK.jpg), just for kicks. For a size reference, Ash's body fits on a quarter. 

Thanks again for all the kind words and suggestions! Really helped","1320108046"
"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","The white balance is off on that photo, but it looks like the plating is already stripped down to the brass. You've got a long-comb Gillette NEW head with a thick handle from a Tech there. The base metal of the cap and the handle are a rosy copper color that I believe is a red brass, and the base metal of the guard plate and the neck on the handle are yellow brass.

Personally, I love the two-tone look of the base metal. Considering its state, I would polish the bejeezus out of it with something like Maas or Flitz -- heck, you could even just pull out the Brasso, since you wouldn't be worried about plating loss -- and get the brass nice and bright. You can even go as far as to lacquer it once it's clean to keep it nice and shiny. ([Here's an example of a brass lacquer](http://amzn.to/vsoqxn). I haven't used that brand myself, so it's not a recommendation just an example.)

You can also replate it, though it'd be easier and cheaper to just find a NEW in good shape if you decide you really like it -- there are plenty out there.","1320108046"

Though realistically if someone goes in there and puts down $3k on a car with a 20% loan, they'd be far far better off just spending $3k on an old Accord.

Suppose I either decide to set up an institution to attain these ends, or patronize one which a friend or a business colleague has established. Now, if he succeeds in setting up the agency, which provides all the services of the Objectivist government, and restricts his more efficient activities to the use of retaliation against aggressors, there are only two alternatives as far as the ""government"" is concerned: (a) It can use force or the threat of it against the new institution, in order to keep its monopoly status in the given territory, thus initiating the use of threat of physical force against one who has not himself initiated force. Obviously, then, if it should choose this alternative, it would have initiated force. Q.E.D. Or: (b) It can refrain from initiating force, and allow the new institution to carry on its activities without interference. If it did this, then the Objectivist ""government"" would become a truly marketplace institution, and not a ""government"" at all. There would be competing agencies of protection, defense and retaliation â in short, free market anarchism.""

However, I did come across an interesting attempt to refute the Judeo-Christian god through evil. 

And not the evil that philosophical theists groan at and claim that Plantinga has solved once and for all. No, not the kind of evil that can be explained away by ""free will"" but rather the unnecessary evil that humans experience by those other than their own (diseases like the spanish flu, worms that burrow into innocent chldren's eyes and blind them, natural disasters). Defenses for god regarding evil doesn't address harm upon humans that god *could* prevent without violating anyone's free will (but, rather enhancing it, right?).  And if a ""hands off even if there's a moral imperative to intervene"" god is invoked then we enter into a rather large rabbit hole of problems. 

Edit: Doing some research I see some responses to the problem of natural evil involving things like ""humans couldn't exist if god made the world not harmful"" but those things aren't proper responses. For example - the earth need not be built on such violent plate tectonics that devastates entire populations in order for it to support human life. ","1320108066"

Ideas are basically old solutions to new problems, or vice versa. If you've worked in a family business I'm pretty sure you must be coming up with solutions (read: ideas) to various small and large problems on a daily basis. So what makes for a great business idea?

For me, a great business idea is something that solves a clear need, has a clear (and preferably immediate) revenue stream, motivates and excites people whom hear about it, and is clearly implementable. In other words, it is easy and valuable.

How do you get easy and valuable ideas? 

Let's look at brainstorming:
Any brainstorming session has at least two parts: an opening up part, where quantity is the name of the game - lots of ideas, no matter how crappy they are, enable new associations around the topic you have at hand. Some people do this by adding random words, pictures or other stuff - personally I prefer to just go for a walk, take a shower or do something different. Or you could just sit down with pen and paper and write one hundred one-liner business ideas.

The second part of the brainstorm is about narrowing down. By clustering, de-selecting and developing some of the ideas a bit further, you get a better picture of what's going on. The most important thing here is to have some clear criteria in mind (i.e. what are you looking for?) and to be able to ""kill your darlings"".

Prior to my startup, I've been working with ideation (idea-development) processes for a couple of years now - here is my best offer of advice: do it again. It's crazy how semi-good ideas can really become great if you look at each idea a couple of times more just when you are ready to initially select. A trick I use is this Ease/Value matrix I developed (sorry about the crappy rez). [Ease/Value Matrix](http://i.imgur.com/6zSWc)

Once you have a bunch of business ideas, place them on a Ease/Value axis according to how easy the idea might be for you to implement, and how valuable the idea is for you and other stakeholders. It's a rough estimate - no need to be super precise unless you are working for a multi-billion dollar corporation. You should get four quadrants: the ideas that aren't particularly easy or valuable; ideas that are easy but not very valuable, ideas that are valuable but not very easy, and finally ideas that are both easy and valuable. Now - and I've seen this happen at all kinds of corporate levels - most people will stop here, take the highly easy/valuable ideas and go with them. And of course they work (at least some of the time) - but the thing is that the stuff that is immediately easy and valuable to you, is probably the same stuff that your competition is thinking about. So here is the trick: do a second brainstorm, where you look at the ideas that might be highly easy, but not very valuable, and the ideas that might be highly valuable, but not very easy, and see if you can't make them both. I've been surprised how well this works.

...anyways, that's my 10 cents. Hope it helps!

in the case of the candidate who only ran to impress his grandkids - why didn't you just decide not to give him equal time? why didn't you think ""this guy has nothing to offer my viewers by way of policy, therefore he does not deserve equal air time."" it's because of you had to maintain the illusion of objectivity, isn't it? i think it would have been fine if you decided to give silly candidates less air time, or no air time at all. as long as your thinking is ""is this helpful for my viewers?"" you can call the shots as you see them.

"sanantonio","t5_2qqch","My take:

SSFCU - worst of all of them (one man's opinion). They charge a fee on debit based debit card transactions. A VERY shady fee in my opinion given the backlash from BofA deciding to charge 5 bucks. Credit Union taxation alone negates a need to charge this fee.

RBFCU - a very good BASIC account. They charge some silly fees (replacing debit cards at a cost, temp checks at a cost) but overall their free checking account is legitimately free. I couldn't identify a charge that would sneak up on you regularly. The only issue I find with them is that you'll easily outgrow them if you  need anything 'complicated'. They're a very basic institution that will probably fit most needs.

USAA - for the record, they're a federal savings bank, not a CU. But they're in here because SA loves em. Good, solid bank. Has a rich history and good management. I have to be honest, I don't know their fees that well but I know what they lack in human accessibility (see their lines at the main branch) they make up in being VERY tech savvy. If you don't want to visit anyone, they'll be good for you.

SACU - They seem to focus most on rates because they almost always have great deposit/loan rates. Fees are pretty solid, there are a few ridiculous ones, but you can get away with a free account easily. Their myGen, although having odd stipulations, is a great account. I don't know yet what to make of this, but their CEO is retiring at year end. I don't know what new management would have in mind or if it changes anything but it's worth noting.

Generations, Air Force, and other smaller CU's in town are too small in my opinion. There's a comfortable middle ground for CUs of not being too small (generations) and not being too big (navy fcu) for finding that sweet spot on rates and fees, and I think majority of others are too small.","1320108080"

Feminists have managed to destroy the patriarchy (explains all the limp-wrist, broken, feminized males in Western civilization). LGBT rights is just another term for slowly allowing more and more deviant behavior, even the child abuse they supposedly prevented will be eroded by their own logic. Women's sufferage was actually opposed by a lot of women in it's time believe it or, the thought (and as we've seen since then), is that it breaks apart the family and divided households are highly dysfunctional. 

Basically, if it were up to feminists, men would be kept in cellars to be used strictly for breeding purposes, until the female geneticists (LOL, as if females make good scientists) could find a way to breed asexually. It's common for anti-feminists to say that feminism used to have a good goal, but frankly, it really hasn't. When muslims finally take over Europe, the feminists will REALLY see what a patriarchy is like.

The few times I've had that conversation with employees who want it all, I play the 'auditor' card. I pass the buck onto the auditors. ""I'd LOVE to do that for you, but then I'd have to explain to the board of directors why we fail our next safety and soundness audit"". 

That usually stops the conversation. 

The few times the CEO has insisted on something really bone-headed, I've told him that I would do it as soon as he signed a letter to me taking all responsibility for any consequences. The last time was when he wanted to give Facebook access to users (we are a bank, and it would  include the teller PCs), because 'this social networking thing is important and we don't want to be left behind'. The compromise we finally came to is that I set up a few PCs for the marketing dept. on a separate network with a DSL connection. I don't want to be the sacrificial goat if he insists on messing things up, then needs a fall-guy for the problems he caused! 

About once a year we get a vendor who tries to tell us that we need to run their software as a user with full local or domain admin rights. So far we've been able to work out alternatives. I've made it known that this will NEVER happen, and if a vendor designed a system poorly enough that it needs those rights to work, then we will not be able to use their services. (IMHO many vendors take the path of least resistance when developing their product, and will 'push' mandates like this on you as long as you don't push back). 

Luckily, I've been right about these things enough in the past (and we've had enough close calls as far as security goes) that he trusts me when I really put my foot down. ","1320108094"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I once had a similar experience, but with smoke. I was stopped at a red light and saw smoke wafting by my windshield. I looked around to see where it was coming from, and it took a good 10 seconds before I realized that it was coming from under my hood. I pulled over as soon as the light turned green, and popped the hood. Underneath, something was ON FIRE. Amazingly, i was able to just blow it out (my backup plan was to douse it with the jug of windshield wiper fluid in my trunk).

It turns out that the air conditioner compressor seized, and the belt somehow caught fire from the friction (I'm not much of a car guy, so if this sounds technologically impossible, it's because I'm not explaining it correctly).","1320108098"
"Android","t5_2qlqh","I couldn't agree more. Google, get your fucking shit together.

Marketing is key to getting sales, a lesson you should have learnt from Apple. If the Nexus One and the Nexus S were commercial failures, as somebody pointed out, then it's really only Google's fault for not hyping them up. The Galaxy Nexus is an amazing device, but as usual, nobody will know because it's not being advertised. Is it really that hard to release an ad campaign Google? God knows you've got the cash.

And a release date, don't get me started. As somebody who preordered the Galaxy Nexus a few days after it was announced, do you know how mind fuckingly frustrating it is to not have a release date? Really really mind fuckingly frustrating. Sure, we have the Nov 17th date in the UK now (which is where I preordered), but Handtec.co.uk is still displaying Nov 7th as their first batch date. I guess it's possible that the release date is Nov 7th somewhere else in the world, and so that's the release date for *unlocked* phones, and the 17th is for carriers. Who knows? It's still driving me crazy.

If they ever want to attain the level of hysteria and stupidity that surrounds an iPhone launch, they need to start giving release dates. People camped outside Apple stores to get an iPhone 4S, which arguably was a minor upgrade from the iPhone 4, yet nobody's going to do do that for the Galaxy Nexus, when on all accounts they should considering how great a device it is. Hell, I'd camp out for it, **IF** I knew when it was actually going to be released.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","&gt;What is your preferred set up as pilot / gunner?

Pilot

* Upgrade: Air Radar
* Gadget: Extinguisher
* Weapon: Heat Seekers

Gunner

* Upgrade: Maintenance
* Gadget: Thermal Optics
* Weapon: TV Missile

&gt;Is it worth giving up flares for another upgrade, or is flares a must have?

The three gadgets for pilot are IR Flares, Extinguisher, and ECM Jammer. ECM Jammer seems to do nothing so don't use that. Flares are nice but they really can't help you when you are getting hit by bullets (from a tank, or AA, or jet). Once you get down below 50% you have to bail or land and repair. With extinguisher you run the risk of being taken down really quickly with heat seekers if you get locked on to twice and get fired upon really quickly. Usually you get hit with two missiles or one stinger missile and get disabled. Then you can pop extinguisher and fly away really quickly and let your helicopter heal itself. Extinguisher usually reloads when your helicopter gets to about 80% without getting hit again. It really just helps you stay in the air longer than IR Flares.

&gt;And if so should both have flares or just one?

I think that is up to you and your gunner. If you are actually cooperating and planning out your loadouts (for me its hard to find somebody to do that) it is up to what you want. The gunner gadgets are IR Flares, Zoom Optics, and Thermal Optics. If you can pick out people and tanks in the map easily then the gunner should use IR Flares. Thermal Optics makes it really easy to see people though so I personally use that. I do not know if gunner and pilot have flares then the helicopter has two sets. I would think not.","1320108117"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I have never come across anyone who thinks that removing religion will completely eliminate all intolerance and violence; these are problems that have their root not in religion but in human nature. 

Having said that, I think OP would agree that religion has been and, in some cases, continues to be a detriment to human society. It may not be the cause of all war but it has undeniably fuelled the division and hatred that has lead to countless wars throughout history. It may not be responsible for all intolerance but it has certainly fanned the flames of bigotry and ignorance that has resulted in some of the most widespread and vicious oppression. Would the world be a perfect place without religion? Obviously not. Would the world be a better place without it? Arguably, but it is impossible to say.

I do not think that ""religion"" is ultimately the real problem most non-theists would like to see removed. The true problem is the infantile and corrosive ways of thinking, which while not unique to religion, have festered within its protection and often with its blessing for far too long. I cannot speak for all atheists but *this* is what I would like to see eliminated from the world today and often (unfortunately at times) the largest obstacle to that is religion itself.

&gt; Is your stance that no obligation exists

People feel the obligation unequally, and likely resent others for feeling it less, or resent others for pressuring them to feel it more.

Natural governance, or specifically basic income, aims to free individuals from this obligation, and place it on society instead.  It does so in a limited way.  The individual should structure his life in order to make due  with basic income or earn more.  Both the individual and society are free from further obligation to their fellow person as a result.","1320108155"

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","I think that the people who really like meme posts are blown out of proportion.  A meme takes about 5 seconds to look at, close, and upvote.   A rage comic, maybe 10 seconds.  

By the time someone has read an article, watched a valuable video (tactics, strategy, bugs, etc.), or participated in a discussion on self post hundreds of people could look a meme, go ""heh"" and upvote it.  Because it's so easy for memes to get quick and easy upvotes they move out of the new queue and into the hot queue relatively quickly.  Once they get into the hot queue they're basically guaranteed to keep getting upvoted because now they're not just seen by people who go out of their way to view the new queue, they're seen by *everybody*.  

Additionally, I think that if ""the community"" really wanted to keep memes and rage comics and other reddit rubbish here there wouldn't be so much support for this.  I absolutely don't think there's any problem with the mods telling people to take a certain type of post elsewhere.  A community of 15,000 full of useful discussions, interesting videos, and even the occasional clever gag is a lot more valuable than a community of 18,000 full of content-free shitposting.  Which community do you think has the potential to last beyond the next major game release?","1320108167"

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","First you'll need to identify the resources your project will expose through web services. In your photo example, those resources are photos and users. For each resource, you'll have a different URL.

Now think about what you want a user to be able to do with your resources. For starters, we want users to be able to look at photos. We also want users to be able to upload new photos.

These two actions show two different methods of communicating with a web service. You can request information from the server, or you can send information to the server. With HTTP, these two actions are usually done with GET and POST requests.

For the first case, requesting a photo, you need to specify which photo you want to see. We'll do that using a unique URL (each photo is a unique resource with a unique URL). Here's the URL you might use:

/photos/172

Once you get this request in your web service, you figure out which resource this URL corresponds to (maybe with a database lookup, or maybe 172 is the literal file name) and you send that file back to the user. Now you've got the GET done for photos.

The other example is submitting a new photo. In HTTP this is usually done with a POST. For this, you'll have another URL that looks something like this:

/photos/create

When a client requests this URL, they will send some data along with the request (called the payload) that represents the content of the new photo. It's a new resource, so your web service will save it to your data store (the database or file as mentioned above) and perhaps return a success message.

So those are two basic operations for a photos web service. There are many other operations you might need to implement (list all photos, delete a photo, edit photo data [e.g. uploader name, photo description]) but hopefully they will be a bit more clear once you've worked through these examples.

One other thing that may help is a definition of CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic operations that one might want to perform on a resource. You might create a new photo (hence the /photos/create URL for uploading new photos), read an existing photo (the GET example above), update an existing photo, or delete an existing photo.

Hope this helps!","1320108167"

And you assume you could escape that position even though you don't train to be in those positions.  How are you going to do any of those things to me while I have your arms tied up while I'm clawing your eyes out?

&gt; You are more than welcome to think that you could get me in a guard then have your balls wrenched from your body and be able to keep that guard and execute your armbar, choke, whatever. But I don't think it's true.

Here's one of your big misconceptions.  BJJ is 25% guardwork.  Do youthink really I need to take you to the guard to do anything to you.  There loads of different ways to dominate you **while being on top**.  So you are welcome to believe that BJJ is all about guard if you want.

I'm not talking at all about them going out and committing robberies with documented, traceable firearms, I'm talking about accidental discharges, or to be honest, unpremeditated emotionally charged reactions. 

I'd rather mandate gun safety courses and exams prior to being allowed ownership. Kind of how we teach driver's ed in an attempt to maximize safety on the roads... even though there are countless asshat douchebags out there who shouldn't be driving. ","1320108191"

It is not just the hymen either, a big part of it is that you are shoving something ""massive"" into a place that had never that particular experience before. And while with the right prep, etc a vag can handle it like a champ, the first time always sucks in this regard.

Simply let her set the pace. Wait for her to get used to you, everything, etc. Let her tell you when she wants you to move. In my experience the hurt quickly faded in favor of the awesomeness of sex. (Or what I figured was awesome. First time ever sex ALWAYS sucks in comparison! Ha)","1320108192"

Second, the USPS assigns mail piece identifiers (IntelligentMail Barcode, or ""IMB"") for any piece that doesn't already have post net barcode attributed. They can use these internally for sorting and routing mail items, which may help identify the originating sort center or post office that received your item.  

Beyond the getting-away-with-it part, it's just not with messing with the Postal Inspection Agency.  For the .0001% of folks that have to deal with them, it's better to avoid people who carry a badge and a gun, but live for and breathe arcane, obscure postal regulations.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","what does intoxicated mean though? I think it is a relatively useless description and utterly impractical in the real world because it's definition is way too broad. You cant do it by units drunk or blood alcohol levels.

UK law does not mention intoxication I assume for this very reason and goes into when they are unable to consent and when you can not assume consent even if it is verbalised etc which includes unconscious/incapacitated, under coercion etc the standard stuff you'd expect but what I found interesting looking the law up is that if the person has been unwillingly given narcotics/alcohol etc they are unable to consent. 

However that seems to suggest if they have willingly taken narcotics and consented while drunk or high etc, are not incapacitated/unconscious etc they are able to consent (i cant say if case law backs this up as i havent researched it so far but I would bet it does) and to me that is sensible.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The problem is deciding on how to deal with the minority of ""protesters"" who are obviously not part of the OWS crowd.

I live in the S.F. Bay Area, I don't know the people who were throwing things personally, but I've seen people just like them at protests over the years. They're like moths to a flame, if shit is going down, they're going to show up to make it violent. No matter the protest size, they're *always* the group that gets in the paper, despite there never being more than 10-30 of them. They will break windows, throw things at cops...do whatever they can to just cause damage and fuck things up.

If I hadn't personally known a few of these people over the years I would say this is fertile ground for conspiracy theory (hire some kids to do just enough damage to justify any police action...).

My point though, is that by now the police know who these people are. They've already arrested them several times over for doing the exact same things in the past. They know those people aren't part of the Occupy Oakland protest. The question has to be asked, is firing tear gas and flash-bangs at a huge crowd appropriate when it's only a few people who actually deserve that?

I know that hindsight is 20/20, but look at the end result. What if that man had died? Was it worth seriously injuring a peaceful protester to fire back at a few other people? Considering the movement has been focused on remaining non-violent, how dangerous would it actually have been to just go and arrest the people being violent?

I know the standard line on that is that protecting the lives of the police comes first, take no unnecessary risks. The natural question in response is ""what level of unnecessary risk is it ok to put bystanders in so that they can avoid risk themselves?""","1320108212"

Good people *because* they adhere to a faith, no.

Let me use another metaphor as I feel I was unclear: Alcoholism is bad. 

 Just because someone is an alcoholic doesn't mean they don't do good things for humanity. They might be a great person, who also happens to have alcohol as a vice.

 Likewise, a person can be a believer, and still a good person, but they can't be a good person *because* they're a believer...

 ..And good people can be corrupted to do bad things by manipulative religious leaders. Simply, they take a bad idea, claim it to be an idea from god, and suddenly the good person does a bad thing because they are tricked into thinking it's a good thing.

 Like, say, executing a ""witch"" in ages past. If you truly believed they were an evil magician hurting the innocent, it's perfectly logical and ""moral"" to stop them... only, they'd been misguided; witches were fake all along. 

 tl;dr: Religion is bad, but religious people can still be good. A good religious person doesn't make religion good anymore than a good alcoholic makes alcoholism good.","1320108231"

Secondly, homosexuality is not a sin in itself.

You are only sinning when you are engaging in homosexual relations.

However the degree of this sin is not what many small-minded people would have you believe. Homosexual relations are no more sinful than sex outside of marriage, masturbation or childfree marriages. I'm certain you know ""good Christians"" who engage in any of these activities so there is no reason you too cannot be a ""good Christian"" even if you fall into sin like they have.

Thirdly, we are taught that the degree of sin is mitigated if you are not in full control of your actions. Also you are not judged based on some idealized being, but based on how well you've handled your life. If you believe that you are a good person and are acting in a way that would be pleasing to God, I would have no problem with calling you a Christian brother. Because I understand everyone has different things that they deal with in their lives, and everyone has their own sins that they must confront. 

Finally, I reiterate, we as Catholics are taught that being gay is not wrong. Now being gay however puts greater pressure on your life and in many aspects of your life, if you desire to be a Catholic you will have a larger cross to bear than others, but hopefully this just means more people will aid you in carrying that cross. That being said, if you decide that the views of the Catholic Church and your own views are irreconcilable there are many other Christian denominations that support homosexual relationships. If you desire to be a Christian I would suggest you look into those Churches as I believe you were graced with an intellect to allow you to seek out God in your own way. And if you are earnest in that belief you will be in the Christian brotherhood.","1320108233"

&gt; Neither party is actually anti-war or pro-military cuts.

neither is Krugman:

&gt; If you want to see what it really takes to boot the economy out of a debt trap, look at the **large public works program** [emphasis added], **otherwise known as World War II**, that ended the Great Depression. The war didnât just lead to full employment. It also led to rapidly rising incomes and substantial inflation, all with virtually no borrowing by the private sector. [(source)](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2009/02/krugman-is-wrong-on-wwii.html)

it is very interesting that he thinks of the near-total destruction of Europe as a ""public works program.""  but here's an even better quote of his, re: WWII...

&gt;Think about World War II -- that was actually negative social product spending and yet it brought us out... If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack and we needed a massive build-up to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months. And then if we discovered, ""whoops, we made a mistake,"" we'd [still] be better... There was a Twilight Zone episode like this, in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we need it to get some fiscal stimulus.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was never any good with children either; nor was I very interested in them. But it's different when it's your own - when you've been with them since they were really really small, there is no ""uncomfortableness"". And I would not want to miss the years when they're so small - it's amazing to see how they develop; how their little mind works and how they're like a sponge sucking everything up. I think by missing that, you'd be missing some of the most rewarding parts about having a child.

Hey don't get me wrong now - you know people that claim having children is the best thing that ever happened to them. That's bullshit (or if it isn't, I'd argue that person hasn't had a very interesting life). It's hard work, it can be very stressful, it requires a lot of sacrifices and some days you wonder why you ever thought this would be a good idea - more so for men, then women I think. But I'm still happy I had a child and it IS a very special thing; sometimes in surprising ways. Hard to explain really... but I will say this: I don't put any stock in people at 23-24 saying they'll never have kids. I was dead set against kids, in fact, I swore I'd never have any; just as adamantly as you... and now look :) And I have a lot of friends that were like me and they now all have kids. I also have some that didn't... but in general that had more to do with lack of opportunity (i.e. stable relationship) than out of principle. What I mean is... people that are the most dead set against it usually do end up having them, whereas it's the people that weren't really thinking about it all and sort let time slip away from them that didn't.

Having said that, despite the truth in what you said, you're being incredibly one-sided. The Israelis definitely have some legitimate grievances with Palestinian ""leadership"" and Hamas, and their history with the surrounding countries can't so easily be ignored. Also, countries like Syria do nothing but hurt the Palestinian cause. Most Arab governments don't give a fuck about Palestinians, they are simply using them as a proxy to harm Israel.

&gt;S. 968 would authorize the Attorney General, or an affected intellectual property right owner, to commence legal action against Internet sites dedicated to copyright infringing activities or the sale of counterfeit goods.

You may be sure that I will keep your concerns in mind should this or similar legislation be considered by the House of Representatives in the future.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","What difference if it is or is not normal?  The issue is, she turns you on and you want to have sex with her.  Right now you are getting ambiguous signals and you want to turn those into a definite 'yes'.  Women are reluctant to ever say 'yes' as they never want consent to be taken for granted.  If they say 'yes' they are afraid it will change the relationship to where saying 'yes' is expected, to where they will have to justify their decision if they chose to reject you the next time.  They always want to be able to say 'no' if they chose to.

The answer is - you do not ask her.  Instead you just escalate slowly, not enough to initiate rejection, but just enough to make her feel comfortable with taking another step in the right direction.  You might start with a back-rub, neck rub, throw in a caress, tell her how beautiful she is, tell her how nice her skin feels.  You start with a reach under the back of her shirt to rub her back, and if it feels good, with a little luck the shirt moves higher and higher, and maybe even comes off.  When if feels right throw in a kiss.  Shoulder blade, move to the neck, I am sure you can take it from there.

This way she gets to be with you, and never has to say 'yes'.  If she decides to change her mind she is free to do so, and does not need to invite you back for an encore.  If she really enjoys being with you, she may initiate sex herself next time.  If she is still ambivalent, she may not bring it up, and just wait for you to seduce her again.  Any which way it goes, the uncertainty of what she really wants should be gone.  Either she rejects you, or in some way she accepts you.  But it is up to you to take the next move.

Good luck.

A lot of specialization comes from the inputs that the particular structures are being fed from. Ng discusses recursive algorithms, which appear to exhibit similar properties. 

For example, you can do edge detection, then pass the output through the same algorithm and get object detection, and get scene recognition at the next pass through. This is practically the same approach that Hawkins is using with HTM, and his argument that a similar process occurs in the brain doesn't seem outlandish.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Before i begin i'd like to say that I appreciate the conversation, and as an AMA im guessing there is no such thing as off topic material so no need to apologize for ranting. If anyone should apologize for ranting its me lol.

I feel that i am far too new of a user to say much about the status of the AMA's on this site.  However combining your thoughts with the comments my friends have made on the subject I starting to get the gist that there has been a bit of reversion to 4chan like tendencies, but i'm not familiar with 4chan either,

Regarding the topic of worth i think its obvious that im not in this for the ticks lol or i could have just gone to a section where everyone there tends to agree with one another like atheism, or trees done something.  But i understand what your saying.  

Honestly in terms of a solution i have two things to say.  The voting system on reddit is essentially a democracy and the way democracies are designed is simply not to topple. More so than lets say monarchies or dictatorships which don't topple through conflict or appeasement.  The reason for this is that they constantly topple within the system itself, when people get tired of Bush's face they vote Obama etc. etc. While in a environment where there is no suffrage the political status quo (in this case quality posts making it to the top) is far easier to keep the environment ""mature""(i'll use mature as a proxy for whatever adjective one prefers) because the unenlightened masses (who would vote on their ignorance) don't have a say in what makes it up and what doesn't.  I suppose a simile for this would be to have someone like the creator of the site appoint people to go through and only they get to decide what makes it up.  With a system like that you can ensure that there is quality material, but the masses will eventually leave because its damn near impossible for the moderators to keep up with the fluidity of the whims of the masses (one could imagine why it is that command economies often fail, and why capitalist ones are stereotyped to do so well, not claiming one is better than the other)  But perhaps a smaller more mature society of reddit die hards wouldn't be so bad.

The second thing however is as Reddit is designed as a democracy one could argue that its perceived devolution is a testament to it doing it's job well.  Basically the reason ""crap"" posts make it to the top is because over time (due to immigration a.k.a people switching site preferences) the community has grown to value the ""crap""

That being said you are completely correct in saying that the sanctity of AMA has devolved (in your opinion) which from what your saying i'd agree with. However it is important that we take our own opinions with a grain of salt.  But on to the solution basically were doing it right now.  Short of changing the system (as exclaimed earlier) the best thing we can do if we want to see legitimacy return to this section of Reddit in general is to take charge, vote, and continue to put up worth while using our powers to keep the nonsense ones down.  That's all we can really do at the personal level.

 Unless we (as like minded peoples) band together and form a Leviathan (Hobbes lol i'm way to nerdy) which is perfectly plausible as a method that could work but due to issues of cooperation near impossible to start

Sorry for my rant lol i hope what i said makes sense and answers your question, i tend to speak in analogies btw which why i randomly start talking about government ","1320108250"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Dude, you live and study in Pakistan and still stick your neck out? As someone from the region (Punjab, India) who is an atheist (born Sikh), even I have the brains to toe the line so I don't get shot and/or screwed in some other way.

In the eyes of your univ, you *are* a bad example, liability, yada yada - they don't want some fundie student to get a gun and blow you away on campus for your ""lack of faith"". They're may be wrong, but looking at the big picture and the situation in your country, I can't say I blame them.

That said, I empathize with you - I am an atheist but the only people that know this are the friends I've made in the USA and my sister. She says I can never tell my father because he will either kill or disown me. Other, more scummy elements of my family would probably favor only the former option.

Regarding moving to another country - do it ASAP. I would not suggest America - despite having been a great experience for me, this country is headed down the shitter and you don't want to show up just as they pull the flush. Head to Europe - the UK is a bit a xenophobic but very chilled out otherwise, especially if you make an effort to assimilate. Germany is similar. France is a bad idea right now, given where you're coming from and your Muslim background (even if you are a non-believer yourself).

I hope your life turns around for you, but above all, please don't take any unnecessary risks. You're in a country where you'd be lucky to escape with your life, while we lot sit around and bitch about evangelical Christians.","1320108250"

Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones. ~ attributed to Marcus Aurelius

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The cons are fairly obvious, but I'll point them out. If Origin becomes popular enough, EA gets a monopoly of online sales. That doesn't mean we'll get something better because of it, quite the opposite, whenever there isn't competition, innovation withers, prices rise, and the products become worse.

If you want a good example of this, try to remember what the state of the mobile phone industry was before the iPhone's appearance. We were getting clunkier, slower and more expensive phones, and they were in no hurry to improve the experience. When the iPhone arrived, we got iOS, Android, Web OS, Windows Mobile 7, it shook everything up, and now we have vastly better mobile devices thanks to that.

If you think I'm talking bullshit about the pricing, look at the prices of 5 random games on Origin. Now go to Amazon, Play.com, cd-wow.com, and other game retailers and check the prices. You'll find that most of the time, Origin is priced much higher than in those places.

Another con is that you're locked in to Origin. There is no way around it if you want to play the games you legally purchased, you have to go through them. That means that whatever limitations Origin has, the number of PCs you can use the games on, the number of times you can activate, whatever bullshit EA wants to pull, it can. Steam has done the opposite and actually become more open as time went by. You now have the option of purchasing some games that work across 2 platforms (3 if you buy Portal 2 for the PS3) with nice cloud-based save-game features.

And finally, the most dire con is that, if EA can get away with Origin, it won't take long until other publishers try to pull something similar. I don't know about you, but I don't want to have Steam for Valve and Indie titles, and Origin, THQ Store, Ubistore, Activision Store (they already have their own store kind of, for Blizzard titles)... If each developer goes ahead and makes their own store, they'll be able to treat us worse. Right now, they have to compete with each other because they sell the same games in the same channels: the same stores, etc. If each of them have their own store with exclusive titles, they can mutually agree to strip certain rights or ""goodies"" from us.

Their job is to maximize profit, and I don't blame them for that. But I do blame us as consumers, for falling for every pit they set before us.","1320108266"

* You doing consulting for IPL while managing EG
* Slasher being a ""journalist"" while working for MLG (same with Chobopeon now)
* djWHEAT debating the merits of SC2 on TV while working for TwitchTV
* Various other IPL staffers having deep ties to certain teams (Reign, Complexity, EG)
* IGN sponsoring Reign
* MLG owning SotG
* Rakaka staff working for DreamHack
* etc etc

Do you think this is something that will go away, and is kind of necessary while the industry is growing because you kind of need 2.5 jobs to make one real job, or is it something here to stay?

I'm also curious what you think of the large amount of invitational tournaments, and basically how every foreign tournament Koreans are just invited, do you think qualifiers are important for growth? If qualifiers are online should they be global and completely open, or closed regionally?

This may actually answer the question in some manner. When body/mouth noises have me glaring and seething, I often find myself thinking that a person should have the self-awareness and consideration for others NOT to make noises like this. If I am in a movie theatre, and you are chomping your popcorn, my night is ruined. If I am in fourth grade and you're essentially snoring while awake, I feel like you should make an effort to quiet yourself. 

I go out of my way constantly to avoid crunching, slurping, breathing too hard after a long flight of stairs, even passing gas outside of the bathroom. It's just consideration for everyone who doesn't need to hear that stuff.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Not really, but I could have phrased it better. Of course what we're really interested in, in terms of standard of living, is resource usage per capita (very tightly correlated to quality of life measures). It's generally held by folks who promote economic growth (which is almost everybody who has an opinion about it) that growth is the means by which populations go from poverty to, if not abundance, at least a tolerably modest way of life. And this has been historically true. It's the rising-tide-floats-all-boats theory of economic social change; sure, the rich (in this case rich nations) get richer, but the poor find their lot improved as well.

So, here in the States we have the highest energy usage per capita, maybe twice Europe's and many times that of the poorer nations. So, if we stick to this model and wish (as they likely do) that the poorer nations might rise to at least a European standard of living, then that means an several-fold increase in their per capita energy usage. Even if the US and Europe (and probably you too, Canada) don't increase their standard of living at all--or if they do, they do it without using more energy--the global per capita energy usage has to keep climbing. A lot.

And it can't. We don't have it. More and more sources are pinning global peak conventional oil production at around 2004-6, and if it production begins to decrease, as it seems it must, it's probably impossible to bring alternative energy sources online fast enough to even make up for the loss, *much less* account for the growth needed to bring everybody up to a palatable standard of living.

Maybe some long shot like LFTR will swoop in and save the day, but I doubt it, and I certainly wouldn't bet the future on it. But even then, we *must* concern ourselves with:

* Freshwater access
* Nitrite contamination of water
* Potential decline in phosphorus availability
* Declines in a number of rare metals and rare-Earth minerals used in the manufacture of so many of those glorious things that we create economic growth by purchasing.

And finally, while I'm no deficit hawk, we have to come to grips with the fact that our economic growth, at least here in the states, has for the last several decades been driven not by the manufacture of products but by the issuance of debt. We now have national debt, consumer debt, and even student loan debt at such levels that they will simply never, ever be repaid. So as we consider the other constraints, we may very well be looking at ""peak debt"" and it's accessory, ""peak credit"", and we may be drawing close to both.

Sorry for the wall of text; I've been learning a lot about these matters lately but I'm still putting my thoughts together and claim no expertise. Criticism welcome.","1320108277"

"news","t5_2qh3l","sure, but when the more grungy, drunken, have-nowhere-else-to-go types show up, they are seen as less than desireable, they cause the police to break things up, they ruin photo ops... but these people live in the streets, some of these parks have been their ""homes"" for years. 

so it's like, let's all protest, but if you're out here because you have nothing, no hope, an addiction, and are a mess, well, you're kind of ruining the image. 

my point is that the people protesting by and large aren't (or at least weren't) championing the cause of the homeless until they became or were threatened with being homeless themselves, and now that they are out there protesting, they suddenly realize what it's like for people who have been living on the street.

if these drunks and so forth had proper treatment, they likely wouldn't be in the protest zones in the first place. most homeless people try to avoid places with cameras and police. but free food, secure beds, and clean toilets are like gold when you're out there, and the longer the occupation continues, the more this will become an issue until it is properly dealt with. 

i'm a disabled usmc vet, fwiw. i have been homeless, and even tho i have a service connected disability and va benefits, im not being fully treated by the va. they just don't have enough specialists to deal with all the ""hard cases"", and if i want ""proper"" treatment for emotional/mental issues i can pay for it out of pocket like everyone else.

we like to pat ourselves on the back and say we care, but when you are homeless, the entire universe doesn't care. you might as well be an inantimate object. people don't look at you, don't want to talk to you. life isn't all happy endings. sometimes people just die. my last best friend drank himself to death in the field we slept in. outside of me and the workers who had to come pick up his body, no one gave a shit. for some americans, that's life :(","1320108286"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It varies from game to game and opponent to opponent. Some players have more conservative styles, others play more aggressively.
It really varies depending on a number of factors. If you're losing, play aggressive. If you're winning, play defense. Personal styles factor in as well, it all depends.

And while your opponent is important a lot of the time, in Scrabble it can be as if you're playing against your own letters and the board more than another person. It isn't like chess where every move you make is dependent on what your opponent is doing. Each play can be approached as if it were an individual puzzle that needs to be solved. But it's factor into your decision making things like the score, your opponents strengths/weaknesses, how many tiles are left, what tile have been played, etc. So basically every play can assessed on its offensive or defensive qualities. The ""right"" play depends on a number of factors.

I'm an aggressive player.

"Warhammer","t5_2qqd4","For anyone interested, I got my ass handed to me.  First, there was only one guy there who wanted to play.  I told him I was new and he just kind of shook his head and apologized for not having an easier army.  He left his vanilla marines at home and only had an army of Jokaero Weaponsmiths in Chimeras with Coteaz.  I didn't really care, because I had no other options and knew I was going to lose anyways.  He apologized profusely during the game for only having that army with him, so I don't blame him for stomping me.

My first big mistake was that I wasn't very familiar with the different scenarios.  We rolled a Dawn of War game and I had no idea how I wanted to deploy.  My poor Deffkoptas didn't get to take their turboboosted scout move and were completely ineffective all game.  Not that they could have gone far because he had servoskulls blocking the entire middle of the table anyways.

Next, I was too timid with my advance.  I left my original trukk stationary on the first turn in order to let the other one catch up.  Both were destroyed before making it to my second turn.  I should have just gone flat-out to get nearer to his tanks and get my wreckage out of one of the choke points.  I then disembarked the orks in a completely nonsensical way that left my Nob at the back.  When they finally made it into assault range, he couldn't attack and I did nothing to the tank.  The turn afterwards, his Jokaero obliterated the entire squad with flamers.

Then I didn't turboboost my deffkoptas on the first turn because I was afraid his entire army would deploy right next to them and obliterate them.  I forgot about the 3+(?) cover save they would have had.  They took an instant death wound anyways and had to fall back.  By the time I could move them forward again, it was too late for them to do anything.  They did hit 3/3 of their twin-linked rockets on a Chimera on one of the first two turns, but none even glanced.

Finally, I forgot to take a KFF save on a Killa Kan.  When I realized this later, I rolled just for the hell of it to see what would have happened and I would have been able to keep the Kan on the table.

Ultimately, I would have lost that game no matter what.  Even if I could have popped his tanks with better play, his Jokaero still would have torn my squad to pieces on their next turn.  I could have at least done better though with more experience.  All in all I had fun, but I hope I can catch someone much less experienced next time I go look for a game.","1320108287"

"politics","t5_2cneq","(NB-- based on year-old knowledge. Your home could have different rules. I could be wrong. Get your own legal advice.)

Lawyer, here. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine. The way it works in my jurisdiction:  police only need to establish that property is ""an instrument"" or ""a proceed"" of crime, on a balance of probabilities. They do this by filing an affidavit (usually the seizing officer saying why he thinks you: are bad person/could not make your own money/bought drugs while being in a car you own/etc) but they don't need to sue you or anything like that.

In fact, in order to effectively defend against the suit, you need to file an affidavit in response AND be cross examined on it. If you fail to comply with either of those steps you can pretty much auto lose. This is a problem with the right to remain silent, since this might compel you to give evidence that could be used against you in the criminal case.

Eventually, there is a hearing before a judge as part of the seizure process. Maybe you get your stuff back, there. By then a few months have passed, and you've probably spent a lot of money on a lawyer (or found one upset enough to help you for cheap).

There used to even be a provision that protected the government from having to pay costs if it wrongfully took your stuff. Thankfully, Courts declined to enforce it in at least one really nasty case.

tl;dr: They can take your stuff. They can make you explain why they shouldn't take your stuff. It's hard to win. They used to not even pay you for the court costs, even if you won.","1320108290"

For spices, add 1 tbsp of smoked paprika, 1 tsp dried oregano, and 1/2 tsp each of dry mustard and salt.  Also add 2 tbsp each packed brown sugar and worchestershire sauce.  Stir it all up.

Cook it on low for 6 hours or so.  Without a slow cooker, just go ""slow-and-low"" in a casserole dish in the oven.  Thicken it up with a 1/4 cup of water with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch or flour in it, and serve over egg noodles.

I would go to work, come home, go to sleep, wake up, go to work, and I wouldn't be recovered from running around on my feet for fourteen hours. 

Shifts never ended when they were scheduled. 

You had tip out - give up your income - to other people who made a decent wage already - 13 to 9 dollars an hour. And people rarely tip the full twenty percent. 

Cheapskate managers would have you doing work - for *two* dollars an hour after all the tipping customers were gone. At least up that shit to min. wage when the store closes

Min. wage was averaged over entire week; if you worked Monday, you were fucked, and earning forty dollars for eight hours of work. 

Health insurance was unaffordable, even working full time. And the managers would threaten to fire you if you missed three days because you had a 103 degree fever. 

If something screwed up, the majority of managers would rather yell at you about it than help fix it. 

All of this makes for a depressing work enviroment. Maybe it's better if you don't work for Olive Garden or whatever cheap ass casual resturaunt, but that's what it's like for servers at family resturaunts.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It is important not to think of evolution as ""steps"", but as more of a very very very gradual sliding scale from one characteristic to another. 

In this day and age, selective pressures are very weak on humans, especially in the ""developed"" world. Morphological change seems unlikely, because the survival of a human is rarely tied to someone's physical prowess anymore; survival no longer relies on a person's ability to defend and hunt for themselves. Similarly, medical conditions that would be deleterious to humans in the wild (such as glandular problems causing obesity, haemophilia, epilepsy, and congenital heart conditions) can now be mitigated within the constructs of our society and people afflicted with these conditions are able to survive to reproductive age, whereas they would likely have perished quickly in a hunter-gatherer society. It is no longer ""the survival of the fittest"" for humans, but rather ""the survival of everybody"". 

All that is to say- if society stays the same or achieves even greater levels of ""development"" than currently exists, I for one do not foresee much human evolutionary change. Perhaps a somewhat realistic morphological change would involve a relatively ""minor"" adaptation such as a decrease in the average amount of hair on bodies, but again it is hard to see how something like this could really affect fitness in a developed society.

But if i recalled correctly according to canon law homosexuality in itself isn't a sin, just the practice? for example the if you are homosexual but dont proceed to practice homo sex then you are no where in the wrong in God's eyes as you are supressing your earthly desires.

I could wait for cyanogen mod to release a rom for my phone, or I could just get a new phone. For me, buying a new phone is actually easier and takes less time than waiting and modding.   

 As for the hardware, I can see your point, but is trusting a dodgy company really any worse than trusting random people on the internet? Just because something is open source does not guarantee it is not malicious. I'm not going to look at the source, so how do I know its not spyware?   I don't have any clue, again, it is probably quicker and easier for me to just buy a new piece of hardware.  

I can see why programmers care, I just don't know that it actually makes any difference to non-programmers who tend to buy new things rather than fixing old things (as unsustainable as that might be).  just because the code is open, doesn't mean its out of corporate or individual control, how many open source projects have corporate backing? How many open source projects are ruled by an all powerful lead programmer?

The top 10% therefore control &gt;80% of the stock shares. 


So... We the top 10%? 

Let's not forget business equity though:

Top 1%  - 62.4%

Next 9% - 30.9%

top 10 % - 93.3%


So all this responsibility goes back to the great executive circle-jerk and the continued myopic decision making as executive pay and bonuses for even the worst performing executives hugely outpaces the rest.  That is not rewarding performance.

#1 - but you said the CEOs were hired on an open market which is predominantly not the case.

#2 - No, what it proves is that this perceived merit of being the best decision makers and therefore the best 
CEOs is false when the hiring basis is not, in fact, merit, but who knows who. 

#3 - Interesting. Not that it matters, but I know them personally - ask them candidly about the skill of their 
peers. 

#4 - So then the severity of the crime is greater and therefore the punishment should be greater under the concept of great power = great responsibility (apologies to Stan Lee)

"love","t5_2qhnh","In my opinion, long distance relationships only work for couples who are operating on the belief that they will wait for marriage to have sex. 

I've said for years, and will always say, that a healthy relationship is a three legged stool:

* Friendship
* Romance
* Sex

It's a natural and healthy part of a relationship, and I've never been able to make a long distance relationship work (3+ attempts, all different women, all using the ""L"" word at the time). Sorry, I know you were looking for hope, but this is my honest opinion.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","here's a point to consider: if you put an arbitrary limit on a relationship it's going to burn brighter because of the limit itself- people often want what they can't have, and restrictions can make desires stronger.  a limit based on your insecurity is another unhealthy point, even though it is valid and important for them to take it slow so you can catch up.

I'm also going to go out there and say that his ""feeling trapped"" is kinda selfish and ridiculous.  no partner should ever, *ever* make you feel that way, and if it is, it's a negative association and that's bad.  understand that I'm getting this information second-hand here, but it *sounds* like you're being manipulated (seriously, if he was just lonely that's one thing.  wanting to explore and be with others is another thing, but 'trapped' by you is a completely different thing and to me very much a red flag).

however, if you're telling him one thing and feeling another, you're just exacerbating the problems (emotions carry through in words very often).  dealing with insecurities and fears *fucking sucks* but you can do it.  Identify the problems, acknowledge them, because your emotions are important and valid, then determine what you need to feel better.  Is this a pre-existing issue that hasn't been dealt with?  do you need more love and affection from him or others?  reassurance that you're awesome and amazing and that he loves you?  do you need to talk to the other lady to get to know her better so that she's not some mysterious other with whom you cannot bond?

don't ever forget that you are a wonderful and amazing girl, and that he knows he's lucky to have you (anyone should).  seriously, look at all the trouble you're going through!  Remember, the other girl is likely intimidated by you, too.

when's the next time you're going to see him?  can you go visit over a break sometime soon?  if so, try to meet the girl, too, and get to know her.  On a side note, no sexy threesomes unless you're confidently comfortable with her *and them together*, and don't get drunk with them either (tipsy is ok, but drunk will make your emotions more uncontrollable).

tell him what you need to feel reassured.  write letters.  have him send you shirts to sleep in &amp; some pyjamas.  bake him (them) cookies.  schedule date night with him (skype video = awesome).  little things like this are especially important in long distance relationships, let alone poly relationships.

I watched them become 'nouveau poor.'  I was about 19 or 20, and still living at home at the time.  I was kid, for gods sake, and I saw it coming a mile away.

Clues that things are about to go very wrong:

Your mortgage statements start coming from the bank on paper that is a color other than white, like yellow or pink.

Phone, electricity or other basic services come under threat of deactivation.

Phone calls start coming from people who would otherwise have no business calling you (power utility, for example).

Credit card companies start calling.  A lot.

I was a kid, and I was smart enough to find a roommate that I lived with for almost 2 years after my parents lost the house.  Thing I don't understand is, how could you not see it coming?

Colour: Sauternes.


Nose: Brine, tar, seaweed, and of course, peat. Typically Laphroaig, but then...
honey and a hint of chocolate. Light on the smoke.


Taste: As with the nose, but with a sweetness that is never cloying. The
embodiment of Laphroaig in a glass. Perfectly balanced.


Finish: Long with spice throughout.


97/100

First, let me say that Laphroaig has always been one of my favorite distilleries, and
that the Quarter Cask and the 10 year old are my daily drams. So, my expectations
were exceedingly high with the 18. It did not disappoint. Non-chill filtered and coming in
at 48% abv. the 18 is the epitome of Laphroaig in a glass. I couldn't find reference to
any added caramel and since the colour is quite light for an 18 year old I would
guess that there is none added here, at least at any levels that were discernible to my
palate. For me, this has more oomph than the 15 year old that it replaced, and the
strangeness of the hint of chocolate puts it ahead as well. I can't recommend this
dram enough for Islay fans; you can taste the care that's gone into the bottle.  ","1320108341"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in the **exact same situation** with a girl several years ago. Unfortunately for me, she ran and told her friends that I attempted to rape her.

Stop! Story time...

One evening we were wrestling around on the floor because I playfully stole her shoe. Eventually, to ""distract"" her I grabbed her pants and started to tug them off. She pretended to try and pull them back on, but when I stopped messing with them she immediately said ""Oh, you don't want them off?"" in a tone that made it obvious she was messing around. Long story short, I basically forcefully removed her clothes, stopping once or twice only to find her making no attempt to ""escape"". I found out upon getting her panties off that she was very aroused (you know what I mean), at which point she said ""Okay, let's go to the bedroom"", and we fucked like animals for a few hours, then came out and watched TV in the living room.

Virtually the same thing happened on her next visit. She broke away at one point, made it to the front door, then turned and said ""What, you're just gonna let me get away?"", so I ran up and grabbed her to continue the game. That night ended the same way, with us fucking for a few hours.

Third time she came over, I briefly explained to her what a safeword was and when it was used, and I told her that the word **safeword** itself was acceptable if nothing else was agreed upon. About 30 minutes later we started up as usual, only this time she knees me in the jaw. She immediately starts saying ""Oh, God! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that!"", and I say ""Okay, no problem. No hitting though, we're not getting *that* rough."", and she says ""Fine."", except a few minutes later it happens again, at which point I back off and say ""Okay, I'm not into physical hitting, so we're done with this for now."", and she says ""Well, that one was an accident too but I'm not apologizing for that one.""

We sit there watching TV for a few minutes, then she gets her things, puts her shoes on, and says ""Sorry, I'm kind of trying to get with this other guy, but call me next time you just wanna hang out as friends."" and leaves.

I decide I just want to hang out (seriously, I do have female friends that I *just* hang out with), and I call her. No response. After two tries, her friend answers her phone and says I have nerve calling her ""after what you tried to do to her!"" More prodding reveals that she's telling everyone that I tried to rape her and she ""fought me off"". Keep in mind that she's 4' 11"" and under 140 pounds and I'm 6' 0"" at 220 pounds. I could literally pick her up and throw her across the room with a little effort.

Fortunately, she had very little credibility. Nobody that knew me believed her story, both because they know I'm not the type to commit rape and because they know she's incapable of physically fighting me off like she described. 

I still wonder if she seriously sees what happened as her escaping a rape attempt or not. I've heard people can have some pretty screwed up perceptions.

Dungay makes it clear that if the arrest was for the purpose of investigating a crime or for questioning, then evidence obtained as a result of the questioning may very well be excluded under the Evidence Act.

&gt; I appreciate that Pt 10A of the Crimes Act provides for the detention (for a limited period) of a person after arrest for the purposes of investigation. But such a lawful detention is dependent upon a lawful arrest having been effected (see s 356B(1)(a) and s 356C(1) and (2)). 

Also where the power of arrest is exercised disproportionately, i.e. in response to a very minor offence, and the offender reacts by resisting arrest or assaulting the police, the court will possibly exclude the evidence of these further offences: DPP v Carr [2002] NSWSC 194.

I see a lot of college students with really terrible study habits that can't seem to do well on exams regardless of how many hours they study. It's not about the quantity of studying, but about the quality of studying. Take away all distractions, sit down and actually study, really hard, for a good hour or two. You can take a break every hour and get a drink, go to the bathroom, get some food, but then get back to studying. Put your phone in another room, tv off, computer off (or internet turned off if the computer is needed). To study well you need to have absolutely no distractions. Good luck!!","1320108359"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Compromise is your friend here... but you (obviously) both have to meet the other half way.

I am the 'slob' in my relationship. It's like mess doesn't appear on my radar at all until a certain point...a point that is way past my boyfriend's point. It was actually a huge point of contention with us for a while, and is *so much better now* for a few reasons.

- The 'meet me half way' thing. For example, the number 1 most important space for my boyfriend is our living room. He cannot relax *at all* in it if it is messy or cluttered with things. This is the room that I always make sure is tidy, no matter how lazy a day I'm having, because I *know* that if my boyfriend arrives home from work to a messy living room that he will feel the need to spend time cleaning it before he can sit down. For his part, he's tried to become less highly strung about mess in other areas of the apartment (like the tendency I have to use the old 'floordrobe' storage system for my clothing because I just step out of them before I get into bed a lot of the time).

- Communication. For a long while my boyfriend would stew quietly noticing mess that needed to be cleaned while I sat around doing nothing... or he would start to angrily clean without me, until I would notice his anger cleaning and ask if he wanted help (""*Of course* I do...the apartment is *really messy*. Aaaargh""). I explained to him about mess just not registering on my radar. He said he didn't want to feel like a nagging parent trying to get me to clean up...and I assured him that it *wouldn't* be like that at all, but that he needs to *tell* me when the apartment is at a point where he feels it should be cleaned, and I will get right up and help!

Don't get me wrong though, just dropping things when I come in the door is a hard habit to break...as are all those little habits that add up to clutter and mess little by little. But once you get used to it, it really doesn't take that much time.","1320108360"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","this is why we all need lessons in kink-role playing-and BDSM. if you're going to play these types of games, as many people have said, there needs to be clear communication BEFORE acting out the fantasies and you NEED to establish a safe words. while i think you didn't ""rape"" your girlfriend, you showed bad judgement in how you went about attempting to fulfill her fantasy (and yours obviously). between 70 - 80% of all rapes are committed by people the victim knows. without lengthy discussions about aggressive role playing that includes ""rape fantasies"" and the use of safe words, these games can quickly cross a line and traumatize someone or even become rape. your ex may have been raped or assaulted at some point and your attempt may have triggered her. BDSM and kink can be used to heal trauma, but you need to really know what you're doing and why. you should never just spring a rape role play on someone...it's pretty much just rape at that point because you're the only one who knows it's play. the fact that you say you asked for consent several times sort of gets you off the hook, but at the same time, consent after the fact is sort of moot. just be more forward thinking next time. discuss the fantasy more in depth and be safe.","1320108362"

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","It's true about the hydrogen gas, although if the battery is well ventilated, like, the hood open, I doubt that there is any danger of there being enough gas to ignite. This could be a case of being better safe than sorry. 

By having both of the (usually large) clamps on the battery it is be possible that they could contact each other, causing a massive short, possibly damaging the battery on the other end.

The reason they specify an unpainted surface is because the paint will insulate the connection, either resulting in an incomplete connection, or a burn through the paint as you mentioned.

FWIW the engine should be well grounded to the starter because it is bolted to it, but the battery has a large grounding cable going directly to the starter. Some late model cars have the battery buried in plastic crap, and therefore provide remote terminals to jump the car with.

In my opinion, I think it is best to connect to the battery post itself. As you noticed, when you complete the connection, there is a spark. Today's cars are packed with very sensitive electronics and sensors. That sudden burst of energy can damage these electronics. The battery is best suited to handle that energy, and the closer the spark happens to the battery, the less likely the surge will reach more delicate components. I am not an EE, but this is what makes sense to me.","1320108374"

No. TNG is usually considered the best Star Trek series and while TOS is slightly more cowboy-like it is still good because it is classic and original. I would say that if you are going to let the lower quality production get in the way of watching at least TNG, then you are missing out on the main chunk of what makes Star Trek good and for a stupid reason. Most here will admit that, aside from a few jewels, the first two seasons of TNG are very lackluster. But once you pound through those you hit gold, the production quality goes up, the actors don't look like they are stuck in the 80's and the writing and directing improve drastically. It's totally worth it.

Also, if you think you enjoyed ENT, which is widely considered the worst series, you'll really love the rest. That is, unless you liked it for the CG space battles, and in that case you should just stick with the Star Wars prequels.","1320108376"

"SF4","t5_2r4cj","I switched to a stick a couple of months ago, and it's been downhill ever since.  Yes I practice and yes I've seen the videos.

While it's not the stick's fault (and my game has certainly improved in areas), I find the ""referenceless"" empty space between the stick's contact points frustrating.  When using a D-Pad, I could tell where it lay simply by the angle edge/pressure on my thumb.  For the lack of a better way to explain it, the D-Pad seemed tighter, more responsive for me.  

This might sound weird, but I've had to replace the physical feedback and reflex response I normally got from my old pad with a visualization of where the stick is (or is supposed to be).  It's like I have to keep track of the stick's position mentally (like an imagine in my head) and move my hand appropriately.

Still, I'm getting better at ""feeling"" where the stick is as I play.  Eventually I hope the visualization as I play unnecessary.  ","1320108379"

&gt; First things first: Military spending does create jobs when the economy is depressed. Indeed, much of the evidence that Keynesian economics works comes from tracking the effects of past military buildups. Some liberals dislike this conclusion, but economics isnât a morality play: spending on things you donât like is still spending, and more spending would create more jobs.

You seem to disapprove of war and of wasteful military spending as much as I do. We could have a big anti-war protest party all day long, but it doesn't change the fact that the government paying a person to build a fighter jet is an economic stimulus if that person would otherwise have been unemployed. The fighter jet might never see combat. The jet might go out every day and blow up a hospital full of nuns and handicapped children. That wouldn't change the fact that paying someone to build it can be an economics stimulus.

By all means continue to rail against factual observations about how money works, and continue to hate Krugman for making those observations. Your objection to the death and destruction of war won't aid you in your Sisyphean battle against facts.","1320108398"

Getting shot at, multiple times.  No question about it.  Seeing a car slow down up the street and the windows roll down.  You know what's gonna happen, but you're just sort of frozen there.  Before you know it, they're shooting.

&gt;Funniest

Seeing a lot of the guys trying to run from the cops, but not getting far because their pants were so damn far down.  Wear a belt, fool.

&gt;Most depraved

I'm sure I could think of a lot of them, but what's coming to mind now is distracting a pregnant woman so a friend of mine could grab her purse.  That was pretty fucked up.

You make things up because ""it feels right"" and you claim I have an agenda? Man, the technical term for that is projection.

In this entire discussion all I can take away is that you have some sort of deep-seated hatred for women and believe that they are all liars who would charge a man with rape to extort him or any number of other reasons. Yes, there is a small percentage of both sexes that engage in despicable behavior, heck there are even men who forcibly rape women - even though I doubt they number past the one to two percentile. But in your world a LOT of women accuse men of rape. 

That's pretty sad, in fact, bordering on pathetic.

I don't like that he will only support the bill if his amendment or associated bill for the creation of an environmental impacts agency succeeds; he should be supporting the bill on its merits, and convincing other MPs to support his proposal on his proposal's merits.  But therein lies the fault with our current parliamentary system: all deals are done outside of the chambers, the speeches in the chambers are delivered to an empty room in an absurd form of posturing and time wasting, and the vote follows pre-determined lines.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This. I've had four virgins. The first two, it was like normal sex, with a little resistance on the initial penetration followed by a kind of pop feeling, then I was in and it was tight but very well lubricated (both girls were average in appearance and I was in good shape and young and handsome at the time, plus I did a fair bit of foreplay, mostly because I wanted to see it down there before it was changed forever). I didn't enjoy these much.

The next two were about 4 or 5 years later, then 8-9 years after that (recently). Both were very very hard to break into, very much like rape, and very enjoyable for me but very very painful for them. The first one left with a dopey, drugged like grin on her face. The next time I tried, it was healed, and she was too tight to get into again. We broke up shortly after. 

The next one didn't enjoy it at all, and actually preferred anal due to being less painful. But I did get her a second time- by jumping her by surprise when she was sleeping over and we were sleeping together naked after oral sex earlier. I got another round of anal sex, again she said it was less painful and that was the end of it- we broke up a little later. 

For some it's extremely bad, for others it's not bad, and for some others I guess it's like nothing.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Well probably the first difference between chess and even football is the fact theres barely anything else to do with a chessboard. :P

The further difference between video games and games in real life is that video games not only have things that are impossible to do in the real world leading to people just doing anything for fun, but also that video games (once again only if you are not playing a competitive one this doesn't apply as much) you arn't putting anything in, and the main thing you expect out of it is fun. So if you arn't putting in effort you don't lose anything when you lose, and its possible for things other than winning to be fun, or if the effort to win is high other things can even be funner.

"wine","t5_2qhs8","I think a key element is that enjoying wine is not just about the juice in the bottle but also the overall experience your getting, a lot like how eating out at a nice restaurant is about more than just what is on your plate. 

I can get a tasty Italian dish for around $15 at the Olive Garden that I'll probably enjoy very much on any given evening. But I'll still gladly pay much, much more for that same dish at one of Mario Batalli's restaurants or San Domenico in New York or Spiaggia in Chicago. While it is easy to argue that the net quality of that dish will better than then the Olive Garden version, can you really quantify by how much? Is is 2x better (worth $30), 5x times (worth $75) etc?

But I think the overall *experience* of going to a nice restaurant and having a dish prepared from a world class chef plays an enormous role in enhancing the enjoyment. There is also an exclusivity element since while there are hundreds of Olive Gardens in the world with thousands of daily customers, you know that you are one of a few hundred (or even dozens) of people who get to sample this particular dish from this restaurant.

Similarly in wine, the experience of trying a world class wine like a Chateau Margaux, Champagne Krug, Don Melchor, Col d'Orcia, Roberto Voerzio, Sea Smoke, Cayuse, Grange and Bryant Family is about tasting the history and story behind the winery, land and region that produced the wine. While there are millions of cases of far less expensive wine in the world, you are paying for the exclusivity of being one of the few thousand (or even hundreds) that get to try some of these wines.

TL;DR - If wine was only about the juice in the glass, we can all get drunk off of Two-Buck Chuck but the overall experience for wine lovers make some of the higher end bottles worth the price. ","1320108438"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","""Outcome of what?""

The extremely complex game that is reality.

""We are? How so?""

Keep in mind that in the CTMU, God is identified with reality itself. Were this not the case, one could again follow the CTMU's reasoning and see that reality satisfies certain principles traditionally attributed to deities. One could perhaps regard smaller parts of reality as 'demigods', but they would still be presided over by the greater aggregate that is all of reality.

""What happens to God if we weren't? Is that even an option?""

If we weren't part of a greater reality, we would be God ourselves.

""Can God 'exist' without us?""

As far as I can tell, God could exist without us specifically, but not without any sorts of information processors at all.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I'm going to have to disagree with you there.  Maybe The Odyssey and Harry Potter aren't directly matched (I'd have to go through and do some serious analysis to double check) but a basis in classic literature gives Harry Potter a whole new depth.

Sticking with a short example from Harry Potter, let's also stick with Greek mythology.  Kerberos was the three headed dog guarding the gates of the Underworld.  He appears in a few stories of Greek myth, including as one of Herakles' Twelfth Labours (Herakles was to capture Kerberos alive) and, more relevantly, in the story of Orpheus and Eurudike.

Kerberos appears in Harry Potter under the guise of Fluffy, the three-headed dog.  First, one familiar with Kerberos will likely recognise Fluffy immediately and realise that music will put it to sleep and that Fluffy is likely guarding something important.  This is, admittedly, not very useful for analysis, but it is a fun note.

The more interesting analysis is in recognising the inherent equation of the chambers of the final trials in Philosopher's Stone with the Underworld.  This immediately conjures several levels of understanding, the most interesting of which (in my opinion) are:

1. Kerberos' role was to prevent those in the Land of the Dead from returning to the Living.  This suggests that the chambers are doing more than just protecting the Stone; those who enter are never intended to leave.
2. Again, given Kerberos' role in guarding Life from the Dead, it makes sense that he'd be placed in front of the Philosopher's Stone, which grants unnaturally long life.

These, in turn, imply a lot more that I won't bother going into.  Admittedly, this is a pretty small and simple analysis, but the example was chosen for ease of exposition.  A solid backing in classic literature actually reveals a lot more behind the entirety of the Harry Potter series and, indeed, most other great books.","1320108472"

This isn't THAT remarkable.  For several years, researchers have been able to take adult cells, and then genetically manipulate them to become similar to embryonic stem cells  That is not new at all.  What's new here is the observation that many of the same factors that are involved in ""reprogramming"" adult cells into stem cells can ""fix"" cells that have reached a state when they are old and nondividing (senescent) into dividing stem cells.  (This is something that you might predict but hadn't been shown yet; researchers had always reprogrammed adult cells that normally divide throughout lifetime like skin cells) Senescence itself has some correlation with aging processes, but the novel thing here is the observation that it can be reversed.  This might have more implications for cancer research than it does for aging, because tumor cells probably hijack a process similar this to escape normal controls on cell replication.","1320108478"

Obviously, our species has existed in a form biologically similar to today's for about 100k-250k years.  But what if, 6-8k years ago, God took that basic evolved/tweaked biological form, and made a spiritual addition to it.  Poetically, He breathed into a newly tweaked prototype of the latest human model.  Now He would have a new species that had a biological and spiritual component; something new.  

This new hybrid creation then propogated, side-by-side with the other examples of biological-only humans.  At some point, the other, un-souled humans died out, or God did a miracle and ensouled all the other live biological-only humans.  

But after He started the newly-souled hybrid species, God began His relationship with corporate humanity.  In putting the eternal spirit into a mind capable of communication with and understanding of eternity and God, a new thing was started, and society, agriculture, religion, etc. followed.  

I can't prove any of that, but it does fit with anthropology, paleontology, archeology, sociology, and the Bible.  So I put forward that the above is logically consistent.  Lots of unanswered questions, but it's not illogical. 

As far as the suffering thing that Hitchens mentions, I don't understand what he is getting at.  Jesus dying didn't directly keep people from dying ""from their teeth"".  And Christians believe that God did interact with and show great interest in humans from the beginning of the ensouling hybridization of our species.  

Now, most Christians may not have thought of all this, but the same is true of the other side (explain abiogenesis, atheists...or do you just want to take that leap of faith?)","1320108478"

If I enter into an open relationship and all parties agree on non-exclusivity, I would say it's not ""straying"", and also not immoral. Of course, there's a whole spectrum there that is merely suggested. I think that it is most important to stay true to your word if it's given and come to a mutual agreement on changes to that word.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","A couple issues there. Firstly, the names are ascribed to the gospels, we do not know who wrote them, but we do know they were written around 60-100 AD, so the disciples were probably quite old by then, assuming their authorship. 

Secondly, what we know of jesus and his teachings stems mainly from the four main gospels. So naturally, they would provide a context that implies that those four disciples (assuming once again their authorship) had the correct message. 

But the Gospel of judas is based on the idea that all the other disciples had it wrong, and completely misunderstood jesus's teaching. The gospel claims that only judas truly understood the message. So on that basis, the NT can't have MMLJ if it has Judas in it. 

It would be all, here is Jesus's message! jk Only Judas knew what was up

It's apparent I have a lot of new people on my team, as most of the game it seems like we're all running around like headless chickens trying to capture points, and in general getting our asses handed to us.

I spot Junction for capture, as it seems to be the best point for take.  (Alleyway was a clusterfuck as usual).  It turns out I have one other person sticking with me, but we eventually run into a trap and are clearly outmatched.  My teammate holds up in one of the small rooms on the street, and I go prone and toss him some ammo.

We manage to take out one person, but then he fudges a grenade throw and it lands on top of me.  I'm already injured and prone, so he ends up TKing me.  I curse to myself, resigned to my fate, but he jumps out to res me just as two enemies round the corner.  Somehow, he manages to res me and take out both of them.  (This guy was rank 3, btw.  He was making a lot of noob mistakes, so I imagined he was still learning his ropes)  Taking advantage of the situation, we move out for the capture, and are met with some more teammates who had made their way successfully down the other street to flank.  A few more enemies respawned there, but we had every spot covered.  It was really well coordinated for having no voice communication.

I then decided that the alleyway needed cleared.  Everyone was spawning there, so it was pretty chaotic.  It was at that point I realized just how long you can shoot with an extended mag.  It's insane.  On top of that, I had suppression specialization.  They tried to turn the corner to rpg spam, but those that did couldn't get a bead on me.  I was a crazed madman standing out in the open, just letting bullets fly.  My chaotic fire didn't net me many kills, but I got a ton in suppression assists.  My teammates mopped up those who managed to find temporary cover, and proceeded to the left alleyway, where we managed to retake Market (after losing it while we were in the alleyway), and win the game.

After the match was over, it struck me how much fun it was to play when people were at least trying to fill their roles, even if they were new.  At what point everyone decided to act coordinated, I don't know.  Laying down that cover fire in the alleyway sold me to the support class.  Not only did I feel like a beast, but it worked.  That, and my teammates surprised me in just how much they turned things around in the final moments of the game, with most of them being fairly low rank.","1320108529"

Also, I have the same car (well not a convertible, but basically the same) and one of the most annoying things I've had to deal with in servicing the car myself is the oil filter.  Audi, instead of using the disposable can contained filters, has the container for the filter built into the car and you just buy the paper part.  It sounds like a good way to save money and be more eco-friendly because just buying the paper part for the inside of the filter is cheaper, and it's easier to recycle.  But the problem is that when you go to take the old one out its full of oil and when you open the container it spills all over the engine and yourself.  Supposedly Audi sells a hose thing that lets you drain the oil out the bottom first, but quick search online only gave me products that cost about $30 and seeing as all you need is a rubber seal to fit into the bottom of the canister I was a little disappointed in this obvious ploy to make me buy their tool or be forced to just get oil all over my engine whenever I go to change it.","1320108542"

What's at issue here is EA's corporate image.

If someone told me tomorrow that Comcast was stepping up bandwidth throttling to make Netflix unwatchable, I'd go in expecting the worst, and if someone wrote about EA tapping into my private tax documents to farm data I'd expect much the same.

If you egged my house, I probably deserved it, but I try not to do anything that deserves egging.  I was adding to the thread with a simple comment and I think that you went a little over board with your response to it.

There are many things in life that are overboard/suck/shouldn't have happened but do, but shit happens.  One of my other neighbors in our last big snow storm hit my car and my neighbors car, cost me $2500 to fix.  My neighbor was in his garage and walked out after he heard the crash, and saw him driving away from the scene, so we confronted him.  He had no insurance, and told me that we should go ahead and call the police because there was no evidence, and that they would come and laugh at us because there was no evidence against him.  Unfortunately he was right, he literally admitted it but I had no evidence to prove it other than my neighbor said so, and I wasn't going to spend 2k in court costs to take some asshole to court who probably wouldn't be able to pay me back anyways.  He even pulled the ""Well Obama's president now, so I can do whatever the fuck I want and he will protect me because I'm black."" card...w/e the hell that means lol.

My point behind that story is Karma.  Real life karma.  I did something shitty to my neighbor (different neighbor than the one that hit me), so something fucked up and shitty hit me in return.  That's how my life has always been.  Is it just coincidence?  Probably.  But I feel that the nicer I have become in life, the better my life has been in return and the less shit has happened to me.","1320108564"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","First off, sorry if my comment came off as mean-spirited. I can get a little carried away with pretentiousness when critiquing photos. :/

Anyways, really the only issue with the photo is that the light was behind the subject rather than to the side or in front of it (although in some rare cases, backlighting can look good) and there really isn't anything you could've done about that. I would've still taken that photo even with the bad lighting too! It's still a close up of a lion, which is very cool. One other thing that I'll mention is that you did a great job of using the rule of thirds for composing this photo, but since the centerpiece of this picture is the lion rather than just being an artistic photograph with no interesting subject (think nature or portrait photography versus... not sure how exactly to describe this, but less subject-based areas of photography that focus on turning everyday scenes into an artful picture) I might have centered the lion a little bit more while still keeping the rule of thirds - especially since the background filling the rest of the photo isn't very detailed. However, I really don't know if I would change the composition. There's nothing wrong with it, but just something to keep in mind.

Hopefully that made sense and hopefully that helps you in your future endeavors. :)

Also, I don't really know anything to recommend besides criticism and taking more photos which you mentioned (which are definitely both great ways to get better). Sorry!

What I said is that we wanted to create our own space, but the feminist trolls (not feminists in general, but a specific group of individuals who are feminists or claim openly to be feminists) and other feminist individuals felt that they had to come into our space and police us and attack the things we were trying to sort out.

Furthermore, we wanted a safe space for men who have been hurt to be able to come in and discuss what they were feeling and try to work through the pain. 

But when you get ""alleged feminists"" who come in and call these guys ""whiny men,"" ""neckbeards,"" and other disparaging insults, or others who come in and try to derail the discussion about men's issues and pain and tell us how we should ""man up"" and just fix women's problems, then what are we supposed to do?

Obviously, according to you, we should just ""be men about it,"" suck it up and take the insults and attacks, right?

r/mensrights is not a ""shithole."" It is a battleground created by folks like those in r/againstmensrights, r/shitredditsays, r/feminisms, and the various other redditors who have nothing better to do with their time than to try to disrupt a place where men can try to work out their issues.

In fact, in re-reading your reply, you basically dismissed everything I wrote in order to continue in your tirade about how horrible a place that r/mensrights is to you. You are not interested in changing things; you are interested in dismissing male concerns and male feelings in order to support your viewpoint as to how we are supposed to act according to your skewed paradigm of how our movement is supposed to act.

By the way, we don't defend our ""angry members."" We acknowledge them, and we are willing to explain why they are angry. We ask people to look past their anger and see the real issues behind it. We downvote the more vitriolic and hateful comments because we agree that they do not help our cause. But we do understand that there are feminists who are out there with the purpose of dismissing our viewpoint and we will combat them with all of the tools at our disposal.

For the record, I'm one of those angry men. My life was nearly ruined by a false rape accusation. But I worked and learned how to live past that horrible moment, and I've learned how to channel my anger.

**Let me say this again; I am still very angry about what was done to me and I always will be, but I have learned how to use that anger to serve my purposes and not let it control me and distort my vision.**

Let me sum things up; we are what we are...whether on r/mensrights or r/masculism. But right now in our movement, we acknowledge that men are angry because of what has happened. That is part of who we are. 

If this is a problem for you and you cannot accept the reason for our anger, then perhaps you are not the ally we need at this point of our movement.","1320108587"

It wasn't a best of three sets. It was best of three games, double elimination. In a tournament like this, you play a set of three games. If you win, great; if not, you get an elimination (and up to the final round you get thrown into the lower bracket). As described Dignitas got all the way to the final round without taking an elimination point. CDE got to the final round but had lost a set, so they had an elimination point.  

You can't end a tournament without everyone being eliminated but one person/team. When CDE defeated Dignitas, they gave Dignitas their first elimination point (out of 2 allowed). Neither team was eliminated in that set. Since it was the final set, there were no other teams for either team to play, so they played another (and final) set vs each other for the second elimination point.

I wrote that very wordy with the hopes that I explained it perfectly.

Edit to add: This is going purely off what the Riot staff member said, which makes perfect sense to me. If anyone has a copy of the tourney rules, I'll be happy to peruse them for differences in language.","1320108594"

Even the most symbiotic organelles have their own genes.  (mitochondria, which live in evey celll in our body).  Isn't that fascinating!

In fact, because mitochondrian DNA evolves separate from the human genome, and is passed down only from the mother, we've been able to determine how long ago our last common female ancestor lived:

It's going from a cordless screw driver to an ice auger, but you really need something in between. maybe a drill press.

#4 on your list is probably the biggest problem facing adaptation right now, and it's burning the candle on both ends.

On one hand, you have the elites, who aren't really more than script kiddies. The people who write the software are actually smart enough to not insult the people they wrote it for. The most advanced thing these people have done is tweak their bash script or fight about Emacs or vi.

The on the other end of the spectrum, you have the chronic complainers. Many of whom live in this very subreddit. They like to bitch about how broken X is, or how it's Y vendor's fault that something's not working. It's like installing Archlinux has given them a merit badge, and they can't wait to run up to you and show you how smart they are, and that they could never misconfigure something ever and it's all Adobe's fault, you shouldn't use free drivers because they're not free. They invent things to get angry at as the ecoculture actually gets more stable. Instead of being grateful that Adobe provides a commercial plugin at all, they are angry because the source code, which they will never read, is closed source.

Somebody bothers to write an open implementation of a popular tool on another platform, Mono, and the nerds get angry because ooh, Microsoft is going to sue over the project they actually endorsed, meanwhile ignoring that Oracle sued Google for their free implementation of Java, and they don't even write code. They fear Microsoft the same way the Tea Party fears Socialism. 


So, on both ends, you have people complaining about it being too easy, and you have people complaining that it's too hard, neither of which actually contribute to the community.

The even sadder is that these two groups are the vocal minority. Out of the less than one percent of people on the planet who use Linux, less than 5% of the user-base is rabidly vocal. And yet they manage to ruin the experience for everybody.

As a note, if it locks because of an issue with one transit agency (such as GO), it won't stop you from using the card with other agencies. I had this happen once on the GO (wouldn't let me tap off), but I was able to use the card at a TTC subway station before I got it unlocked.","1320108600"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'm echoing it because from what I'm seeing, he's essentially been predicting your intended responses would be. I wanted to make sure this was the case.

&gt; That said, the whole country could use a few things, most importantly an independent, public judiciary.

That's rather... off-the-wall.

And also unfitting, because basically, you get to decide what the country needs (most importantly), but for everything else, there needs to be economic demand before implementation.

Well, in anycase, I actually do agree that more rule of law would be nice for China, but here's something to consider:

Rule of law is generally stronger in countries where most of the country's labour comes from services. Rule of Law is above par in the US, where lawyers are estimated to contribute twice as much to GDP as auto-manufacturers. The US can afford it with our specific economy. Overlitigation and the costs (both direct and indirect) of it are debated to no end in the US, and I'm apprehensive of the effects it would have at this very moment on China. It's something to consider. 

Historically, civil rights, rule of law, democracy start to kick in for a country when GDP per capita reaches a threshold range of 8k-15K USD (adjusted for inflation; based on current values). This makes sense as you need a stronger, stabler middle class that demands more civil defense mechanisms against the elite. This is based off the writings of various modern, American geopolitical strategists (one of whom is an adviser to the current administration), so I never thought of it as communist propaganda. As such, I'd consider you to be putting the cart in front of the donkey.","1320108602"

""I never officially left the gang, I suppose. It's not like I had official papers that I turned in. I just stopped hanging around gradually. I'm probably still on some gang task force's surveillance for all I know. I went to college and used that as an excuse for why I wasn't around as much. People seemed to be OK with that, or at least, not very upset. I'd show up to parties and hang around with people, but remove myself from the criminal aspect of it. Eventually, it became kind of obvious that I didn't want to be putting in work anymore and started getting harassed and threatened about it. It got to the point that I left the state and started over elsewhere. It's been a while since that happened so I doubt they're too serious about finding me.""

None so far.  All this happened a while ago and if they haven't killed me or fucked with me by now, I doubt they will in the future.  (Knock on wood).

It should be clear from my very first comment that I am defending the problem of evil as a valid argument against the existence of God. We can point to what suffering exists in this world and say that, if there were a God, he would have the ability and the desire to prevent such suffering. My intent is not to ""criticize God"" but to defend an argument for atheism.

&gt;  ...absent god you have no claim to stand in solidarity for a suffering child...

Yes I do. Moral philosophers have been coming up with such claims for hundreds of years. My own preferred way of conceptualizing our moral obligations is to posit that they stem from those obligations we would impose on ourselves and each other if we were able to contract with each other without knowing what position we are to hold in society.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, Christians do believe in lots of crazy stuff too. But you can't necessarily ""disprove"" anything, and anything that seems like it could be disproven/illogical, they fall back on the ""the Bible is metaphor"" argument.  That's not Mormonism. The LDS Church claims the Book of Mormon is the most accurate book on earth, and its littered full of anachronisms, linguistic errors, plagiarisms, other errors, etc. There's numerous archaeological errors, historical errors, serious DNA issues, etc.  Moreover, the Book of Abraham is 100% a fraud--we know this not only because Egyptologists have translated the text and shown that Smith was entirely wrong about everything (including the fascimilies), but also it's been carbon dated to the 1st century A.D.--about 1,000 years after Abraham would have lived, and on top of that, the text is littered with anachronisms.  

So while you can't necessarily directly disprove god or Christianity with empirical evidence , you can disprove parts of Mormonism (Book of Abraham), and there are numerous other major holes.

&gt;I don't think God would not continue to reveal truths to us, His children, or stop leading and guiding us. 

Technically, after the 1st century when the world went through the Great Apostasy (and the church was ""corrupted"", the keys taken away, no prophets, etc.) God apparently did give the world a Prophet for nearly 1,800 years. Apparently it was acceptable to not guide us then. Apparently, not ONE person was valiant/worthy enough to be told the truth. Apparently, not ONE person ever followed the prompting of James 1:5, or similar NT, and asked God what the true church was. Right.","1320108621"

Throwback is a word with implications of progression, plain and simple. To continue with the example of tails, simply because our evolutionary line included tails before, to assume that the resurgence of tails is a ""throwback"" to when our hominid ancestors did have tails is erroneous. Perhaps an adoption of tails will eventually be more suitable for a different environment we live in during the future, but it is irrelevant that our ancestors did have tails (outside comparative studies of biological evolution).

I hate to bring yet another example into the discussion, but I'm sure you're familiar with subterranean creatures that have eventually lost their eyes, due to a lack of light in their environment. Well, it is a misconception to see it as a throwback if the occasional creature has a mutation which gives it light receptors (a fully developed eye would almost certainly not happen in one generation). It is simply a mutation that might prove to be beneficial in the future if, say, there was more light available in the environment. It might bear similarities to historic mutations, but to use the word ""throwback"" to describe it would be a misnomer, in addition to the implications of the term.","1320108623"

It's also a bit odd people here saying 'who cares'; there's a prevalent stereotype that women don't play games, or that if they do they only play casual games like Farmville.  Or that if they play something more serious, it's because their boyfriend or husband talked them into playing the game.  

Hell, half of that isn't even a stereotype, it's true.  I've never met another serious female gamer IRL, ever - I had a WoW guild for a while that was pretty female-heavy, but it WAS true that almost every single one of them was there because their SO played.  Which is fine - I'm happy that women are getting introduced to games in whatever way.  But it reflects the male-dominated state of the industry.

So given that female gamers are sorely underrepresented in non-casual gaming, what's wrong with stepping up and bringing attention to their existence?  It's nice to know that there are other women out there, especially when half the post on gaming subreddits are about how you all have to argue with your damn wives to get any play time.

A few people take all the money and the rest of the country is forced to live on credit. What is similar from what I understand is that the Greeks have also been duped into thinking that they can live like Kings on debt.

Safety nets can get out of hand I suppose. I have never ever seen that happen on a scale big enough to cause serious damage, usually it's when power and wealth is too concentrated that we have catastrophic results. Some people in Germany don't work at all because unemployment is too cushy, but still those aren't enough people to damage the overall economy and people still prefer to work instead of just collect unemployment.
The important part of a safety net is that you don't lose any potentially skilled workers to economic down turns. Homeless workers are useless, hence, safety net.","1320108643"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Morality is interesting because in a naturalistic sense it doesn't exist. Right and wrong are not black and white, both depend on an individual's viewpoint and are definitely debatable.

Morality in a humanistic sense is an evolutionary trait. Just as the strongest, fastest, biggest ape in a group will be more likely to mate, being an individual who attributes to society and the well-being of all will also be more likely to mate.

Morality in a psychological sense is different. We don't like it when bad things are inflicted upon us. Say somebody stole a toy from you when you were young. Later in life you will have learned not to steal from others because that feeling of missing that toy is so clearly imprinted in your brain. It has to do with our sense of kinship and chivalry, another evolutionary trait. Of course, many are missing or can wholly ignore these things.

Morality in a philosophical or ethical sense is the strangest of all. It basically comes down to defining whether you would want the greater good for yourself or for mankind as a whole. If the former, then stealing things is obviously a good choice. If the latter, then no, stealing is wrong. The latter generally has the greatest benefit, so that's the view that society should hold.

But then again, to a rock floating in space, there is **no such thing as right or wrong.** Morality is wholly defined by human beings and enforced by mankind as a whole. If you murder somebody, thinking you're in the right, but society disagrees with you, society will decide that it's right to imprison or kill you. Measure of enactment or deferment of action.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","Now this is the type of debating I could get used to. ;)

White, middle class American.  Non-practicing Christian parents.  I loved Science and logical arguments ever since I was a child.  When I was old enough to understand the concept of God from the extremely rare visits to church, I hated them both for their fanciful nature, and its desire to get me up early on Sundays.  I became a mediocre Christian in High School, but I would say that I became more serious about it latter, after I had looked into Judaism, Mormonism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Agnosticism and Atheism.  I concluded that God was real, and that Christianity made the most logical sense.  I think the only polytheistic religion I looked into was Buddhism, and Hinduism.  I might be wrong in this, but I thought that if God were real, and active in the world, he would be represented by a major religion, and not a tiny one or a dead one.

&gt;Agreed. But why does there have to be a cause? And even if we knew there had to be a cause, why is that cause a god (as opposed to the big bang etc)? And the main problem I see with the argument - what caused the cause?

In the beginning, there was nothing.  No matter, no space, no dimensions, no energy.  Nothing.  Then, all of the sudden, Something!  Which lead to everything!  This is an astonishing reality to me!  As to what caused the cause, whether you believe it is God or some non-personal natural phenomena, I think it would have to exist outside of space-time.

&gt;Anyway, would you not agree evolution proves that complexity need not be fashioned in any way?

I don't think this is necessarily true, since the natural world and its physical properties have always been even more complex than life itself.  Life wasn't creating complexity from chaos, it was distilling it from physics. BTW, I believe in evolution, and I don't think it is contrary to the Christian faith.

&gt;This is quite vague. Could you give some examples? For example, we are well aware that the biblical age of the Earth is incorrect. Where and how in the bible do you decide to pick and choose - and how do you reconcile the bits that don't make sense?

It is such a broad topic that I would rather write about something specific.  I think that the first few chapters of Genesis are a metaphor for God's relationship with us, and what happened early on.  Here is my current understanding of what the metaphor is referring to.

God created the universe over the course of billions of years using very natural ways (the six days being a complex common Jewish Algorithm I won't explain here).  He is the one who created the spark in the void.  He also made people (through evolution), and breathed his breath of consciousness and self awareness into them.  He told them to tend the garden he made for them (be hunter gatherers), but don't eat the forbidden fruit (agriculture).  But of course, they did.  Soon brother was fighting brother (the remaining wandering hunter gatherer tribes verses the permanently established agricultural societies), and soon the population exploded and the land could not longer sustain the old ways of living.  In the new complex way of life, work time vastly increased along with bureaucracy and slavery, while health, infant mortality and life expectancy declined.  It was in this era of the first few cities that Abraham was born . . .

Do you see how cool the metaphor is when put alongside a historical basis!?  Check out Rob Bell's ""Everything is Spiritual"" on Youtube if you want to know more.

As for picking and choosing, it is usually evident what is poetry, and what is supposed to be fact (though not always).  But most people want to either say it is all literally true, or the whole things is just a fairy tale.  Try to read it as a book about a people and their God, not exclusively as a history book.  Even the parts that are metaphors are put there for good reason, and have something you are supposed to get out of them.  So I do not consider myself ""picking and choosing"". Also, context, context, context.","1320108654"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The church father Origen (184-253 AD) thought so.  From *De Principiis*:

Who is foolish enough to believe that, like a human gardener, God planted a garden in Eden in the East and placed in it a tree of life, visible and physical, so that by biting into its fruit one would obtain life? And that by eating from another tree, one would come to know good and evil? And when it is said that God walked in the garden in the evening and that Adam hid himself behind a tree, I cannot imagine that anyone will doubt that these details point symbolically to spiritual meanings, by using an historical narrative which did not literally happen.

Given the small size of his car the number of batteries he could carry would be limited (not to mention increase his diesel fuel consumption). Gen IV Prius batteries for instance would take 7.8 hours from empty to charge (on a nice sunny day). They would also only hold a little over a kilowatt.

Thinking about her round the clock and having trouble concentrating.  The kind of stuff that happens when youâre 18, but not in your 40âs.  I also donât believe it is a mid-life thing. 
To make matters worse, the younger girl and I became business partners and we both began doing incredibly well together. She started telling me she loved me, etc. and things got quite hot between us. 
She was going through a divorce; her current husband had a drinking problem and lost his job.  She had a young kid and was behind in her mortgage payments. However she kept telling me that I wasn't just a white knight. I was 'special'.  
To make it more complicated, my wife was working all the time and had mental health issues.  The last time I had sex with my wife (over a year ago) she had the attitude of ""letâs just get this over with"".  There was no laughing, no fun, no vacations, etc.  I have a decent paying job and considerable assets. A lot to lose, but I didn't care at the time.
Fortunately, a series of weird things happened and we just slowly drifted back to 'friends'. A year later, it is still very painful for me and I think it could take a long, long time for the feelings to go away. At least it is bearable now.  Now here's the kicker - to this day, I honestly believe there was a mutual attraction between us.  We had a lot of fun, she is easy to talk with, we laugh and had a great time together. She is like no other girl and could have been my true soul mate - we could have been happily ever after.  I guess I'll never know now and might be forever sad and tragic. Strange stuff happens in life.

* What is ""the first place"" for you? 

&gt; I am going to say Standard Oil, but you will probably school me on the subject. =)

* [Significantly](http://mises.org/daily/2317), Rockefeller passed these savings along to the consumer, *as the price of refined oil plummeted from more than 30 cents per gallon in 1869 to 10 cents in 1874 and 8 cents in 1885.* 

&gt; What actor is being left out? How are they being hurt?

* The consumer. They would have less purchasing power. 

&gt; Why would the supply remain relatively fixed if demand is increasing?

* Well, I was referring the [supply cuve](http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2006/05/supply.jpg). An increase in demand will be marked by a movement along the supply cuve, however, not a shift. Suppliers will supply more, but, at a higher price. 

* However, at the same time an increase in input prices shifts the supply curve to the left (further increasing prices).

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","&gt;So If somebody says ""fucking niggers"" or some other racist bullshit, I would have to feed the troll instead of silently downvoting and reporting?

Well, no, later in the post I added:

&gt;In the case of submissions that are rightfully downvoted due to being stolen, hateful or otherwise rule violating content, the report button can be used instead (as it should be anyway) and that user can then be automatically penalized with a chunk of their karma (say 5 or 10 points for each infraction) once there have been a fixed number of reports which the mods have then approved.

My intention here was to think of ways to further discourage people from writing that shit to begin with, and I should have said ""5 or 10 points per report"" in order for it to be more of a penalty, but this all quickly gets pretty sticky and inefficient, so it's probably not the best idea. A half-idea at best.

&gt;I don't like how this could limit the ability of people who are downvoting worthless shit instead of people who are ""abusing"" the downvotes.

Fair point. I guess my idea here was to both encourage responsible upvoting along with responsible downvoting, because positive voting is as important as negative voting to the health of the site and users should be balanced in both. The ratio could be skewed in favor of downvotes (say 3 or 5 to 1), but again, it's an incomplete idea.

&gt; I worry that this would lead to retaliatory downvoting

Well, if measures were in place to make it harder to abuse the downvote, wouldn't that be a built in deterrent? But even as I type this sentence I can think of how people will still find ways to stalkvote users they dislike, so yeah, probably another bad idea.

Like I tried to convey in the post, I'm not saying I have the answers or that these ideas are practical in application as is. They were just potential beginnings of solutions that occurred to me occasionally as I gave thought to OP's question, which comes up frequently, and thought they could be expanded upon through discussion. 

In truth, I don't really have a huge problem with things as they are. Nothing is going to be 100% fair, that's just life, and all-in-all I think the voting system does a decent job. I just think it would be improved if there were some form of accountability attached and ToR is a place to brainstorm improving reddit. So I released my braindrops into the wind thinking some might find their way into mud and others into crystal clear streams. (Damn, that was some poetic shit, yo...)

Who the fuck cares because now you're going to GET to that higher level. Don't give a shit, play the ladder and just have fun. When you catch up to everyone when it comes to understanding the game, you'll naturally start moving up and fit right where you belong. At that point it's time to start refining your play and getting everything down.

To start, the campaign is a great place to get started with understanding just how the game works. Once you've got that, pick a race that you like. It may or may not be one that you'll stick with, but once you've chosen you can fiddle around against comps and eventually just hit the ladder.

Do not be discouraged wherever you end up. Just keep playing the damn game and have a good time.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I have plenty of first hand experience. I don't think I've been to a party all year where at least one person doesn't end up vomiting and passed out. In my experience, teenagers don't 'drink for enjoyment', they drink to get drunk, and usually, very drunk. Of course that isn't universal, but again, in my experience, it is the majority. But I guess you want studies or something? We've had a lot of people come into our school, but they sensationalise a lot, [this](http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/data/05data/fig05_14.pdf) is pretty interesting. I've had a poke around else where and the general result is that around 30-40% of people underage binge drink, and to me that is a pretty dangerous amount, but I can see how people might interpret that differently.

That said, I think it is better for teenagers to be introduced to drinking at an early age (edit: I mean, 16 or something, not fucking 4); preferably by their parents. That way, their parents can easily monitor how much they are drinking. That is a bit of a tangent though.

I think in the end, teenagers lack retrospect. They think they are indestructible. Most people with drug habits begin in their teen years, which I think proves my point. You shouldn't enable people to destroy their body before they have the maturity to understand the consequence.

And honestly, I don't know how old you are, but I'm sure you've seen it. I've had a few friends, and a few of my older brothers' friends go off the rails in a big way, and they were all kids who drank early. I'm not saying that it is mutually exclusive, I'm just saying that it is definitely a major factor.","1320108695"

&gt;We're spending more on 'less'. Digital files have no weight. All those MP3's, films, games and books downloaded from the internet have no actual physical form.

&gt;Same goes for food, we're eating less, but it's costing us more, and luxury these days tends to go hand-in-hand with 'tiny' artisan portions, and even chocolate bars are smaller.

&gt;We are also spending more, but not on things that appreciate much in size or potentially consume much in the way of resources. In this instance that would be homes, and most BTL landlords (the ones who are doing all the buying) feel that buying anything in the way of furniture or fittings is a horrifying concept.

&gt;Our money is going on intangibles, rent, mortgages, debts, energy, is it any wonder we're consuming less when everything just plain costs more?

&gt;On the one hand, great, but on the other, it just points out the paucity of choice available to the majority of people and the fact that conspicuous consumption has again become the preserve of the super-rich only.

If Stanford beats Oregon though, they'll at least gain some ground on OKSU in the **AP** poll.  If OU hadn't lost to Tech, and OKSU beat them, I'd agree that OKSU would have it locked up, but now I think it could come down to style points, and the AP is so in love with Luck that Stanford might have the edge in that regard.  I think OKSU still has the better shot overall though since I think Oregon is probably going to beat Stanford but OKSU has a real shot at beating OU.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt; Wide-open performance, bokeh and AF speed not important? My 35mm F1.4 AF-S begs to differ.

Indeed.

Most people who hang out in photography forums don't seem to understand bokeh.  It's neither the degree of blur, nor the shallowness of the field of focus; it's the **esthetic quality of the out-of-focus areas**.  Bad bokeh = out of focus areas look harsh, hard-edged, textured; bright lines become doubled; in some lenses, the background has a distracting swirly effect.  Good bokeh = out-of-focus areas look smooth and creamy.

The kicker is that, contrary to a lot of people's intuitions, **good bokeh is most important with fast normal and wide-angle lenses**.  Why?  Because these lenses don't blur as much as long focals and this maximizes the opportunity for bad bokeh to mess up your photosâyour out-of-focus areas can turn out slightly blurred yet harsh at the same time.

On the other hand with a telephoto lens like, say, a 85mm f/1.4, the background blur is large enough that it tends to minimize the impact of bad bokehâwhich is often still there in many of these lenses (and can be excited by having insufficient space between the subject and a highly detailed background).","1320108708"

The first problem that comes to my mind with an sudden collapse of one race is that it will disrupt the economy, all the races will suffer. The second, it will distract them from the real goal, the dragons. Logan, being human, will try to have Destiny Edge to bring humanity together. It might even kill them.

I meet my first Christians today who didn't celebrate Halloween and acutally are against it. When getting my morning coffee from this older lady, extremely nice and kind lady, I gave her the ""happy Halloween"" not thinking anything of it, and she kind of froze for a minute and than told me she doesn't celebrate.  Than followed it up with, ""but I remember how much fun it was as a kid before I was a christian so I don't want to deprive these kids of that fun"". I thought that was great, until the next words out of her mouth were, ""So I give little christian scriptures to all the kids who come to my door"". Again, this is the nicest older lady ever, except she is always talking about church and Christianity to me even in our brief 2 minute interactions, but I couldn't help but feel bad because those kids are going to destroy her house with eggs or something for giving them bible bits instead of candy.

Anyways so after going into work I mentioned this to a few people who I thought were very moderate type christians, just because I hadn't meet personally christians who were so into it that they were against Halloween even though I knew that those sorts existed. And to my surprise each one of the five people I asked said that their church doesn't approve of Halloween and they aren't letting their kids go out trick or treating. I was shocked, I don't know what to take from that, either they are more religious than I thought, or even moderates these days are starting to turn against Halloween, or at least the churches they attend are.

Those features can be built on patches of fixed sizes (e.g. 6x6 pixels): try to find occurrences of prototypes (for instance using k-means). You can then pool the occurrences of such prototype code words on larger areas of the picture (e.g. on each of the 4 quadrants). For more details on this approach have look at this [website](https://sites.google.com/site/kmeanslearning/) and the referenced papers.

Another simple yet state of the art feature extraction technique is  [Histograms of Gradients (HoG)](http://www.acemedia.org/aceMedia/files/document/wp7/2005/cvpr05-inria.pdf).

Sorry you had to listen to that guy's offensive comments. Unfortunately there are some gay guys who are even more transphobic than straight folk. Shame on them.

Ok, then how about the bullshit in /r/starcraft2 turned into?  Or how about  /r/badcompany2 and the whole PC master race bullshit?  This subreddit could easily devolve into that without rules that are clear.  

I use /r/gaming because we all know what happened with that subreddit and it was only partially due to the popularity.  With good moderation, that subreddit could have stayed on topic.  Hell with ~25k readers, it seems /r/gamernews does just fine and rarely, if ever do you run across a meme, unless you are in new.

&gt; The overall size of a subreddit regarding the subject matter it covers, and how many people are reading it, contribute, I think, a great deal to how much it turns into ""meme central"" to use your term.

Regardless of size, we already see quite a few meme/rage/foo all the things/ et al posts in /r/swtor.  You do remember the Peter Griffin flame war not that long ago here?  It's gotten worse.  Also note the subreddits I mentioned above have a serious problem with this shit and they are ""small"" subreddits.    

The harsh reality is that reddit has a problem that must be addressed.  Easily consumable content generally gets more up votes because I can vote on that content quickly.  While articles and deeper content tends to slowly rise and not get as many upvotes.  

Look, if it takes me 10 minutes to read an article on IGN about SWTOR, in that same time someone could upvote 100 rage comics on here.  It just doesn't make sense as that content is, well, devoid of content.

Long story short?  This shit needs to end now, before the larger influx of users.  If we have a clear scope of community, then the meme shit will simply not get any traction for the karma whores and we will have a better community.  ","1320108733"

It's like in when a new MMO game comes out, you can bet your ass that no matter what fancy titles for classes they have, they're going to be some variation of the tank/DPS/healer set. 

My characters aren't going to work together. Many of them will die because of their own impudence, arrogance, greed or any of a laundry list of flaws. They were shitheads in society, and now that society has collapsed, their flaws are magnified ad nauseam. Awful people, being awful.

My main character is as-of-yet unnamed, but I'm thinking that his crime should be a non-violent one. I like writing from the perspective of a insane man, or a man as he loses his sanity. Maybe he's a sociopath? Maybe he's a sadist that never had the nerve?

1. Really, I agree 100%  I think SR is more fun than GTA (Except maybe San Andreas, which is only close), but can't figure out how to start a numbered list at 2... lawl.
* The side jobs are plentiful, in SR2 you had a septic tank and drove around (on rails) and sprayed shit all over buildings.  Also there are ""stronghold"" missions where you take over another gangs territory.  These are all in addition to the main story line missions, but don't forget the ability to pimp your character/ride/apartment/gang/tag/, etc.  Then there are the side-side missions which can be found hidden throughout the city.  (Check near gas stations).  The best part about all the missions?  They all unlock upgrades, and they are fun, unlike the tedious monotony of GTA.  (Please don't get me wrong I love the series, I just thing SR is better.)
* I just want to reiterate "" Saints Row is the most fun you can have in the genre.""
* I played 1 many years ago but only played parts of it, then I played 2 and *HAD* to go back to play through 1 so I could understand the story.  It is cheesy in parts, and it definitely made me roll my eyes more than once, but I love the ""underdog taking over story"" and I think SR is really well written on the whole.  I agree though, the story is really secondary to the whole point of the game.","1320108780"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It wasn't rape. The reasoning is obvious. Rape requires intent to perform non-consensual sex.

The law provides implied consent first. Basically, if you attempt to have sex with someone, without coercion, and they don't revoke consent either verbally or physically, it's not rape. They have to make it clear that they do not want it, *or* they have to be physically incapable of putting up resistance (which is why you're automatically vulnerable to a rape charge if you have sex with someone that's unconscious).

The fact that he stopped and *asked her* if she wanted to keep going and she said yes specifically means that she *granted him consent* to physically force her into physical compliance. Furthermore, the fact that he stopped when she told him she wanted him to pretty much prevents her from having any grounds to claim rape.

What most likely happened was that the fantasy became too real for her. It's possible she was raped in the past, or it's possible that she simply allowed it to go so far that it became subconsciously real for her and terrified her. Either way, OP is not guilty of rape because he verified consent multiple times, and stopped the moment consent was revoked.","1320108787"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Jury Duty. It should be noted that there is no guarantee that you will be picked or even sent to a court room. My county has developed a phone-in system that significantly cut down the prospective juror's waiting time and often results in you fulfilling your duty without ever going to the courthouse. Your county's system could have something similar, resulting in you doing your duty without inconvenience. 

Once, I was fortunate to have been picked for a jury. It was an incredible experience, getting insight into the system. The case (drug case with two defendants) was not overly exciting, in and of itself, but it was great to see 12 people of vastly different backgrounds taking their responsibilities very seriously. We found 1 defendant basically guilty of everything and the other basically not guilty of everything. A result we probably wouldn't have reached initially, without everyone's input.

Not to sound like a ""My country right or wrong"" patriot, but this is one of the greatest things about our country: To be judged by a jury of your peers. Not the upper class, not the bureaucrats, but our fellow average fellow citizens, who more often than not, get it right. When we ditch our civic duty like this, we are one step closer to an Orwellian system where Big Brother decides our fate. Please choose jury duty.","1320108789"

If you were living through the great depression, how long would you have survived murdering? If any society still exists a posse would mobilize and hunt you. You're a fool if you think killing someone's family or neighbors won't make them dedicate themselves to ending you.


And in my group, we have children. You're going to burn children alive to pick their bones? That sounds like a caption for the Internet Tough Guy or e-peen meme.

Synthetic hormones are used in dairy cattle.  There are also antibiotics that are found in the meat from the feeding cycle. Low dose continued antibiotics can also encourage growth. Perhaps in the states there are less stringent advertising claim requirements, but there has been legislation tabled to address these very concerns.  When you buy ""free from"" in Ontario - you are.

As to agriculture, I honestly don't know a whole lot about it, but here is something I do know. Mega companies are dominating the markets because of situations like this: Monsanto has a patent on 80% of the corn grown in the united states. Monsanto genetically engineered this corn, as well as the week killer Round-Up. Monsanto's corn is immune to round up, which makes the combination of Monsanto's seed and round up an easy way to grow crops. However, Monsanto also engineered it's corn to not produce seed. This means that farms have to buy new seeds every year  at as high of a price as Monsanto wants. Big businesses can much more easily overstep this obstacle than small farms.
Also: The efficiency of farming varies incredibly based on the level of technology used in the farming. Huge corporations can afford to use techniques many times more effective than less fortunate farmers. And regardless of the price supports, small farms still have to sell their products at much higher prices.","1320108824"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm curious what you expect to gain from talking to Jatt? He's only going to say that he thinks there was nothing wrong with his actions and that everybody hates him for what he thinks are false reasons. He's going to spread misinformation about what a double elimination tournament is, just like Marcou is doing right now, like it will magically fix the situation and everyone will like Dignitas again. But it won't work; while the majority of the community isn't 100% clear on the exact details, it's very obvious that what events transpired were wrong, detrimental of LoL as a legitimate esport, and was collectively caused by WCG's incompetence, Riot's incompetence, and Dignitas's underhanded way of grasping at any chance of victory they could get, sportsmanship be damned.

And you're probably going to placate him because you're a nice guy trying to network with all the pros. And it's going to be really painful to watch that. Because we watch your show because we like you, and we want to keep liking you. When there are two sides of an argument where one side is the honest side and the other side is the dishonest side, and you try to pick a place in between, it's hard to keep liking you. It's also [fallacious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation).

If I watch your next episode, it's not going to be for Jatt. There's nothing he can say that would contribute to what's already been said. I'm much more interested in the SK story, of which many details are lacking. Wickd seems to be a positive force in the LoL community with his community site, and Guardsman Bob is one of the more respected streamers out there. I would also be concerned that anything legitimate thing Wickd or Bob wanted to get out there would be overshadowed by the controversy over Dignitas.

Edit: You also can't moderate Reddit. You know there's going to be backlash here, and that's going to hit your self esteem yet again. We really do like you, but there is going to be a lot of criticism, just consider this fair warning.","1320108829"

The *mutation* of the gene that allows these bacteria to survive is completely random, I agree, however the environmental stress of the antibiotics directed the *evolution* of the cell culture towards resistance. 

The same thing happens in a larger scale with all types of creatures. We have random mutations in our genetic code which either put us at an advantage or disadvantage when compared with the rest of the population. If we are at an advantage, then we will be more likely to reproduce, therefore directing the evolution of the species as a whole to be more similar to us. Yes, it takes a long time.

The league is a experiment and we are likely to always be changing things up.

In that sense, isn't everything that is not logically contradictory possible?


&gt;I guess the wikipedia definition can suffice: the totality of everything that exists, including all matter and energy, the planets, stars, galaxies, and the contents of intergalactic space.

Then there might a be an issue of equivocation going on here. You and cosmologists both may mean, by universe, the totality of everything that exists. However, what you really mean may very well be different.

A cosmologist may mean universe, everything physical. If god is non physical, then even if the universe is infinite, he can't be in it. I imagine many theists would disagree with you over the claim that God exists within the universe to begin with.","1320108861"

Granted, it would likely take legal action, but it's my understanding that sections of a contract declared to be unconscionable don't carry legal force.

I think the usual argument is that the company had such a superior position, and the customer had so little chance for contract negotiation that parts of the contract could be rendered non-binding if the court decided that they conferred unfair advantage to the more powerful party.
