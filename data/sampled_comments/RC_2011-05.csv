Whole boxes of samples and work were thrown out, experiments had to redone, collaborators were extremely pissed off because no one had any idea what he did.

You sound like you have you're head screwed on right and coding for your purposes (similar reagent names etc.) makes sense.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Dude, I don't think you get it. The whole point of the Bing toolbar or the Google Toolbar, is to help the search engine rank pages by using its users as human ranking engines. It's based on what you CLICK on. Say you go to stackoverflow.com and search for ""multithreaded php"" and you CLICK ON result X. The toolbars report home to the motherships that ""Hey, when searching for 'multithreaded php,' X is a super relevant URL.""

Since the toolbar has this feature (when you search a site for something, noting which result you choose), it would be idiotic for them to go around blacklisting certain sites like google.com -- in effect saying ""the links people click when searching on google.com have no bearing on relevance."" Google is just like any other website with a search field. And also, when a user uses the Bing toolbar and searches Google, I believe that only the URL(s) the user clicks is used as data. The toolbar figures all other links on the page are probably not as relevant as the one the user chose.

Google purposely ""polluted"" the Bing toolbar's reporting data, you might say, by manufacturing fake results and CLICKING ON THEM with the Bing Toolbar. They could have achieved the exact same effect by making up a random website called ""xzxcvzxcvvvd.us"" that featured a search field and returned their bogus, unrelated results.

Conclusion: ""bing copied google"" is a line for fanbois who only read the sensationalist headline. ""bing gives weight to links that it knows people clicked on when searching on other sites. other sites include competitors"" is an accurate picture of what happened.","1304208014"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Webcomics count? I got some good ones for you.

Here's the bulk of my infamous list but in no particular order: 

[Adventures of  The Floating Elephant:](http://act-i-vate.com/23-1-1.comic) A very interesting story but very mysterious. 

[Freak Angels:](http://www.freakangels.com/)almost steampunkish story of psychically powered twenty-something year olds surviving in post-apocalyptic London.

[Sin Titlu:](http://www.sintitulocomic.com/2007/06/17/page-01/) Another mystery story, very surreal.

[octopus pie:](http://www.octopuspie.com/) Slice of life cartoony comic of people living in New York.

[The Meek:](http://www.meekcomic.com/) Fantasy comic with the second best art in webcomics. Characters, style, and story are phenomenal. Still somewhat new though.

[Lackadaisy:](http://www.lackadaisycats.com/) A group of cool cats running a speakeasy in 1920's St. Louis. imo, the best art in webcomics, and quite funny too.

[Rice Boy, Order of Tales, and Vattu:](http://www.rice-boy.com/) There are three webcomics on this site. All by the same person, two of them finished, all of them high fantasy stories that take place in the same fictional world. The first is a little more surreal, the second has a much nicer story, and the third is still getting started so who knows (though it has the best art yet).

[Gunnerkrigg Court:](http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/index2.php) A strange scifi fantasy about a strange girl going to a strange school. Ignore any similarities to Harry Potter you may think it has in the beginning, and this will become one of your favorites I think.

[Zebra Girl:](http://zebragirl.net/) Fantasy about a girl who accidentally gets turned into a demon. Story starts out a little wacky  but gets progressively better and darker, both in story and in the actual artwork. You might even think the artist planned that. Winner of awards for best black and white art in webcomics, and the reason I like crosshatching so much.

[Dead Winter:](http://deadwinter.cc/) Best zombie webcomic hands down. Every so often the artist takes advantage of the digital medium with simple animations in the right some (you'd be amazed how well it works) and some less successful full page animations. 

[The Abominable Charles Christopher:](http://horhaus.com/abominable/) The ongoing story of a silent bigfoot and his animal friends. It's really very good. Art is awesome too. 

[Scary Go Round and Bad Machinery:](http://www.scarygoround.com/) Two comics on this site. First is about English college students solving mysteries with actual ghosts and stuff. Second comic is about English middle schoolers solving mysteries with ghosts and stuff. 

[Questionable Content:](http://www.questionablecontent.net/) Slice of life ongoing comic. It's about robots, love, and indie rock. 

[Boxer Hockey:](http://boxerhockey.fireball20xl.com/) Best sport ever invented. 

[Girl Genius:](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php) The steampunk webcomic. It's pretty good  at times and has been around for a while. I've got a few complaints for the art but it's decent at the least.

[Bear Nuts:](http://www.bearnutscomic.com/) Care Bears on crack. Story of a group of dysfunctional zoo animals.

[Nedroid Picture comics:](http://nedroid.com/) These guys are the spongebob and patrick of webcomics.

[he Adventures of Dr. McNinja:](http://drmcninja.com/) He's a doctor and also a ninja. It's like when you played with action figures  as a kid. It's pretty awesome.

[Johnny Wander:](http://www.johnnywander.com/) An auto-bio comic by a couple and their roommates living in New York. There are also a few short stories thrown in that are very nice.

[Wasted Talent:](http://www.wastedtalent.ca/) Another auto-bio about a girl working as an engineer in Canada. If you want to read back skip all the black and white pages, the ones she made in college aren't so good.

[Subnormality:](http://www.viruscomix.com/subnormality.html) I really don't know how to describe this one. Go ahead and read it and tell me if you can think of a description.

[Dawn Of Time:](http://www.dawnoftimecomics.com/index.php) Story of a stone age girl, her dinosaur, and her time traveling Victorian era friend. 

[Gastrophobia:](http://www.gastrophobia.com/) A single Amazonian mother trying to raise a child in Ancient Greece.

[The thrilling Adventure of Lovelace and Babbage:](http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/) Nevermind what I said about Girl Genius, this is my favorite steampunk webcomic.

[Jump Leads:](http://www.jump-leads.com/comic/) British scifi comic about two guys stuck hopping between alternate universes. 

[Adventure of Superhero Girl:](http://superherogirladventures.blogspot.com/) Exactly how it sounds but at the same time different. Story of the daily life of a small time superhero, the actual crime fighting is all in the background.

[Cleopatra in Space:](http://www.cowshell.com/cleopatra/) Exactly how it sounds. 

[Rat Fist:](http://ratfist.com/title/) It's like The Tick. Not sure what else to say.

"self","t5_2qh96","Well... honestly - you are your own person and you have a few paths to chose from here on out:

1) You can try and change her mind (say you're sorry, or confess your love even more) - which will continue to feed her distain for you.

2) You can completely and utterly cut off ALL contact from this point on. You will still feel feelings and what not, but do not give her the benefit of bringing you down anymore. 

Take the second path. Choose to move on. Make her realize down the road that you haven't fawned over her like you were. See at this point she despises your attention - but once she realizes that you no longer even care about her enough to contact her at all, many thoughts will probably flood into her mind: ""Hmm, did he find a new girl?"" 

There will other thoughts along the lines of why you are no longer contacting her. She will think that you've moved on and that if you were so into her then you must be doing great things because you're not even thinking about her.

Women like men who don't seem needy. They like men who pretend that they don't matter. Women like to work to get a males attention against other women because in their minds ""if all of these chicks are into him, he's got something good going on and I want it, I want to make him mine.""

If you're bugging her, she sees you as weak and desperate and pathetic. Just show her that she no longer matters to you by not contacting her. If you ever do see her again in person do not appease her, do not fawn over her. Give her nothing more than a brief glance, short ""hey, later"". Make her think that she is invisible to you. You are a man, and despite how many women will say this is untrue: you have a role to play in this GAME. It's a game, the dating game, the mating game. ","1304208035"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Oh boy. This is going to be fun. 

First of all, most studies done that measure the sensitive of the penis only measure the sensitive of the glans. How can you measure penile sensitivity without measuring the whole penis? The only study of the kind ever produced that actually even looks at the foreskin is [this one.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x/full) 

It concludes that: 

&gt;**The glans of the uncircumcised men had significantly lower mean (sem) pressure thresholds than that of the circumcised men, at 0.161 (0.078) g (P = 0.040) when controlled for age, location of measurement, type of underwear worn, and ethnicity. There were significant differences in pressure thresholds by location on the penis (P &lt; 0.001). The most sensitive location on the circumcised penis was the circumcision scar on the ventral surface. Five locations on the uncircumcised penis that are routinely removed at circumcision had lower pressure thresholds than the ventral scar of the circumcised penis.**

Here are some helpful images to illustrate the results of the above study:

[Intact](http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/sorrells-int.jpg)

vs. 

[Circumcised](http://www.circumstitions.com/Images/sorrells-cut.jpg)

[This is the key to interpret the information](http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQRq0Z5xg4usAw1tsaMQ-vQyPGA0bOCbubaK5XpefLoilYydanZjQ)

As to the health risks of circumcision; the rate of complications is estimated to be anything from 5 to 10%, which is much higher than all of the conditions that can affect the intact penis. The severity of complications from circumcision can be anything from skin-adhesions to loss of the penis and even death.

And as far as forecasting... are you really trying to say that we are better at spreading the word of an incoming earthquake than letting people know about impending tornadoes? We have an entire system of alarms and sirens used to notify people of tornadic threats. There is nothing even close for earthquakes.  

A single large earthquake would make the damage caused by these tornadoes, or any others, look like child's play. That isn't to downplay the damage from these storms, which is obviously immense. It's more about recognizing that the threat posed by a large earthquake is staggeringly large.

* In a blender that can crush ice: Fill blender about halfway with ice Add 3/4 cup each of GOOD tequila and Triple Sec. Add juice of 3 limes Fill blender with FRESH strawberries.

This should yield four good sized drinks. Use this recipe as a baseline. Some like it with more tequila and less triple sec. If the strawberries aren't very sweet you might have to add sugar. I use powdered sugar or a simple syrup. Add these at the end after you've tasted it. If the strawberries are really sweet I up the lime juice. I like to use the lime zest from a few of the limes as well as this gives you all the lime flavour without the bitterness of the juice. I also add a couple pinches of salt to the ice. I find it helps break down the ice and it also helps to balance out the drink. You can rim the glasses with margarita salt or powdered sugar is nice too. Cheers!","1304208061"

**wrong approach.**

you need to choose your destinations wisely. rome and the rest of europe are an awful choice if you're traveling on a budget. why? the euro is slaughtering the dollar, this drives up the price to go to and be in europe (which is also why gas prices are rising, dollar is inflating = oil is priced in dollars = oil drives up cost of flights, anyway...).

want to travel outside of the country? birmingham alabama to cancun is $327. puerto rico is $428. jamaica is $453.

want to stay in the USA? birmingham alabama to miami florida is $237. denver colorado is $239. new york city is $255.

these tickets are on kayak. go to kayak.com/buzz or kayak.com/explore and see for yourself.

here's how you save up to travel if you're tight: create a new bill every month, it's called the travel fund. pay $100 a month into it, don't fuck off, take it seriously and treat it like a car payment or necessary service bill. at the end of the year, you'll have $1200. you can stay in hostels for $15/night around cancun, and eat at taco stands for $2-4 a meal. even if you lived 'well' for a budget traveler, you'd be spending about $35/day which is enough to stay a full month traveling around the east coast of mexico. yea, you might not have all the amenities of the first world, but who gives a shit, [this is your scenery so i think you can deal with a few salty showers](http://i.imgur.com/Qotkn.jpg).

if you still think traveling is expensive, you're just looking for an excuse to not go anywhere. 

ps: birmingham (bha) to rome (fco) is $879, but regardless of the price i wouldnt recommend going there.","1304208064"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","To be honest, it was too informal for my taste. The Church itself didn't reflect the informality in the RCIA program, but we only met for one hour on Tuesday nights. There was way too much to cover in that time and I feel like we breezed through some of the important things I wish we could have covered. We didn't even cover the Rosary.

I think they make it so informal in order to try to make everyone feel welcome. This works for some people, I think (my husband enjoyed it), but it made me feel awkward and out of place, sort of like they are trying too hard. My experience in the church has been more enjoyable since leaving the RCIA program, however, and I imagine it varies from parish to parish.

I encourage you to come prepared with your own questions because they do try to cover an entire lifetime of doctrine in one hour sessions per week from roughly September to Easter. There's a lot of material, so it's often difficult to get through it all. Use the community (your priests, deacons, or RCIA instructors or sponsor) as often as possible and make sure you ask, ask, ask!

Other than the informality and the amount of time spent in group, the only other real complaint I had with the program was that the priest had no interaction with the group at all. ","1304208073"

The majority of violence in the American revolution was reactionary based on the British sending in troops to keep the U.S. form leaving, the French was bloody and vicious from the start. We should never hope to emulate the French revolution, many innocent people (on both sides of the revolution) lost their lives.

I'm just saying that if we do end up having another revolution, let's keep it civil. We arm ourselves, march to the government buildings and escort those we are aiming to dispose to their house/jail where they are forced to stay until the new government is in place. We don't need to be senselessly chopping off heads. If we do that, especially if we do it like the French and have no proper trial, then we are no better than those we see stripping us of our rights.","1304208109"

I don't see how it can be ethical to deny any child access to any knowledge it requires to expand its capabilities based on the idea that some people were simply born into the wrong family. Capitalist ownership of intellectual property is in diametric opposition to the general good of societal development, in many ways. As I've demonstrated previously, dismantling of copyright, patent, and trademark doesn't have to mean dismantling of the economy as a whole. There are many business models which can still function effectively even without denying countless people access to knowledge because they can't afford it.","1304208112"

We talked about what I liked about the church, what I wanted in my life that (I thought) only the church could give me (like the closeness of reading scriptures and praying together) and compromised with what I need from him in those respects.  The most comforting thing at the time was that I knew that he 'did it the right way'.  Meaning I knew at the time, without a doubt, that he prayed, went through church resources (as well as non), and tried his hardest to 'just have faith'.

When this was happening, for me, he had broken my heart in the worse way imaginable to me at the time.  He took what I longed for my whole life; a fairytale temple marriage and made me question what I was taught my whole life as the only truth.  I took good advice and waited it out, and eventfully I realized/decided my love for him was more important to me than having a Mormon man.

This was four years ago and I am still recovering from Mormonism.  Me and my husband are still married and have an even stronger bond now than we ever have before.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Good question. It looks like you're asking for possible dream scenarios, so here's mine:

    Cons: 120
    Lib: 90-100
    NPD: 40-50
    Bloc: 47
    Green: 1



I like your idea of a fairly unified group of two parties that still don't have a majority on their own, but my reasons for the Liberals over the NDP are:

1) Space policy - I want Marc Garneau to manage Canada's science policy. Canada's first astronaut and former head of the CSA. Even flew the Challenger.

2) Ignatieff - Among other things, I like how he doesn't have a stump speech and just takes questions from whoever wants to ask them. 

I'm also an expat (11 years) and if Ignatieff does bad the Conservatives' ""just visiting"" schtick will certainly have had something to do with it. As a result, other Canadians with a great deal of overseas experience that would like to get into government may choose to shy away from it because no matter how hard you try (Ignatieff's been at it for six years so far) the question of whether you're loyal to Canada keeps on coming up. Canada needs to be a country where overseas experience is valued, not villified.

3) Calgary Centre North - the Liberal candidate is by far the superior candidate here.

I don't like May's leadership of the Green Party but if they fail to lose a seat they may just fade away entirely. Then again the NDP has just as good an environmental record so perhaps it's not that important. I certainly won't be that upset if she fails to win a seat.

Finally, on the NDP: I'm glad to see their support rising and I hope they pick up seats (which they will). On the other hand they do have a lot of dud candidates, people put in ridings that they never expected to win, and I don't want to see them in parliament. It's better for the party too, as they could end up embarrassing the NDP once they are put in the spotlight. Better to win about an extra ten seats with some really good candidates and go from there.","1304208132"

I have to say that the climate system has to have a non-linearity that pushes any positive feedback mechanism back to steady state, otherwise the system would have run away from an animal releasing some tiny amount of methane in the past... IE page 10 isn't a very good picture at all...

Clearly there is anthropogenic forcing of the system what is unclear is the dynamics of the complex system and if it matters.

positive effect of CO2 ""overwhelmed by the negative effects of heat stress and drought"", maybe but the idea that mean temperature rise = drought is based on complex models. Higher temperatures actually mean more rain not less, it is a question of where it rains, these models that predict drought suggest that the rain will mostly fall back in the oceans.

There are lots of problems with climate science, mostly because of social and political interest and intervention. ","1304208149"

Everything in that link is just stories about how many people died from cars in the early history of automobiles, which is something I would expect from a people that don't have much driving experience, and from a society that had not learned how to live with cars all over the roads. It's kind of a situation similar to modern transportation in China or India, where driving is not embedded in their culture, so they drive in a way that many Americans find insane. The author of that link then twists those into an idea that because there were a lot of deaths, a majority of people were against cars.

Unless this man is owning unusable land, as in unable to be farmed, he is most likely making an income off the product harvested and or rent for the property.  If he's sitting on land, for whatever reason, waiting for a developer, he inherited it, I don't really care, then I don't know what to say.  He's silly?

So it's possible to assume he is at least making $25,000 off the land he owns, that amount could even be exponentially higher depending on the quantity of land owned.

What I'm getting to is that after $174,000, he is still making money.  Just like Duffy and anybody else who says they are ""cash strapped"", realize the life you're living.  Mo Money Mo Problems, right?  That still doesn't resolve the issue at hand.  He is out of touch.  He made choices that he has to live up to.

On the flip side, there are people out there who have made choices they have to live up to, but don't have the means to even do so.  IE, having more children than you, personally, can provide for.  This isn't always the case, it does happen though.

Maybe they are to some people, but I think most science students have seen skeletons, etc, and even with atmospheric lighting, they are not much outside the spectrum of prime-time TV these days. Now, maybe an AmA on why you collect human remains...

I should submit more. I do a lot of work in biotech and pharmaceutical labs, and while most of it is pretty boring, some of that stuff does get pretty creepy... lab rooms full of malaria-infected mosquitoes, monkeys with bolts in their heads, surgically-modified animals of various sorts, etc. I'm usually not allowed to take pictures, and it's not stuff that would be an obvious fit to begin with, but there is a lot of stuff out there that is genuinely creepy. It's just not mostly in this forum. ","1304208190"

"politics","t5_2cneq","No offense, but if you believe that you're

&gt;not an economist by any means

why would your belief (I assume) tax cuts don't create jobs be true either?  Economics is an extremely complex issue, like global warming.  Isn't proclaiming one side to be true without any knowledge just like the Republican policy of saying global warming doesn't exist without any backing?

But as for your actual question, tax cuts don't create jobs because we have a fairly legitimate consensus among economists.  Some of the most respected economists like Shiller (I would argue he's the best alive) and Krugman have been calling for tax increases, so I listen to the experts.

I'm aslo by no means an expert economist (I doubt I'll get a PHD in economics), but it's generally held that tax increases reduce our incentive to work.  Basically, you can look at it like overtime.  If people eliminate double overtime, would you be willing to do it?  The opposing argument (that I support) is that the impact of tax increases isn't that large.  Yes, the rich will be less willing to work, but it has a negligible impact on what they do, especially in comparison to the benefits tax increases create.","1304208190"

"travel","t5_2qh41","As others have suggested, Africa is a fucking enormous place.  Is it safe?  There are many safe countries, there are some unsafe ones.  Even within unsafe countries there are safe places to travel, and there are unsafe places in the safe countries.

I spent ~4 months in Accra, Ghana and traveled quite a bit throughout the city and the country.  Did a couple excursions to Togo and Burkina Faso as well.  There were some tense situations, but on the whole I felt very safe while I was there.  I think in general if you keep your head about you, there will be no problems.  

Caveat: I am only speaking from my experiences in this small subset of countries, I think the advice should generalize to most countries, except maybe the major issue areas (Cote D'Ivoire, DRC, Somalia, Zimbabwe...), but take that with a grain of salt.
Wherever you go you'll find that there are good people, in most places the ratio of good people to bad people is fairly high.  When people see you, they usually can tell from a mile away that you are a foreigner (esp. if you are not black), they know you are not in your element.  Most people, knowing this, will look out for you.  So to avoid the human dangers (i.e. people trying to steal from you or take advantage of you in some way), just stay in populated areas.  

As far as other things: know what diseases are present in the region you are going to (malaria, yellow fever, typhoid, etc.) and get all the vaccinations and take your malaria pills.  Bring some drugs of your own; a good antibiotic for bacterial infection, some stomach meds, basic first aid stuff.  You will have stomach sickness while you're there, just avoid drinking water from the tap and eating fruits with skins and you'll be ok for the most part.  As far as other things; don't get caught without water ever, driving will be more dangerous there than here, but there's nothing you can really do about that.  

If you read up on where your going and keep your head on your shoulders you can travel ""Africa"" decently safely.  ","1304208191"

What a self promoting little shit. I've done 2 years of cancer research at NCI with some of the best and brightest. They know exactly what they are dealing with, and the last thing they need is some layman to tell them what they've unknown for decades.

Edit: After I finished reading his bullshit article (with great difficulty), I feel like I should explain why it's such bullshit. There are 2 key concepts of cancer that he does not understand.

One, cancer is difficulty to treat because it's constantly mutating. Cancer cells will eventually develop resistance to any drug you can throw at them.

Two, cancer is difficulty to treat because your body's immune system recognizes cancer cells as ""self"", meaning they will not attack the cancer cells as they would as other diseases like bacteria or viruses.","1304208220"

When shooting bands in a bar usually it is crowded and a photographer has to be fluid to compensate for the movement of the audience.  Also taking pictures from one vantage point makes for a limited number of pictures before exhausting all the options.  While extremely slow speeds are possible with a tripod, the subject is often in motion so that speeds under 1/15sec don't really help, making the tripod unnecessary. 
    
When working in these conditions, there is a lot of shadow areas that makes high-ISO noise much more noticeable.    
    
A flash can be used to greatly improve photos by making it possible to use lower ISOs (less noise), fill in the shadows (less contrast), use smaller apertures (greater depth of field) and freeze the action even when using a slow shutter speed.","1304208233"

That said, she does speak of the local police as being helpful and doing their jobs when she came to them, and luckily was able to prosecute her attacker in a state with no statute of limitations.  Her choice to continue pursuing justice in this case does urge victims to seek help--that's what she did as a college student (to no avail) and what she did 20 years later when she called the police and said ""press charges.""","1304208258"

There are some more elementary guides out there on the web. I like [this one](http://harrisonfjord.com/style-cheat-sheet-1/) a lot.

How much are you looking to spend, and what would you like to buy? Could you give an outline, per item?

Edit: re: poor man's guide. No, you've not missed a post. There's an ongoing back-and-forth in mfa between people looking for cheaper items and those insisting that quality is worth investing in. For example, it's often argued that an expensive pair of shoes will last 10x as long as a pair that cost a quarter of the price, and so cost is lower even though the price is higher.

There's a cost/time/quality tradeoff with clothes. If you need great clothes right now, it will cost. If you can wait for sales and don't mind thrifting, you can get great clothes in time at reasonable prices. If you've got to have them now and they have to be cheap, you'll usually be sacrificing quality.","1304208270"

B) Most of the media in Canada is owned by a few huge corporations, and they shill for the most pro-corporate party, which is the Conservatives. It's interesting to note that this list of endorsements for Harper reads like a Postmedia newspaper roster.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The Japanese government is saying it is okay for the kids to receive 20 mSv for the year while the recommendation they are referencing suggests that optimally the exposure remains at the lower end of 1-20 mSv. Let's say that should be &lt; 10 mSv. Then, in this case, the Japanese government should make the internal recommendation to its citizens that this is the outdoor + classroom limits to stay under 10 mSv. The government should not expect the citizens to extrapolate the math from 20mSv down to 10mSv. Even more so when they do not even mention that while 20mV is the upper limit, the recommendation is to limit exposure to be much less than that.

The government is exaggerating the safety of the situation to downplay the problem. Or rather, government recommendations are assumed to be cautious. Obviously not many people are going to stay 16 hours in a classroom and 8 hours outdoors. That's not the point. The government should recommend a maximum exposure lower than the limits - this let's others feel more confident in the government's recommendations and intentions.","1304208273"

No longer mind the meat because it was a byproduct of farming and eventually it seemed ridiculous to purchase protein for me when it was readily available outside my door. This coupled with personally knowing the animals made meat much more palatable Now I eat meat but only if I know where it came from, be it our farm or a neighbor etc. and feel comfortable with quality of life/slaughter. That being said Eating an animal that you raise, and kill is a really really weird experience, one which I think should be had by all chosing to eat meat.
As for relationships, yes attachments are formed with all of them although the level of attachment varies between individual cow. As for keeping them after they stop calving, that does not happen. When they can no longer produce milk we can no longer afford to keep them and they go off to slaughter, except for maybe if there is one particular cow which we are all fond of, then we keep it around because it has become more of a pet if that makes sense.

I don't dispute there are both shitty men and women out there, I just can't believe every one of these emotionally unavailable nice guys is the product of an evil woman.

For those of us who aren't sleezebags, the guitar does not help any more than just about anything else we try. Nice guys often are not trying to just fuck anyone who wants to fuck, nice guys are looking for someone to connect with, and possibly fuck. Then they wonder why their guitar didn't help.

Because you're only attracting sluts, and they don't want a relationship, they just want some dick. The guitar does not simply put women into your bed. This is a common misconception.

I personally haven't made a claim or had to contact them yet though; my dog is fairly young and we've only had her for just under a year.

What I like about Trupanion:

1. Premiums adjust due to inflation only, not due to claims I make or my dog aging. This means I'm less tempted to drop coverage when she's older.
2. Very few exclusions (just dental work and hip dysplasia after age 1 year)
3. No payout limit - I pay 10% and a deductible. I personally went with a deductible as I'm only using this for major illnesses/incidents and I have money saved to spend on my dog if she gets sick.","1304208366"

Here are his opinions:


""The Holy See . . . considers that it is necessary above all to combat this disease in a responsible way by increasing prevention, notably through education about respect of the sacred value of life and formation of the correct practice of sexuality, which presupposes chastity and fidelity.""


The Vatican has depicted contraception as part of an attack on the ""culture of life"" because it blocks the creation of children.""

""At my request, the church has mobilized in favor of the victims and especially in order to assure access to help and the necessary medical care through a number of treatment centers,"" he said.

"science","t5_mouw","I asked a ranking member of the IPCC this very question.

The IPCC scientists review literature, they do not do 'research' for the IPCC. After writing a long academic report of the current consensus, the long report is used to write a summary for politicians. 

The politicians do not touch the science, but they do have a different way with words. For example, when scientists use the words ""very likely"", it has a statistical correlation. The summary for politicians uses words differently to avoid alarmism. 

The scientific IPCC reports tends to be conservative because only well-researched phenomenon make it to the final report; for an international team of scientists, this is a good thing. The idea that the politicians sway or control the scientific process is based on a desire to discredit the IPCC (and their findings). The only role politicians play is translating the hard science into a summary for government officials - they have no influence in and are excluded from the process of writing the scientific report.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""Gender Differences in Receptivity to Sexual Offers""

The original study was conducted around 1989 and found that approximately 70% of men would agree to sex.

http://www.elainehatfield.com/79.pdf

In this original study women had a much much lower response rate, none agreed. However more recent research suggests that this may be a result of women finding a randomly approaching stranger creepy and believe that they wouldn't enjoy the encounter. Apparently when the approacher is a famous, attractive celebrity (Johnny Deep, Angelina Jolie) men and women have more similar acceptance rates.

Why? I'm 41, and the older I get, the *less* sense it makes to get a degree, because:

(1) I'll get fewer years of benefit from it.  
(2) I have fewer years to recoup the *cost* of it, in both tuition and lost wages.  
(3) I *need* it less. I have decades of professional experience. I don't have an education section on my resume, and I can't remember the last time anyone even *asked* me about it; they want to know what I've done, and what I can *do*, not how I learned it.

That's not to say school is a bad idea, but I don't understand why you would think it's more important *later* in your career. If anything, it seems to me far more important at the start of your career, to lay a foundation of knowledge you'll be using for the rest of your career, and to get your foot in the door before you have a proven track record.","1304208400"

The story really needs to be cut down -- there isn't enough of real importance to justify the length of the series.  There's way too much time spent developing characters that, in the long run, just don't matter to the outcome.  There's the demotivator that goes: ""It might just be that the entire purpose of your life is to serve as a warning to others"".  Martin gives out way too many warnings.

OTOH, fitting the first book into a 10 episode series means that they have to move the story along, probably cutting out whole chapters (or reducing them to fairly short scenes) in order to fit it all in.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've used the same scent of axe body spray as deodorant for close to a decade now. 

Funny story about that: I moved to Germany in Feb 2002. While there, I started using a scent of Axe body spray called Africa. It was great, I got compliments all the time on how good I smelled (This was back when body spray was kind of a new thing, and I only applied it lightly to my pits, so I didn't wreak of it). Then, in 2005 I moved back home to NYC, and couldn't find my beloved Africa scent any more. So finally, I called up the Axe customer support line, and told them my situation. The woman on the phone said she didn't know, but would consult with her ""fragrance manager"" and I'd get a call back. I just assumed this was their way of telling me to fuck off, and I kind of gave up. 

Then, ~3 days later I get a call:

&gt;Hi, DesCo. This is Joanne, the fragrance manager here at Axe. I had to do some digging, but it turns out that the Africa scent is rebranded in the US, and here it's called Kilo. It comes in a greenish bottle not the red bottle that the Africa came in. The formula i the same, even though the name isn't. Hope that helps. 

I couldn't fucking believe it. There really was a fragrance manager, and they really did call me back. Now I'm a customer for life. ","1304208408"

"wow","t5_2qio8","Feral druids are freedom.

Druids are the most *fluid* class out there. Paladins can technically be faster with crusader aura. but feral druids can move. I've been playing one for six years, and let me tell you: you will hate 100% move speed after this.

Let's review:
-At early talent levels, you get 130% move speed to your main form, cat. Collecting bodies, killing things, or just running through an indoor area? you move 30% faster. Think about that for huge-void-zone boss fights in dungeons and raids. You can stay in there seconds longer than others, dealing more damage. Dash lets you move at 150-180% move speed, and breaks any movement CC on you. Frost Nova? Nope. For 15 seconds out of every 2 minutes, you get to move nearly as fast as a ground mount.

-At level 14, you get aquatic form, giving you 150% swim speed. Minor glyphed, this is 200%. A water quest/zone/instance? You move faster than running people. With Water Legs in Vashj'ir, you move as fast or faster than a mount. You have an instant cast spell that you can skin and herb in throughout the zone. Aggro an enemy? Instant away, full mount speed. Like travel form, below, you can auto attack with it, so if you need to hit a critter or quest object, no problem.

-At level 16, you get travel form, which is 140% speed. You can auto attack with it, which makes it useful for moving and tapping things, like quest targets with one hit point.

-At level 60, you get fight form. Name any quest that you have to collect things on the ground for. You can hover above the ground, collect the item, without aggroing any melee mob. Ranged ones will still aggro, but if you do, you can just fly up, and they'll continue patrolling.

-At 70 and above, with epic/master flying, you are a rocket with a built in parachute. Say you want to get from A to B, where A is high and B is low. You can fly at an even altitude the whole way there, and just cancel flight form. You re-cast it when you near the ground. Gravity is faster than flying down. You spend part of your trip going at 400%+ higher move speed. What's more is cat form has innate fall damage reduction at a certain level. You can fly in, cat form in air and stealth, and land on the ground already stealthed behind a target, without taking damage. What's best is that you conserve forward momentum, like you're playing Portal. You can literally rocket forward until you hit the ground, right on top of the enemy mob or player.

Movement aside, Druids are the only class that can do all four roles: Ranged, Melee, Tank, Healer. You also get all of these spells, regardless of spec. You can root, heal, DoT, or become meaty with one cooldown.

Anything you can do, druids can do better. We are fluid, we are mobile, and we are the class that is a swiss army knife.

I, however, while I know I am not obese by any means, I am heavy around the middle, and my legs are thicker. What really did it for me was I didn't like that I had to buy bigger jeans and clothes, but also, I want to look good. I got bummed one day because I saw a girl who had an amazing body, but then I was also thinking ""Why be upset, when I can have that if I work for it?""

Not to sound like a ""trophy wife"" either, but I wanted to look good for my husband. He works really hard, and we dealt with a lot before we got married. I wanted to work hard for him now since he did so much for me before we got married. He has never made me feel anything but good about myself, but that was all the more reason that I wanted to look the best I can.

You fail to realize that you haven't seen a large number of links precisely BECAUSE they were downvoted.

Do some creative Google searching with Site:reddit.com which ignores vote counts and you will see what I mean.

The hard news links to radiation monitoring showing the government was misrepresenting the truth  etc  in the beginning when the warning were most important were almost ALL downvoted to zero very quickly by groups that matched up vote with downvote very precisely.

It is not at all the only subject where that has happened. Several friends of mine have pointed it out to me on their own account on their posts where they can see the upvote downvote count.

I guess my main point was spam is not as much of a problem as these group censors are now on reddit.

I wish more diligent people with good intentions like yourself would focus on that problem instead. Its a bigger problem.

I can skip a spam link that sneaks through. I can never know what important link I DIDN'T see because it was censored out of rank visibility by downvoting squads. (Which is of course exactly why they do it.)

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I have a feeling that there won't be a lot of unique answers to your question.  This question is asked a rather lot, but perhaps with a different topic.  i.e. bikes, tools, cookware, books, etc.

You'll get suggestions like Freecycle, craigslist, garage sales, etc.  These are great suggestions and should not be overlooked.

What I'd like to offer you is a different perspective.  I don't expect it to be popular, but I will suggest it anyways.

Don't buy any of it.  Not even the refrigerator.

I have slept on the floor for years.  The typical American bed uses a lot of unnecessary materials that seem to be more form than function.  There are a lot of great ideas, but the simplest is to camp out, if you will.  A sleeping bag (and a mat, if you want) is all you need.

Eat on the floor with your legs crossed or stand at the counter.  Buy rice, beans, peanut butter, pasta, honey, flour, sugar, vegetables, fruit, etc. and only cook what you need.  If you buy meat or dairy, then only get what you can cook and eat immediately.

This might sound ridiculous to you, but there are millions of people that have been living this way their entire lives.

You get to save your money.  It will be challenging and that is always rewarding.  Think of what you will learn!

Semiconductor design is another wonderful field where everything we do is an approximation, and rarely (if ever!) proven in class; we do whatever it takes to get a model that I can build a design around even if it means sacrificing rigor for results.

"Art","t5_2qh7a","Anyone can draw. You're lucky if you have talent, but essentially, it is a skill that can be learnt and developed.

I ""learnt"" to draw properly when I was about 13. Then I re-learnt when I was 15. Between the age of 13 and now (I'm 19), I drew shit loads. I'm not even going into fine art at uni, I'm doing costume, but I still need to be able to draw, so I do. 

when I first learnt, I was shit. I didn't get any better for a good few years. 
I was drawing things like this: http://xandu-san.deviantart.com/gallery/11856483#/dmu909

which eventually turned into this: http://xandu-san.deviantart.com/gallery/11856483?offset=24#/dxbkeh

and I've been constantly progressing since. 


There are also many different approaches you can take. I was originally taught to draw the darkest shapes I saw first, and then the slightly lighter and then the lighter etc. etc. (It helps to use photoshop to isolate these shapes at first if you're working from a photograph. Eventually your eyes get used to spotting the shapes without help)

You can, like myself and many other artsy people I know, use a lightbox (or tape your paper to a computer screen in the dark like me) and trace to give yourself a general guide as to where specific blocks of shading may go. I only tend to do this for commission work (i.e. for a portrait. the eyes need to be perfect, because they're very expressive).

As for producing your own original work, take bits and bobs from pictures. Use body shapes, hand positions, face expressions. You'll find a ton of stock images online and as long as you don't reproduce the entire picture exact, you should be find. Just use it as a general guide for proportions. 

Sometimes you find your ""style"" is not a photorealistic image. My style includes fluid looking figures without hands or faces (because I can't draw them from memory) but in positions that are symbolic of a situation. 

On a final note: The ""Masters"" did not produce work from their heads. They had inspiration. Religious paintings took stories from the bible and made them into pictures quite often using models. Also: The masters weren't always perfect or in proportion. I know you want to draw, but I'm just giving a little reassurance. So Da vinci was proportionally exact, but his images look almost too good. He used maths, but it detracted from his work (in my opinion).

TL:DR - ANYONE can draw. Watch someone do it, repeat. Draw what you see and ask yourself ""Does that look like what I see?"" If it does, great! If it doesn't, try again and again and again.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Not necessarily - it often only statys if it's managed properly. 

I plan to pass on and share the financial mechanisms I've built up through my working life with my children when they are old enough, bit by bit.  They'll learn, I hope, how to look at money the proper way (proper in my opinion...).   This is something that I didn't learn in school, or from my parents, though they certainly instilled some good habits in me.
I'm doing my best to ensure that they grow up wealthy.  I don't mean living some elaborate, expensive lifestyle - I mean that they won't have to worry about money, and they won't have to borrow any. They'll be able to focus in their lives on education and work (and following their dreams, whatever they turn out to be).  That doesn't mean they won't have to WORK, and won't have responsibilities..... we're not talking stinking huge trust fund here (don't I wish....).  We're talking about having a good buffer built up and the financial skills to keep using it and look at money from a fincancially strong position rather than a weak, debt-riddled one.  If they continue the same way (yeah, of course it's a big if - a father can dream, right?  I know they'll do whatever they want in the end...) it's not out of the question to think what I started can keep growing, and they'll pass it on to their kids, and so on - keeping future generations of my family out of debt and creating business, jobs, and happiness.

Now - the ""old money"" world certainly has it's share of spoiled brats - but it also has it's share of people who started out like this...and over generations continued to grow and manage and pass on financial knowledge and structures (and money - but that's just one piece of the puzzle) generation to generation. 

There are some people, yes, with so much money in some gigantic trust that it would take many generations of abuse or global turmoil to disrupt it - but there are far more family dynasties out there that simply know how to manage money properly.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;When did I say his assets were like cash?

Right here:

&gt;I said assets, like his, generally make money, and a vast majority of the time they do.

Assets do *not* ""make money"" the ""vast majority of the time."" Every type of asset is different. 

Granted, assets might *increase in value*, but that does not equate to ""making money"" (i.e. cash). You keep making this mistake without realizing it. 

Think of it this way: imagine somebody who owns a large farm as an asset. It's currently worth $1 million. It generates $200K/year in gross earning. Let's say $180K of that goes to overhead (staff, feed, seed, fertilizer, pesticides, etc). The owner than puts the remaining $20K/year, along with an additional $50K/year from other sources back into the farm as growth investment (more cattle, more seed) and insurance against bad seasons (more silos, extra stockpiles). 

This growth makes the farm worth $1.5 million next year. Suddenly, on paper, the asset is making the owner $500,000 richer - but in reality, the asset is actually sucking up $50K/year in CASH out of his pocket. 

And that is how you become asset rich and cash poor. It's not uncommon.","1304208620"

Companies will inevitably make mistakes, and it oftens does lead to public ill-will. But it doesn't bring those dead people back to life. It doesn't bring sections of the oceans back to life.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;What would it take to convince you that something is self aware? Why do you believe other humans are self aware?

That's just it, I have no proof that other humans are self aware. It's a matter of common sense rationality ala Thomas Reid that I simply believe other people have minds.

This doesn't hold for me when it comes to machines, not due to any external observations, but more to my agreement with Searle and Lovelace concerning what machines (more specifically, software) are capable of and what they are not (that is - they simply input and output data). Searle doesn't go so far as to posit any kind of supernatural mind, he simply points out that the ""mind"" seems, thus far, to be unique to biological machines (namely, humans). If someone could recreate a mind the exact same as a humans he doesn't deny that it would be human - but he argues that we can't do this without essentially synthesizing a *human.* A.I. for Searle, is simply software - and his point is that software can never have the sort of semantic awareness that human experience does.


All this is getting complex at this point. I don't even think that self-awareness necessitates anything supernatural. If we were simply flesh and bones I'd still say, like Searle, that ""mind"" thus far seems to be unique to human experience and unreproducible by mere software. What's dumb about this argument though is that it's essentially an argument on whether Strong A.I. can exist at all - not whether if it *did* exist it would possess a ""soul"" (whatever that is).

I forgot the mix competition was ending yesterday so I didn't have time to plan ahead and most of my song choices/transition points were decided on the fly.  As a result some of them came out a little sloppy, and the mix was recorded live in Traktor without editing afterwards.

Some of that distortion you were hearing was probably just me going a little overboard with effects.  I try to make my mixes unique (i.e. not just what you'd hear playing the tracks yourself), but there were at least a couple instances where the effects came in too strong.  

In the future for mixes like this (that won't be heard live) I'll probably use Ableton instead of Traktor, because that will make it easier to plan things out and refine all of the transitions, etc.  Sometimes even when you cue things up in your headphones they don't always play out as smoothly as you're hoping when you do it live.

He says absolutely 100% his sons will be circumcised at birth.

You do realize this is nothing more than anecdotal evidence right? Even if you are actually telling the truth here, this is nothing failure of parenting and possibly even a failure on the part of his doctors. It is very likely that he suffered from preputial stenosis, where the opening of the foreskin is too narrow to allow the glans; most of the time this is easily corrected without surgery.

But I've still retained that short, quick backswing with little shoulder turn and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to take this swing much further than occasionally breaking 90.

They get away with this because we haven't made enough of a fuss yet.  They would have a big problem if everyone knew the holes in the story and kept on hearing about lawsuits in the paper or where ever.  

It's not about just saying ""it will never happen"".  You know what that gets us right?  It get us more of the same.  We've already got that.

So what do we do?  We do more.  We raise hell.  We do it nicely.  All non-violent.  We just need everyone to figure it out, but the media can be used against them.  It can be turned on them, we just have to raise enough of a fuss.  The squeaky wheel truly gets the grease.   

It's not about individuals, because we're all in the same boat.  Together, we crush them.  Plain and simple.  That is why they have to manipulate.  That's why we're controlled to such a degree, if we are not.....they lose control.  That's not how they want it.  So these are the results.  

Make something happen.  Talk about it.  Just facts, without emotion.  It will make people think when you have grave concern for something and the ones hearing your concern have no way to argue a fact like WTC7 falling straight down at free fall speeds.

We have all the ammo we need.  It is all there.  No one can deny it!  It should be an easy fight, but the system is corrupt right?  The system will buckle under everyone pushing on it.  It only runs this way because the majority are made to ignore everything except dancing with the stars or the royal wedding and the like.

It can be anything we want.  You just have to talk about it.  I do, there is no shame in pushing the truth and talking about it.  As if anyone can deny it.  ","1304208691"

The ones he lists as the pillars of his faith are:

* Logical Arguments
* Creation
* Bible
* Other Christians
* Personal Relationship
* Prayer
* Morality

I know many Christians who believe in evolution and are Christians because they think prayer works and God guides them in a personal way.  I know Christians who believe that God is not answering prayers or leading people directly today now that the canon of the Bible is closed, and are Christians because they doubt evolution and believe we have no basis for morality without the Bible.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;There is no office of Men's Health because virtually all test subjects for medical research for the past century have been men.

Men die much earlier than women, commit suicide more often, are 90% of workplace deaths.  There is no argument to be made that an office of men's health should not exist.  Men tend to die much younger than women from heart attacks, yet there is no Go Red for Men day.  Men are much less likely to seek treatment for ailments - so if we are willing to educate women on heart health, why aren't we willing to educate men on health?

&gt;Female circumcision involves a clitoridectomy which in many cases then prevents that female from ever having an orgasm.

False.  Female genital mutilation *may* involve a clitoridectomy, but that's not the extent of female genital mutilation.  And even that does not always mean the female will never have an orgasm.  Many female circumcisions are ""merely"" the removal of the clitoral hood or portions of the label, just as male genital mutilation is ""merely"" the removal of half of the sensitive genital tissue of the penis (foreskin).  The foreskin and clitoral hood are anatomically similar.

&gt;Men are the vast majority of war deaths because historically speaking, it is men who wage war.

It appears you are equating ""waging war"" with ""participating in war"".  But let's assume you meant what you said, that men wage war.

False.  Women comprise 51% of the American population and many of them vote for war.  It is not men who wage war, it is the people in power, who happen to usually be men, and often backed by the public (both male and female).  I'm sure you understand that there's a difference in saying ""Those in power are all men"" and ""All men are in power.""

Nevertheless, who got us involved in Libya?

It was three women in power - Hillary Clinton, Susan Rice, and Samantha Power.  http://womensvoicesforchange.org/clinton-power-rice-three-women-swing-u-s-policy-on-libya.htm

&gt;it is men who wage war

It has always been men who led the battle - because women didn't want to, and could not.  Furthermore, there are millions of male war dead who never wanted to *participate* in war but were forced to by the men in power.

Now, if you mean that it's men who are the grunt soldiers in war, that's generally true.  That's why I said men are drafted, but women are not.  Please don't equate men's involuntary servitude in war with some sort of ""privilege"".  It is women, who are not drafted into wars, who are privileged.

And even when it was men who voted for wars, and men in power who signed off on wars, there were always their wives in the background, urging them to it.  Kind of like the Libyan Three did with Obama.  Kind of like Lady MacBeth.

Don't you know anything?  Are you truly so blinded by your misandry?

Your whole argument is 1) men should be able to get along by themselves, but women need help, 2) males are disposable, 3) males are inherently evil and women are inherently good.

You might ask yourself why you're spending so much time trying to refute what I'm saying instead of just listening for once and doing your own investigation.  Is it really so hard to believe that you've been lied to?  Is it so hard to seek the truth even if you don't like it?  Must you really excuse every disparity against men as if they deserve it simply for being male?  Because that's what you are doing.  And that, my friend, is hate.

You stated that men are drafted because men make war.  I showed you that it is not just men who make war.  Can you admit that you don't have a leg to stand on, or will you just move the goal posts or run away?  Because that's what most people do when they don't like facing their delusions.

A truth seeker doesn't say ""but, but..."" when he is shown to be wrong.  He says, ""okay, allow me to think about thing and investigate further, perhaps my assumptions were wrong"".

How do you think I learned all this?  I am a truth seeker.  You think I like that this is how it is?  No, but I will not choose to remain ignorant.

Will you?

You argue against the need for men's health... I argue that we all need to pay better attention to our health, even men.

You argue that female genital mutilation is nothing like male genital mutilation - I argue that yes, they are similar, no, they are not always to the same degree, but who cares if they are?  If a woman had her hand chopped off, would that not be terrible?  If a man had just his thumb chopped off, would that not also be terrible?  Why do you make this into a competition?

You argue that only men deserve to die in war because only men make war.  This is false.  Men and women make war, but only men are forced to die in war.

"starcraft2_class","t5_2rz1w","Back around the release date over a year ago, Day[9] said it took a 20-game win streak BARE minimum to rank up again (but that was assuming an A-level ICCUP player in silver, someone who should really end up in master/grandmaster level in SC2 and was already on an unbeatable streak until he got proper placement) 

In practice from someone who definitely ISN'T that good, it takes a little while.  I was beating golds regularly and took about 2 months to rank up from silver to gold (2 months only once I was beating golds regularly), but I really wasn't playing very often at all.  For me, it was  maybe 80 games or so. (a busy few months with little playing time!)

In my anecdotal evidence, I think long stretches of inactivity will keep you from ranking up more than getting the occasional loss against weaker opponents will. Either way, don't worry; you'll get there! GLHF!","1304208727"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's me again, same guy.. one day later here, I'm glad your post is still up. Spent a lot of time thinking about what I said. I'm sure you won't care but I do, I apologize. That WAS  a ""doucher"" thing to say. And it wasn't true. I like to hear the truth and I wanted to give you a real opinion. It wasn't the truth. 

I've been sittin here trying to imagine this. The only person I ever met with AIDS was a gay junkie. I didn't want to be around him but i did. Of course there is fear, like girlzilla said. I am the worst case scenario of this fear but it seems I grossly exaggerated it. I... don't know what to say I was in a bad mood. I don't want you to think that people are going to feel this way... even the troglodytes. Stupid Stupid. 

I know you don't want to engage in a dialog with me, and I'm deleting this account too because I'm new to the internet and I don't know if some avenger will hack me! Because that was a very stupid thing to say. More importantly it wasn't true. My experience with the internet so far has been... frustrating. But this is one thing i couldn't let go. I read the comments and I'm surprised that nobody mentioned how ridiculously untrue my comment was, I mean, nobodies going to want to just run away like i described. At the most, i would just be mindful of the fact.

I hope this helps you and please forgive me, it's very easy for people to say things they don't mean, especially online. I realize this is too little too late. --- I would never actually ostracize somebody like I said I would. I don't want you to feel like anybody feels this way either. At the most, like i said, they would keep it in mind. I'm glad theres a lot of bigger people here to let you know that, but my point is, if anybodies going to feel like i described, it's gonna be me, and I'm here to tell you now, that was ridiculous. I'm embarrassed for myself... I gotta go, if you've read this far, thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Really? Most Iranians view him (and the government) very negatively. Most of his support comes from the poorer, rural areas, and the people who have gotten rich through the government. 

You obviously have a very biased view on the government. You wanna know why they are so unpopular? Well let's start with the obvious example. How about the '09 election? How do you think people felt when they turned on their TVs in the morning after the election to see that, despite all their campaigning, despite all their efforts to get their friends and family to vote, that Ahmadinejad beat Moussavi in a massive landslide. I still remember the silence and shock in the living room that morning when my family was gathered around the TV as the results of the TV were  being announced. I also remember that the government, who was very confident in the integrity of the results of that election, quickly cutting off text messaging, the internet, and, during evenings, cell phone calls. I also remember seeing the security force of this great government you speak of patrolling the streets, bullying the 5 year old son of our family friend, destroying people's property, and later even killing the people who wanted to express their frustrations with the fraudlent election.

You claim those protests were CIA backed? Fine, lets throw them out. How about the fact that Iran is ranked #2 in the world for the number of executions/year? How about my cousins, all of which have a college degree, but none of which have jobs? How about the others like them, as well as the engineers who drive taxis and the scientists who run shops. For having such a ""great"" government, it seems a bit strange that everytime I go there and someone hears that I live in the US, they tell me how lucky I am and how they would give up anything to be in my shoes. What about that, despite living in a country ranked among the highest for oil and natural gas, people face natural gas shortages during the winter and rationed gas? 

The people aren't blind. They all see that the government is much more concerned with ""standing up"" to Isreal and the US than helping out its own people. They see that instead of dealing with the problems mentioned above, the governement uses its money on funding Hezbollah and helping neighboring countries to buy allies. They see all of this, and frankly, from what I've seen during my time spent there, they're sick of it.

TL;DR Ahmadinejad &amp; the rest of the regime are a joke. The US and Isreal don't need to demonize them, they demonize themselves enough as it is. ","1304208761"

2. If something is not working out for you: stop doing it.

3. Your dad and yourself can team up in a corp and work together to achieve your goals.

4. EVE is not instant-gratification. You need to get a feel for the place and what to do and what not to. You're learning what not to do in a real hell of a hurry.

5. When you get your ass kicked, that's not fun. You find a group of friends, because you're going to need a group of friends. And then you start doing the real work. I have mined in -large- mining fleets deep in 0.0 and we had a whale of a time on voice com. You can do the same for PvP roams, for missions, you name it. For the new arrival it's often a scary place and you have already found it's unforgiving. But when you find the place, when you 'get' what it's all about, there is nothing like it.

Don't give up, it's a great place. Never forget: you know the guy's name. There is _nothing_ that prevents you from keeping him in your contact list and go find him when you start to understand what you're doing. In EVE you can pay back the favor.

I figured it was about time to get off of these forever since my Doctor kept asking me if I wanted to up my dosage for as long as I remember, but I knew if I did, I would be in way too deep. When I asked him to lower my dosage he said that there weren't any lower dosages for Luvox, and I had this suspicion he was lying, but you kinda confirmed it for me. 

I also wish I didn't have to do anything stressful, but I have major anxiety, so everyday normal things make me overly anxious. 

Lastly, how long would you say it takes to ""completely"" flush it all out of your body? Like I said before, I've only been on it for about a year and a half at 100mg, but I've read it can take upwards of 4 months to half a year.","1304208770"

My mindset drastically changed in college. I went from a liberal Democratic, mindlessly voting with the party line, to supporting Libertarianism as taught by Ron Paul and the founding fathers.

I realized that the government isn't here to help me. World history is filled with governments suppressing people.

I'm lucky as I live in the U.S. which is mostly free. But I see my civil liberties disappearing. I see people not even aware of what they are loosing. Not even aware of the lies the media feeds them.

Amazingly so many of my college peers believe so much bullshit. Sheep indoctrinated into a system of thinking without critically analyzing their world. WTF is college for then.","1304208796"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","While growing up in Virginia in the 1940s the common term for people of color was 'niggers,' but my father, a professor of English forbade the use of that term. He explained to me that the proper term was Negro and that was the only term I was allowed to use in reference to darker-skinned people.He explained that it was the proper term to use for people of the Negro race and that there was no Nigger race. He also explained that Caucasian was the proper term for people of the white race and that Oriental was proper for people of Japanese or Chinese heritage. 

I would prefer to continue to use Negro, but the black people themselves have confused the issue: calling themselves Black and African American at various times. I think African American is not only clumsy, but also incorrect since few if any of the black people in America today immigrated from Africa. ","1304208799"

Seriously, [read it yourself](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen7/11/1/contents).  While my middle English isn't the best, it would appear to provide that a person is not to be charged or attained (convicted by decree) of treason while they are away accompanying the King at war.

Given the above, it's fairly hard for me to give more reasons why this wouldn't work, since there's simply nothing to talk about.  I would, however, point out that the Treason Act of 1495 (more properly, The Act 11 Hen. 7 1495) is a British law and most likely no longer in force in most Commonwealth nations.  Similarly, given that this scheme supposedly relies upon one's allegiance to the crown, I'd also point out that a number of commonwealth nations are republics where that would be especially nonsensical.","1304208801"

Anyways, I know the difference between cash and net worth. It's entirely possible to have a large net worth (like the 31,000,000 mentioned in the title) and still be cash poor.
Net worth is the total estimated value of a person including their bank accounts, property values, and investments. Generally investments are easy to convert quickly to cash so if the majority of net worth is contained within investments or property or the stock market then you can technically be cash poor. But to claim because you are cash poor you can equate to those who are truly below the poverty line is completely fucking ridiculous. I know that in a recession (and even not in a recession) it can a little while to sell off an investment to turn net worth into cash wealth, but he obviously isn't going to starve to death waiting for an investment to sell. And if he is seriously struggling on his current budget, he needs to take some personal finance classes, re-prioritize his spending, and probably cash in some of his investments to make it through this rough patch until he can survive on his current income.","1304208844"

For what it's worth, I'm dating a black girl and I don't think saying ""black"" has ever been an issue. I think it all depends on tone of voice. It is one thing to say ""that black guy over there."" Is is quite another to talk about ""the blacks."" I think the latter has a bad sound to it. I think ""black folk"" has a nice ring to it if you need to refer to the group.

The goblin mines can be used to nuke like NigmaNoname is saying, but they can also be used in a techies fashion at the same time.  Since you can place so many you can use them to nuke, as well as place them to ""ward"" and prepare traps.  The ultimate can be very effective when placed properly as a silence and damage (inside and when moving in and out).  You can place the ultimate, watch someone try to run out, and stun them back in.  You can also place the ultimate, watch someone get slowed out, slow them with your turret, and maybe even stun them.  At low rated games, a hand full of players desperately try to avoid going inside the ultimate.  Of course, this isn't always the case.

Wait what?  This is extremely counter-intuitive.  By not supporting tuition through taxation you make it harder for people to go to college, and saddle them with enormous debt that they spend much of their lives paying off.

In the long run it certainly is sustainable and is likely necessary.  Economies continue to grow and countries grow increasing wealthier as technology advancements increase our productivity.  Ensuring there are enough highly skilled workers to shift an economy into an advanced state, thus allowing it to properly compete with cheap labor in developing countries, is paramount to a modern economy's success.

I don't think humans have a concept of ""what to call you"" if you'd go through with this. This is about as grey (as opposed to black &amp; white) as you can get. So... the best answer I can think of is to stop thinking about it.

I mean, I totally understand where you are coming from with your fears. This is completely uncharted territory, so you really have nobody to turn to for support or answering questions.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","No, I stand my ground on that subject.

It is the only country that is regressing. From an abject stance against torture, they've now decided it's ""OK"". From an abject stand for a humanitarian war effort, and you've correctly identified the reasoning, they've chosen vengeance. From an abject stand of freedom of the press, we move to politicians calling for the death of a publisher. From arguing on moral qualities, now it's pandering to base elements. 

If your intent was to state that my country is also regressing, then now that I've finished pointing to the degradation of your political processes, I will gladly state that no such thing has or will occur in my country. Nor France. Nor the UK. Nor even Germany. 

Your arguments are centred on a false assumption that directing economic growth via tax incentives equates to corruption, while I am correctly pointing out that these industries are *not*, and I will repeat myself, *are not* able to provide any government office, party, or person, with monetary or object incentives. Yes, they can turn to the government and request more -- but there must be a business reason for it; Competition from another province, or country, leading to lost jobs for the province or the industry as a whole. Whereas, in the US, a company can petition to the government, proffer funds to the parties and individuals, and have their bills pass so as to improve profit taking. Not doing this would not lead to lost jobs, as much as the talking heads may say it would, but leads to a loss of tax dollars and greater profit taking of the owners. 

To end any accusations of corruption, all that needs to occur is for these laws permitting public funding to be cut short. Limit the amount given by every individual. I understand corporate person hood is an important ideal in the US, so include them in the limits. Election seasons may well become a bit more boring, but by removing lobbying groups and massive single donations, corruption accusations are far harder to substantiate. 

The moment the patriot act passed, so did the days of American moral leadership. We can almost forgive the wars, because they have done some good, although entered into under false information. But the torture? The revoking of basic human rights of captured and capitulated enemy combatants? These will always and forever be marks of shame.","1304208954"

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","Joey, get the fuck out of this subreddit and back to r/politics, we all know about Ron Paul's views. He is running as a republican and there are certain positions you have to take to have any chance. Ron Paul, along with many of his followers, has realized that these issues are not really that important compared to the other issues we face today. In fact, he doesn't want to ban abortions and gay marriages, but leave them up to the communities. 

I personally believe abortions and gay marriages should be legal (I don't like the Civil Rights Act though), but I would rather have a president who doesn't like these things than a president who does but wastes all of our tax money in order to kill and torture people around the world in service of the oil and MIC lobbies, while bailing out banks and letting the dollar become a worthless piece of paper

This is why I support Ron Paul, but if you think abortion and gay marriage are the most important issues in this country, go ahead and vote to re-elect Obama.

In this throwaway account's opinion, a coffee/meal date is vastly superior for determining whether you're compatible with someone than anything you can do over the site.  Why some people are so resistant to them is beyond me, especially for girls since there's a non-trivial chance your partner will cover the check.

So my advice is if you think you might like him, message him and get a date setup; maybe give me a google voice number if you are that worried that he'll end up really creepy.  If you don't think you'll like him, hide or otherwise ignore him and don't worry about it further.","1304208980"

The optimum efficiency (number of representable symbols vs. number of digits) is achieved using a base-e system. thus, base-2 and base-3 systems are the closest using an integer base.

Have yet to try Double Thumper but it got a good write up in last month's DRAFT mag. 

Goose Island - arguably one of the top 5 breweries in the USA behind Stone, Russian River and Dogfish. Pepe Negro is a dark version of their belgian style series (can we move on please?), and a little light but still drinkable. The Big John Imperial stout was only available for 1/pp purchase, obviously they're in demand and well regarded. I haven't tried yet but after sampling both Night Stalker and Rare Bourbon County Stout, hard to imagine anything could surpass - willing however to give it a shot.

RIPA on Rye - people don't give enough love to the big flavors produced by he'brew (aka Scmaltz), but this one, in my opinion, top of their inventory. If you've ever heard someone describe a beer as tasting more like a smooth liquor, they were inadvertantly describing this beer without knowing it. I was blown away, and I drink a fuck load of beer. Only thing comparable by them is the ""Vertical"" that combines the last 5 or 6 years of anniversary brew that He'Brew released. Grab that one too if you have the chance. 

Lastly, the Left Hand - have yet to try but am anticipating highly. Sawtooth was solid, as well as the Widdershins (barleywine, I believe) which was a bit more oak-y than anticipated but still rounded out a nice Sunday Funday.

Never said they were. I said ""Many of the men have stories about crazy exes who wouldn't let them watch [porn]."" The men tell stories about their crazy exes, and one of their complaints is sometimes ""she wouldn't let me watch porn."" Doesn't mean that I think an aversion to porn implies craziness. 

However, I do think your views on *masturbation* are overly possessive. You don't own your boyfriend's dick; you can't put a lock and key on it and make sure he never gets off when you're not around. Relationships don't work that way. Of *course* your SO isn't going to be satisfied by you alone. He needs other things in his life to make him sexually fulfilled. That's not a threat to you, and viewing it as a threat makes you seem jealous and crazy. People masturbate to release tension, to help them sleep, to be alone with themselves, to learn new ways to please themselves... It's a necessary activity that can help you know yourself sexually.

It isn't a prejudice so much as I just can't be around super strong vile smells.  I did have a client that I worked with (in private practice) who smelled so bad that I kept my fist near my nose and I told him that his hygiene was symptom of his illness and he had to shower and have clean clothes on when he came to our next session.  He did and all was well.  I'm not sure I did the ""right"" thing with him - but I couldn't tolerate being in a room with him.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I stopped reading at the abstract, but then i skimmed through it and came across this gem:
&gt;There are real and imaginary situations when it might be beneficial to have a gun in the home. For example, in the 
Australian film Mad Max, where survivors of the apocalypse seem to have 
been predominantly psychopathic male 
bikers, having a loaded gun would seem 
to be very helpful for survival, and public health experts would probably advise 
people in that world to obtain guns.
However, for most contemporary 
Americans, the scientific studies suggest 
that the health risk of a gun in the home is 
greater than the benefit

^ that was the only example he gave about a situation which could have been helped with a firearm. This study oozes bias. Not to mention there is no fair indicator of a value of a firearm using the data provided.

Serial Rapist breaks into your house, you shoot him, points are tallied against owning a firearm because it caused a DEATH IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD. Studies like this are more of an exercise in having a conclusion THEN trying to find data to support your conclusion, rather than actually following a scientific method and being impartial.","1304209137"

[The Twistolution envisions a post-patriarchal order free of male privilege, rape, misogyny, femininity, theocracy, corporatocracy, gender, race, deity worship, marriage, discrimination, prostitution, exploitation, godbags, the nuclear family, reproduction, caste, violence, the oppression of children, the oppression of animals, poverty, pornography, and government interference with: private uteruses, non-abusive domestic arrangements, drug habits, lives, and deaths.](http://blog.iblamethepatriarchy.com/about-the-blog/)

Why aren't we truly happy? Obviously we must be stupid and let these enlightened, much smarter women choose for us.

Be careful of the analogy to evolutionary processes. Natural Selection is a brutal and unfeeling manner of traversing towards local maxima based on the forces acting on the population. That can quite easily lead to great suffering.

So, that being the case... why do such organisations exist? Alt ""medicine"" is especially rife with them, and most exist only as rubber stamps, the rest do honestly try to control the quality of their bullshit, but lack the means and methods to do so.

These rubber stamp organisations exist because there are so damn many that no one knows who the hell they are and very few are willing to put any time into checking. The only significant market forces on them are how well they can market themselves to companies and how ""authoritative"" they can make themselves look. It's an elaborate pantomime, one that you claim should not exist.

&gt; Competition is the function that keeps businesses honest. They would quickly disappear and if at all surface. We would devolve into the problem of the ""who watches the watchmen"" infinite regression if we followed your line of reasoning. Your view on the uncertainty of knowing illegitimate from legitimate businesses could be solved by not exchanging goods and services with anyone. Point being that you have to eventually trust someone. That someone is not the government.

On the contrary, that someone is the government. I am the government, afterall. It is transparent, objective and controlled by me (more or less, indirectly)
Competition only deals with profitability, not quality and not trustworthiness. People often buy things they know are shoddy and from untrustworthy people simply because they're cheap.
Back on topic, competition would favour rubber stamp organisations. Very little overhead, only what it takes to contact potential buyers and put on the facade of respectability, and no real skill or knowledge needed. Running the sort of group you propose would be expensive, difficult and always open to charges of ""being in bed with industry"", or being a part of the conspiracy because they would have to consistently rule that real medicine works and alt ""medicine"" almost never does anything but make people poorer. ""Big pharma"" in this case.

&gt; Bread Safety Problem: “Quality” is a highly elastic and relative term and is decided by the consumers in their free actions in the marketplace. The consumers decide according to their own tastes and interests, and particularly according to the price they wish to pay for the service. If a man is sold adulterated food, then clearly the seller has committed fraud, violating his contract to sell the food. Thus, if A sells B breakfast food, and it turns out to be straw, A has committed an illegal act of fraud by telling B he is selling him food, while actually selling straw. This is punishable in the courts of a free society.

No it is not. Sausages are more rusk than meat in the cheaper ends of the market, but people pay it anyway because it's affordable. It's only provably fraud in the most outrageous of cases. Keep in mind that we're taking about people that use such terms as ""promote wellness"" and other meaningless and unmeasureable claims. How do you prove that the sap of some random tree doesn't promote wellness?

&gt; Hard objective and empirical proof solves these matters for most. For the lingering irrational crazies, what are you suggesting be done with them? And if they are not harming you than why should you care?

And where the job of marketing departments it to make finding ""hard objective and empirical proof"" as difficult as possible by dis/misinformation? Again, it would be fine if people were omniscient but they're not and they cannot and will not be able to distinguish these things apart except through the use of government agencies detailed to regulate industry.","1304209177"

You can then get compact *or* full size slides for $245 in 9mm, .38 super, .40 S&amp;W, .45ACP, and 10mm.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My friends and I were riding in the shoulder of a two-lane road at night in sparsely populated rural area of North Carolina. I was on a bicycle towing two friends (a guy and girl) on a skateboard. Behind us was another friend on a bicycle. 

We see lights are a car approaches from behind and I move as far into the shoulder as I can go. All of a sudden, the SUV is brushing against me and I feel warm metal on my thigh. I get slammed to the ground in what feels like slow motion. 

Stunned, I look up, in the shock I don't feel my injuries. Up ahead, the SUV is stopped and I hear the driver get out and emit a wailing squeal. I get up and see my friend who was on the other bike limping from the gravel driveway on which he landed to a patch of grass. Up ahead, I see a body in the street. As I approach, more headlights come from behind and I can see that she dead still, facedown with a rapidly growing pool of blood around her head. I had just met her that day for the first time, and there wasn't a question in my mind that she was dead. 

I called my friends who were at a party down the street. Waiting for them to arrive, I look for my other friend. I find him in the ditch alongside the road. His body was lifeless and covered in blood with his arm covering his face. He had been my best friend for the past two years. As I called his name, my other friends were arriving. One was a paramedic and told me not to touch him. 

The scene filled in as cops, more friends and an ambulance arrived. I was dazed. Someone was doing CPR on my best friend. His body was limp and blood trailed form his mouth. But for some reason, I knew the girl was dead but thought they could revive my best friend using the paddles like they do in the movies. I suppose it was just my denial of the situation, a protection mechanism to keep from feeling too much pain at once. 

As my other friend and I were carried away in the ambulance and the pain of my own physical injuries was beginning to set in, it still had not hit me that my best friend was dead. I didn't fully know until the next morning as we were riding back home.

Some of the windows look a little mean and considering you'll be adding frame depth for openable windows maybe you should think about making them larger. I really like the split between interior and exterior. Have you looked at falling water at all? It's reminiscent of it. Think about some full height glazing in the public spaces beside the terraces to really open the spaces up. As it's in Norway I assume triple glazed panels are pretty easy to source at that scale too so I don't know if it will have any negative repercussions. 

Also, think about simulating the depth of the walls more accurately to get an impression on how it will affect the spaces.

Of course it's impossible to make an exact same copy of someone, nurtured the exact same way, to create the exact same person whom you once loved. But what about creating someone similar enough that *you* couldn't tell the difference?  
  
For simplicity let's assume we're talking about a dead wife. This wife was very outgoing. Much of her outgoing tendencies were picked up during the summers she spent at Camp Krusty. You've heard a few stories about this camp but you weren't there. For your perception of your wife  the only important thing about this camp is that your wife learned to be outgoing. Whether she learned to be outgoing at Camp Krusty or Jesus Camp isn't all that important, only the end result of being outgoing is important for how you view your wife. So if a clone of your wife learned to be equally outgoing at Jesus Camp would you really notice a difference in how outgoing she is?  
  
Point being that it's your perception of your beloved that matters, not your actual beloved. We don't need an exact copy, just one that's close enough that *you* don't notice the difference.  
  
Admittedly the probability of getting one quality perfect would be low, let alone getting every quality perfect. But the probability of creating such a clone would go up as we increase the number of clones being made. A one in one million shot isn't so difficult with one million tries. Thus this is much more probable than finding your beloved in another reality. The ""other reality hypothesis"" isn't based on anything. Just because we don't know what objective reality is like doesn't mean we can use this to justify outlandish claims. By your logic death could be the solution to any problem (not that that's a flaw for your argument). ","1304209209"

What I know (and I have more of a medical background), is that they have noticed differences (brain sizes are smaller), and decreased metabolism in the left frontal cortex.  Beyond that, it is purely clinical.  I think that until they come up with better ways to interpret imaging, or better imaging modalities, it will remain at the cocktail party banter level. 

ADHD is a well defined psychological disorder (see DSMIV or a draft of DSMV).  The vast majority of children respond extremely well to amphetamines, and are able to have normal school and home experiences (the results of not treating them is much worse).  Potentially overtreating is a much smaller priority than undertreating.  So even if you could determine if someone had ADHD type 2 or whatever, you would only care if it altered the treatment for the disorder. 

Alot of medical diagnoses are clinical. Look at schizophrenia. It is such a variable disease. Many different types of schizophrenia, all clinical diagnoses. Many different treatments. Some respond to a certain treatment, others don't.  Much more interesting disorder. Compared to ADHD, there is alot more work to be done for schizophrenia. ","1304209222"

edit: Apparently, lots of CFers are paleo/primal, perhaps that will provide a breakthrough.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I think this is the most important point I'm trying to make with this AMA:

**NEVER FIGHT A COP. NEVER RESIST ARREST.**

The core of your post is true: this incident is my fault.  You fucked up the details in every possible way, however.

--You have already assumed that your brother officer was in the right, but the reality is: he did not handle this situation well at all.  Neither did I.  There is something to learn from here as an officer: Slow the fuck down.  I thought that was the first thing they teach... something about ""fast is dead"" right?

--Tell the person he is under arrest.  He did not tell me until I felt the cuffs snap on.  We were standing facing each other with my hands hanging in front of me.  My hands weren't on the hood.  All the protocol that I see on TV?  It didn't happen.  He casually reached forward and snapped one cuff on my left hand.  Fuck yes I jerked my hand back.  I was startled as hell.

--Continue to talk to the person.  Once my hand jerked back (with one cuff on my wrist and the officer holding the chain), the officer stopped speaking entirely.  The ASP baton came out like lightning.  That ESCALATED the situation.  There was zero violence before that moment.

--Realize who you are dealing with.  Someone with tears streaking down his face may not have a straight head.  Why present an opportunity for him to fuck up his life?

The video would have been revealing, but it wasn't available.  Considering the lies on the police report that followed... well what the hell am I supposed to think?  Feels wrong to me.

&gt; My concern is what if you start getting butt hurt by life again?

I can understand why you would ask that question.  As I'm sure you know, a huge number of offenders are repeat offenders with a pattern of violence.  I'm not.  I wasn't.

Oh also, your tone is antagonistic as hell.  I'm not here to spread a message to assault police officers, I'm here to share the experience.  Anyone who has read this AMA should understand how badly resisting arrest can fuck up your life.  One more time:

**NEVER FIGHT A COP. NEVER RESIST ARREST.**  The more you ""win,"" the more you will LOSE.","1304209289"

He kind of coughed a bit and I heard a tinkle behind his teeth. I reached in and extracted a long stemmed drawing pin. It had a 15mm spike on it. My son put on this big smile. Apparently getting rid of the in was a great relief for him.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine seeing that kind of devastation firsthand.

Jesus was actually asked a question like this once...

...his answer is below:

&gt;&gt;There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. And he answered them, ""Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.""

So, if a Christian shows up and tries to tell you ""this happened because these people were eeeevil"" - please remind them of this passage where Jesus reminds us that the message is not ""we're good and they're bad and they will get what they deserve"" - but is more along the lines of ""we're all bad, God is good, and our best hope is that we WON'T get what we deserve, and also, stop looking at them and start looking at the shit in your own life.""

I know this probably isn't that comforting to hear right now, and probably also doesn't answer your questions in full...suffering and pain are some of the most deep, emotional questions that we can talk about in this life. I just wanted to put it out there so you know it, that when someone who professes Christ tries to tell you this happened because of such and such a thing, you can know what Jesus himself had to say on the matter.

Again, I'm so sorry for your loss.

If you then use those things she taught you about, you're going to live a very frustrated life.

"news","t5_2qh3l","See, the thing is, *at the very best*, the tax cuts failed to prevent or mitigate one of the worst recessions in American history. At worst, they're in part to blame.

The fact that we had ten years of tax cuts with little to no cuts to government spending (in fact, not only did we *not cut*, we actually *spent more*) is only more evidence of why this policy just won't work. We actually can go back as far as the Reagan administration and see that sustained tax cuts have been met only with increased deficits and more spending, rather than the opposite.

It's legitimate to argue that if they actually had cut spending, maybe somehow we wouldn't have experienced one of the worst recessions in American history. It's a great hypothetical, and I have little to offer to refute it. But my point is that, for whatever reason, even under a conservative administration, it is still a hypothetical. Even the newly elected and supposedly more conservative Republican house has yet to propose anything by way or spending cuts that go beyond pocket change. (The Ryan budget, incredulously, has been scored to further increase the deficit. It's insane.)

I don't see any reason why this reality would change in the next 10 years if it essentially hasn't in the last 30. And in the mean time, the economy will continue to get worse. If we want to cut spending, let's do that first, before cutting any taxes. Lower taxes *after* we've balanced the budget. Then we'll talk. Until we're ready for that approach, tax cuts are just an argument for deficits.

My point here isn't just to refute the economic argument for tax cuts, but to remind you that the argument against taxes is principally a moral one. The much weaker economic argument has been plastered on top of this moral contention that taxes are akin to theft and tyranny. I'd rather be talking about this core argument instead of the canard that somehow tax cuts have been good for the economy.

TL,DR: My point is still that here we are, 10 years later, and no new jobs. Sure, if we had done things differently, the tax cuts could very well have succeeded in creating jobs. If I had a wand, I might be able to make the economy better myself. But neither of those hypotheticals change the reality: that the tax cuts have not succeeded in creating jobs.","1304209323"

The fact that they lose their anonymity does not make any difference in this. It's a life they chose - they wanted to make music, they wanted to get out there and they wanted to be **famous**. That means they willingly entered into it, as artists, to be seen by the world. You can't start complaining later that you have no privacy - it was your own goddamn choice! And sure, let them have their millions and be rich and whatever else. But they do not need an endless supply of millions.

"science","t5_mouw","Easy to read and concise.  Willravel's link to 158 arguments + counter arguments even corrected some of my own misconceptions.

I do have a question as a relative layperson.

Long term and short term temperature records show temperatures turning (relatively) sharply from warming to cooling periods.  All the information I have seen seems to show positive feedback loops which accelerate warming (to a point preventing total runaway) or negative ones (that stop glaciation in the ice ages).  

My question is what theories and/or hypothesis do we have which explain the transitions between observed warming and cooling trends in the past?  It seems like all positive/negative feedbacks in climate should cause a rise or cooling period and then a plateau at that level (as diminishing returns from positive feedbacks balance against negative ones).  This isn't what we observe over short or long time scales... are there specific events to explain this? (besides the little ice age which does have specific events)  Do they correlate with some other external factor (the sun?) or is there just more to be learned about what causes these types of transitions?","1304209364"

You have to push really hard, especially if you're not at a high-ranked school. I'm at a T2 and I'm getting by because of contacts. Contacts can potentially leapfrog a lot of other people, so long as you do well in school and are actually a useful worker. If you're targeting US firms, identify their cutoff numbers for SA/hiring programs and make sure you've met them. Then, pursue aggressively.

Even so, I'd guess my chances at actual gainful private firm employment abroad are about 50/50 post-graduation, depending on how my SA thing goes, and there's no way I'll be on a US salary scale. There are other options other than firms, of course, in-house teams sometimes want people with specific regional experience, but they don't hire fresh graduates very often. Smaller companies might.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Ehh, okay. 

It's largely the idea of imagining yourself *in* the porn that bugs me (though maybe some people don't do that with porn?). I hate the idea of my SO ever thinking about how much he wants to stick his dick in some porn chick, or anyone other than me. I consider this unfaithful, to some degree. And since masturbation without porn often relies on remembering porn / sexual encounters / dreams or visualising other women, even that can fall under the ""unfaithful"" category.

I guess I've really never understood even the capability of doing that sort of thing. Calling yourself monogamous and saying sex is only for this one person, then wanting it with someone else (even if you're not going to fulfill that want)? I'm sure people would counter me by saying ""Well, it's just biology."" but I just *don't get that*. Just the idea of another person's hands on me makes me clench up if I'm in a relationship; so for someone to say ""I only want you"", but ever think ""I want Sasha Grey's mouth on my cock"", even if they'd turn it down if they really thought about it... it seems contradictory and dishonest. Dishonest at an instinctual level that most people can't overcome. But human biology doesn't just excuse that. 

But, then, my first relationship consisted of being cheated on the whole time, and I've lost count of how many times I've been assaulted, so I acknowledge that I've probably got some abnormal attitudes towards faithfulness, and pretty abnormal capabilities of staying faithful. But this domain is one where my SO's opinion is the only one that matters, and he can dump me if he doesn't like it. I hate when people get all judge-y at me, demanding I get more ""sex positive"" or something. I let everyone else live their sex lives how they want, and that should be ""sex positive"" enough.","1304209369"

To a rapist, yes, arousal occurs during the rape (obviously) but that arousal does not come from the attractiveness or compatibility or cleverness or whatever other trait you or I might find sexual in another person.  It comes from taking away their power and asserting control over them.

Not everything has an evolutionary purpose--full body hair obviously did, but as it became less necessary due to various reasons, it was fine if it thinned in some places. The places where it didn't most likely weren't random,  but many people are suggesting that it occured after we lost ALL our body hair, which suggests humans being bald for a while, or something.

Most likely explanation is a. remnant of full body hair and b. hair in this area served an additional purpose besides warmth, such as bacteria and friction reduction, as many people suggest.

They ignored us for several minutes while we stood infront of the register ready to order. One black kid was on his phone the *entire* time we were there, which had to of been half an hour. The food was disgusting. Okay, I know it's Taco Bell, but it was 3am and we were drunk, so if it was bad while we were impaired, there were some serious issues with these burritos. My friend's fiancee got a burrito that was just cheese and sour cream. No meat. So we began to plot.

I constructed a Taco Sauce bomb. I took the paper wrapper from my burrito, and a handful of Taco Sauce packets that I opened, and then I wrapped the paper around the packets. I filled my drink. My friend carried his wife's cheesey creamy burrito, and we all brought our trash with us as we exited.

This Taco Bell had a foyer. What a mistake. We trashed the foyer in complete solitude. I dropped my Taco Sauce Bomb on the big carpeted welcome mat, and stomped the shit out of it. Taco sauce went all over the walls, the floor, and probably ruined the mat. My friend smeared the cheese/cream burrito on the glass door and left it there to hang. We dumped our trash on the ground and poured our drinks on the floor, then we left.","1304209395"

For awhile I actually followed some really great gluten-free vegan food blogs and found a lot of recipes that I still love today. Vegetarianism/veganism was the wrong choice for my particular body. I do believe that my over-consumption of wheat/gluten products definitely contributed to me building up a bigger intolerance [though looking back, It's been an issue my whole life]. My body does not respond well to carbs [glucose, fructose, gluten, rice, most starches in general], so it was easier for me to re-introduce meat into my diet. If I didn't, I would have had to remain totally vegan, omitting dairy and meat, while also not consuming any grains or fruit. That's really hard.

I didn't become vegan for moral reasons, just for health reasons. It wasn't right for my body. I want to introduce dairy because I am currently following a very low-carb diet, and it would be a good way to expand my food choices. I am still on the fence though.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","Its a government venture capital fund only the government doesn't get a piece of the company instead it just takes all of the downside risk. For example, the last failed investment was the Blue Heron Paper Co. in Oregon City.  Over $13 million of taxes was invested in that company but it went bankrupt 5 years later anyways.  EcoTrust invested $5.4 million and lost it all.  Even if Blue Heron was wildly successful EcoTrust (or the ratepayers) would have gotten nothing other than the trickle-down effect and the good feeling that the company saved energy and cut down on pollution.

To preempt any questions on how it is funded.  The Oregon Legislature passed a law that required the government regulated energy utility monopolies to apply a surcharge to everyone who buys power and divert it to EcoTrust. So although it isn't funded by tax levies directly through a government, the utility monopolies act as a pass-though for the collection of taxes on energy.

Not to mention it is government money spun off into a ""non-profit"" so it can hide from the public records laws. A fairly obvious but clever way in which Oregon governments hide from the public records law. The only information that you can legally get from a non-profit is the federal form 990 which states very basic financial information about the organization. Basically government funded ""non-profits"" are a huge loophole in Oregon's public records law.","1304209421"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;They're poorly paid sexworkers whose profession leave them likely to catch STDs as most studios don't allow for the use of condoms, how is that not exploitative?


There's a risk in their work. Like with a lot of jobs. I don't see how that implies that they're being exploited. Also, the compensation usually is not that bad at all. And btw, if you're doing what you enjoy doing (which a lot of them claim they are), who cares if it doesn't pay that well? Why does that mean you're being exploited?

Maybe we have different definitions of the word. I think of exploiting as meaning ""unjustly taking advantage of"" and kind of implying that the person being exploited isn't really in a position to make it stop. I don't see that here. Unless you're talking about how some people in porn are sexually compulsive/addicted and that that environment kind of takes them lower and makes them worse off in the long run. That's my only problem with porn. But I can't see how it's exploitative by anything you mentioned.","1304209435"

It will be an amazing match for sure. Both teams could potentially be in similar positions, chasing the double. Pep has won the Champion's League once with Barca, SAF twice with United.

We will see some of the best attacking footballers in the world, in the greatest club level game in the world, lead by two of the best managers in the world.

As you said, Xavi against his idol, Scholes, Messi vs Rooney, Iniesta vs Nani. We will also see two of the best centre back pairings in the world, in Puyol and Pique and Vidic and Ferdinand, show us how they can handle the immense attack both teams possess.

This is the Champion's League final. This isn't the time nor the place to sit back and park the bus, and if i'm not mistaken, it's not a tactic United like to use, or use often at all. I think both teams will be out there to win it from the get go, and I think we will have a wonderful spectacle ahead of us.

It will truly be an excellent advert for football, and I, for one, cannot wait.","1304209441"

yes, but it decreases it significantly. you simply don't know how economics works. you're too absolutist. removing the benefit that your children see form your hard work WILL CERTAINLY (even if it's 1% tax) decrease your incentive. 

&gt; And I'm pretty sure that ""leaving something to your children"" is only one of many reasons that people earn lots of money.

but it is a large part of it for some people. again, you're making absolutist statements. ON THE AVERAGE, it WILL effect people. 

&gt; Also I'm pretty sure that there is not much correllation between between working hard and earning enormous wealth

well obviously there's WHEN you work hard (ie if you study a lot and become a doctor, you'll earn more than someone who works hard as a janitor), and HOW you work (ie inventing the CPU is different from working hard to clean a floor), and many many other effects. to say there's not much correlation is completely ridiculous. 

before 1913, there was NO estate tax NOR income tax. now they are very large. you might ask yourself how our country even existed back then, given that liberals now say we need to tax MOST of money that rich people make. but it did - it existed, AND it was growing much faster (economy and std of living).

Dan Amen is a snake oil salesman. His neuroimaging is based on SPECT, which has nowhere near the spatial or temporal resolution of MRI/fMRI. This is important to know, because in the land of fMRI, it is not currently possible to diagnose ADHD with neuroimaging. The individual variation in activation between any two subjects dwarfs the variation between an ""ADHD group"" and a ""non-ADHD group"". The best we can do now is say that ""if you average the activations of 30 people with ADHD and compare that to 30 neurotypical brains, you'll see slightly more/less activation on a certain task in certain parts of cortex"". What we can *not* do is look at any one person's activations and tell you with even a hint of certainty if they have ADHD or not.

In short, your professor is wrong. There *is* no credible diagnosing of ADHD based on neuroimaging, so talk of neuroimaging ADHD rates doesn't make sense.

Ask him for a source. If his source is Dan Amen, point him to the scientific review of Dan Amen on Wikipedia. If he has a different source, please PM me. I've been involved in fMRI experiments with ADHD, and I'd love to see who's claiming that we can diagnose ADHD with the tools we have...

The individual is part of a group, all people have parents who were educated by them and others (teachers, etc).  No man is an island.  This fetishization of the individual in some kind of utopian idealism is probably the most disturbing thing about americans and other intellectuals ideas.

These concepts only exist in the ephemery of language.  In the real world people are made of matter and energy, for instance no amount of chanting principles will make them represent what is real about reality itself.  The problem of this age is people take principles and try to impose them on reality rather then learning about reality and it's limits to temper their principles into guidelines, when principles become so inflexible that facts do not penetrate them then we have a serious problem.  We can take homeless people and rich people in america, the violation of supply and demand.  We have an oversupply of houses on one end (people owning 10+) and people without housing on the other, this is clearly a failure for hayeks theory because it requires a dispossessed class enslaved to those who own capital.  Let us not forget that money and property are purely political inventions.  The whole theory is predicated on certain groups who have ideological hegemony and a monopoly on violence over a society preventing through their dominance of schools and culture other alternatives from forming.

His theory is not undisturbed, there have been plenty of critique's.

http://reality.gn.apc.org/econ/hayek.htm

You should also remember what workers had to go through to get their rights, they had to die for their to be a middle class, healthcare and welfare state today because past owners of capital were so horrible as human beings.

More motivation like ""I'm the only one giving you a ship, and human colonies are disappearing; you need to act now"" could have worked.  

But yea, the idea that ME2 is an isolated story was its downfall.  The main plot backpedals on everything that ME1 tried to set up, and made the Reapers look like idiots.  

I would have loved some ""calm before the storm"" style storytelling. (going back to DS9, we meet the Dominion in the 2nd season, and the war starts at the end of the 5th.  There was some good tension in that buildup.) But ME2 just *had* to have some giant enemy; that was kind of unrelated to the giant enemy form the first game.  (""Arrival"" makes everything that happened in the main ME2 irrelevant)

I think the problem is how we're defining counterfeiting. You seem to think counterfeiting = defrauding someone. All I want is for banks to freely determine what their reserves will be, e.g. Federal Reserve Notes, platinum, etc. and what ratio to keep. So I have my notes in reserve and I print up IOU certificates for my depositors. Under this system there really can't be counterfeiting laws, because who would determine when there has been counterfeiting? How would the government know whether or not the banknotes are counterfeit? Only the supplier could determine this. If they did not have a reliable method to prevent and protect against counterfeiting, their currency would not gain circulation.","1304209532"

Edit: To make carriers more viable w/o breaking them, they need to remove the cost for interceptors, and fuck-away with only starting with 4. Interceptors need to be free to cost, and ""build interceptor"" needs to be on auto-cast by default so they rebuild as they die in combat. This would make carriers much more useful as you could actually USE them as soon as they came out of the stargate, and you wouldn't have to worry about interceptors constantly dying draining your minerals.","1304209553"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Huh. I guess that it just really depends on what you feel that masturbation *means*. I didn't realize that there were differing opinions on what it means to masturbate. But now I know (AND KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE!! -- sorry about that). I guess since you don't masturbate/don't like masturbating then you might not see it the same way. But to me, since I do masturbate on occasion, I know that doing so doesn't mean that I'm not satisfied with the sex I'm having with my partner. It just means that I want an orgasm and I want it now and he's not there to give me one. Also sometimes it's just nice to have a little ""me time"" and not have to worry about anyone else's needs but my own. I would assume that most men look at it the same way so it doesn't bug me when they do it. It could never replace sex with an actual human being. I'm sure that some people have weird/unhealthy masturbation habits that a detrimental to their lives and relationships (sexually or emotionally) with their partners, but that's definitely not the vast majority of people. 

I dunno. I'm glad that you have a partner that shares your views and it works for you guys. I just feel like masturbation doesn't generally denote dissatisfaction with your sex life, although I guess it could. ","1304209558"

But I believe that, not because of a political stance, but because *you do* see an increase in temperature when perusing scientific records. I don't believe it because you told me to, and I certainly don't believe it because everyone else does. 

You seem to miss the point of my criticism. It has nothing to do with the content. It has everything to do with the delivery. When you respond to criticism with insults and accusations of political indoctrination it only works against the *good* things you have said. I responded to your initial post because what you said was a *huge* claim without adequate citation. You responded to that with a paper that fixed that. But don't expect that if you make a claim as you did, that everyone will just take you at your word, especially those of us that don't pay as much attention to global warming as what you do.

**CPU** | [Intel Core i5-2500K 3.3GHz Quad-Core Processor](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/intel-cpu-bx80623i52500k) | $224.99 @ Newegg 
**Motherboard** | [MSI P67A-G43 (B3) ATX  LGA1155 Motherboard](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-p67ag43b3) | $124.99 @ Newegg

**Power Supply** | [Corsair 650W ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-power-supply-cmpsu650txv2) | $79.99 @ Newegg 
|| **Total**
| (Prices include shipping and discounts when available.) | $749.93

With [this combo for the CPU and motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.622006) and [this combo for the RAM and power supply](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.627241), these components will set you back $790 for much better performance. The Intel 2500K is a newer processor that performs just as well as the i7-2600K (which is faster than the i7-940 you're looking at), for $100 less than the i7. The motherboard is a fantastic price/performance one considering it's an Intel board, that will give you SLI/Crossfire support and a handful of other neat features. The graphics card absolutely destroys the 550 Ti in performance, the power supply is much better, and the hard drive is a fantastic drive that's currently on sale for an awesome price.

And I won't forget to mention the $70 total in mail-in rebates that you can go for, which will knock your build down to just $710 if you can go for them. Stick with the optical drive you have and your total can range from either $730 to $810 depending on if you can get all of those rebates or not. Bottom line is, this is a vastly better build for much less money. :P

Hope this helps, and best of luck!","1304209572"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Ok, so is the joke ""9 out of 10 people enjoy gang rape"" a joke with rape as the punchline or does the construction imply more of a meditation on the banality of alluding to mass appeal?  Because I could see it either way.  The first way is pretty trite and lame.  The second is vaguely insightful.

If the poster had come across less bitter and instead it had been a comic where she had asked him if he liked Indian food (or Gregorian chants) and he had responded with a joke about anally raping her it would have had a much more appropriate amount of hyperbole.  The reason that the joke is in poor taste to me is the fact that you don't threaten violence when you are legitimately perturbed.

I was talking to a good friend of mine about going home with her (very saccharinely) and she responded with something about how she wasn't going to sleep with me to which I responded, ""I'll just wait until you're asleep.""  That was tasteless, but in the context she wasn't in the least offended and was rather impressed with my ability to go from sweet to sociopathic in mere moments.

According to the Supreme Court tacit collusion is legal. The hotel's intent is to maximize their profits and the managers understand that by not competing on price with other hotels they will be able to increase their profits. There is nothing illegal about that.

If however, they have a ""Hotel Alliance"" in which the managers have met and discussed price fixing without making a legally binding agreement then this is in fact illegal.

"rapecounseling","t5_2rfx0","I've worked with several women who went through something similar to this - regularly found themselves searching Facebook for one of their abusers.  I've known others who periodically Google search.  For one woman I have seen it benefit her only in this - she did NOT choose to contact him, but she was able to print out the picture and create a ritual for herself which she conducted on the anniversary of the assault to gain a sense of closure.  I think for her that being able to see that he was human, had struggles in an imperfect life (although he was married with children which was painful for her as those were things she wanted for herself but did not yet have), and, most importantly, lived far away were all helpful.  But she could have found something very different, or used the information in a different way, and either could have been very damaging.  There is an aspect of seeking *trauma mastery* to this kind of searching.  In one sense it means we are renting very undeserved headspace to the creep who hurt us.  In another sense our subconscious may be wishing to somehow change what happened by having an interaction with that person in the present time (or sometimes by seeking out, even unconsciously, similar interactions with others in the present time with the hope of having a different outcome - which is essentially what *trauma mastery* means).  The secret hope may be to see remorse, regret, pain, etc. in the abuser.  The problem is, the outcome is absolutely not guaranteed, and the risk is terrible that instead of feeling a sense of mastery over the trauma it will instead be reinforced and the damage greater.  

As long as we need something from the abuser, even something as simple as to hear what we want to say to them about their actions, they have some kind of power over us.  That's a power they don't deserve to have, and one they are likely to abuse.  Scirocco and Auyan have good advice here.  I would ask you to examine your motives carefully , talk with a professional counselor about any actions you are thinking of taking, and plan things out thoroughly before using the information you have found in any way.  You deserve to heal and be as free as possible from happened to you.","1304209591"

Their goaltending is.......atrocious.  I've never seen a team switch their goalie more times in the playoffs and they're only one game into the second round.

I think the biggest factor is how much the Bruins are improved from last year, as you pointed out.  Our third line has been fantastic so far, and Marchand has been all over the ice with a ton of chances.  Horton and Lucic have picked up their game and as a result, our top line has been more effective.

We really just need to stay healthy.  The Flyers are a physical team, and there's always a chance for someone to get hurt.  As soon as Krejci got hurt last year I knew we were in trouble.

Also, as it's been said over and over, our PP needs to get better.  Game 1 didn't really show a lot of improvement and since this is going to be a physical series, there will be penalties, and we will need to score.","1304209591"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;, I don't really think anarchism would have nuclear weapons to begin with

Wishful thinking. You have to start with the initial conditions you're given (the current state of our world), not the initial conditions you want to begin with. You're treading on fantasy here.

&gt; nor would an anarchist community desire to keep whatever nuclear weapons they may have inherited from the previous order

In your anarchist community, how exactly do you propose to stop me, an independent and deranged citizen, from cultivating my nuclear arsenal which I have inherited from a couple US missile silos? What about my machine guns and tanks and other ""hobbies"" I like to keep?


&gt;The ultimate resolution, in my view, is less important than HOW the issue would be resolved: does everyone who has a stake in the decision get a say?

Unfortunately for your society, once I, the deranged citizen, hold all the nuclear power, your opinion on what your society should do with the nuclear weapons no longer matters. By the law of *power*, I'll just nuke or shoot anyone who doesn't bow down to what *I* want. How could your harmless little society ever stop me without breaking your anarchist commandments? (And don't say people like the hypothetical me just mentioned don't exist. Think Saddam. Think Kim Jon Il. Think Stalin and Mao. We are very real, and very much huge fucking assholes) 

Once I hold the nuclear cards, your little society is *over*. I've taken over now, and you guys will do what I tell you to lest I nuke your ass or shoot you with my guns. 


This is the problem with anarchism - the *impotency* of such societies to counter aggression and violence. Reaching consensus is difficult, and in times of violence, time counts. The time you guys waste trying to reach consensus on every god damn issue means more authoritarian governments will fucking plow right through you before you can make a good decision.

It's not a fluke that most of the greatest armies in history were extremely authoritarian - the American army (in comparison to the average citizen). The Spartan. The Nazi Army. The German Army. The army of Napoleon. These tools of violence were not very democratic at all, yet they all are considered some of the greatest fighting forces in history.

This is why anarchism will fail. Its ability to defend itself is, well, lacking. Thankfully, most people *instinctively* fall to a more authoritarian order in times of war. All the easier for your little anarchic experiment to collapse at the slightest threat of violence. ","1304209616"

Regardless of where you stand on this, I can't image obesity being responsible for the end of the world.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","great vid.  Love it, and your comments.  You were fine and in the right all the way through as I see it.  Obviously since nothing bad happened as far as the vid showed ;)

I didn't like the big two second black screen gaps in the vid.  bad editing, but w/e.  I watched the whole thing... a fun ride i'm sure ;)  To me it actually looked like you turned into their course.  Intentionally trying to scare them.  Your friend has it wrong I think - any rider worth his salt woulda seen that coming a mile away as i'm sure you did.  I do not believe you were in any danger.  Maybe if you were talking on a cellphone, distracted and with one hand off the handlebars or something (lol).  Good on you if you did intentionally try to scare that guy.   I mean, how are they gonna learn unless you show them how insane what they're doing is, of course.. only when you're confident enough in your abilities that you CAN do that and get away with it ;P

I've done the same, not in that excact situation, but say people running turning lights when i've got a green.  it's particularly bad where i'm at.  habitually 1-2 cars after the opposite light has turned green try and scam past.  motorcycles can accelerate, time to learn that and not run red lights!  I know this is probably one of the highest risk situations for motorcycle accidents, i'm always aware and plan accordingly.

Sure there's risk involved but if I can do it, get away with it, and be in the right; and maybe at the end of the day make someone rethink things and be a safer driver for all motorcyclists, it isn't so bad.

Worst i've seen though is when there was an intersection and a light... two lanes going in my direction.  one immediately turns into a turninglane onto the highway.  What drivers like to do is get into that lane, and scoot ahead of the crowd and merge in later.  I decided I was not going to have any of that.  Was his destination any more important than mine?  I doubt it.  So I don't let him in... I KNOW he knows i'm there.  Quick horn.  He pushes in anyway.  Fucker.  almost runs me into the siderail of the bridge we're on.  Lay on the horn for a bit.   yeah he doesn't care.   HATE HATE HATE... forget ;)   I have little hope for humanity if that's how most behave, but I tend not to think about it much.","1304209672"

Also, no matter how you look at the issue, gerbs post is *entirely* wrong.  *No one* is claiming that Mortenson totally fabricated the book or isn't building the schools.  That's utter ignorant fiction.  The claims are about a couple tall tales that are in his book that honestly have nothing to do with the project-- they just went to the narrative of the whole thing-- and his poor management of the company's finances.  Mortenson's bad organizational skills are well known (talked about in the books, even) and yeah, maybe he can't handle the day-to-day running of a massive non-profit.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I feel like everyone always forgets about the challenges he ran into when writing ADWD and AFFC. That's the point he decided to extend the series, to NOT skip 5-7 years of plot but actually tell the entire story, and also when he apparently discovered a giant plot hole with Dany's story (the so-called Meereenese Knot) that required re-writing most of the 4th book.

Maybe you can attribute all of that to ""writer's block"", but if Martin sticks to his proposed schedule (7 books, meaning only 2 left) and the above problems were the primary causes of the delays, we should expect to see the 6th book within another 2-3 years.

I completely disagree about the short stories. I think the first one was the most memorable, but the other two were enjoyable. Besides, they aren't part of the main series and I got the impression Martin used them as a way to provide more insight into Westeros and the Targaryens before the War of the Usurper. They were also probably a nice ""fun"" project that was still related to the main task -- for all we know they actually sped up his writing for ADWD!","1304209694"

Basically the forward looking cost of owning a car is worse at 0 miles because of the up front cost/insurance, it falls, and falls as it is totally reliable but deprecating. Then it goes back up because it starts to fall apart.

What I remember the ideal time to buy a car was a higher mileage than I typically try to get my cars at (30K) but that over 100K roughly was a bad place to be also. Basically this study showed that it is better to sell your car rather than maintain it forever... That there was an optimal point for buying and selling given current market norms.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I like it that you are staying on topic of dead vs undead vs still alive rather than just saying that this is an idea you personally don't favour.

I think it is only discredited if you had some inflated idea of what a social welfare system was supposed to deliver to poor people in the first place.  If on the other hand you view it as only a limited part of government policy as a stopgap measure then it has been as successful as many other government policies aimed at alleviating problems of poverty, that don't attract the same level of distrust.  Long term welfare recipients do fare badly but to suggest that many of these people would be better off without it, especially without spelling out an alternative, is an enormous leap I think.  So that is one criticism you have about the welfare state but the welfare state also works at another level and this is closer to what its core mission was considered to be from the beginnings of modern social welfare as an idea in [Germany and England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare#History) of a national insurance scheme to smooth out the boom and bust cycle that is otherwise a feature of industrial capitalism.  This aspect of the social welfare state is very much relevant today and by way of illustration it is worth noting the difference in emphasis of stimulus spending during the recent GFC where the economists in the United States argued that European governments should increase their stimulus spending or risk stagnation to which the Europeans were able to reply that due to the nature of the welfare states in their various countries, should unemployment start to rise appropriate stimulus money would be automatically directed into the economy in the form of welfare payments directly to those parts of the economy most effected by the slow down.  [Link](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=axtkv3ILIIHI&amp;refer=home)  I don't know of any pieces that point to a more robust economic recovery in the European states as opposed to the USA as a result of the social welfare programs in Europe but it is food for thought isn't it.  Also I am just some idiot with a keyboard but I am pretty confident that my interpretation of this is not unique.  It is with these considerations in mind that we realize that opposition to dismantaling the welfare state in states like Australia and other modern social democratic democracies enjoys broad based support from all level of society poor and rich alike.  Conclusion, the social welfare state is not a dead idea, not a zombie idea living on past time its usefulness has expired, but a full on living idea that continues to grow and adapt to current circumstances.","1304209715"

PS3 (RPG - exclusives):
1) Valkyria Chronicles (tactical RPGish)
2) Demon's Souls (action RPG w/ online elements)
3) Yakuza 4 (beat 'em up with RPG elements)

Xbox 360 (RPG - sort of exclusives):
1) Tales of Vesperia (this was rls'ed for the PS3 as well, but IIRC, only in JPN; traditional Tales JRPG)
2) Mass Effect 1 (sci-fi RPG; also avail on PCs)
3) Risen (also avail on PCs)

Cross platform RPGs (Xbox 360, PS3):
1) Dragon Age: Origins (also on PCs)
2) Resonance of Fate
3) Fallout: New Vegas (also on PCs)

I can't really think of any RPGs for the Wii, but the DS is loaded with them. If anyone can make suggestions for the Wii, that would rock. The only RPG that seemed interesting to me on there was Arc Rise Fantasia.

As for FPSes, they're pretty much cross-plat with almost everything nowadays aside from the exclusives like Killzone 3 (PS3). Then you have the slew of third-person action games like Uncharted 2 (PS3), Dead Space 2 (PS3, Xbox 360, PC), or Gears of War (Xbox 360, PC).

There's also the Halo stuff for the Xbox 360, though it's arguably better known for its multiplayer action. The Wii has a few FPS games on it and if I had to pick one, I'd recommend the new GoldenEye which works with the Wii remote and/or Gamecube controller. I liked it as a nice, solid update to the original.

Hope this helps out.","1304209737"

I've fiddled with DIY long enough to see that there isn't *that* much difference between components, other than durability.  Do not expect the pricey stuff to last the longest, either.

The circuit is more important than the parts, anyway.  Modest parts in a great circuit will always outperform the finest parts in a bad circuit.  But keep in mind that the finest parts in a great circuit aren't all that much different from the modest parts.  This is why you'll find loads of testimonial evidence of a difference, but few graphs or measurements.  This sort of thing is like buying a new outfit for a Barbie doll.  It's still the same Barbie.

You can talk about makeup and periods and whatever the fuck you want whenever the fuck you want. That's the entire point of it! To be able to express yourself, regardless of sex or gender affiliation.

If this subreddit decides that stereotypical ""girl talk"" is okay -- nailpolish, romantic movies and books, cute boys, etc. -- but news articles about female politicians or something aren't, then there's a problem here.

I'm honestly very surprised here. The majority of the comments here say that they don't call themselves feminists because they like making sandwiches for their boyfriends or cleaning. This does not make you an anti-feminist, as long as you don't bash someone who says ""yeah well today I don't feel like cleaning, today I feel like exercising or playing baseball or whatever the fuck I want to do.""

* Bloodlust/Trouble - Stood near a middle-aged guy in a dress shirt and slacks during Trouble's set. He didn't move at all, then they played ""End of My Daze"" and he started headbanging harder than anyone I've ever seen before or since. Once the song ended he didn't move again for the rest of the show.
* Throw Rag/The Dwarves/The Damned - My then-girlfriend wanted to sit on the balcony because she thought it would be too violent down on the floor. Halfway through The Dwarves' set a huge ""Road House""-worthy fight broke out two feet away from us, with tables and chairs getting tossed all over the place.
* The Vandals - Some kid in a wheelchair was crowdsurfing.
* Nebula/The Hellacopters - Two guys in front of me in line before the show kept talking about how stoked they were to finally see The Hellacopters. Halfway through Nebula's set they were both drunk as hell and got in the most vicious fight I've ever seen in person, which led to them [getting kicked out before The Hellacopters even took the stage.](http://www.sadtrombone.com)

Weirdest:

* Turbonegro - The venue got lazy and played Black Sabbath's Paranoid album in its entirety at least eight times over the PA.
* A bunch of local bands playing at someone's house - Mid-set for some Mr. Bungle ripoff, a friend of theirs decided to strip naked and start masturbating in the singer's face. (If it had been a chick, this would be in the Best category.)

Worst:

* Pentagram - Getting cockpunched by some kid who was running from security. (Great show other than that.)
* My old roommate's indie rock band - 'Nuff said.","1304209758"

Ungrammatical, and apparently betraying a misunderstanding of the word ""defunct"". Later the author uses the word ""shibboleth"" in a sense opposite to its actual meaning, and throws in a ""between Wallace and I"" at some point. The grammatical and stylistic blunders are distracting, and made it hard to take the ideas seriously.

I get that the review is probably supposed to be a pastiche, but DFW's prose was never sloppy - it only *looked* chaotic. And I get that DFW had a tendency toward personal oversharing, regardless of what he was writing about, but this read more like a memoir than a book review.","1304209759"

Casually let them know you are concerned and ask them if the dog has a medical problem that is causing it to be so thin. Just be aware that the owner may claim that the dog is being cared for properly even if it is not. If they deny there is a problem or give you a wishy washy answer, then make an anonymous call to your local Humane Society or ASPCA and report the dog's condition. You don't want to insult your neighbor by accusing them of neglect, but it is better to err on the side of caution for the dog's well-being.

First, the simple spectroscopic. Oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) do not have polarized bonds, and this is the basis of them absorbing in a different range than molecules which do, CO2, CH4, NO2 etc...  Molecules with polarized bonds tend to absorb strongly in the [infrared region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared), while the non-polar symmetrical molecules do not.  The wiki page on [IR spectroscopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy) covers the concepts pretty well.  Infrared is what we typically observe to be radiant heat.

If you mean why do carbon dioxide and methane and the like contribute to global warming at a greater rate, it's because they absorb in an area where little else in the atmosphere does, so small amounts make for a big difference in the total energy absorbed, as opposed to say water vapor, which is almost always maxed out, so changes in the total amount don't make much difference.","1304209766"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Healthcare and education shouldn't be bundled together, as they're vastly different things in terms of concept and implementation. What you've described for healthcare is just insurance. In terms of education,  because the government has made education mandatory for people under a certain age, some sort of publicly funded education system is necessary, but an *entirely*--or even nearly entirely--subsidized education system is extremely expensive and will require a significant hike in the tax rate. It is plausible and probable that in such a case, a family that would have been able to send their children to a private school will be unable to do so due to their mandatory funding of public education. Also, those already with university degrees or those who don't plan on going to college will be forced to pay for education; in this case, for the amount that they give regarding education, they receive nothing themselves.

Buy health insurance and unemployment insurance, set up a college tuition fund for a child. This way, it gives you control over your own life and money and provides more options for the consumer than an educational or healthcare system monopolized by the government.


&gt;I don't know about you, but knowing that I'm helping someone who has come across hard times is much more satisfying buying things for yourself and your loved ones. You are indirectly using your money on yourself and your loved ones by paying taxes.

If I want to help somebody, it wouldn't be through the government. I'd bypass the layers of bureaucratic blubber and make sure my money goes to the people I want it to go to. In the current situation, I have no idea if my money is being used effectively, and no way of finding out. I don't see how that makes me feel any better--the idea that I'm giving up part of my income for only the *possibility* of someone else benefiting.

Also, I want to have the choice of allocating my money wherever I see fit. If I want to help someone else, I'd do it of my own accord. It's not a matter of ""I don't like helping people,"" but a matter of ""I want to have the right to do whatever I want with my money, as long as it doesn't infringe anyone else's rights.""","1304209812"

Pope believed that condom blocks ""life"" and prevention of sex should be used to stop AIDS. (Yes, this is bullshit, I know, but this is his belief. And his belief shouldn't be used to portray as evil man)

*""The Holy See . . . considers that it is necessary above all to combat this disease in a RESPONSIBLE way by increasing prevention, notably through education about respect of the sacred value of life and formation of the correct practice of sexuality, which presupposes chastity and fidelity.""*

Also, yes, you are right. LYING about condom not stopping sex is bullshit and morally wrong. However, I believe that he didn't intended to cause millions of people to get AIDS. Vatican probably wanted to discourage condom usage and increase sex prevention to stop AIDS. Just saying that it is morally wrong won't stop people so Vatican took radical step. 

If Pope said this lie to cause spread of AIDS, he is indeed evil and wrong.

However, if pope said this to stop people doing what he considers wrong, and he was ready to stop it even through lying, it is still wrong, but not enough to call him ""evil"" since he still wanted to stop AIDS. He just thought that condom is ""wrong way to do it"".","1304209821"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","well, this is what you make me think of when you say that:

http://www.sjnohio.com/Just%20War.htm (just ignore the Catholic parts, it applies with or without theology)

&gt; The idea that every government has a duty to pursue justice ""shapes the first set of moral criteria in the just-war tradition . . . the 'ius ad bellum' or 'war-decision law,'"" according to Weigel.10 Eight centuries ago, St. Thomas Aquinas — who builds on the work of Augustine and the medieval canonists — articulated these still-valid criteria or conditions for a just-war as follows: (1) Legitimate authority must declare war, not private citizens or groups; (2) The cause must be just; and (3) **The war must be waged with a right intention (""so that they intend the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil,"" as Thomas says), which excludes acts of war done out of vengeance, hatred, and other like motives.**11 This third condition would also encompass the moral quality of one's ends or objectives in fighting a war. These too must be morally good.

does that sound anything like the wars the U.S. engages in?  every war we've been in for the last century has had some racial slur attached to it - ""japs"" in WWII, ""haji"" in the Iraq War, etc. etc., i can't even remember them all.  the soldiers kill indiscriminately, commit great atrocities...so how can the war be just?

the politicians claim our wars are just.  but what else would they say?  you can claim that hitting one individual might make him think twice about attacking others again, but can you really apply the same logic on a national scale?  ""an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind,"" right?

the nagasaki and hiroshima bombings were indefensible crimes against humanity.  the only reason you read that there was ""controversy"" about it in your history textbook was because your textbooks were released by McGraw Hill.","1304209831"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Yes, the bullet cluster is the ""smoking gun"" of dark matter. It seems that there is a problem with your description here, however.

The primary amount of mass that ""got caught up with itself"" is in the middle. This is mostly gas, however, which is spread across a large area, without focal points. The stars and black holes of the galaxies mostly pass through without colliding with one another. So, we have a cloud of gas in the middle, with the large astronomical objects on the out sides, around which we see the gravitational lensing.

Could it make sense that the actual astronomical objects within the two galaxies curve spacetime more sharply than the thin cloud of gas even though there is more mass in the gas because the gas is spread out so non-focally?","1304209838"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","To back up my admittedly over-optimistic vote for a photonic quantum computer:

Most proof-of-principle demonstrations in quantum computing were done with single photons first. More recent advances include, for example, the first three-qubit (Toffoli) gate, although that was a close call, with the ion trappers not far behind, the first demonstration of one-way (or cluster-state) quantum computing, the first demonstration of quantum chemistry and many more.

The big advantage of a photonic architecture is that photons can be generated and manipulated quite easily, that photons do not interact with the environment and thus are not subject to decoherence, and that they do no require complicated vacuum or low temperature environments. The big limiting factor at the moment is that photons can not yet be produced deterministically, i.e. we don't have a device where we press a button and a single photon (not zero, or more than one) comes out.

Another problem are the quantum gates we are using. Currently, gates are probabilistic in nature, i.e. they do not work all the time which means you cannot scale them up. There has been a lot of progress though recently - we know how to build scalable gates and people have demonstrated that they can be fabricated very compact on photonic waveguide chips. Another limiting factor are the detectors. Our fast detectors have low detection efficiencies (around 50%), which makes a photon computer inherently unscalable, while existing highly efficient single-photon detectors are complicated and appallingly slow.

Most of this is an engineering problem though. So far, the photonic community has not nearly invested as much time/money into tech development as the other communities. While the ion trappers and, more recently, the superconducting groups, have improved their technology, photon groups happily churned out result afer result with the simple but effective few-qubit technology they already had available. Now, of course, tables are turning and we photon people do have to catch up technologically if we want to stay in the race.","1304209870"

I've found that a lot of the time it is the dubstep DJs (not trying to start a fight, I love dubstep and play it in my sets as well, there's just so many bad dubstep DJs) who crank up the gain and distort the sound levels to get that ""filthy bass"". Anyone who knows what they are doing, and I'm sure someone has stated this already, knows you don't crank up your gain and you make sure you're not red lining you levels. Loud music is always better but there is a limit and distortion fucks with the sound. 

As for the issue of talking in a bar, I agree that this should be the priority. Of course DJs love playing for themselves and playing songs they know rather than top 40 shit, but when playing at a venue it's about trying to get the crowd into it. If it's a club scene then the DJ is more of a rockstar and can play however they want usually, but at a bar it should be expected that not everyone is there for a rave. I would love to always blast my tunes and only play songs I like but DJs need to kow what type of venue they are playing.

Anyway, these are just my views. I haven't been DJing for a terribly long time but I know that pleasing the crowd is important.","1304209873"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Warren Kinsella on this:

&gt;A Sun reporter called me about this story yesterday afternoon. Before he could even describe what it was about – he said it involved “a major political figure and the police” – I told him I already knew what it was about. **In Toronto, and amongst many political people, this story has been pretty well-known for years. Someone came to me about it two years ago.** I looked at what they had, thought about it for about sixty seconds, and then urged this person to forget all about it. I certainly planned to. If the story ever saw the light of day, I told this person, it would hurt the source more than it would hurt the target. I still think that. If people within a political party were ultimately behind this – and there are four political parties which would have a direct interest in getting this story out – they’d better hope to God they don’t get found out before Monday night. Right now, there isn’t a voter in Canada who doesn’t think a political party was wrapped up in this somehow. Does that hurt Jack Layton? Not with most voters. Ask that Hugh Grant actor guy, he knows.

So, if it's this well known I don't think a Liberal person shopping the story 2 years ago is any indication that it's someone from the Liberals now.  Particularly if a Liberal consulted Warren Kinsella and were told to shut the thing down.

My reaction is the same as Kinsella's.  This is dirty tricks and I don't like it.  Worse, it will almost certainly backfire on the source, so I like it even less.","1304209950"

In [this entry](http://quotedepot.net/quotations/the-constitution-is-not-an-instrument-for-the-government-to-restrain-the-people/246996), it says the reason why Patrick Henry opposed the US Constitution is because

&gt;The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our lives and interests.

So in other words, he doesn't want the government to systematically use it as a weapon against the people, which is why we created the Bill of Rights. However, as of recent, an increase of laws have been enacted to protect the American people. Surveys show that the general American population are overspending, uneducated, and don't vote/or understand politics. Thus, the government knows what is best in monitoring the constant threats from terrorism and other dangers; such as allowing the TSA to search persons, pass laws against gun possession to reduce crime, monitor cyber attacks to the general public, and allow reputable, successful companies to oversee various sectors and see us through our economic crisis, like Medicare and USDA.","1304209970"

They are instead political ideologues who are opposed to policies that potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In order to advance this political argument, they have taken to critiquing the science as laymen, leading to frustrating, unproductive and ignorant arguments.

A better approach is to ask them what motivates their skepticism about climate change as a political matter and then address that. Don't waste your time or theirs being a layman arguing complicated science with another layman.

I usually start with: ""Look, I'm not going to argue climate change with you. Frankly, I don't understand the science, and neither do you. I'd rather address why on this issue you've decided not to trust those who do science for a living."" Or something.","1304209980"

By that I mean that it will now be easier for a new brewery to be built (here in Chicago) so that more beer can be produced to keep up with demand (the brewery is already at capacity). This means that a likely $50 million+ brewery will be built, much more than the current yearly profit stream. In addition, the current brewery will still stay running. That means 2 Chicago breweries contributing to the local economy and providing a well over 100 jobs.

 the bible describes the night jesus was arrested in a very subtle way. but peter, flipped... out: ""Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.

I'm confident that based on other descriptions of peters behavior and human nature in general, he went apeshit on those guards. then later, he denied even being associated with the man he was willing to kill for. but knowing this to come, jesus called peter the rock upon which he would build his church. a foul mouthed, impulsive, hardnose fisherman (if any of you have spent time on a boat as a living, you know what I mean) receives the keys to the kingdom; he becomes an example of why god loves his people. despite how he acted, or how he doubted or how he cursed, his heart never wavered. just be you dude. it's important to guide others through your actions or words and if you offend someone, make it right, which you seem to have done well enough here... but you were made a specific way for a specific reason. there is no guilt in this. there is no guilt in being you.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Harper will undoubtedly win, although it'll likely be another minority. What will happen though is that he will likely be unable to win the confidence of the house afterwards (which caused this election) and the parties will not want another election and therefore the official opposition (likely the NDP and for the first time in history) would go to the governor general and ask to form a government. With the loss the liberals are about to take, ignatieff will likely not be party leader and a new leader will be chosen. There would have been a liberal-NDP coalition in 2008 if it wasn't for Harper ending parliament and the liberals electing a new, anti-coalition, leader (ignatieff). With him out of the picture the next leader would likely be someone like bob rae, who is in favor of a coalition. What may end up happening is an NDP-liberal coalition, with NDP leader jack layton at the head as pm. This coalition would then have to win the support of the bloc before being brought in as a majority government. If the bloc doesn't support it then it would be a minority. However, seeing as the bloc was on board with the 2008 coalition deal and pledged to support it for 18 months if it came to, I don't see why they wouldn't.

Also politically:

Cons-Right wing (between dems and reps)

Liberals-Centrist (left of dems)

NDP-Left wing (far left of dems)

Three nurses holding me down. With my mum. And my grandmother. And the doctor. A nurse who's good at venupuncture comes in. And tries several more times. 15 tries later, including canulas (which they called 'mosquito needles - they won't hurt much, honest! Just nibbles like mosquito bites' Bullshit.) to the arms, legs and groin. They eventually had me stripped to my underpants, held down on a stainless-steel table with a needle in my crotch to get to my veins there.

Needles freak me the fuck out. It was years before needles on TV would not induce instant gag-reaction, dry heaves and cold sweats.

I still give blood. Just because it's hard doesn't mean it's unecessary. I sit there looking VERY pale, the nurses swearing at my shitty veins and with a piece of surgical gauze draped over my entire arm so that I don't catch a vomit-inducing glimpse of the needle in my arm... but I do it. Blood saves lives.

EDIT: And now that I've done it a few times, tetanus shots and the like are a billion times less anxiety inducing.  A ten second jab compared to a chunk of surgical steel in your arm for up to 15 minutes (I'm a slow bleeder)? Nada! ","1304210038"

"RenewableEnergy","t5_2ryj2","1) Pessimistic analysis suggests that uranium supplies (regardless of cost) will last just 40 years. More optimistic reports suggest there's about 270 years worth, which, with breeder reactors, could last more than 8,000 years. 

Uranium from seawater (while not currently being done at commercial scale) would make the resource virtually limitless (millions of years of supply), and, according to the OECD, would cost about $300USD per Kg, a price that would not dramatically affect the cost of nuclear powered electricity. This technology would also eliminate the externalities of uranium mining. However, this has only been done at laboratory scale to date, there could be serious technical issues or cost overruns facing large scale deployment. While mined uranium prices hit $300/Kg for a brief time in 2007, they dropped before anyone started looking to put this tech to commercial use.

Also, uranium isn't the only fuel nuclear reactors can use. Thorium is a promising candidate, and Earth has more than 3x as much Thorium as uranium.

2) Totally agree. Renewables are way safer. It's only a matter of time before they become cheaper and we perfect storage solutions for their intermittency.

3) There's really not that much waste. All the waste ever produced by the US could fit in a high school gymnasium. It will, however, continue to build up as time goes on, and it is extremely dangerous.

Forgive me for my future technology solutions, but within the next hundred years or so, it is more than likely that we'll build space elevators and/or orbital airships that could get rid of the waste safely and economically.","1304210061"

That GTX 570 is an *insanely* powerful card. Even a Radeon HD 6870 or a GTX 560 Ti will play any game at max settings in 1080p, just for reference. The 2GB Radeon HD 6950 is another great option, as you can unlock the shaders on it or flash it with the 6970 BIOS or whatever trick it is to basically get it to perform at 6970 speeds for $250, so that would actually be a cheaper option than the GTX 570. Even if you can't unlock it, the Radeon HD 6950 is a very powerful card by itself.

Also, with the money you save, you can get a better, more efficient power supply [like this Corsair TX750](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817139021) for instance.","1304210090"
"reddit.com","t5_6","Proof:
See: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=censorship+squads+on+digg+and+reddit

Unfortunately the nature of the reddit voting system has a huge flaw.

If a group maintains a story initially at near zero points the Reddit algorithm keeps it from rising to larger visibility (it bumps off the new list but doesn't make it to a position on any front page) where the normal masses of redditors could overwhelm the smaller active group of censors.

Many have asked for reddit to offer an ""upvote only"" ranking tab next to new and controversial (which is NOT the same thing) which would eliminate this problem and rank links based on only total upvotes but reddit has consistently refused to offer this ranking.

One has to wonder why since it is a slight modification of existing code to do and less computationally intense than doing a summation of both upvotes and downvotes for a net vote ranking.

My guess is they approve of the censorship.

I don't know why else they wouldn't do it.

&gt;Although currently there are no accepted uses for imaging in diagnosing ADHD (other than ruling out identifiable medical/neurologic conditions that may mimic ADHD), this article: (1) provides a context within which to understand the potential future role of imaging in clinical practice; (2) dis- cusses the inter-relationship of clinical diagnostic controversies with imaging research; (3) briefly overviews the main imaging techniques used to study ADHD and highlights some major recent advances that exemplify the cur- rent state of imaging capabilities; (4) identifies issues and complexities facing psychiatric neuroimaging research in general and highlights disorder-specific challenges of ADHD research; and (5) suggests guidelines for possible fu- ture clinical uses of imaging in ADHD. It is not intended as a comprehensive review or meta-analysis of imaging of ADHD, which can be found else- where [1–12], but rather as a primer to aid clinicians and non-imaging ADHD researchers in understanding the relevant complexities of ADHD imaging and possible future applications to clinical practice.

(Sorry about the hyphenated words -- that's what happens when you cut and paste from a pdf.)

The identifiable medical/neurologic conditions are *not* depression and anxiety, by the way. Those are just as impossible to diagnose with neuroimaging. The conditions he's talking about are things like Pick's disease or frontal lobe tumors.","1304210096"

I'd rather live in a country where the half of the population that didn't earn as much, and had more health requirements in order to bring up the next generation didn't have to worry about such general things.

Unfortunately, I've felt under siege since the last election. I would much rather talk about the diva cup, and places to find great dresses. But I think it would be being like an ostrich in the sand if we did not make each other aware of these things.

"canada","t5_2qh68","The shit hit the fan when the CRTC allowed the backhaul owners (the backhaul is the relay network which exists between your house and your ISP's own network) to charge their wholesalers the same rate as they charged their own customers. This meant that wholesalers simply had to adopt the same pricing model or go out of business. I don't need to go into any more details about this as I'm sure you're already well aware of them. In any market, more options are always better as they maximize consumer surplus. What most people here are unwilling to accept is that these options **also include UBB**. There is nothing inherently wrong with UBB. UBB is a model which allows a subscriber to obtain data on demand via a high speed connection for a lower price than they would pay for an unlimited connection of the same data rate. Consider the following plans:

1. 2 mbps down, .5 mpbs up, no transfer cap. This is the plan I was on for the past 12 years ever since the first xdsl services were rolled out in my area (amongst the first in Canada). When I switched, I was paying 60 bucks a month for service plus 5 dollars a month for modem rental.

2. 6 mbps down, 1 mpbs up, 25 gb transfer cap. This is Bell's current performance plan which retails for 34.99 a month

3. 16 mbps down, 1 mbps up, 80 gb transfer cap. This is your average family's cable plan provided by rogers. Lets just say this costs 44.99 a month (I cant remember the exact pricing but its around there) and you also get up to 15% off of all services if you bundle them together, saving you a lot of money on mobility, home phone and cable if you have them bundled.

4. 16 mbps down, 1 mbps up, 300 gb transfer cap. 42.95 / month provided by teksavvy. No bells and whistles.
5. 16 mbps down, 1 mbps up, no transfer cap. This is the plan provided by Teksavvy for 54.99, again, no bells and whistles.

Right now there are already plans for pretty much everyone. If we were to remove UBB then the plans would go back to being speed differentiated rather than usage differentiated and ALL prices would gravitate towards the more expensive options like they had in the past.

As long as we ensure that businesses such as TekSavvy are able to offer their preferred business model the market will naturally form its own equilibrium. Restricting UBB or flat rate will naturally remove consumer choices and this is universally bad. Despite what some people around here want to believe, networks do not maintain and upgrade themselves. If I have two endpoints 100 miles apart and one end point fails then I have to send out a technician to fix it and that technician has to travel 100 miles both ways to do so. Telecommunications costs are invariably going to be more expensive in Canada than they are in the rest of the world and there's simply nothing anyone can do about this fact except move to a more populated population center if they want better service.","1304210138"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Harry knew plenty of stuff about his parents.  Most of it was lies when he was at his aunt and uncle's house, but he learned plenty of stuff right away once he got to Hogwarts.  Everyone tried to keep Luke's ancestry a secret, except the fact that his dad was a jedi.  Everything else about Luke's father was completely secret, including his identity, which was never kept from Harry even when he was growing up with the Dursleys.

What do you mean if ""Maybe if they were nice to Thomas riddle and snape the story would have never happened?""  That doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, considering it was the sole fact that Harry's mother opposed Voldemort that the story occurred at all.  It was the fact that Luke and Leia's father joined the bad guy, aka the Emperor/Senator Palpatine, that the story occurred.  If he had opposed the Emperor, Anakin Skywalker would have been killed, and Padme would probably have been hunted down before Leia and Luke were born, thus making the whole story of the original trilogy inexistent.  Oh, and Harry's father was only a bully to Snape, which was a contributing factor to him joining the Death Eaters.  Voldemort attended Hogwarts many years prior to Snape, Lilly and James attending Hogwarts.

The empire would have been created with or without Darth Vader's help. The only tools that Palpatine needed were the fact that the jedi attacked him and the clone army, neither of which Vader had anything to do with.

I'm guessing you mean that ""You first think that Luke would get LEIA but then she goes to Han?""  What the fuck does this have to do with anything?  If you're implying this is similar to the Harry, Ron and Hermione love triangle, you're missing the obvious clues that Rowling planted about the Hermione and Ron relationship from the very beginning of the series.

Your comparison between Dumbledore and Yoda makes no sense.  What, are you going to say that the plot of Karate Kid is the same as Star Wars just because Mr. Miyagi is a wise sage who teaches Daniel to fight like Yoda teaches Luke to fight?

No, there was a Wizard War.  The Jedi were systematically eliminated.  There are no major differences between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix aside from who they support.  The Jedi and Sith train in completely different sides of the force.  So to compare the First Wizarding War to the systematic extermination of the Jedi is completely ignorant.

Harry started learning magic at the age 11, when every other person in the wizarding world, muggle and wizarding family alike, begin to learn magic. He didn't start late.  Besides, there was never an established ""age"" of when people start learning about the force in the Star Wars movies either.  Yeah, the younglings were learning it in school on a single planet, but it was never stated that that was the norm.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, take people's word for it, there are plenty of spammers, and the only reason you can afford to call them ""nonexistant"" is because the admins spend plenty of time tweaking code to keep them out of the way, because many mods spend plenty of time making sure the spam filter is working as it should, and because some users diligently reports the few that get through the cracks.

&gt; I have yet to see a good definition of what ""Spam"" is on reddit.

Try the FAQ: http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam

&gt; Furthermore posting a link with a referral like say an amazon link is also not spam

It's not spam. It's in bad taste though. The community generally expects content to be posted because it's awesome, not because it's making you money. Original content creators tend to get a free pass on this one. Blogspam and affiliate links just tend to piss people off. I think those basically create a conflict of interest that ultimately would turn reddit into something more digg-like.

&gt; What I would suggest people report is the massive groups of ""censor people""

That probably falls under what the FAQ calls [""cheating""](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutescheating). There isn't a very good way for individuals to report cheating automatically, mostly because it's really hard for individual users to tell the difference between cheating and a regular mob of like-minded individuals.

Think about it. What actual evidence do you have that cheating is happening on any specific Fukushima story, beyond your disbelief that any rational, honest being could ever downvote them, and your belief that some people make a business out of cheating reddit?

Now, that doesn't mean cheating goes undetected or unpunished, but the only good place where it can happen is with the admins, since they have access to all sort of neat data and tools that allows to differentiate good votes from evil votes.

None of this is an exact science. It's really more like trench warfare. If you have ideas that could help move the front line by a few feet, please let folks know. There's an [/r/ideasfortheadmins](http://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins) subreddit that'd welcome those suggestions.","1304210159"

Thanks for lecturing me on correct english though. It is most appreciated, but rest assured that these are simply exhaustion related grammar/wording malfunctions. 

Concerning the question why I were asking You if You were one of their staff and saying how much they sucked. AFAIK I didn't. I have the reply screen here, so I don't have the full thread, but if my memory doesn't betray me I neither asked if You were staff nor stated that they sucked. Read. Thoroughly.

On the one hand I would never badmouth people behind their backs, especially if I know them, on the other hand, as You are hosting PandoraPress, I'd even consider You staff, at least technically. I'd say You're affiliated. Way to go, Mr.

Listen, please. Your posts read like fanboying. THIS.WILL.NOT.HELP. People smell fanboys from miles away. Defending obvious mistakes of the pandora team with invalid arguments will not help the pandora project. I've stated this before.

You have supported the availability of a fast tracking fee as being supported by the community. This is not the whole picture. The suggestion came from the project leaders. I f I remeber correctly it came from CraigX, but I might be wrong there. Who would not support collecting funds for assembly personnel after waiting for years on ditched shipment dates. I mean this is most certainly better than never getting the device that You already paid for because assembly is so slow with the team. But basically the solution is nothing more than a ransom under the given circumstances. the logic goes like ""Forfeit Your place in the queue or You might never get Your device"". Everybody notives, so You're not helping. Really.

I liked the project in the beginning, I disliked the turn it took and I was very disappointed about the further development, but thats life. Despite that, I still have made no attempt to reclaim my money because I'm a nice guy. But all that fanboying and hostility You display against the other redditors with other opinions (just remember the guy that bought a phone whom You lectured about missing knobs. I bet he knew that his phone had none.). Your behaviour is just outrageous. Maybe I should forward this thread to ED. Just apologize to the others, really. I don't mind myself, but please...stay classy.

Also I will not elaborate further on any internals of the pandora project or its development, as I would not deem this proper style, but I reserve correcting false or misleading claims of Yours.

If you have a bunch of time to spend going between the two look into the Regional (slow) weekend train pass. ""Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket samstags oder sonntags im Nahverkehr quer durch Deutschland! Ab 39,- Euro."". 39 euros for a group of five people to travel for a 24 hour period on all of the trains in Germany. 

You can purchase a sale ticket online  if you make your purchase minimum of 72 hours before your journey. However, the sale tickets are limited and under the policy of first come first serve, so it is best practice to purchase a sale ticket as soon as you know your travel dates. For domestic routes seat reservations are optional. In Germany, unlike France, more passengers are allowed on high speed trains then there is seat capacity. It will cost about 5 euros to guarantee a seat. If you are traveling during the summer or rush hour times and require a seat, it is best to pay the reservation fee In Germany it is possible to buy two types of bahncards, the bahncard 50 and the bahn card 25. These bahn cards reduce the rate of a normal price ticket by either 50 or 25 percent, bahncard 50 and 25 respectively. The bahncard 25 can be used to take an additional 25 percent of a sale ticket while a bahncard 50 has no effect on sale ticket's price. ","1304210206"

But, what about the case of a major movie?  A major motion picture costs a couple hundred million bucks to create these days, and a lot of time, effort, and resources go into making them.  Sure, the variable cost of duplication is very low, but the fixed costs are very high.  Compare the costs to that of a Snickers bar.  The actual cost of materials I might be taking are very small (pennies) but by not paying I am kind of screwing over all of the people who put the work in to making and delivering it to the store:  the stock boy who put it on the shelf, trucker who shipped it, inventory manager that ordered it, person who build the machine that put it in its wrapper, person who developed the product, people who advertised it.  All of that in miniscule amounts was unfairly deprived of those people when I took something that I  didn't pay for.

The main purposes of punishment/restriction is supposed to be either specific or general deterrent.  The punishment is supposed to either deter that individual person from doing that again, or else it is supposed to deter others from doing the same thing, by way of example of what may then happen to them.
That being said the issue is not if they remember what they did, the issue is how likely are they to do it again.  Removing their memory of what they did would probably not lower their predisposition to do it again.  Therefore, I think most people would say the person should be told what they did and restricted/punished accordingly.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Language is a bit harsh, but I agree (mostly) with the sentiment.  It becomes painfully obvious if you even think about it for 10 minutes that all of our vaunted ""social"" progress (including human rights, not just feminism) is a direct result of technological progress:  in short, harnessing fossil fuels to do the dirty/dangerous work that used to be done by animals, frequently male human animals referred to as ""slaves"".  What will happen when our access to free (and safe) energy disappears?

One point of criticism:  I don't think that women are any less critical to the survival of the species.  It's just that their function is different.  Sort of yin and yang.  The problem with feminism is that it (ironically) devalues the natural strengths of women, to the point that its message is that women should be like men (or at least, have access to the benefits traditionally accrued by men, without any of the responsibilities).  Someone needs to bear children, deal with the tedious details of raising toddlers, cook, sew, and organize the day-to-day social arrangements.  Feminists take these as ""demeaning"", but in prehistoric times, they were critical to survival, and not particularly easy.  (As an aside, one of the transformative experiences I've had is to take a weeklong introductory course on primitive survival, in the woods, and I will tell you that Western civilization takes for granted almost every little detail of survival that would be enormously difficult if done from scratch in the wilderness.  You want to sew?  Make a needle from bone and tan a hide after killing the animal and skinning it.  You wanna cook?  Start a fire, carve a pot out of a tree stump, find stones that won't explode when you put them in water, and find firewood that isn't poisonous).

You can tell someone isn't ready to have a partner in life if they can not make room for you in their normal day-to-day life. That's just the bottom line. If someone consistently picks things over you then they have no business being with you or anyone else for that matter. Relationships take 2. I hope you get some help, OP, and realize that not only do you deserve someone that will treat you right.. not everything bad that happens is your fault. You aren't thinking clearly. You should be able to determine when something is your fault or if something has nothing to do with you (like your situation now). Btw, deliriumzer0, ty I like your username too.","1304210273"

It's especially interesting to me given that your beliefs seem to parallel those of a friend of mine with whom I have regular discussions about religion.

He too is a Southern Baptist and while reading the first portion of your story, I realized that this friend is actually a fundamentalist. I find it to be extremely frustrating trying to have rational conversations with him about this stuff. It's nice to know there may still be hope for him when it comes to having him actually start seeing the world through his own eyes someday.

I've always doubted that I could ever talk any sense into him because his default rebuttal ""That just proves how awesome God is, you just have to have faith"". How do you have a rational debate when only one side is thinking rationally?

I've thought that it would be nice to help him 'see the light' as it were, but I'm honestly worried that I might succeed. Religion is such a huge part of his existence that I'd be worried at what losing it would do to his life.

I may ask him to give your story a read. He's an intelligent guy, which makes his denial of reality that much harder to swallow. Maybe your experience may encourage him to actually look for answers to questions instead of being content that it's all God's will.","1304210287"

I asked for the cream of broccoli soup, but what I received seemed to be the most burnt, solid, and sour tasting soup I have ever had. It wasn't much of a soup at all, more of a lump of wet casserole if I had to call it something.

I returned to the clerk with the soup and asked if she would take a look at it because I did not think it was edible. She agreed and threw it out and gave me a bag of chips and 2 cookies instead.

The point is that the girl who originally scooped the festering mass they called ""soup"" agreed with me that it was not edible. Why didn't she just tell me that they didn't have anymore cream of broccoli soup for me to choose a different soup or not to  have soup altogether?

* Is there any chance at all, no matter how slim, that the memory will ever come back?

* What kind of memory loss are we talking about? I don't know much about amnesia or the like, but from what I understand there are a few different kinds of memory loss. You could simply lose time like a black out or forget your name but still remember how to tie your shoes or you could be reset to zero as if you just came out of the womb.

* What exactly is the crime and it's details? For example if the crime is murder was it a crime of passion or a ritualistic slaying? Um... maybe a better ? would be how likely are the circumstances that prompted the crime to reoccur?

* How did the memory loss happen? The important part about this is was it self inflicted? Say if a madman buried someone alive and then took a drug to erase his memory to a time before he'd have any knowledge of it to ensure he couldn't give away the location.","1304210292"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Forget the movie stars, what about the movie production companies?

If a movie makes $200million - that has to cover the cost of making the movie in the first place (paying the talent, paying the crew, paying for locations, paying for equipment, paying for the props etc etc). Then it has to pay for the marketing, becasue if you don't tell people about a movie, no one is going to see it. So now this $200million is more like $50million. But that money doesn't just go into the pockets of the movie company owners. It goes into the production of other movies. Smaller arthouse movies that would otherwise wouldn't get made etc... One of problems is that as humans we aren't used to dealing with ""millions"" of anything. But if we stripped away the zeros, and a movie cost $100 to be made, and $50 to make some street flyers, and it only sold $200 worth of tickets. Then that $50 left over needs to be used to pay the upfront costs of making the next $100 movie. ","1304210324"

I find it remarkable that you are ok with keeping someone in jail without any formal criminal charge for 14 months on what legally should have been a civil matter -  and also don't see anything wrong with the legal process being hijacked by an old boy network.  The drug abuse and suicide were his own decisions but if you think justice was served here then you are either being willfully ignorant - or you have a very simple minded view on legal matters.

And yes - if something is not illegal by the law of the land (editorialising about it being a ""loophole"" is a bit more subjective than you would like to admit in this case) then you cannot be charged for it - neither can you be charged retroactively for something that is newly illegal.  Google ""ex facto law"" for how common a concept this is and why. Its in the US consitution and its also illegal in Canada. Nor *should* punishment be enacted retroactively. Nor should public servants bend or break the law as favours for friends - especailly on worse than dubious ""moral"" grounds.  I don't see drug analog laws (or their failings) being a good analogy - except for if you are using it to make an entirely rhetorical and emotional argument. 

You keep coming back to language like ""loop-hole"" or ""he deserved"" or ""he is not innocent"" which suggests you think that things you believe are immoral should be de facto illegal - despite the actual law on the subject. That's just simple minded moralising authoritarianism. To you ""guilt"" or ""innocence"" is hanging on something other than the law, precedent or process and you are fine with people stepping outside of these long established boundaries in order to ""punish"" the ""guilty"".

When I get these sensations, I know that I'm just about to fall asleep. I think this happens during the hypnogogic stage. If you can train yourself to control your feelings when this happens, you can sometimes catch yourself in the panic state, calm yourself down, understand that you're about to fall asleep, then have a lucid dream.

The biggest setback is the elevated heart rate and anxiety. It took me a long time to just think to myself ""get over it. it's happened before, nothing's wrong"". Once I started feeling that way, lucid dreaming has become easier.","1304210356"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I wasn't sure either, so I [hacked together a simulation in JavaScript](http://hell.student.utwente.nl/~maks/queues.html).

Turns out that if people are able to estimate exactly how long every line will take, then they can commit to the fastest queue from the start and the result will be just as good as using a single queue that is shared between all registers.

However, if people just join the shortest line (the one with the least people, regardless of how long each person will take) then they usually end up waiting longer, though the differences are fairly small.

Things change if we allow people to change to a line that's shorter than their current position. This tends to be better again than the first two cases, and I think this case is actually most realistic (i.e. people don't know exactly how long each line will take, but they're not going to stand in line when there's a free register available) so in reality the single queue is probably only a little faster, or even slower than using separate queues!

For completeness sake I also included a system where people are lined up ordered by increasing time, which minimizes the total waiting time, but this wouldn't work in practice because people don't want to give up their place.","1304210361"

Second item would be a linked belt with 1000 rounds. Reason for the Mk48 over the Mk46 is moving to the larger round. Plenty of power (a replacement (upgrade) for WWII and earlier .30-06, which could apparently go through 3 people before stopping), compact package for future use, and reliable design (the M249/FN Minimi is used in various forms by most Western militaries). One well-placed round could probably kill a human, so I'd probably be safe with the Mk48 and two 100-round pouches (one already on the gun, counting as one item). The 1000-round belt rather than the second pouch is so I have extra ammo to defend against future things/people trying to kill me, since I'm still stuck in the past.

Now, if I could have a fully loaded tactical vest as one item, I'd go for a [CQBR-equipped M4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Quarters_Battle_Receiver) (with an [Aimpoint CompM4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aimpoint_CompM4), and a lot of personally-selected stuff like a different buttstock, grip, lights, rear BUIS, etc and a SOPMOD rail system), with a vest/belt full of spare magazines (would need at least 10 30-round [PMAG](http://store.magpul.com/product/MAG210/3)s for the 100 Romans to give me a minimum of 3 rounds each).

Either way, I'm bringing as much ammo as physically possible (an entire truck full of loaded PMAGs/pouches would be ideal if not prohibited by the rules). Best case would be the loaded vest plus a backpack full of ammo.","1304210364"

Also, current tablets are woefully underspec'ed, CPU-wise, for doing what some people want to do with them.

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Okay, some info on chisels.

Here are 2 1/2"" chisels, my Marples and my Lie-Nielsen.  http://imgur.com/fh89w  The Lie Nielsen is shorter.

This is actually a positive for a general use bench chisel.  When you chop your dovetails, you hold the chisel like a pencil with your non-dominant hand.  The shorter, the easier it is to hold.  Personally, I almost never hold bench chisels by their handle.  Handles exist to give me something to hit with my mallet.  Marples:http://i.imgur.com/QeOof.jpg  LN: http://i.imgur.com/Evw01.jpg

Both are also bevel-edge chisels.  Note how big the edge of the marples is vs. the LN.  This lets you get in tighter on your dovetail tails without brusing them.  http://imgur.com/TaGXa

The other big difference is hardness.  A carpenter's chisel is softer to take more abuse.  A cabinetmaker's chisel is harder to take a keener edge.  Marples = soft. = Bad for cabinetmaking.

Now sharpening new chisels.  Here is my brand new 1/2"" Narex mortise chisel http://i.imgur.com/EVaSj.jpg  Mortise chisels are 1/2 chisel, 1/2 prybar, 100% frightening. 

Step 1.  Flatten the back.  Notice the perpendicular machining marks on the back.  http://i.imgur.com/linaY.jpg

I start with my DMT DuoSHARP coarse/fine.  Its purpose in my setup is for flattening the backs of new chisels and flattening my waterstones.  http://i.imgur.com/WlTBd.jpg

My middle stones are currently an Arkansas soft and an Arkansas hard.  I plan on replacing the two of them with 1 Shapton 5k.  Still working th at back: http://i.imgur.com/xjcQ2.jpg

Not shown: the arkansas hard, shapton 12k finishing stone, or working the bevel.  I sharpen freehand.  Also, flattening the back doesn't show technique.  I need both hands to do it right, but well, I need to snap a picture.

Is it sharp?  How do you know if it's sharp?  When you can pare END GRAIN PINE.  Yes, I pared with my mortise chisel.  Yup, it's razor sharp.  http://i.imgur.com/otVEb.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/J5qdL.jpg

How's that back look:  (note the difference between the business end and closer to the handle) http://i.imgur.com/Y74RC.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/r5Jo4.jpg

Finally, all my wood chisels.  Left to right:  Marples setup for cabinet work, my 3 LNs, 3 vintage bench chisels, 2 marples setup for rough carptentry, 3 black handled beaters for really rough work.  Second row: Mortise chisels (2 narex, 2 vintage) and a yellow handled Stanley that is crap.  I keep it just to lend out. :-)  http://i.imgur.com/hxBs4.jpg","1304210374"

Almost all crimes require a showing of intent with the very limited exception of a few negligent crimes.

It did not sound like you were being rejected because you were atheist, but because you were a very outspoken atheist. Do you think you would be able to get into a Biology program if you were very outspoken about how all of Biological research is complete garbage? Graduate programs do attempt to recruit classes that will be cohesive and functional, and it sounds like they thought you might not contribute to the cohesion. They could very easily be incorrect about this though, and if they are, just reapply next year after spending some serious time volunteering for church based organizations.

There honestly could have been other reasons for you not getting accepted as well. Do you know the mean and standard deviation on entry statistics like GPA and GRE scores? (I have some sort of background in philosophy, and I don't know of too many people who were accepted into grad school with much less than a 4.0 in philosophy undergrad coursework.) Often times grad schools will have some sort of a review of your packet, at least for internal use. Can you ask to see that?

"oklahoma","t5_2qtnt","x-post from a similar question a couple of days ago:

housing in Norman is really really cheap. I know Norman is ~40 miles to Tinker AFB so that might be a problem. But as an example:

For 429 a month you can share an apartment that has 2 beds and 2 baths.

The 429 a month includes all utilities (30$ electric cap) and wireless internet that averages about 5-7 Mbps down and 1 Mbps up.

The apartment complex matches you up with a roommate and ONLY you are on the lease, so if your roommate flakes or breaks shit, he/she is charged, not you.

There is also a 4 bedroom variant. 4 bed 2 bath for 319 a month. Same everything about above though.

Its The Commons On Oak Tree. Its an okay place, but it is like the cheapest place in Norman.

If you could say how much you are looking to spend a month I could give a somewhat decent list of apartment complexes in Norman and rank them in order of niceness.

Anything outside of Norman though I do not know anything about.

If the post above was all incoherent and a little all over the place, forgive me, I am in the middle of a huge assignment.

Coupled with the soft sticky tyres that they need so that the car actually moves instead of just wheelspinning at nigh-on idle, it's not elegant to watch. The best cars for rc drifting are electric powered as the throttle response is instantaneous. The video shown to you as an example wasn't very good, in this regard. Actually... most of the videos of it aren't. They have to be choppily edited because if the focus of attention isn't crashing, something in the background is. It's tough on driver skill, but any flaws in the equipment soon show up as well, and the crashes can virtually render the chassis unusable in some cases.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","No one in this situation is a wizard who can cast a magic spell to kill the bad guys and only the bad guys. It's not like anyone captured his kids and then executed them for the hell of it, they were accidentally killed because they were in close proximity to a leader of violent forces in a war. If he didn't want his kids to die then why didn't he send them somewhere that's not a war zone?

War is hell, bad shit happens to people who don't deserve it, like these kids. That's why we try to avoid it. But a dictator gunning down unarmed protesters in the street is even worse than war. Are we just not going to go to war with anyone ever no matter what fucked up shit they are up to? If that's your position then I guess that's your choice but if you accept that war is ever necessary in any situation then I don't really see how this is something to be horrified about.

It's like in children's fiction where the good guy murders his way through hordes of minions and then when he gets to the top bad guy he says ""if I killed you I would be just as bad as you"". What do you think is going to happen to the children of Gaddafi's soldiers that we're killing with no outcry whatsoever? The lives of dozens of thousands of children are going to be fucked up pretty bad as a direct result of this war, and MANY will be killed. Is that an acceptable casualty? If it is, then why are the deaths of these children of a dictator not acceptable?

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","My day is sheer insanity, but that's totally a result of working in a batshit clinical + academic combo program. My boyfriend is working on his Master's in computational linguistics and seems to have a lot more free time than me just because he doesn't have the clinical component to deal with. 

So with that said, it will really depend on your program and luck of the draw with how taxes your classes/commitments are in a given semester. Your program might have the luxury of starting you out easy (or never getting to such a crazy point in the first place). Talk with some older students and see what their experiences are like. 

If you're doing all your work and are sure you're completing any other non-academic parts of the program (i.e. do you need volunteer/extracurricular involvement? Do you need to complete so much of your research project by a given year?), then you're fine. Count yourself lucky and enjoy it. ","1304210441"

So far it seems, that is a *very* tough sell.  There are caveats to this plan, namely people have to pay higher taxes.  If the people were smart they would leverage a good proportion of that tax on the insanely wealthy, tax financial transactions, tax capital gains as income, and simplify the tax code in general so the revenue would be predictable and consistent enough to fund these plans.  Obviously the middle class would have a higher tax rate to contribute to such a plan, but the amount we would pay extra would be a hell of a lot less than all the cash we dump on privatized health care and tuition rates right now.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There are two parts to this:

I definitely wouldn't call it fundamentalists vs Ahmadinejad. It's the other way around. From what I saw in Iran, it was the fundamentalists who supported him. Maybe they feel that he isn't doing enough as some Dems feel with Obama, but he has their support for the most part, with his comments about Israel and the US aiding that. Would I say there is an ideological element to the power struggle? Yes. While the fundamentalists support the heavy influence of religion in the government and want to keep the Islamic state of the country, a lot of people are tired of the theocracy and want a secular government. The power/influence of religion in government is the main ""ideological element"" dividing the country in my opinion. However, with that being said, there are many strong Muslims in the country who also don't like the government, for they feel that their actions are unislamic and further hurt the reputation of Islam. It's a complex matter.

As far as Ahmadinejad goes, that's somewhat true. Like others have pointed out, he isn't the one pulling the strings, so not all of the burden of the regime's actions fall on him. However, with that being said, many are against his economic policy, and feel that he is too concerned with foreign policy to take care of things at home. Also, while some like yourself like his criticisms of the west, others feel that he's full of shit when he speaks. The whole ordeal with the Holocaust was disgraceful, and on top of that, he's infamous among Iranians for lying. If he's good at anything, it's at lying to the point that anyone listening to him is left speechless.

"Liberal","t5_2qxt5","I think some of the commenters need to keep in mind that capitalism is a reactionary model; graft can only be fixed, not prevented. There also seems to be a presumption that monopolies are no longer a problem and that current businesses that control key markets wouldn't band together to maximize profit (as has occurred with the effectually unregulated OPEC) if regulations were quickly disbanded. Similarly, the fact that the current status quo (in terms of wages, safety standards, sanitation, health benefits, etc...) is primarily enforced by government regulations and bureaus (esp. OSHA) seems to go unheeded. There also seems to be a bit of the ""Perfect World"" fallacy in regards to the intelligence of business owners; if a large enough group of businesses (which are controlled by imperfect beings) reduced the costs expended on such measures as wages, sanitation, and the like (whether through a collective and organized effort on the part of businesses that had the reduction of such costs as it's goal or through a mass of independent businesses with flawed reasoning, ""bandwagon"" ideology, or ignorance relating to the rules of the free market model), the free market (as a reactionary model) would be unlikely to bring wages back up, and would tend instead towards the new standard (especially considering the increased profit motive. Extraneous factors (such as job localization and willingness of employees to find work anywhere in times such as a recession) are rarely addressed.

Finally, even when one of these factors is addressed, none of these factors seem to be addressed together. Say a large group of businesses banded together and collectively reduced wages. Would prices of food go down to accommodate this development (as was the solution proposed in the comments thread)? Possibly (assuming that the supply wasn't overly demanded, a separate issue). Now say food distributors had formed a trust; would this trust have any substantial motive to bring prices down? No other substantial businesses would exist to undercut their prices. Instead of losing profit by decreasing prices for everyone, why not gain profit by reducing the amount of supply harvested and attempt to simply feed those would still had enough money to purchase the goods?

The free market is a practical system and modern governmental regulation certainly contains unnecessary graft and certainly could use modification. Those are fair enough premises. However, the conclusion that this means governmental regulation should be eliminated doesn't really logically follow. At least to me (an ardent liberal), it seems better to focus on improving our current system in an attempt to gain the benefits from both and the negatives from neither instead of settling for the benefits and potentially substantial negatives from only one.

Eventually he cuts you in half and you die. Being a dream, blood loss isn't an issue. You just hobble around the locked mall for hours, panicking as you realize that there's no escape.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","You're right to say, I think, that rape is more likely to be about the psychological wants or needs of the rapist, not the rapist's attraction to the victim. But let's not get too comfortable diagnosing this man's brain based on so little evidence. For example, why did he message her after so many years? Was he trying to relive the thrill of making her feel vulnerable, of ""controlling"" her? Maybe. Then again, he said he hasn't had much luck with women, maybe he's just lonely; she could be the only woman he's slept with, and he may have convinced himself that he has a chance. There's a very good chance this guy has some mental health issues as well. Asperger's Syndrome (which as far as I'm aware is not severe enough to get you acquitted of a crime) can make it difficult to comprehend the effect your actions have on others. The point is, who knows? We don't know the guy. He could be crazy, he could be malicious, he could be blinded by selfishness, loneliness, or self-pity, he could be legitimately contrite but too socially incompetent to do it properly.

**Kapsize** [purple]

The label with the purple sound. Joker set up this label in 2008 and although there aren't many releases they were certainly influential in the shaping of the ""Bristol"" sound.

**Night Slugs** [UK Funky]

Possibly more Future Garage than Dubstep, Night slugs is a relatively new label with some quality releases. Their sound is synth heavy with sparse 808 kicks and snares and some 4/4 beats. For more information than you could possibly ever need on their tunes (seriously) check out this [blog](http://rougesfoam.blogspot.com/2011/01/artl-night-slugs.html).

They are hardly a strictly dubstep label, but their sound is as progressive as it gets.

**Planet Mu** [IDM/FG/deep]

One of the quintessential IDM labels. Started in the mid-1990s by [Mike Paradinas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1Ja_IZaIQY), in the 2000s Planet Mu has had a hand in dubstep by marketing artists such as Distance, iTAL tEK and Vex'd. More recently expanded to juke/footwork/ghettotech and the UK Funky scene.

**Punch Drunk** [deep/purple/FG]

Punch Drunk is another essential link in the Bristol axis. Founded by [Peverelist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHVWaZVoPhs), the label has been pushing the dub, jungle and techno-influenced sound of people like himself, RSD and Pinch since 2006. It is also home to two of the developers of the purple sound, Gemmy and Guido. Recently transitioning to a more Future Garage aesthetic. Their compo ""Worth the Weight"" released last year is a very recommendable tour of the Bristolian bass music scene.

**Rottun** [heavy]

Rottun Records is a label owned and started by Excision which encorporates very heavy ""robot"" style basslines, described by wikipedia as ""...influence from the morphing basslines of drum and bass, the aggressive energy of heavy metal, and the laid back vibes of hip hop.""
Here are some examples of what I am talking about.

**Skull Disco** [deep/ethnic] [no longer in existence]

Created by Appleblim and Shackleton in 2005 essentially to release some of their 12-inchers. Dark themes, minimalistic sounds and metal-influenced imagery. Credited with dubstep's initial crossovers to the techno scene, given its association in 2006 to Ricardo Villalobos.

It's true that if you are moving very fast *relative to some observer*, you might see an interval of 1 light year where that observer sees 10. But the situation is symmetric. In the direction opposite to your motion, you'll see 10 light years while the observer sees 1. It's simply not meaningful to talk about observations in relativity unless they're... well, *relative* to some observer, and that's for precisely this reason.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Etale cohomology is an essential tool in modern algebraic number theory.  I am not a number theorist, so maybe someone else can elaborate, but major results like the Weil conjectures and Fermat's Last Theorem depend heavily on using it to understand geometric properties of algebraic varieties.  See two questions at mathoverflow: [Etale cohomology -- Why study it?](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/6070/etale-cohomology-why-study-it) and [Applications of etale cohomology](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/16195/applications-of-etale-cohomology) for discussion.

Of course, if you're asking from the perspective of an engineering student or biologist or something like that, this answer is bound to disappoint you.

&gt;Almost all crimes require a showing of intent with the very limited exception of a few negligent crimes. If you can convince a court that you didn't intend to counterfeit money, but that you did it accidentally, you probably won't be convicted of counterfeiting. However, most people don't have epileptic fits that cause them to counterfeit money, so you're unlikely to prevail on that defense.

Sadly it seems that Battlefield 3 won't be including a DirectX 9 option either when that's released on PC later this year either (or at least they won't 'support' it), even know they'll be making it work on the Xbox 360. I assume it's either to force adoption to make developing for less renderers easier or for less hassled development, even though BF:BC2 (Frostbite 1.5 vs BF3's Frostbite 2.0) supported all DirectX 9, 10 and 11.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Are you applying a personal income tax to a discussion about corporate taxes? If so, please stop. Instead, show me the highest business tax rate.

A 90% business tax rate is gigantic, and would probably cause a stock market crash. Why? Well, let's look at Chevron for an example.

[Chevron's market cap is approximately $220B.](http://www.google.com/finance?q=chevron)  Last year, their [income before tax](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:CVX&amp;fstype=ii) was approximately $32B. With a 90% tax, their net income after taxes would be $3.2B. If all of that money goes straight to dividends (unlikely), the investors will have made a 1.45% return on their money.

In other words, they would be better off selling their stock and putting their money in US Treasury bonds, or overseas stocks with lower taxes. And investors would do it in a heartbeat.

So congratulations, moogle. You've just suggested a business tax rate that would cause the next Great Depression. Unless, and I hope I'm right about this, you're mixing up personal income taxes with corporate income taxes. Are you?","1304210576"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","It's just a matter of me having a good time playing him this way. With Mandreds and his W every attack does 10% of their health in magic damage and with his Q and the Phantom Dancers he has 2.5 attacks per second with a fairly long range when you activate his W which is up most of the time with CDR.  
I use Void ooze for an escape mechanism most of the time and shoot it down the path that I am running away instead of at the target, I have frozen mallet for chasing. His ult has a low AP ratio in my opinion compared to the damage I can put out with fast attacks, basically 240 + 45% of your AP against champs and it's avoidable if they know what they are doing so I generally use that for it's reveal mechanic and not much else.  
For his W you can get 1% for each 100 AP meaning you can double it's effectiveness at 600 AP. It is much easier to get 100% increased attack speed and attack twice as fast to double it's effectiveness meanwhile you are also doubling his attack damage in the same way so I might as well build some AD to better that.  
That is my reasoning behind it.

"travel","t5_2qh41","Street vendors in Beijing are quite pushy. ""Wo bu yao"" means ""i don't want"" (can't remember the actual pinyin spelling). You'll say it a lot. 

Avoid the tea scam. Be very cautious of this. Also beware of rickshaw drivers who get ""lost"" and ask for more money. Pickpockets run rampant, so keep your eye on your pocket, and don't keep valuable shit in your backpack.

Slang for Yuan is Kwai (it's like ""bucks"").

As far as what you should see. DO NOT MISS the forbidden palace. Seriously. It's so fucking amazing, and you can explore it for days if you have the days to spare. If you decide to do the great wall, go outside of Beijing to get to the old parts of the wall. It's quite a hike though. I was shattered after hiking across 30 towers. Well worth it.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Just a few months back I was bumbling about on Reddit, asking if this kind of thing was possible. Most people said 'yeah i know an old guy at work he doesn't have a degree'. Stuff like that. I don't have a degree but was constantly job hunting.

I was turned down most of the time, sometimes I wasn't even considered when they found I did not have a degree. PR of companies would say, ""Sorry, a bachelor's in compsci is necessary. We will not consider applicants without one.""

However, just a couple weeks ago, I struck gold it seems. I was offered a job, flown 1000 miles from home for an interview, and they accepted me. They paid my moving expenses to move out there. Now I'm at a job that not only I got without a degree, but so far actually *love* doing. It's a programming job, in my absolute favorite language, and it pays well enough for me to rent a cabin and live on my own. I move in to my place tomorrow from this hotel I've been in forever.

I'm 21 now, and I've been looking on and off since I was 19 or so. If you love what you do (you *have* to be passionate), are competent, and have **persistence**, then yes, you can get a job. You won't have as good of a chance as the same guy with that [often] overrated degree, but there are sane employers out there who will consider applicants for who they are and what they have to show, and not what their education section of what their resume says.

**EDIT**: It took extra long for me to find a job because the kind of development job I was looking for was somewhat specific. While beggars can't be choosers, I refused to be employed for a job [like webdev or anything java] that I can't use my most honed knowledge for [whatever I rant about [here](http://symbo1ics.com/blog/)].

The only reason I have found it helpful is being able to use parenthesis to force order of operations, build and perform math with matrices, and find roots of polynomials.  My friends who own a TI-89 like it because it can integrate for them, which is NOT helpful when you are trying to build calculus skills.  

Some courses do not allow calculators, or only allow non-graphing calculators during exams (so those of us who do not own a scientific calculator are screwed).  I know it's tempting to get the fancy TI-89 or some other extreme graphing calculator, but you will find that you only use several of the hundreds of functions that the calculator is capable of.  Plus, if a professor happens to demonstrate how to use a certain function, most likely he or she will use a 83 or 84, and the 89 people have to figure it out themselves.

There is no indication that Dany *ever* physically enjoys intercourse with Drogo.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You did your best to just give facts, but the post still came across as biased.  You tried to blame it on the friend and take a little bit of responsibility, but the fact of the matter is you blew it big time.  I'm wondering if you are trying to justify your actions to your BF and deflect the blame or if you have taken full responsibility for your actions?

It doesn't matter what your friend did, it matters what you did and you participated in flirting with another man, not stopping his advances like you think you did and not removing yourself from the situation like you should have.  

Texting is a crappy way to communicate with your BF.  This needs to be talked out.  If he can't talk to you right now then accept that and don't contact him until he is ready.  If he doesn't want to continue with the relationship then accept it and move on.  Learn your lesson and never do this again.

Trust is not something you are entitled to, nor will you regain it over night.  Trust is something that is earned through actions.  Responsibility is a good place to start.  Transparency with your actions and events.  Communication.  No relationship will survive if two people can not communicate their problems.  Honestly, I won't be surprised if your relationship doesn't last.  He is already sleeping at a friend's house and you two aren't communicating and blaming the struggles on a busy schedule.

If you're making money say, as a contractor for a company, then the company will report your income and then you might want to deduct stuff.

However, if you're making money under the table.. well, lets just say it isn't as important to deduct stuff.

How will the IRS audit you for not paying taxes, if they do not know you're making money to begin with? Not to imply anything illegal. Just that how your income is reported matters a lot in the big picture.

Keep in mind, the gov will not give you money if you deduct more than you make, so deducting is pointless if you're living off of scraps as an inspiring artist (novelist in this case). All that will happen in the end is an audit. I always make sure I write off less than I make. Even $1 in taxes is tons better than $0 in taxes when you run your own business.","1304210642"

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","This attack mechanism isn't unique to p2p/linux -- note most apt upgrades are done via http.

When remote exploits become apparent all an attacker needs is a list of IP addresses that have some reasonable possibility of having linux on them running the affected service in the unsecure state.  Just because you are installing a security upgrade, doesn't mean you are necessarily vulnerable (e.g., you have openssh installed but not running on port 22 or its behind a VPN/firewall, etc).  Also since you are in the process of upgrading, the vulnerability will be often fixed in a matter of seconds giving a very narrow attack window.

More likely than not every website you visit you are telling them that your IP address is running linux and the particular distro in their server logs with a line like this (but with your actual IP address instead of 127.0.0.1):

    127.0.0.1 - - [30/Apr/2011:20:43:12 -0700] ""GET / HTTP/1.0"" 200 1813 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.16""

Or you downloaded the ubuntu iso via p2p or a mirror somewhere, or someone monitored traffic and saw you downloading the update.  (Apt updates are normally done publically through http not https).  You shouldn't think you have security just because someone doesn't know you are running a certain OS.","1304210649"

If there is a chance for you to find anything in this world that you can put your energy towards, then please do so. I'm not sure where you served, but the military has the tendency to find people like you, and do this to them.

everyone is going to tell you to quit drinking, and see a psychologist, or join a church, because it worked for them, all this advice just forgets the fact that the first thing you have to do is admit that you still have the will to change the world around you, and by that act of introspection where you find a calling again, you will have transformed yourself into a new individual who can move forward with your goals, it will be slow, but it's better to be moving towards something than nothing at all if this is where you have come to rest.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","i was going fishing with my dad last weekend up in the moors. We turned the corner just as a land rover (big SUV) and a small car had a head on collision. My dad's a doctor so he pulled over and told me to stay in the car (I'm 18, but I'd be totally useless in first aid) so I phoned an ambulance to get there. The land rover was pretty smashed up but nothing compared to the other car. It had 3 lads in it, 1 died on the scene. The car was so bent out of shape and in a huge ditch that my dad couldn't open the door so I had to go down to the car with him to smash the window open. I still shake when I think about it all. The guy in the passenger seat was clearly dead. He had cuts all over his neck and arms and his head and chest were destroyed. We could see the driver was still alive but unconscious and at the time we only thought there were 2 people in the car because the back seat was crushed in on itself. I had to pull a fence pole out of the ground to smash the window of the driver side open so that my dad could get at him to help him out. After I broke the window I saw a guy's leg hanging out from between the ceiling of the car and the floor where the gearstick was. The car had been bent down the centre widthways and the guy who was sitting in the back had trapped his legs which I later found out had to be amputated but he survived. I had to leave because it was terrifying so I went to see if the guy in the SUV was okay. Once the air ambulance arrived they dealt with the scene further and we made our reports to the police and left. It turns out that the car was one of 4 cars with mates that were going on a stag weekend fishing where I was going with my dad. They were racing and the driver of the car behind the small car which was involved in the crash is likely to be prosecuted for encouraging the dangerous driving. The driver later died in hospital, the passenger died at the scene and the guy in the back seat is currently in a coma. I'm shaking because it terrifies me still to write about it.","1304210684"

Even if mutation or selective breeding could eventually achieve the same results as gene splicing (and given infinite time mutation could do it but selective breeding alone could not) it does not mean they are the same thing.

Gene splicing on the other hand introduces genes and creates traits that where not there originally. 

BTW I don't have a problem per se with GMO products / gene splicing, I think it is cool as hell. It's the corporations I don't trust.

If most women don't have anything to say that's worth listening to, it's only misogyny if it's not true.

Just as if I were to say ""men suck at getting pregnant"" it isn't misandry because it is quite true.

So the question to ask is whether women tend to have anything to say that's worth listening to.  For roosh, such a woman may be rare.  Personally, I meet them every once in a while, but much less often than I meet men with something worthwhile to say.  Them's the breaks.

Admitting that there are a lot more men out there than women who can teach me anything doesn't make me a misogynist.

Perhaps it's partially due to the fact that so many women are coddled from birth and never expected to do anything for themselves, for the most part.  Who's fault is that?

CO2 has been fluctuating WILDLY for 4 billion years and it has never gone out of control irreversibly: there is not a lot of reason to believe it is an unstoppable feedback loop.  Look through the CO2 concentration data, it has been at higher concentrations than this in the atmosphere before in teh earth's history.

&gt;But that's correct. Bear in mind my entire point is that there is a difference between things you or I think are legitimate and things that people who will hold us accountable to our actions think are legitimate. If you commit an act that is not established as ""rape"" by the law, then you will not be charged for rape. I fail to see any sort of ambiguity there.

There is no ambiguity, there is the continued irrational claims or irrelevant claims you are making.  The presence of disagreement between people on what constitutes ""legitimate"" ownership or ""legitimate"" rights of control, does not mean that the action meanings behind such acts as ""rape"" did not take place.  Rape is not a concept that rests with or depends on what a group of individuals calling themselves ""the state"" consider to be illegal or legal sexual behavior, and it not a concept that rests with what a democratic majority calling themselves ""the electorate"" consider to be illegal or legal sexual behavior.  Indeed, it does not depend on groups or laws at all.  

Rape is a concept that rests with and depends on the *individual consent* of those involved in a sexual interaction.  Individual consent is what establishes whether or not rape is being practiced.  Not the law, not what the majority believe, not on anything else.  It is and only is a matter of individual consent.  If an individual does not give their consent to sexual interactions with another individual or individuals, and the other individual or individuals physically force the other into having sexual relations, in this case it is intercourse, then rape has been committed.  A rational law on rape would recognize rape to be non-consensual sexual intercourse and would consider it to be ""illegal.""  If there is some location of land, with a number of individuals inhabiting it, and there is a group in that population who impose their rule on everyone, dictatorial or democratic it doesn't matter, and this ruling group does not recognize rape (the way most of us correctly, thankfully, understand it) to be wrong, then that doesn't mean rape is not being committed when one individual forces intercourse on another against their consent.  It just means that group in charge are so stupid and so irrational that they don't recognize it to be wrong such that it should be stopped.

&gt;Actually, yes it does. This is why slaves weren't able to seek legal recourse. It may not mean that you automatically agree with their servitude, and that's fine-- people like you or I who disagreed with it regardless of what it was called, for whatever arbitrary reason, are the people who made slavery suddenly a rights issue.

Your conception of rights is still way off.  You should have fixed your mind by now.  But you still need to be educated on this matter, so I will correct you once again.  The fact that slaves were not able to seek legal recourse from those in the state, or, in other words, they could not ask the monopoly user of violence to use violence against the slave's masters to stop them from using violence against the slaves, does not mean that the slave's individual rights were not being violated.  Rights are not granted by a group of individuals who have monopoly authority to use violence, i.e. the state.  The state is just a group of individuals who happen to hold a monopoly of violence over a given geographical territory.  If you say that rights are granted by the state, then you are just saying that rights are granted by those who successfully enforce their own monopoly of violence in a particular geographical region.

Rights are not established by violence.  Rights are established by reason.  A group of people who call their interactions a community or country, and they recognize and understand the rational foundation of rights, and practice respect for private property, willingly and of their own recognizance, is a group of people who have established for themselves a rational system of rights that coincide with the logically presupposed rights inherent in human life.

It doesn't matter if there is, in some far off land, a group of individuals who have declared themselves rulers over this community, and it doesn't even matter if 51% of the individuals in the community support the actions of the violent group of individuals in the far away land.  If that violent group were to steal from, or initiate violence against anyone in this community where there exists individuals who willingly and voluntarily respect each other's property, then that doesn't mean their rights have been taken away such that the entire concept of ""rights"" are no longer rationally founded and no longer logically presupposed.  It just means their rights has been VIOLATED by others.  The whole concept of rights recognizes the existence of violence and violent people.  That's one of the major reasons and explanations as to why the concept of ownership is implied in every socio-economic system imaginable.  If resources were infinite, then theft wouldn't even be a rational concept.  It would not even exist.  If someone is controlling something, and someone else forcefully takes it away, then it won't matter because the ""victim"" can just take whatever he needs from the infinite pool of resources.

Even theft logically presupposes the exact same private property ownership framework I have been talking about above.  For if someone steals, it must mean that they are declaring for themselves the sole right to control what they steal.  If they didn't, if they would immediately lose whatever they stole to someone else who steals from them, then they wouldn't steal from the first person.  

A ""right"" is a logically implied concept that can be rationally established by inquiring into the reality of human interactions.  It is not created by men with guns.  It is not a social convention.  It is not arbitrary.  A right is what I call an absolute contingency, namely, it absolutely follows from the reality of human life, which is itself not an absolute, but a contingency.

As long as humans *act*, humans will always have rights.  Rights will cease to be a rational concept if humans were to ever to become non-contingent, immortal, and lived in a world of infinite resources.  Rights will cease to be rational because there would no longer be any necessary requirement of an ownership framework.

&gt;No. I hope that settles that.

Government regulation, which you support, violates private property rights.  It's not settled because your position is not consistent.

&gt;You're right! However, it's not silly to deny the propositions that you are of the opinion are logically presupposed, when you don't provide evidence. 

It is silly to *deny* a proposition that is absent of evidence.  It is not silly to withhold judgment until such evidence is explicitly presented.

&gt;Bear in mind that you must show that ownership is logically presupposed, not mere control, which I have already established is different.

If you act to establish control over an object, and the object is either directly taken by you from a piece of land that has not been actively homesteaded by another, or it is an object that has been produced by either yourself or someone else who has voluntarily transferred total control of it over to you, (all these are action concepts by the way), then that is just another way we say that you have (legitimate) ownership over it.

Sure, an individual can vocally declare that he has the argumentative right to control something, and he could even act on that declaration.  The concept of ""ownership"" is just one that separates unjust declarations of the right to control versus unjust declarations of the right to control.  

A framework of what is considered just and unjust rights of control is a framework that every single conceivable socio-economic system contains.  This is because physical resources are scarce, meaning humans are capable of denying consumption or access to resources from other humans, such that other humans cannot simply tap into an infinite supply of resources to replace what has been denied from them by another.  Resources are not infinite, which means a system of rules and principles of the rights to control objects is inevitable and inherent in every single socio-economic system.  This will be the case as long as humans would, if asked, desire to have or consume more resources than what happens to be accessible at the time and circumstance.

Thus, since all conceivable socio-economic systems must contain a system of rules and principles concerning the rights of control to resources and objects.  The necessary requirement of principles of rights to control resources means that the general concept of rights to control is inherent in human life on Earth.  It cannot be ""escaped"" so to speak.  This requirement of a framework of rights of control is what we rationalist philosophers call ""ownership.""  

Each socio-economic system can of course differ in terms of the precise rules and principles of ownership, but the concept of ownership itself is ubiquitous.  It follows from the facts of human life on Earth.
 
Thus, we call the concept of ownership ""natural"", meaning it is a part of objective reality that is humans vis a vis the physical world.

You just prefer a system of rules and principles of ownership that differ from those in anarcho-capitalism.  But what you need to realize is that because the logical presupposed rights of controlling yourself, and controlling whatever you use to communicate to others, if at least the area of land upon which you stand while communicating, are always present with any proposition concerning property, ownership, rights to control, etc, it means that a (perhaps non-intended) framework of individual (i.e. private) ownership of self and (portions of) the external world is presupposed.  

One cannot merely say that physical control is presupposed.  The reason why the logical presupposed physical control rises up to logically presupposed ownership, is because one, all socio-economic systems require a framework of ownership, as discussed, and two, the fact that the same individualist rights to control framework is presupposed every single time any proposition concerning ownership or property, indeed any argument at all, is advanced, means that, upon closer inspection, individual private property becomes the (presupposed) framework of ownership in a reality where individual humans interact and communicate with one another.

This presupposed individual private property framework is of course exactly identical for every individual in the world who acts and who interacts with other people.  You often mistake this logical presupposition for social convention, imposed laws, and whatnot.  But it doesn't matter what the convention or laws happen to be.  The private property framework is always presupposed in human life.

It is of course possible to consciously select and act upon a different framework of ownership.  But every time anyone tries to act on such a framework, one that is different from the one that is logically presupposed, namely self-ownership and private property ownership, that person will not be acting (and thus thinking) logically.  When an individual does not think or act logically, objective reality will ""punish"" him, so to speak.  Any individual or group of individuals who try to act in practicing an ownership system different from ownership of self and ownership of private property, must act to forcefully deny the logically presupposed ownership framework for individuals that try to act on the logical ownership framework.  That is the only way individual self-ownership and individual private property can be ""overruled"", so to speak.  The only way any other social system (i.e. any system other than individual self-ownership and individual private ownership) can be practiced is thus by negation.  Thus every ownership system other than ownership of self and ownership of private property, are not actually positive systems in themselves, but rather they are all just negations of ownership of self and of private property.  

So we just say the individual ""owns"" himself and his private property because such an ownership framework is always presupposed in human society.  It is really just trying to argue semantics when you refuse to call it ownership, and instead call it something like ""existence of sole control"", or ""social convention that happens to be about the practice of respecting and enforcing private property,"" or whatever.

The private property ownership framework is the only ownership framework that is both consistent with the reality of human action in the physical world, (i.e. it is logical) and capable of being practiced (i.e. empirically valid).

&gt;Convention, yes. Arbitrary, no. Every society's convention on ownership rights and legitimate authority grows organically on the basis of a lot of deliberate conditions.

When I said arbitrary, I didn't mean it is imposed by God or some other unknown force that no human is responsible for such that people all of a sudden find themselves in a particular ownership system.  When I said arbitrary, I did not mean that it is not a product of human action.  Of course it is a product of human action and of course any positive system at a given time is a function of whatever ideas and values most people have such that you can say ""this"" is ""the"" ownership system ""they"" practice.

When I said arbitrary, I meant that what hold that the question of what you would call the ""right"" or the ""correct"" ownership framework, is whatever prevalent ownership framework happens to exist.  There is allegedly no rationally founded ownership framework that can be said to be ""right"" or ""correct"" *independent* from whatever ownership framework happens to exist at the time the question is asked.  Whatever ownership framework happens to be present, that *is* the correct ownership framework.

There was a large number of teenagers hanging around the counter, probably waiting for their friends to get off work. Anyways, this buzzer on the wall right above our table was going off randomly.  I asked them if they would turn it off, the kids told me there was nothing they could do and it just did that randomly.  Well I go back to my table and the buzzer just starts buzzing like crazy and the kids back there are all laughing.  They are obviously messing with us and I get ticked off.  Well, I am a big guy, so I stand up in the booth and tear the fixture out of the wall and present it too the kids behind the counter. I tell them that i fixed it temporarily and their manager will need to look into a long term solution.  I then finish my burger in silence and leave about 5 minutes later.

When I was done eating, I went into the restroom to pee and discovered a bunch of dead roaches all over the floor.  They looked as if someone had stepped on them, so I can only assume that the employees simply killed them and didn't give enough of a fuck to clean them up.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Ok I've just downloaded all the suggestions here plus a 4th one. All of them are free.

PCM Recorder - Very clear recording. Though it only has a Record and Stop button, there is no pause or resume button. Adjustable recording quality. No recording time limit.

Hi-Q MP3 (Lite)- Very very clear recording. Also no pause or resume button. As someone else says there is a nag dialogue box everytime you open it to upgrade. Also, to view your list of songs you have to use the menu button, not convenient compared to the list that appears onscreen for the other apps. Adjustable recording quality. 10 min recording limit for this free version.

Hertz - No pause or resume button. Couldn't tell if the quality was clear or not because once I recorded something it gave me no option to view it, and there was no menu button. I deleted it immediately and still don't know where that damn recording went. 

Tape-A-Talk - Clear recording, but not as clear as the others. However it has a pause and resume button which is very handy. Also, once you have finished recording and saved it, you can also add more recording to that same file. Adjustable recording quality. No recording time limit.


Ok so my verdict is, in terms of clarity Hi-Q MP3 blows the others away. But it is annoying in that you have to open menus rather than have things onscreen, If I decide on this one, I will upgrade to the full version to avoid the nag screen and make the recording time unlimited. The Tape A Talk has the most convenience and ease of use plus the pausing and add-to-recording feature is awesome.

So for me, it's between Hi-Q MP3 and Tape-A-Talk. I'm going to wait and see if Hi-Q MP3 adds a pause button, since all the reviewers are demanding one as well, because then I will choose that one.","1304210764"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I appreciate the edit, but I still disagree that feminism has to always be the opposite of like chill and relaxed. It's this kind of sentiment that makes me feel like I should be ashamed to call myself a feminist. People always react based off of their assumptions that feminism automatically equals constant anger and whining.

I didn't mean to call anyone anti-feminist necessarily, and I apologize if it came off that way. But there are definitely notions floating around that imply you can't be a feminist if you like girly things. Again, this is something that I, as a self-titled feminist, detest. I can be super girly and I love it. Being feminine or masculine has barely anything to do with feminism... actually that's a lie. But it is related in the sense that feminism allows people to be feminine or masculine depending on preference, and not restricted by sex.

I'll agree that a stampede of silly posts could upset people. But that's why we have the downvote option :) I just don't want to feel like I can't post here because I call myself a feminist or just because I like discussing girly thing but not 100% of the time. If I were to even mention that I'm a girl in other subreddits there's a pretty high chance someone will comment about it... whether it's in a degrading way or harmless way, it still can be annoying. I like it here because I know that's not the case usually. But I still want to be able to feel comfortable as a self-titled feminist.

edit: I also want to point out that although I can't agree with many people in this thread, I have not downvoted a single comment. I don't want to be blamed for any anger being pointed toward here. I'm just putting in my own 2 cents, as you are :)","1304210772"

I still wouldn't put him up there in my list of favorite casters, but I definitely don't dislike him anymore. In fact, I have a ton of respect for him for not only making the commitment that he has to improving his casting, but for being able to ignore the throngs of haters online that want to jump on the haterade bandwagon for some lulz at his expense, and turning what I previously considered to be his (at times) awkward diction and mannerisms into his own unique persona. He's really doing a great job lately of playing the foil to Geoff's character, and the dynamic of their casting combined with the quality of the match-ups has had me picking NASL over anything else (with the exception of GOM, of course) when I've sat down to catch up on VODS in my limited free time the past week or two.","1304210807"

Although I'm primarily using VB.NET and another Rob Conery project ([SubSonic](http://www.subsonicproject.com)), I can speak to the ""smoother"" development experience of being able to abstract data access.
 
NOTE: If you use VB.NET and SubSonic, make sure to find ""Default"" and ensure it reads ""[Default]"". C# should alleviate that issue though.
 
The Dapper docs also do some performance comparisons that are interesting.
 
I can't speak to the Entity Framework benefits, but would expect that they're otherwise similar.
 
As far as the OP is concerned though... Learn at least the basics of data connections first so that when things go wrong/get wacky, you've got some foundation to troubleshoot from...

"canada","t5_2qh68","Of course the economic argument, like all social science arguments, isn't black and white. I was merely stating in a poor way that I'm not willing to budge on those ideas.

Most of the new classical elements I've been exposed to are clearly flawed in one way or another. The first thing they teach you is the limits to the models. Sure classical makes sense, provided the situation meets the pretext. Austrian to me is a joke. At best, it explains the things that Keynes already explained. It seems like an excuse as opposed to a legit argument. Knowing that Friedman is just a whore for attention and even sold out his old colleges for more popular theories, it makes me severely question his ideas.

At best, I think Friedman is just a scapegoat for the wealthy to justify making the system more favorable for themselves. I believe in corruption and that's why I don't buy into the Ayn Randian stuff. Not that Ayn rand is the only aspect of right-wing economics or even a significant part but still. 

I'm not claiming that left-wing individuals are perfect. I know for a fact some people bullshit their research. What I'm saying is that when centers of research and education distinctly favor one set of ideas over others, it's a sign. Liberalism is inherently intellectual and it's not because all liberals are 'snobby'

There's little risk of replacement in the foreseeable future (at the point where robots become sophisticated enough to effectively replicate customer service without human assistance, they would be sophisticated enough to replicate most other jobs too, which is a whole different issue).

I replied to this and had to upvote it because you do have a point--when you go shopping, the person who has a lot of items(or a lot of transactions) always takes the longest. As a previous cashier, sometimes cashier lack of experience can cause the drawer to lock up or have to call the manager to void a transaction. Cashiers who use drugs don't usually impact your waiting time, but they bring the quality waaayyy down--forgetting items, sometimes giving you another customer's items,scanning something twice or not at all(yay, free), dropping things....paying with change doesn't hold up the line if the customer or the cashier are fast with counting the change. lol about the mom haha. Although as a cashier mothers with kids who wanted aisle candy while there was a line had no patience with the kid and would either say ""NO!"" and simply not let them have it, or, ""here, but you can't have anything else, just that."" so they will shut up. The assholes who complain and argue will hold up the line until you either give them a discount or free item or you agree with them, then they go away. The flirtatious customer is an instance that will let you see whether a cashier is high, lol. Most cashiers being professional will make a little joke and move it along. A high cashier will have a long conversation trying to get a date. The sober cashier will, instead of trying to nail the date that moment, ask the customer to come back again at a certain time. And not hold up a line to do it. 
As a general rule I avoid being in line behind a large group of customers(families or teenage cliques) or anyone who seems to be buying everything in the store. ","1304210869"

Giant Bomb is not a definitive source for gaming news (though, their new guy is adding a bit something to that).  They really only follow up on stories that they themselves are interested in, and they think their fans would be interested in.  Their main appeal is in the charisma and enthusiasm of their staff.  Those guys are just fun to watch, and the videos they create are usually pretty damn funny and informative.  I easily learn more about a game by watching 25-minutes of them playing it than I ever would by reading every story a site like Kotaku puts out about the same game. 

In my opinion, Giant Bomb is what a gaming site should be: A focus on actual games, gameplay, and having fun.  They don't report on Gabe Newell's every last tweet, and they don't talk about every last thing Bobby Kotick says in a conference call about profits for the third quarter.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","That 9 out of 10 people joke is terrible, because it is making light of rape.

It is the kind of thing that men that actually find rape inoffensive would say over a beer, and then high five about. The victim is the punchline.

Your post is a bit rambling as you say, but one thing did stand out other than the joke bit. What if your friend was a rape survivor and you made that comment? Would you feel fine about saying that joke if you knew? And would you feel fine about having said it if you didn't know, and after you said it she was horrified and told you about being raped and that you caused her to relive her attack?

My general rule for jokes like that is to not mock the victim. I don't make aids jokes mocking the victims, or (obviously) rape jokes mocking the victim.

Laughter is good and healthy, even using the hardships of life in humor can be good and can be a coping mechanism/cathartic, I just do not agree with making the victim the brunt of the joke, or laughing at the action of 'raping'.

Of course, everyone can make whatever sort of jokes they like, I am not the joke police, this is just my opinion. Some people though seem to think that freedom of speech means that they are free from any judgement or consequences of what they say.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","When I was 8 I collapsed while running around on a soccer field. This was due to my rare heart condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Little did anyone know that my heart was beating at 280 bpm. My parents just thought I was over heated and took me home while I lied down for 8 hours while my heart was beating at full speed; this was the status quo for me after playing any sport... I never told my parents because I thought it was normal. That night was particularly bad and decided to ask my parents if it was normal; that's when I was taken to the hospital and had my near death experience.

When I arrived in the emergency room a doctor saw me and rushed me immediately in with a concerned look on his face. That when they hooked me up to the heart rate monitor and saw that my heart was beating at 280 bpm which is extremely high, heart heart was about to shut down. The doctor suggested giving me drug that slows your heart down however it was meant for adults. He didn't know the exact amount to give me so he started with a low dose.

My heart dropped down to 160 bpm or so then climbed back up to 260. He gave me a second dose and my rate dropped to 80 before climbing back up past 200. My head was turned to the left looking at the heart rate monitor and my parents were out of view on my right when the third and final dose was administered. The first thing I remember after seeing the monitor flatline was the feeling of an elephant standing on my chest then all of a sudden that feeling and ALL feeling went away. At this point time was moving extremely slow. People don't notice it but you can feel the air on your skin, you can feel the presence of your physical body... all that faded away. My vision started to get wavy at that point and I remember turning my head to look at parents and after a glimpse a darkness began to take over my sight. I turned my head back to the heart rate monitor and as soon as I did I felt a surge run through me and at that moment the heart rate line clipped up and life returned to me.

Odd thing about it is: my parents, being mortified during those 7 long seconds, distinctly remember me NOT turning my head and lying completely still looking at the monitor the whole time... can't explain it but I know I saw a vision of my parents during that time. It's really hard to explain how it feels to have your heart stop but I gave it a shot. At first it's terrifying however fear quickly fades and a feel of release takes over. ","1304210889"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That was an interesting read.  However, the book fails to address the question of ""what is the value of IP/an idea""?  It might not be the key point of his book but it is definitely a problem that can not be ignored in the context of IP.  Although he does adequately demonstrate how the concept of IP hinders the right of physical property owners to do as they wish with their property, he doesn't at all address how IP ""owners"" should go about dealing with their IP; I mean this is unless of course he doesn't believe in IP ownership at all.

If you do happen to take the stance that IP ownership is not legitimate, then why would creators have any desire to create for anyone else other than themselves?  It seems to me that a lot of the ideas and inventions that we have today would not exist if the creators had no way of being compensated or method of owning their IP.  This also leaves open the question of how should authors and musicians be protected from say someone else plagiarizing their work and releasing it (even if it wasn't for profit; ie. I take ""Against Intellectual Property"" remove the author's name put my own on it and host it for free on my website; now extend this example to what if I did do it for profit and started selling books with his written words without his permission).  In the example I just gave, if he was completely against IP ownership than he would be perfectly fine in my usage of his material in that manner.  After all no harm has come to him because I have not deprived him of any property.  Another counter argument that can be made is that if I develop a process for say burning wood better so that more units of energy could be extracted from the wood then wouldn't I have added value to the wood being burnt using my method?  Do I not deserve some compensation for that value I have added?  These are all questions that Kinsella fails to answer while proposing a completely theoretical argument against IP.  I feel that while his arguments make sense for dealing with physical things, they can not completely be applied to IP.","1304210895"

Other than the physical ending connectors failing (which is extremely unlikely) you literally can not have a 'bad' HDMI cable, there is no cable at ANY price point or by ANY manufacturer that is better than another.""

Now, this doesn't meant that it's not true, but it's interesting that he only said anything about this after being rejected from the program.

Second: this guy is also a current undergrad in the UCSB Religious Studies department.  I know for a fact that most departments accept very few (or sometimes none) of the undergraduates to the graduate programs.  This is done to promote diversity of education, both for the applicant and the department.  This, among many other things, could easily be the real reason for his rejection.

All that being said, many of the departments at UCSB are highly political (as I imagine is true with many other universities), so there is also the possibility that this really is discrimination.  However, I'd caution everybody to wait for more information to come out before you start foaming at the mouth.  I certainly wouldn't take the allegations of a rejected applicant as the Word of God, so to speak ;)

He has submitted a formal complaint to V.C. Michael Young, who is a fantastic advocate for students, and can be trusted to investigate this situation appropriately.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have quite a few but this one is my favorite. Sorry about the length but I really can't leve anything out.

I had a dream once that I was time traveling. Now, time traveling didn't involve hopping in a delorian and speeding off to the future. How you did it was you just walked through the ""time stream"" and picked a time to enter. The time stream manifested itself as a large series of featureless hallways. Every second of time that has ever occured or ever will occur had it's own unlabeled door as an entry point. So, it was basically an infinite series of doors in an infinite series of hallways. Naturally, I was precognizant of all these confusing details.

Anyways, so I'm walking down these hallways trying to find a time to travel to when I turn a corner and encouter someone. This person is me. Well, specifically it's me from ten years in the future. How I know this, I'm not sure. I just do. Bear with me here.

So, the first thing I notice is that I look pretty good. Haven't really aged much. My hair is darker though and I'm wearing this long black coat. My future me of course recognizes the present me but says nothing, so I iniate a conversation. ""You're me in ten years? Tell me what it's like ten years from now! What am I like? Do I have the same job? Do I live in the same city? Do I..."" Future me has a strained look on his face.

And that's when he shoots me in the arm with a crossbow.

I shit you not. My future self just pulls out this crossbow from his jacket and shoots me right in the shoulder. I yelp in pain and shout ""What the fuck did you do that for?"" Future loads another bolt and responds ""You know goddamn well why I did!"" I turn and run. Future me gives chase.

So here I am, running down these blank hallways with my psychotic future self's footfalls echoing behind me. I briefly consider taking one of the doors to a period in time but quickly decide against it. None of them are labeled and I don't want to end up running away from dinosaurs instead of an asshole with a crossbow. I turn a corner and find myself at a dead end. My future self arrives shortly after. I unwisely decide to reason with him.

""Why are you doing this?"" I ask. ""You're here to stop me!"" I respond ""I don't even know why you're here."" My future self starts getting really aggravated ""That's bullshit. You're obviously here to stop me because I remember what I was like when I was you."" Instead of actually trying to understand that statement, I continue with my questioning. ""What exactly are you doing here?"" My future self explains.

""I'm going to go back in time to find the exact moment when the first human beings evolved. I'm going to find them and detonate a hand held nuclear device in order to prevent humanity from ever existing."" He takes the nuclear device out of his pocket and shows me. It's roughly the size and shape of a football. It seems really strange in retrospect that he had such advanced technology and apprently knew how to use it, but he was attacking me with a fucking crossbow. 

Predictably, I tell him that his plan is crazy and so on. I try to appeal to his basic sense of humanity by asking him rhetorical questions like ""What about all the great art, music and literature that humanity has produced?"" hr responds with ""Oh, right. Look, we're talking about the species who invented the Q-Tip here. What a great loss that will be."" which was actually pretty clever.

I try telling him that he can't kill me because if he does, then he'll never exist. He tells me that once you start time traveling that you become exempt from the regualar flow of time, so you are actually capable of killing yourself in the past without causing in damage to your actual self. He then tells me that I'm ""pretty much fucked"" and to ""stop moving around.""

I'm pretty much going to die, so I decide to take my chances with the nearest door. I shove future me out of the way and make a run for the nearest door. I can hear him cursing and chasing after me. I reach the door and open it. Everything goes black and that's it. I wake up in a cold sweat and seriously considering psychiatric help.

The schools are good, but they really focus on teaching how to take standardized tests, so if your kids aren't the test-taking type they'll struggle a bit. Not to say the curriculum isn't more advanced than other schools, it most definitely was, but Irvine is the best and worst of Orange County distilled down into a beige-colored, vanilla-flavored extract.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","its called the embryonic period because at the end of the 8 weeks, the embryo is complete, from then on, it is termed the fetal period because essentially it is growth of the foundation that took place during the first 8 weeks.
blastula and implantation occur by the end of week 1.
end of week 2 we have a 2 layer embryo
end of week 3 we have 3 layer embryo and gastrulation forming three germ layers begins. by the end of week 4 heart gut and kidneys develop and limb development begins, this ends in the 8th week, when fetal period begins. 
at the end of week 6 most of the limbs are getting to be fully developed, and by teh end of week 7 the skeletal system is formed. week 8 you are done with complete embryo and now the embryo needs to grow. 
so i would say that it is essentially the development of the embryo that is the embryonic period, and when that is complete and the organ systems are developed, then you move into the fetal period which is essentially growth.","1304210954"

"SexPositive","t5_2r7c9","Warpedme, I appreciate your openness to celebrating your own sexuality; if more people were like you, the world would be a better place. However, I think your argument of completely dismissing Rule34 as porn is false. Don't you think *your* personal interpretation of whether *somebody else* believes a Rule34 pic is sensual versus ""art or satire"" is fundamentally irrelevant? 

Consider this question from the perspective of [privilege](http://blog.shrub.com/archives/tekanji/2006-03-08_146) and minority spaces. A majority outsider looking into the world of Rule34 can just laugh it off and then move on with the idiosyncratic of their life (i.e. the date you just described with the girl above). Yet it is dramatically different for someone who identifies with a minority fetish, such as relevant34. In his original post, he states: 

&gt; ""And while I agree that [Rule34] often times can be funny, the truth is that most of these are *not* being created as a joke."" 

Furthermore, with a little digging into r/rule34 you can find a [pseudo-manifesto written by relevant_rule34](http://www.reddit.com/r/rule34/comments/fcnpw/the_meaning_of_rule_34/), where he explains his perspective in more detail. It is worth a read in its entirety, but I'll highlight this powerful quote:

&gt; ""Porn is a very special thing. It keeps us sane, and is always there for you, even when a lover is not. But even so, it is something greater than just a fantasy. **Porn is a reflection of who we really are, and what gets us off. The realization and understanding of our desires is a step towards becoming at peace with ourselves and the world around us.** Yet it makes me sad to see how at odds we are with our sexual identities.""

Anyways, I think Rule34 is an interesting case study for anyone trying to learn about Sex Positivity. It highlights common issues of acceptance and understanding; while also touching upon minority rights, freedom of expression, and sexual libertarianism. For example, if we theoretically replaced Rule34 with a more benign, yet still ""taboo"" fetish - such as ropeplay - the debate would have been incredibly different. Overall, I think we can all learn from the wisdom of relevant_rule34 and apply it towards our own sex positive conversations. ","1304210962"

*On February 25, 1994, that year's Purim day, Goldstein entered a room in the Cave of the Patriarchs that was serving as a mosque, wearing ""his army uniform with the insignia of rank, creating the image of a reserve officer on active duty"" (Shamgar report).[citation needed] He then opened fire, killing 29 prayers and wounding more than 125.[7] Mosque guard Mohammad Suleiman Abu Saleh said he thought that Goldstein was trying to kill as many people as possible and described how there were ""bodies and blood everywhere"". Goldstein was attacked and killed by other worshippers.[8] According to Ian Lustick, ""by mowing down Arabs he believed wanted to kill Jews, Goldstein was reenacting part of the Purim story"".[9]*

**At Goldstein's funeral, Rabbi Yaacov Perrin claimed that even one million Arabs are ""not worth a Jewish fingernail"".[19][20][21]**

Basically you get a ""warchest"" filled with enough cash, invest it into income stocks and bonds, and live off the dividend/interest payments.

The holy grail of this is a 10% return, but more realistic is 7% (although if inflation takes off you can probably find 14-18% but that means inflation is probably at 6-7%).

It didn't fly until 2002, and it still isn't used in production J-10 fighters due to performance issues (it spools up a lot slower than the equivalent Russian engine) and quality control issues.  They also last 10x fewer hours than the Russian built ones.

The Chinese have a LONG way to go in terms of engines.

I don't care if the Chinese gov't says 2018, it's not going to happen.  Engineering schedules don't conform to political goals, and there's only so much that throwing money and manpower at a project can do.  Take a look at China's space program and their proposed schedule circa 2005 or so.

I'm curious because when i think ""smoker"" i imagine someone who smokes around a pack a day, however i think this kind of smoker is becoming more and more rare (or at least, in my social sphere, there are several people who smoke but 0 who smoke more than a handful a day).  i think just the simple fact that there are fewer places to legally smoke makes being a full time smoker almost impossible (again, in my experience).

anyway this is just a curiosity thing; we see a lot of these anti-smoking ads and of course they are true, but  I wonder how frequency of smoking affects some of these numbers.  is there any critical point? like. is 4 a day, 4 days a week significantly safer than 4 a day 7 days a week.  what does the distribution look like? anyone know?","1304211001"

Yep, saw the car when the little spotlight box appears. There's a gas station on the left and a church on the right, and there's often cars waiting to turn in to the wrong entrance of the gas station or emerge from the church there, so it's a spot I always scan ahead for.

Getting you on the doing little things to wake people up. Admittedly I don't think I'd rush the getaway on an intersection I know people gamble upon ;)  But I've done little things like on roundabouts, if I'm on the inside for turning right and someone is on the outside going ahead, doesn't realise I'm there (not checked their mirrors on approach or looked right properly on entry) and start to straighten their arc, I've pulled in the clutch and bounced off the rev limiter. Amazing what a sudden burst of screaming engine 4ft from their window does to put someone back in their own lane. (sometimes done that when filtering in slow traffic and jams too - think you guys call it lane-splitting? - when there's someone a little way ahead drifting in a little to the line, clutch in and blip the gas on approach. They usually give away if they're squeezing on purpose by squeezing harder, or just wandering, by moving the other way... either way I'm more wise and safe too).

I'm a little more zen on the gap-squeezing thing. If someone's gonna do it they're gonna do it, so I'd keep a little gap anyway for my own safety and if someone fills it that way I'll shake my head and forget about it. If they get blocked then have to wait and squeeze and hope to be let in they'll end up slowing down 2 lanes so I just add a couple of bucks into the karma bank by keeping it all going smooth ;)

What DOES get my goat is when there's cones ahead for works and people squeeze to get in line like a mile ahead of time and leave an empty lane, and there's signs saying use both lanes until the cones... The plan is everyone leaves a bit of space and it pulls in like a zipper and it flows. So if I carry on like I'm supposed to in the empty lane, merging at the cones and people block or squeeze a gap out of existence, or even try to straddle lanes and block progress ahead...  That does my nut. If they're so thick and sheeplike as to not only join but contribute toward the jam, doesn't mean I should too :D I kind of like to think of the little veins on the side of their temples pulsing harder and harder until they burst open and decorate their interior with hypertensive splatter ;)  (like it could happen...)","1304211009"
"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","I sent my ex a huge email (just under 4000 words) a few days after she broke up with me. I look back at it sometimes and I'm proud of the level of clarity and insight I was able to achieve under that kind of stress. I think it can be useful to tell someone exactly how you feel, as long as you don't expect it to change anything.

At the end of my email I asked her not to reply as I didn't want to argue details - it was my chance to set out exactly how I felt. She was cheating on me, so I felt that me having the 'last word' was justified to an extent.

If you write something - don't make it needy, don't focus only on the good things, and for god's sake don't apologise if he is clearly in the wrong. If you can do that, I recommend sending it - but I see exactly where the other posters are coming from. it's a balancing act. It helped me immensely as I was able to write things she simply wasn't willing to talk about, and it was the first small step towards getting over her.

Good luck.","1304211009"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Post-flat repairs made with tire slime are far from certain.  Ask yourself, if you're ""in the middle of nowhere"", and the slime doesn't work, then what?

Moreover, even on a good day slime only temporarily seals a small puncture in a tube.  In other words, slime does not remove the source of a puncture, or in any way restore the integrity of a punctured tire casing.  That means that you'll usually need to take the tire off the rim even if slime appears to have sealed the tube.

Finally, slime can also clot itself in a tire's valve stem.  This may make it problematic to add air to a tire.

With this in mind, if you have the space to carry tire slime, you're better off carrying a tube and small tire repair kit instead.

To inflate the tube, use either a C02 cartridge system or a small pump.  If you get a pump, get one that actually works: Don't let the desire for for something small and light lead you to purchase a pump that ends up being too small and lightweight to be usable and useful.  (Topeak makes some good pumps; so does Lezyne.)

After acquiring your repair kit, test it (and yourself) before riding to the aforementioned middle of nowhere.  You'll then know that you have everything you need to fix a flat, and that what you have will do the job.

Finally, if you're getting a lot of flats, consider whether reinforced tires can help.  For example Continental Gatorskins, Specialized Armadillos, or something from Schwalbe…","1304211014"

Later in the 20th century, philosophers like W.V. Quine, Hilary Putnam, Richard Rorty, Donald Davidson, and Robert Brandom have endorsed updated versions of pragmatism.

You also have no way of knowing when a story was posted in relation to world events.  Like for example a politics or news story about something that happened: Take the fukushima story, for example.  Things changed as new data came out, and there's no way to know if a comment is reasonably optimistic right or delusional.

It was roughly 3 PM and we were getting all the prep ready for the dinner rush. All the other line cooks were in the big part of the kitchen with the walk ins and everything and I was actually on the line setting up the make line. It got kind of quiet, the meat chef had JUST left the line and went into the big kitchen and I looked over to the trash can and saw a white boy standing there, about 4'7"" tall, with brown hair, like a bowl cut, wearing a blue outfit and black shoes and knee high socks, just watching. I looked for about 5 seconds before he turned and ran into the wall and disappeared.
Later that night I asked another line cook about it, no one talks about the boy and so no one describes him, but I described him perfectly.
Then all of the equipment in the kitchen started to fuck up.
The flat top stopped working, the freezer stopped freezing, the refrigerator started to freeze everything, the ovens stopped working, the salamander oven started burning things too easily.

I think other people will be better able to answer your area-specific questions, but your state cooperative extension is the best resource, and it's free. [http://extension.wsu.edu/gardening/Pages/default.aspx](http://extension.wsu.edu/gardening/Pages/default.aspx)


Unless you just want to try as a hobby, I suspect tea gardening on a single person scale is more trouble than it's worth.  You could certainly grow a plant though and take it in for the winter.  *Camellia sinensis* is a tropical plant, and I suspect the climate in Washington might be a tad harsh for it to really flourish.  Herbal tea is another matter entirely, and you could easily succeed at that.


Blueberries are native where you live, so the extent of your difficulty will be purchasing plants, putting them in the ground, and forgetting about them until it's berry season.  I advise planting enough so that you won't mind sharing with the local wildlife--being rabidly protective of your fruit crops is a sure way to go on a caffeine-fueled fluffy-thing-killing rampage the like of which you and your terrified neighbors will never forget.


Lastly, the term ""mulch"" encompasses any kind of inert material a person lays over the soil of their garden to prevent weeds and trap moisture.  I find it difficult to believe that you're allergic to all mulch (pebbles, wheat straw, hardwood chips, newspaper, clay pellets, pine straw, etc.)  You may have simply had a bad reaction to a particular kind of chemically-treated mulch or conifer mulch with leftover resins in the past.  I only emphasize this because mulching properly helps add material to your soil, and prevents a **lot** of extra work.  If you simply cannot abide any of the above, plant low-growing covers like Corsican mint or thyme if you like herbs, or *Delosperma* if you're in a  dry location. ","1304211063"

Your mileage may vary, but it's worth noting that sometimes people severely underestimate their own limits.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;Do you feel that the recruiter appropriately represented the facility and the training?

I think they stretched the truth. They made it sound like something that would be totally awesome. While there are alot of positive aspects of job corps, there are alot of things that really get on my nerves. For example, there is a ""phase"" system in place here to keep people from having certain privleges until they've ""earned"" them. They are-

Phase 1- Default phase when you show up. You can leave center after 4pm on Tuesday and Friday, and leave all day Saturday and Sunday. 

Phase 2- Achieved after 8 hours of doing extra chores and/or community service (aka, ""phase hours""). You can leave all the days in phase one, as well as on Thursdays after 4pm. You can also play bingo every monday night and have a chance to win $15. They will also allow you to look for work, as long as the hours are on the days that you can leave campus, and they're after 4pm (you must be back by curfew though). 

Phase 3- Achieved after you complete 16 hours of extra chores/community service, as well as taking a month long class called ""leadership II"". You can leave any day of the week, as long as it's after 4pm. You can get a job any time of the day, any day of the week, as long as you're back by curfew (10pm weekdays, 12pm weekends) and it doesn't interrupt your vocation training schedule. Can't get it until you've been on Phase 2 for at least 60 days.

So, they've got it set up so that you can't effectively get a job until you're in Phase 3. Speaking of finding work, going in early to drop off your resume is a no-no- schooling is more important, and you can get a write up if you leave campus to go job searching without a pass by your counselor and your vocations adviser. You may be able to get away with getting a pass if you have an interview set up, however.

As far as training goes, with the exception of a few trades, they send you to CCOC (Central County Occupation Center) to get schooling. It's a pretty cool place, and the training there is pretty good. 

&gt;What is your field of training?

I'm in Computer Tech. It's a bit below my level, since I've been doing computer tech jobs for a few years, but it gives me a chance to get some certifications that I really could not afford otherwise. 

&gt;Co-ed or single gender?

The center is co-ed, but the dorms are single gender :(

&gt;Do you feel that it's a better option than community college?

They both have their advantages and disadvantages. Community college looks a **hell of a lot better** than job corps does on a resume. However, Job Corps also flew me out of where I was living at (Death Valley) for free, and stuck me in a place where there are more job oppertunities. 

If you have the money, don't mind where you're living at, and you have a place to stay/some work, I'd go with college. 

Also, no smoking on campus, or even down the street if you're off center (neighbors complain and call the cops) :(


edit- Forgot to mention that this job corps center will pay for up to 6 units of community college (night classes, on campus, English/math/science only) per semester. So if you want, you can get a bit of free college here.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","(I've shortened this due the fact that I came to realize why I didn't like her argument)
Well let me start with this. The whole Rory turning away from Smith while he was undressing being taken as homophobic is ridiculous. Rory is insecure of course he's going to turn. Amy's job as a Kiss-o-gram is really just Amy not being insecure. She loves Rory and later confirms this but the Doctor is her idol. Of course she has the hots for her. I love my girlfriend but I have the hots for Karen Gillan. She's an actor in my favorite show so I'm jelly while at the same time respectful of her. Amy's a terrible companion though. Rory is actually a far more interesting character but I digress. Her claims of sexism are there because she was looking for them. The advertising, sure, it was probably distasteful but Karen's hot and she knows it and doesn't seem to have a problem with hitting on herself so why not have some fun. Besides Madam De Pompadour, Sally Sparrow, Nancy, River. These are all females who kick a lot of ass. As for the homophobia that's bull shit. Captain Jack is a Moffat creation and he was gay in the empty child. So getting those out of the way. 

So on to somethings I got from this. She has a problem with realism. She LOVED Davis and she gave a lot of Tennant love which makes me think she's a Tennant fan girl. Fair enough he has amazing hair but as a Doctor he was rather boring for me. He was just so... human. That is honestly the best way to describe him. Eight has been credited as being the most human but he is also one of the darkest most brooding Doctors around. I digress yet again. Anyways I'm really calling shenanigans because she gave us half assed arguments and focused on the sexism she wanted to see. She doesn't like Smith and that's her problem. 

In the end she comes off to me as a child kicking a screaming that there was a changing of the guard and she didn't like Smith. She didn't see him for who he was. She wanted another Tennant and instead she got Dr. Seuss. I would argue this is a good thing. The Doctor is supposed to be alien he's supposed to be different. A human Doctor is boring thats why we have companions. We can relate to characters like River, Amy and Rory. (ESPECIALLY RORY! I love his character he's just so interesting to me.)  We could relate to Donna and Martha. (I HATED Rose. Tennant was oh so whiny about her.)  She wants a human Doctor so she pitched a fit but masked it as an ""academic"" argument.

[And here is a sort of summary](http://tedfellows.posterous.com/chomsky-and-the-khmer-rouge)

The problem with Chomsky is that he caught the liberal virus of the 60's and 70's that makes him believe that if anything is wrong in the world it is automatically the fault of the US.  That is coupled with the belief that anything leftist is given the benefit of the doubt until the evidence is overwhelming.","1304211121"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","I stopped smoking about a year ago. Since then I have seriously smashed the fuck out the gym, in the hope to gain the status of 'FEARED WARRIOR' among my peers. I'm probably about half way there lol. But yeah, if you don't smoke it makes your body really feel better, and you feel it in your mind. Same as what happens if you stop drinking sugary drinks, like cococola. (COKE). 

In the first week, you need to keep your mind focused, and would read like fuck what is on reddit. Reddit would actually be a good way for you to stop smoking. It would divert attention. You'd need time off work though, too. Just to keep your mind active (work is boring, as soon as you get bored you'll ask your fat friend in the office for a cigarette, even though he knows you're trying to quit, he'll give you one). 

So you need two weeks off work, and two weeks of hard redditing. The third week is when you'll think 'SHIT, I HAVENT DRANK ALCOHOL IN THREE WEEKS', I started with red wine. I got drunk, and didn't smoke. The week after that I smoked when drunk. I stopped smoking about a year ago, and have never smoked when sober since. Sure, I still smoke weed, but I don't have that 'normal craving', when waking up needing a ciggy. It just isn't something I need in my life, exept when I'm drunk. I'm a bit drunk now, I've had 15bottles of bud lol. 4 cases of that = £25 in tesco, if you didn't know... but yeah, I'm a bit durnk. 

What I said is true though, the information is real. I've had 15bottles and haven't had one cigarette all day. lol I don't even feel like one. I have some tobacco (rolling tobacco - golden virginia) in my draw.. and probably won't even be bothered to make a rollie tonight because it's just not something I crave any more. ","1304211124"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This, sadly, happened only a few years ago, but I'm never, *ever* going to tell anybody about it.  I've also cut off pretty much all contact with the people who were there for it, except weirdly, the girl who ""caused"" it.

I worked at Borders for awhile, and met my then-girlfriend there (she was a coworker).  One night, one of our other coworkers invites a bunch of us to his place for a party, which we agree to go to.

While we're driving up to his apartment complex (which, by the way, is Section 8 housing...and for those who don't know what that is, it's basically government-subsidized housing for poor people; extremely cheap, but with strict limits on the maximum you can make while still living there...kind of the reverse of a credit check at any normal apartment) she tells me she doesn't think we're very compatible, and wants to break up.  Right there.  Right before going into a party filled with coworkers that we both have to spend 30 hours a week around, and still around each other.  This was my first serious relationship (we were at about the 8 month mark at that point), so that combined with the idea of coping with that for 3 hours whilst surrounding by people who would surely be gossiping about just that the next day put me into emotional overload.

First, I had a straightup fucking *breakdown* in the car.  You can't leave me, I love you, I need you, I'll change.  All that emotionally unstable horseshit.  She agreed to drop the subject for the time being just so we could both enjoy ourselves, at least for the party.

I get the brilliant idea to *show* her exactly how much I need her - and subsequently, why leaving me would be stupid - by proceeding to down approximately 1.5 liters of really cheap, shitty vodka's worth of screwdrivers.  And this was *far* before I had developed any sort of tolerance for liquor.

The night ended with me in the front of a Section 8 apartment complex at 3 o'clock in the morning, lying on the ground and throwing up all over the lawn.  A coworker gave my then-girlfriend and myself a lift home because I drove and she didn't know how to  drive stick-shift, and I shit myself in his passenger seat.

We actually dated for a few months after that, and are still friends to this day.  I don't know why.  I still loathe myself for that incident.

Additionally, it's pretty hard to dismiss the probability of a ""close enough clone"" existing when your argument is ""another reality may exist where my beloved is alive"". We know cloning exists. It seems reasonable that humans can be cloned. It would be difficult to nurture a clone of this nature but the probability of creating one is certainly above zero.

He uses the instance of a motorist trying to change lanes into a lane occupied by a cyclist. After a few unsuccessful attempts at trying to intimidate the cyclist into dropping back &amp; letting the motorist in, the cyclist knocked off a side mirror. The report finishes with the cyclist in handcuffs and the motorist with no charges.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If your parents don't make a lot of money, you can get federal grants and money from your school based on your expected family contribution. If they are rich, the efc goes up which makes the need based aid you get go down. So let's say some kid's parents make 150,000 a year. He will qualify for almost no need based aid if his parents decide not to pay. If another kid's parents make 40,000 and decide not to pay, that kid is still going to get some money to help them out. So, if their rich parents won't pay, they are at a HUGE disadvantage because financial aid assumes that your parents are willing to pay. 

I know a lot of kids who get great grades and have great test scores who have trouble getting scholarships and aid because they are rich. They need their families to help them out. And I know people who are poor and have full rides. With higher education being so expensive, the moderately rich have a really hard time and I think its unfair to expect their children to pay for the fact that their parents won't help them when poorer students are going for free because they are poor.

Tadoussac, the whales. Excellent camping around there. . Since you are driving down from Tadoussac to QC, majke sure to go in La Malbaie and and the small villages of charlevois.

You should poke around for it on the internet.  

Another interesting interaction, The presence of both CO2 and Water vapor causes a negative interaction between the two species, together their radiation absorption is reduced vs them as solitary species.  I do have a source for this: Unit operations of Chemical engineers, Mccabe, Smith and Harriot.  Its a strange book to reference but its in there, I think it is a personal dig at climate science by the authors, but I am just guessing.  However, there are very few chemical engineers that I have met that believe all of the AGW theory.

If Gaddafi is committing murder on his own people and a foreign power steps in to end his operation, you cannot blame the foreign power if some members of Gaddafi's family are injured or killed. It's not like his children were 100% unaware of the war he sparked and it's not like NATO was either targeting his kids or even aware of them. If they are in his compound from which he is directing attacks and it gets bombed and they die, it's shitty but it's war. Maybe if you didn't hang around mass-murdering military dictators in the middle of a war you wouldn't get killed. His family could easily steal away to somewhere safe instead of holing up with him in a military operation.

If anything this was an effort to make NATO look bad for killing a few innocents. Note that it was Gaddafi himself who made this release. If that's the price to end his assault on innocent people, it's a huge bummer, but it's not nearly as bad as letting him continue his slaughter. Everyone is trying to misconstrue this as ""we want his children dead because they are part of his family."" The reality is that we want the bloodshed to stop and the death of his family members is an unfortunate side-effect of the conflict he started.","1304211213"

Considering that 1000 gold could've been spent on something that might've prevented you from dying in the first place, it seems pretty pricey for what usually seems to be pretty mediocre benefits.

The money I am paying is to own the condo and the right to use the amenities which are owned by the building owner.  I own the condo unit and the owner of the condo building owns the amenities.  I have final authority over who steps foot into my condo unit, and what people are permitted to do, and the condo building owner has the same rights for the other spaces such as the amenities.

Nobody else has ownership over my condo unit.  I own it.  I pay for the ownership of the unit and the right to use the amenities. 

&gt;You would understand this if you bought a condo, because it is stated quite clearly in the condo sale agreement.

Good, now show me the clearly stated taxpayer contract, biatch.  What's that?  There is none?  Hey, thanks for proving to me that I don't owe anyone any taxes.

Just like the condo owner would violate my rights if he took my money that is not in the contract signed and agreed to by myself, so too is the government violating my rights by taxing me.

&gt;Or you could bitch about it being unfair because you have no clue and hate that people can enter into agreements of this form.

You hate it that people do not enter into agreements that you want them to agree to.  You hate it so much that you are willing to advocate for guns and violence to be initiated against innocent people.

Show me the contract that says I am obligated to pay taxes and obey the state.  And no, merely staying on my own private property is not a contract signing with a random violent group of thugs who I prefer to have nothing to do with.","1304211239"

The effect of the 800lbs less is that it will get thrown around more in the wind. A tougher stomach is definitely a good idea in it.

Also, someone noted a lack of windows on the DA20. There actually are two ~8x10 windows in the canopy and you can get a pretty decent breeze off the wash of the prop through there while taxing. Still gets pretty hot though.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I dreamt once that North Korea some how has taken over the world and I work for one of Kim Jung Un's descendants as some kind of engineer. I got the sense that  we were supposed to be developing something very important but in the end all I end up doing is building model trains for a man I called the commander, who has possessive feelings for all his engineers.
 None of the other engineers likes the commander and so when one day he suddenly disappears we all think the government has decided to execute him for incompetence and we are all very happy... even more so when we think that our replacement commander is the Old Spice Guy.  Old Spice guy and I begin to flirt and one day we go to the market together as a couple where I pull him into a corner and give him a blow job with a condom which I put in my lab coat as a souvenir. Suddenly as we are walking back the market becomes deadly silent when I realize the commander is back ( apparently he had been summoned for a promotion. )  Nervously I greet him and tell him that we built another train in his absence, I feel like he can see right through me and want to get rid of the condom. Without a word he pulls  me aside and sits me down on a bench and spreads my legs wide open and goes down on his knees... and you can guess what he does .... all the vendors, and Old spice guy just stand there staring and I beg him not to do this in public as I am dripping like a hentai whore.  He continues to ignore me and I am on the verge of grabbing his head and forcibly pushing him away when he whispers: "" that rats have to eat their cheese and poison alike.""
Now I know that this makes no sense but in the dream I understood this to mean that he knew exactly what I had did with the old spice guy and that this was my punishment, and if I didn't sit still he would do something much worse. 
I start to cry and cover my face with my hands, accepting my fate, but I guess my shame wasn't to end there because some jackass vendor suddenly shouts out ""Commander do you know what goes great with those juices? MANGOES!"" I hope to God that he is going to shoot this son of a bitch for his insolence but HE ACTUALLY BUYS THE MANGOES and uses them as suggested.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Those are the questions you should be asking, and I couldn't agree more.  I think the answer lies deeply rooted in how systematic and human our society is structured.  

The reasons police try to cover up bad publicity ranges from on the macro-level a fear of repercussions on individual police, because of a misguided belief that to admit fault or mistakes would undermine their authority, the blind loyalty to a group rather than the individuals that make up that group--much like you see with political parties, religion, schools, sports teams, etc.--all the way down to individual reasons like friendship.  

Most people do not want to ""rat"" out their friends, family, coworkers, etc. because they know these people.  It's often hard to accept that someone you see everyday could commit crimes and brutality without provocation.  So instead of facing the truth they rationalize and defend the actions of people they should be arresting.

I'm a strong believer that we must expect more, not less, from our police force and therefore pursue harsher penalties and criminal charges when bad examples break the law.  I also, however, am often beleaguered by the understanding that it is nearly impossible to not only make people view situations morally and unbiased, but to then make them choose the correct moral choice.  Hell, if it was easy we wouldn't need police in the first place.  This massive flaw--human nature in essence--is compounded by the massive amount of people employed in the police and armed forces.","1304211271"

If I'm wrong about people making their own custom firmware and actually hacking and modifying the device then I'm wrong, but AFAIK all they did was create a PC driver for essentially a PC device... which isn't hacking.  If you have a link to actual device modifications I'd be interested.

I realize it can spiral into a semantic argument, but there is a distinct difference between the firmware hacks that were created for the PS3 and the PC drivers created for the Kinect device.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","is it acceptable to refer to white people as ""whites"" or ""the whites?""

i think the answer to both questions is, ""no, it is not inherently unacceptable."" i believe the connotations and implications behind the words are what makes people uncomfortable.

for instance...

&gt;the black man walked to the store.

is not racist because. the use of the term ""black"" is just a descriptor. it is of no consequence to anyone, because the fact that he is black doesn't add anything to the phrase except that you now have a better picture of what the man looks like.

&gt;the black man was rude to me.

the inclusion of race implies: ""a person was rude to me, and i need to point out they were black, likely because i am not black."" 

by pointing out the fact that the person was black, you sort of provide the implication that you think it isn't at all unusual for black people to be rude. it is like saying ""this man was rude to me. of course, he *is* black.""

conversely, if the phrase were...

&gt;this black man was polite to me.

...is akin to saying, ""this person was *actually* very polite to me, for a black person.""

i think referring to someone's race or color when describing them on a neutral level is OK, be it by saying ""whites,"" ""white person,"" or ""the whites."" i think it's just also very hard to find instances in which someone includes someone's race in a neutral phrase, and very easy to find someone including someone's race in a positive or negative phrase.

in the case of:

&gt;""donald trump sued by justice department for refusing to rent to THE BLACKS.""

this is unacceptable because the implication is that the reason he will not rent to them is because they are black. which is racism.

i also heard him saying something like ""i have a good relationship with the blacks,"" (in conjunction with some other stuff) which is akin to saying ""surprisingly, i have a good relationship with them,"" which implies that it is unusual for him to have a good relationship with them because they are black, which is racist.

all of that said, i don't think anyone who refers to anyone by their race in the manners i describe is *trying* to be racist, and in fact i don't think anyone notices when they say things like that. it would be silly to hold it against someone for speaking in this manner, as it is usually out of ignorance. that said, i think it is the job of those who are not ignorant to correct these people. 

**tl;dr: saying ""the black man walked to the store."" is not racist. saying ""the black man was nice to me."" is racist, if only subtly. it isn't explicitly racist, it's the undertones of the phrase.**","1304211320"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","&gt; To consider a war gentlemanly is the biggest lie one can tell themselves.

My example was just saying at one point of time war was almost gentlemanly and kind of like a duel but with more people, not saying its right or civilized but for a brief period of history war did not involve civilian casualties and its a shame we have come so far away from that. 

Back when I was in boot camp and combat training for the marines the emphasis was always on civilians, keeping them safe and being damn sure we weren't the ones doing the killing of them. the kind of war we got ourselves into is not one that makes that ideal easy and I just hope that we can go back to having that idealism again at some point in time instead of being looked at like we're a bunch of baby killers again (again being vietnam).","1304211324"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","There are very few individuals who deny the entire scope of events under the group label ""Holocaust,"" which the Zionists have placed on these events. Very few. Those who are called ""deniers"" by Zionists are almost never that -- they are skeptics of the official account of the events that fall under the Holocaust label.

Some question one thing, others question other things. This is a completely legitimate and honorable activity. They are seeking to learn the truth about history, by applying scientific testing methods, and reason, to what has been an emotional minefield.

Ask yourself why you are so concerned that anyone should investigate the Holocaust, or question the accuracy of the official account? The truth doesn't need to be protected by laws that muzzle free speech. Such laws are designed to protect only one thing -- falsehood.

Why should you assume that every aspect of the accepted Holocaust account is accurate? I mean, what are the chances that the historians didn't make mistakes, and got everything right? When do they ever get everything right?

History is written by the victors, and the Germans lost the War. Naturally the German perspective on the War was denied and suppressed -- how could it have been otherwise? Nobody in England or America wanted to admit that maybe the Germans were being slandered, and maybe some of them got a raw deal after the War, and were treated unjustly. Yet isn't it obvious that this must have happened in some cases, and indeed, did happen?

Personally, I'm tired of regarding the Holocaust as some sort of Sacred Cow. It's history, and it should be treated as history.","1304211331"
"homestead","t5_2s8lc","I actually took one of the workshops in Berkeley. Aaron is really dedicated and genuine, but the workshops themselves could be skipped for a few hours of googling. Very interesting stuff though.

As for your question about contaminants that you never got an answer too, I think I can help. Apparently the reason spirulina is so great, besides the benefits mentioned in the article, is that it's an extremophile, able to survive in extremely basic conditions (up to pH 10 if I remember correctly) where few to no human pathogens can compete. Like 50% of the nutrient mix is baking soda. So the reason he's really into spirulina isn't just because it's healthy, but because it's really hard to fuck up and grow something that'll make you sick as long as you keep the pH high. There are other algae you can grow for food, but you have to grow them kind of like mushrooms, in completely sterile nutrient solutions, not in cheap, easy open-top aquariums like you can spirulina.","1304211331"

1. Daily usage - understood to be correct to the previous thousandth year. In our case, we'd just call it year 11. We already do something similar when we say '11. When we have to refer to the previous thousand years (i.e. 1980) we'd say p80.
2. Relative precision - Similar to the metric system, we could use prefixes to denote magnitude. I.e. the year 4.000.001 could just be 4M1. This won't always be practical though.

"economy","t5_2qhpn","You're an idiot.  If you saved a pile of money that wanted to invest at long time horizon at the lowest possible level of risk, what you would do?  Buy U.S. Government bonds.  You would get a reasonable return on captial, while still maintaining essentially a risk-free investment.  

This is essentially what the social security trust fund has done.  Ergo, everything has been saved, in almost exactly the same manner a household would.  The problem is the SS trust fund can't sell the bond on the open market, as that would constitute a contraction of the money supply (like a fed open market operation) at least until they disbursed the money into the population.  Instead, the SSA trust holds callable Treasury Bonds - the IOUs referred to in the article.  So, they can call upon the treasury to provide them with the principal value of the bond at a given time to make their obligations.  

So, everything has been saved, exactly in the manner you as a household would save.  They only case in which the system fails (in a 25 year time horizon) is when Treasury cannot meet its obligations to the SSA.  That would constitute a default of the U.S. government, something no congress or administration is willing to accept.  ","1304211467"

That's not why. Ugly guys don't want to see ugly people in porn any more than ugly girls want to see ugly people. The reason there are so many toads used to be that male porn actors had to be the rare individuals who could ""produce wood"" on command. This being the case, porn producers couldn't really afford to be choosy. With the advent of viagra, *anyone* can be a porn star. Trouble is, viagra came about about the same time as inexpensive high quality video equipment and the internet. Porn is now something Joe Random can produce with a few thousand dollars backing. As a result, unless it's someone with a *name*, the male stars in most porn made nowadays are either the scumbag producing the film, or scumbag friends of the scumbag producer, and they're into porn not because of any particular skill or looks, but because it's a way to fuck porn stars and maybe make some money.","1304211474"

An anarchist society is not necessarily any more or less able to deal with these things (though one would hope that a society built around increased social awareness would be more capable), but it certainly wouldn't be able to punish people for drug use in the way statist societies are, and so they'd be forced to address the underlying cause more so than states have to.

He asked the rhetorical question what weather would be like on a non-rotating planet (no coriolis force). This is basic atmospheric dynamics - if you don't have a rotating planet, you don't get baroclinic instability. There's nothing more to think about - you don't get weather because you don't get meridional transport of energy from the tropics to the poles via mid-latitude eddies (cyclones); you get a warm tropical energy pool and meridional winds, and that's about it.

This is the type of question you ask an undergraduate on their atmospheric dynamics final. Yeah, maybe he knows some meteorology and might have a Bachelor's degree.

You aren't getting the best advice, but at least it isn't a hate-a-thon. Cheating is a sensitive topic. Too close to too many. A secular stoning often results, regardless whether the poster is remorseful and wants to change. 

The cheating is your fault, one you recognize. You are also right, that it was born out of the context of relationship stress. Your undescribed relationship difficulties created distance between the two of you. They don't excuse it, but they contributed to it. 

Please read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/eh48r/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_and_messed_up_my/c184url?context=3) - it took me forever to find. If you follow the links through, you'll find an example of  worse cheating, but one with some common threads for you, and a number of things to think about. Some direction may come from it for both of you. Both partners ended up posting, so you can get both sides of that situation for some contrast and comparison. 

All the best.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Your arguments are centred on a false assumption that directing economic growth via tax incentives equates to corruption, while I am correctly pointing out that these industries are not, and I will repeat myself, are not able to provide any government office, party, or person, with monetary or object incentives.

Your arguments are centered on the idea that contributing to a campaign equates to corruption. Yours also says that companies with lots of employees, which of which an contribute $1200 (I think that's right) to a reelection campaign to not influence campaigns. The first is a matter of degrees, the second is flat-out false.

&gt; Yes, they can turn to the government and request more -- but there must be a business reason for it; Competition from another province, or country, leading to lost jobs for the province or the industry as a whole.

These statements are the basis for breaks in other countries such as the US too.

&gt; Whereas, in the US, a company can petition to the government, proffer funds to the parties and individuals, and have their bills pass so as to improve profit taking.

Companies are limited by law in their ability to contribute to candidates. You continue to ignore this.

Your distinction between commercial development for profit taking and commercial development for the other furtherance of companies is arbitrary.

&gt; Not doing this would not lead to lost jobs, as much as the talking heads may say it would, but leads to a loss of tax dollars and greater profit taking of the owners.

A statement grounded in nothing but bias. You characterize the people you dislike as being wrong whereas those you are on the side of are virtuous.

&gt; Limit the amount given by every individual.

It is limited. Individual contributions to candidates in the US is limited to a bit more than twice what an individual can contribute to a candidate in Canada. Note there is more to this story in terms of limits to political entities other than candidates in the US versus Canada.

&gt;  I understand corporate person hood is an important ideal in the US, so include them in the limits.

They are included in the limits. I mentioned this twice before.

&gt; massive single donations

There are not massive single donations by corporations to candidates. As I mentioned, these large figures you see are created by totaling up what individuals working for the corporations donated. This totaling can be done in Canada too, although you would reach a lower figure of course.

If you are unwilling to avail yourself of some knowledge that is directly presented to you or by searching it out elsewhere, you will continue to hamper your ability to make impactful arguments.

&gt; We can almost forgive the wars, because they have done some good, although entered into under false information.  But the torture?

Why would we want to forgive torture? It's not something that should be forgiven. But to pretend it didn't happen before is just to blind oneself. There has never been a clean war. It's not the nature of war. When faced with a situation where mistreating one person you don't particularly like anyway might save the life of another you'd be surprised what people and organizations will do.

&gt; These will always and forever be marks of shame.

Oddly not forever, because even though we shouldn't forgive the sins of the past people like yourself have shown willingness to forget them or ignore them. And in this case for the strangest reasons.","1304211541"

I don't normally advocate physical violence, but if someone tries to touch my tits or ass in a public place, my reflexes take over.

I was at a drug store with my boyfriend, waiting for a perscription to be filled and my boyfriend thought it would be funny to put one of those back vibrators on my boob. I didn't even have time to think about it; I slapped his hand **hard.** The look on his face was one of complete shock.

He knows I'm a rape survivor, but had no idea that I would react the way I did. I had to explain to him that no one, including him, got to touch me in ways I didn't want. For me, that includes touching boobs, ass or vag in public. If a stranger was to touch me in any of those areas, he would meet the same fate with some version of ""BACK THE FUCK OFF"". If it's a creeper putting his arm around me, I'd shrug it off and ask him to get off of me.

I don't really see how that compares. Ideally, no one would rape anyone, but unfortunately that doesn't look like it's happening anytime soon. Since it does happen, I think potential victims should take measure to protect themselves. Even if they decide not to, the had zero fault for the rape. The fault lies entirely with the rapist. I would compare it to the fact that accidents happens, so I drive cautiously, drive a safe car, and wear a seat belt. 

&gt;Why is it always the Women's responsibility to prevent rape?????

Who else's responsibilty is it? I believe people have a responsibility to protect themselves. If they chose not, that's up to them. I am against forcing anyone into doing anything. ","1304211574"

You should go with your heart. If you truly care about her, then it won't matter. Stop worrying about what society thinks. They don't have to know anything anyway. You shouldn't even have to ask if this makes you *gay*. It does not at all. She is a female no matter what genitalia she has. Besides, you say she looks just like any other woman so how can this be gay?

In my opinion, I don't think this change how you feel. Date her! See how it goes. If you really love her you will be able to see past such a thing. Get with the 21st century man. Gender isn't so black and white any more.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Wait, how much are you spending in total on this? And are those two GTX 460s I'm seeing? It'd be appreciated if you posted the total amount and links to your components.

Judging on what I'm seeing, however, you can get significantly better performance out of [this Intel i5-2500K processor and MSI P67A-G43 motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.622006) for $20 or so more. There's absolutely no reason to get a hexacore for gaming when even the 955 outperforms it in most games.

Great hard drive, but [the 1TB Samsung Spinpoint F3](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152185) is on sale for $55, performs just as fast, and is just as reliable for $25 less. I personally have one and it's awesome. And, with that $20 you save, you can easily go for that CPU and motherboard combo I linked to in the last paragraph (which I would really go for, it really craps all over the 1100T when it comes to gaming performance).

Two GTX 460s in SLI? First off, you can't run SLI on that AMD motherboard. Second off, I would use the money and buy a single, powerful graphics card now, and then maybe buy another one later down the road if you need the performance boost once more demanding games come out and start to give your GPU a run for its money. With the money you're spending on two GTX 460 1GBs, go buy yourself a Radeon HD 6950 2GB instead. It's a very powerful card for $250, and it can unlock to 6970 speeds by unlocking the shaders on the card, basically giving you a $350 card that performs on-par with the GTX 570 for $100 less. And even if it's not unlocked, it will play any game out there at max settings in 1080p.

For gaming, 8 gigs of RAM is overkill. Get a good 2x2GB kit instead and you'll be set; I personally have never gone above 3 gigs of RAM usage playing games like Bad Company 2 and Left 4 Dead 2.

With those changes, you'll really have an awesome build that will last you for a considerable amount of time. Hope this helps, and best of luck! :)","1304211578"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","If it were a venn diagram like [this one](http://www.sdcoe.net/score/actbank/Venn.GIF):

* A would be libertarians

* C would be anarchist libertarians

* B could be ""non-libertarian anarchists"" (usually some form of [anarcho-syndicalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism))

(Bear in mind here that I am using the generally accepted American definition of the word ""libertarian"".  As an interesting side-note: in Europe, the word ""libertarian"" is generally used to describe anarcho-syndicalists, such as in my ""B"" category on the diagram)

Probably 90% (an unsupported guess based on personal experience) of self-identifying American libertarians are **minarchists**, i.e. they believe that state (defined as a monopoly on the use of aggression in a geographical region) is desirable or necessary to perform absolute basic services such as a judicial system, police and regional defense, etc.  

Some of us, however, believe that the state is undesirable, or immoral.  This often stems from the logical extension of the [non-aggression principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle), although there are also [utilitarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) anarcho-libertarians.  

[Anarcho-capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism), [voluntarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism) (or voluntar**y**ism), and [agorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorism) are 3 different theories, or 'takes' on libertarian anarchism.  None of these 3 terms are mutually exclusive with any of the others.  

The anarchists that you will find in /r/anarchism are mostly some form or another of anarcho-syndicalist, anarcho-socialist, anarcho-communist, etc.  These forms of anarchism are generally based on some form of [collectivism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivism) and the rejection of property rights, whereas libertarianism is generally associated with [individualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism) and the belief in some form of property rights theory.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's not the sole argument, it's the point I'm making.  The argument is to point out that the longer and more ingrained a nation's welfare state the more impoverished and oppressed the people.  The logical comparison is between Western Europe and Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe and China; China and North Korea.

The table you present shows very clearly the benefits of shaking off the oppression of Germany's National Socialist Party.  In 1960 Europe was still rebuilding from WWII and Nazi domination.  Since then they've been able to put more of their resources into consumption instead of re-building.  That is a major factor behind the table you present.

I think we should take the word of the Western Europe's citizens.  I think their riots are clear claims that they are unhappy with their welfare states.  Though I think it's also possible they are unhappy with the real world issue of running out of the ability to borrow to support their welfare state consumption.","1304211634"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;""stop people from committing rapes""

That isn't a new idea, yet they still happen. If it were a different crime, would you advise victims to continue engaging in high risk behaviors? ""Walk down a dark ally, leave your laptop in a public place, flash cash in a seedy bar, get drunk and incapacitated with people likely to take advantage of you, leave your keys in your car, etc. So, the correct response to the crimes that often/naturally result from these behaviors is to continue with the same behaviors? Aren't you likely to continue getting the same results?

On another note, it's interesting to note how distraught people become (downvotes) when considering that behaviors have consequences. I suppose there's always going to be a certain percentage that refuses to acknowledge reality, and prefers to live in the land of *shouldn't be any rapes*, but there *are rapes*, and to ignore the behavior aspect is not an intelligent approach.","1304211635"

First, how old are you? They discount some tickets for patrons 18-25, so check that out first. I'm not sure if the traveling programs are eligible, but it's worth checking out. 

Second, depending on the price difference, I've never really found it worth the extra dough for orchestra level. Obviously some people do, but they tend to be richer people than I. I actually prefer being up a bit because orchestra is usually at or slightly below the stage and thus means you're looking up the whole production. Acoustically, the seats are all decent enough that unless you're a real audiophile you probably won't notice the difference. There are some people who can really tell the difference, but I've never found it a problem. The worst seats I ever sat in for sound were the very first row of orchestra, the sound seem to just fly right over our heads. Definitely worse than one of the tier seats. If you get a seat on the very side you may miss the action when they hug the side of the stage, but that is usually infrequent. 

(note: this is my general opinion. It looks like Wicked is playing in the Opera house stage where I've only sat on the Orchestra level. However, it's not a bit opera house so I don't know how impaired you would be on the 2nd tier.) 

As for Wicked, good choice. It's excellent. :)","1304211684"

I ask because although when I took VB it was GUI driven (though didn't need to be), but with .NET it's easier than ever to work with a Console application (much like your pastebin example), and that would (in theory) permit students to focus on the program logic while setting aside GUI complications for the moment.

(I ask because it's not the first time I've seen students instructed this way recently and it confuses me a bit...)

Using a Console application would also permit the use of Console.ReadLine() which would feel like better integration with the application (for pacing)... to me anyway.

From a Forms standpoint, as stated in another comment, I'd agree MessageBox is probably the simplest, though not necessarily most elegant, solution. Anything else is likely to introduce more complexity than necessary if you're just trying to illustrate a Bubble Sort in action.","1304211686"

"Dexter","t5_2rahc","It's nothing like Dexter, but Battlestar Galactica is the best show I have ever seen, flat out. Start with the mini series, then seasons 1-4, they're all on Netflix instant play.

It's a show about the last 50,000 humans searching, for a new home after their 12 planets were destroyed by their own creation, the Cylons. The thing that I like about this show so much, is they don't just take you through the epic battle scenes, its not a show of ""The enemy found us!"" and then barely escaping. This show takes you through the everyday battles, shortage of food, political struggles, religious struggles, sickness, finding love when all looks hopeless, truly happy moments in times of despair. Moments that are heart wrenching and make your eyes well up with tears from both happiness and heartbreak. This is a bit of a dark show, but if you like Dexter, then you probably like dark. It is one of the few shows, that you actually live, while you watch it, and you will probably get slightly uncomfortable is some parts, but that's what makes it so great, this is a show, that while your watching it, you live it, the good, that bad, and the ugly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's assume the Romans are spread out evenly in a circle and run for you. They're going to cover 100 yards in about 30 seconds. It pays at this stage to realize just how far away 100 yards is. That's almost the full length of an American Football field. A human figure is tiny at that distance. You're going to aim real carefully for a few seconds, then squeeze off a couple of rounds - recoil cancels your aiming at once, so if the first shot misses you're most likely going to miss with the whole burst. You won't hit anyone further than 200 yards and you're going to fire about 10 short bursts in the 30 seconds it takes them to get from 200 yards to 100 yards, missing about 8 times out of 10 if you're a decent marksman. 

From 100 to 50 yards it gets a lot better. You still fire off controlled bursts, but you take less time aiming. You let off 7 bursts, and you hit 4 times. 94 guys are running at you, and you have 6 seconds before they throw their spears. 

This is as good a spot to panic as any. You open up full auto, circling as fast as you can. You let off 60 rounds with little aiming, and because you're very lucky you hit two more Roman soldiers, and two more after they launch their spears. You scare some of them into flinging themselves on the ground, and you imagine you've taken them all with you. You give up firing altogether after you're pierced multiple times by some of the 80 spears thrown your way. When the first soldier reaches you, you're writhing on the ground, crying and whimpering, bleeding profusely. He gives you a half hearted kick, then lets up - you're done for and you've earned the few more minutes of atrocious pain before you lose consciousness. ","1304211700"

We know cloning exists. It seems reasonable that humans can be cloned. It would be difficult to nurture a clone of this nature but the probability of creating one is certainly above zero. Even if you think there is very little chance of this working we're just debating about which is more probable. Personally I have to pick cloning as being more probable.

You are really overstating the effect that biological makeup has on personality. Identical twins can often be drastically different people, and a clone would be a drastically different person from the person you knew and loved.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;No, God does not lie. I believe the Father's words about his Son. And I believe the Son's words about the Father.

No offense but you dont beleive the Fathers words, because if you truly believed God own words spoken FROM HEAVEN TWICE. Then you would abandon the lie of the trinity. That is what makes the trinity so perfect for you guys is that you can take ambiguous bible verses and twist them into what you call ""proof"" of the trinity. The trinity is so perfect and clear vut that even tow people in the same faith who sit beside each other have a different take on it. And then you can also make statements like you just made that they are all call Gods at some point so it is the trinity. WHILE IGNORING THE FACT Jesus called him ** “My God, my God.**Mark 15:33-34, Matthew 27:45-46.

John 20:17) . . .‘I am ascending to my **Father and YOUR Father and to my God and YOUR God.** 

Who else did God refer to AS his Son from Heaven? Whom else did Jesus refer to As Father from earth? Yes Jesus was referred to as God by some, but Jesus pointed from his own mouth to the pharisees that in the Psalms powerful men, judges etc in the OT where referred to AS GODS , yet they wanted to kill him for saying he was GOD'S SON. In that reference saying that was to show respect to a person of higher rank. Sarah refereed to Abraham once as her Lord, and he was addressed in those terms by others he was over. Did that make Abraham Lord and God? Well in a way yes because he was a patriarch.

&gt;Do you understand what the Granville-Sharp connection in Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1 implicates?

Im assuming your two verse says Jesus is God ,lord and Savior right? Im assuming your bible could  not possibly have a trinitarian slant to it. Amirite? 

&gt;Can you explain to me the importance of articular infinitives, particularly the one at the end of Philippians 2:6?

No I cannot and here is why , #1 I dont have time to get in to ciruclar logics about what Greek says, Because we both know just like english of today is different then old english when the KJB was written, It is the same for modren greek and classic greek. #2 If knowing an older language was a requirement of learning the bible God wouldn't have granted holy spirit at pentcost 33 CE so they can speak and witness in other tongues. # 3 If God wanted us to know another language to learn the bible it would have been written and preserved in the language his son was speaking aramaic. So if that is you greek orthodoxy have is the bible was written in greek as your argument that is weak. Much of the NT was written in Hebrew and in greek or translated to greek. And besides since you are all about the greek and translation why are you not out there following a command Jesus or as you claim God made at Matt 24:19,20. Jesus preached door to door, the disciples and apostles did too. You would think people who goad themselves on knowing greek would understand the commandment and do the same.

&gt;Why do you ignore the plain reading of the Carmen Christi? *Do you grasp the significance of ontological equality and functional subordination?

Let me guess another book with a trinitarian slant? Man you guys only seems to quote books from ones who have your slant. Have you never heard of an independent witness? [Jason Beduhn](http://www.amazon.com/Truth-Translation-Accuracy-Translations-Testament/dp/0761825568).  

Here is a debate on why even he says he doesn't agree with all of our translation. And the answer

http://en.allexperts.com/q/Jehovah-s-Witness-1617/2010/8/Prof-Jason-BeDuhn.htm

&gt;You cited Deuteronomy 6:4. Are you aware that the word echad can denote compound unity (as it does in Genesis 2:24)?

I cannot remember citing deut but fair enough the Jewish system has always been a one god system. Im not  sure at what point for you guys it became a 2 god or 1 God with many names system. Ps 83:81 in most bible says Yahweh, Jehovah is Gods name. Most of the earliest bible names pointed back to Jehovah and his salvation including Jesus.

(Josh′u‧a) [shortened form of Jehoshua, meaning “Jehovah Is Salvation

(Jon′a‧than)Yoh‧na‧than′ and the longer form Yehoh‧na‧than′
 [Jehovah Has Given].

(Jo′ab) [Jehovah Is Father].

(Ad‧o‧ni′jah) [Jehovah Is Lord].

You get the point even Jesus name points back to whom? (Je′sus) [Lat. form of the Gr. I‧e‧sous′, which corresponds to the Heb. Ye‧shu′aʽ or Yehoh‧shu′aʽ and means **“Jehovah Is Salvation”].** 

The name Yaweh or Jehovah is interweave ed into the OT for a reason, to give himself credit as the creator. The fact every name EVEN HIS SON's points to him as salvation should be a BIG clue as to WHO IS GOD!

&gt;Matthew 28:18 states that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to him. Does it make sense that an angel or created being would have all authority within heaven, even over God himself? What does this demonstrate in regards to the Godhead?


This is a good point, a very good point so you a agree then that iy doesn't make sense first of all that God would have to give himself authority if he is already God as you guys are taught to claim? I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE THIS POINT MORE THOROUGHLY but if you are going to start bobbing and weaving, like  user pridefulpropensity when I bring out the guns on that verse, then I wouldn't bother.

&gt;In Daniel 7:13-14 we're told that the Son of Man comes before the Ancient of Days, and is given authority and power and he is worshiped. If Jesus claims repeatedly to be the Son of Man, is he worthy of worship or no?

We are to worship God the Father, Daniel's verse says Jesus was (given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him"" To serve him doesnt mean worship him. And it is nothing for the Son(Prince) of a King to be honored to some extent. The Father (Philippians 2:10-11) . . .so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, 11 and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.

I have questions about this also. My questions are If Jesus is God then whom is he before? If Jesus Is God then he would already have those things no? 

John 20:28 Thomas calling Jesus my God....

Sarah call the angel she spoke to lord and her husband also, Abraham was call Lord by others around him. It was not out of line for Thomas to call Jesus My Lord and my God. When the pharisees were questioning Jesus, he asked them why if he is called Son of David why David referred to his ""son""(Jesus) as his Lord? Jesus EXPLAINS how he could be called God by refering to the psalms in his reply here at John 10:34, 35. He says that according to psalms the powerful men and Judges and people of high rank where called gods. Jesus points out they want to kill him because he call himself NOT God, but God's SON. To Thomas Jesus was high rank being Gods Son. Just as Jesus refers to his FATHER of the HIGHEST rank as...

(Matthew 27:45-46)From the sixth hour on a darkness fell over all the land, until the ninth hour. 46 About the ninth hour Jesus called out with a loud voice, saying: “E′li, E′li, la′ma sa‧bach‧tha′ni?” that is, “My God, my God. . .

Same as here (Mark 15:33-34) “My God, my God. . .

Also he says this (John 20:17) . . .‘I am ascending to my Father and YOUR Father and to my God and YOUR God. . .

He doesn't say he is ascending to himself, or that he is God.

&gt;Do you claim to not follow any tradition?

No we don't follow any man made traditions no. The only celebration we do is the Memorial of Christ that he instituted on his last night which REPLACED the passover(as it was on the same night) that he told his disciples to do this in memory of him. The passover was only on ONE night each year after sundown. We celebrate it exactly on the same day which is Nisan 14 according to the Jewish calendar. Much of the world gets into easter, passover, etc on the wrong day for the wrong reason.

When you consider it that way, you realize K-ON is rather brilliant. The enjoyment myself and many others get from it comes from our ability to superimpose our own experiences upon it.

under the PACS, you're recognized as a couple in the eyes of the law. there are tax benefits, just as there are tax benefits for marriage (although the benefits are different). the big difference is that divorce is a huge deal in France, and can take years to finalize. with a PACS, one party can write a letter to the administration and the whole thing is dissolved. there's no argument or dispute.

marriage is entirely secular, too. if people want a religious ceremony or a religious blessing, they are free to go to a church/synagogue/mosque/temple after the fact and have that ceremony, but religious figures do not have the power to pronounce people married. only the State holds that power.

(the 100% secular nature of marriage in France is also why divorces take a long time to finalize. under French law, marriage is a social contract, and your vows are legally binding, as opposed to the comparatively wishy-washy status they have over here) given France's culture of social solidarity and fraternity, adultery is very, very frowned upon. that is, if you get caught. the adulterous party in a divorce usually gets completely screwed because they've effectively broken the law. the punishment is also generally more severe if you're a woman.)","1304211743"

It is worth remembering, though, that Oriental is not an ethnic slur to be avoided in all situations. It is most objectionable in contemporary contexts and when used as a noun, as in the appointment of an Oriental to head the commission. But in certain historical contexts, or when its exotic connotations are integral to the topic, Oriental remains a useful term.[6]
Random House's Guide to Sensitive Language states ""Other words (e.g., Oriental, colored) are outdated or inaccurate."" This Guide to Sensitive Language suggests the use of ""Asian or more specific designation such as Pacific Islander, Chinese American, [or] Korean"".[7] Merriam-Webster describes the term as ""sometimes offensive.""

The traditional method for large-scale baseload plants has involved not drilling where there are ""hot sprints or volcanic activity"", (although there are plants where is hot water being ejected to the surface, like in California)  but the most common and effective is drilling where two tectonic plates meet. Although, France, Australia, the US, and Germany (among others) are all currently using methods where they can drill almost anywhere.

I can understand asking for sources if they involve something more than putting the words into google, or looking at [the wikipedia page](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Geothermal_electricity), but it's not like I said anything controversial. 

This is from the introduction section of the wiki page:

&gt;Current worldwide installed capacity is 10,715 megawatts (MW), with the largest capacity in the United States (3,086 MW)

Are you saying that with all those plants they used more energy to drill them is currently being produced? 

Also, further down they state:

&gt;A 2006 report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), that included the potential of enhanced geothermal systems, estimated that **investing 1 billion US dollars in research and development over 15 years would allow the creation of 100 GW** of electrical generating capacity by 2050 in the United States alone.[12] The MIT report estimated that over 200 zettajoules (ZJ) would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2,000 ZJ with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world's present energy needs for several millennia.[12]

Do you have some information that contradicts this?

&gt;Honestly, the Fallout 3 is the better game. While I agree with some things about New Vegas being better such as the factions, thats pretty much it. 
&gt;
&gt;The setting in fallout 3 is undoubtfuly better, the story is much more personal. I mean you literaly start off being born and grow up in a vault until your 18, when the game actually starts ( your dad leaving) you already have feelings about your character by seeing its childhood and teenage years (somewhat brief though they are). 
&gt;In new vegas you start off being shot by some douche in a checkard suit you dont even know about and you dont even know what your character looks like. I could care less if someone got shot in fallout, I do it all the time. 
&gt;
&gt;Combat was also better in fallout 3. In new vegas VATS was dumbed down and anything with a scope or moded (ahem…machine gun grenade?) could pretty much kill anything off the bat. With Fallout VATS felt more responsive and explosive (who doesnt love a good headshot with a leg or two blowing off in the process) and even though guns were somewhat generic, you were attached to them. 
&gt;
&gt;I remember my first playthrough I kept the same hunting rifle from level 3-20. In new vegas i would find a gun and within 30 minutes find one already better. All in all there good games but Bethesda could handle the Fallout universe much better than obsidian

There is some doubt in the minds of some revisionists that there was deliberate homocidal gassing. For one reason, it doesn't make much practical sense. For another, there is no paper trail that explicitly proves an extermination agenda against the Jews.

But in my view, the question of how much gasing was used in the camps, or even whether gasing was ever used, is a legitimate matter for discussion. What harm is there in talking about the data that is available, or in holding an opinion about it? Why should some people be punished if their opinion happens to differ from the approved, official opinion?","1304211862"

Or would you rather just walk outside, chop down a tree and be done with?

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","I can speak for this because I pretty much had both things in one birth.

I labored at home for many hours without meds. I did not find contractions to be unbearable, painful but tolerable. What ended up happening to me was ""back labor."" My lower back hurt all the time and the pain was intense during a contraction. From what I understand it's supposed to go contraction-break-endorphins-contraction. If my labor had gone this way I believe I could have done it all naturally. I ended up going to the hospital and needing the drugs.

Do you have a birth plan? OB or midwives or doula? Hospital you like? My suggestion is talking to your care provider about what you want, and make sure you have an advocate (doula,SO,etc) during your birth time to help make it happen. You could always start naturally, and say maybe to the drugs just in case.

Parts here add up to $6.49. The part where you overheat it takes about 3-5 minutes for it to do the double blink. Biggest pain out of this process is cleaning the CPU and GPU. 

Basically the reason this works is that what causes the RROD is the GPU slightly lifting out of the motherboard and causing the hardware failure. With this fix method you basically overheat it so that solder is hot enough to pretty much push the GPU back into the motherboard and allow it to work properly. With it being changed over to screws it keeps it from lifting back up. ","1304211938"

If you are wondering why we use oil to fry stuff, it's because water turns to steam at 100 degrees C, so you can't ever generate a cooking environment above that temperature by immersing the food in water. But if you use oil, you can reach higher temps (until the oil starts to break down).

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","I guess I don't feel like this particular post is all about acceptance, and I don't believe that the reason a throwaway account was made was to avoid karmawhoring.

Instead, I feel like this post puts people down who, for whatever personal reasons that are above our judgment, are choosing to live their lives without coming out. Some people will only interpret the post as purely positive encouragement to come out, but my first thought was that it was judgement and pressure. If that thought never crossed my mind though, I still wouldn't go up to somebody and tell them, ""Hey, suck it up, you were supposed to feel inspired to change your mind, your hurt feelings are invalid, shame on you for not supporting it or silently tolerating it just because you found it intolerant and hypocritical.""

As a currently closeted person himself, I think the OP could be a little more understanding of how some other people who choose to remain closeted could feel judged, pressured, or put down by this.

I don't remember having to use any special tools, except for ring compressors, and all the parts are relatively easy to obtain.  The gist of it, and realize there will be a very specific order of steps to go through, but it goes something like: take off seat and tank, remove carbs, remove exhaust, remove chain, electricals, remove engine, valve covers, cam base, heads, cylinders.  This point, after checking all the valves and cams and valve chain, replace rings, reverse.  One good afternoon or a couple if you go through the whole engine while it's on the bench.  Bearings and gaskets are really really cheap and if you have the engine out, it's a piece of cake to replace all those at the same time.  If the engine's not been rebuilt or take out before, an impact wrench is advised.  It's not as simple as an oil change, but it's very basic and doesn't require a degree, just a work space and some time.  My 2bits anyhow.","1304211942"

Most companies don't speak to you unless you reply through e-mail or have access to their website. In some cases its better to have internet than a cell or home phone.

In the case of the second option, 33 would be a less viable option, since you can assume maybe around half of participants will consider this, lowering the average and a smaller number would consider the lower average, further lowering the average.

3. Just think of all the people driving to a stadium for a game of [insert sport here]. That, for one game, is far more fuel consumption than the entire NASCAR race. Yes, people drive to NASCAR races too, but the actual amount of fuel used during a race is trivial compared to what the fans use to get to the race.

So why don't you go boggle your mind over another sport. No one tells you you have to watch curling or darts on TV, and that's pretty boring too. I don't see you whining about it.

i think that maybe that the pregnancy wasn't what the silence was referring to and it'll be something else entirely different. probably about his death and how he was the one who sent the envelopes or something that hasnt happened yet.

&gt;How did Canton get the TARDIS into area 51?

he didn't. the doctor or river put it there since they're the only 2 who know how to fly it. probably river since she still does have the time vortex manipulator so she could bring the tardis there and then leave without being seen.

&gt;How did the 1969 Silents all know Amy's name?

i'm guessing if you have the ability to wipe yourself from someones mind you also have the capacity to read their mind as well. and since they can do post hypnotic suggestion it could potentially explain amy's weird dream thing as well.

I disagree about the the line in 6x01 being about the Doctor's future self. I think it was about the pregnancy (if you recall, she couldn't remember why she told the Doctor at first). I think future episodes will illuminate why the Silent are so interested in Amy and her quantum baby, but it is certainly tied in with the fate of the future Doctor.","1304212018"

We have a unique ability to form romantic/sexual relationships with members of the same gender.  These relationships have nuances straight people can not experience.  They are not better than straight relationships, but they are of equal value, and greater individual significance because of their rarity.

The current social and legal climate treats our relationships with contempt, but that doesn't make them cease to be a gift.  If assuming a religious perspective, where the conditions of our birth are divinely determined, we are given the ability to express and accept love in a way most people can't.  And in an unjust and hostile society, we are given the difficult gift and duty of a love whose dignity and value we must fight for.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I dunno, where I am it wouldn't make that much difference. Ragu pasta sauce at Food Lion is $2.49 not including tax, looks like WH Red Pepper Pasta Sauce (also 16oz I believe?) is $2.29. Produce is comparable to Food Lion/Krogers/Super Target (won't go through each one but just eying it, seems about the same). 

Meat and pre-prepped food is probably where you'd get the biggest differences, but depends how much you value quality over quantity. Thought I saved a huge amount when I bought a generic bag of frozen chicken thighs at Krogers. Tried them...they were honestly half-fat, and saturated with salt. UGH. Nearly inedible, cut out much of it to make into broth (which I do with leftover chicken parts anyway) and realized buying the Step2 (humanely-treated and fed) chicken at WH was actually more cost efficient in amount of meat. Also, depends on how much value you place on nutritional value; [grass-fed beef has better fatty acid content than grain-fed beef](http://www.nutritionj.com/content/9/1/10), and from experience, the grass-fed/organic stuff at Krogers/Super Target is much more expensive than at Whole Foods...perhaps because the majority of their consumers don't buy it, while Whole Foods sells the stuff regularly.

Anyway, just MHO. I still go to places like Krogers because they regularly have discounted items near-expiration date (eg. bagged veggies) and that can't be beat. But usually they don't have that great of a selection of super-cheap produce, and at the regular prices, I would just go to Whole Foods.","1304212060"

My 87 year old maternal grandmother suffered for weeks although she had her family (husband, kids and grandkids) by her side nearly constantly right to the end. During this time, my maternal grandfather died suddenly of an aneurysm; he was all alone and dead on the floor for several hours before he was found. 

They died a week apart and we had two funerals in 7 days. The entire time I kept thinking how I wish I could have been there for grandpa so he didn't have to be alone but how much I wish it would have ended more quickly for grandma.

Now, that in itself doesn't imply that these professors allow their personal bias to taint their curriculum; however, the fact is that there is quantitative evidence that academia is biased. There is evidence for publication bias, I cited peer reviewed proof elsewhere in this thread that some fields are blatantly biased. The fact that these fields are tolerated is further evidence that the whole system is biased.

The fact that many in the left can even admit their bias is troubling in itself. It certainly casts significant doubt on the academic integrity of their work; this leads to questions of confirmation bias and publication bias. ","1304212066"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Audio engineer here. The root of this problem lies in the very two things that it destroys. Human ears are most sensitive to midrange frequencies, and less sensitive to extreme bass and treble. But as the volume increases, the sensitivity becomes much more equal (see [Equal loudness contour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour) for more detail). This makes louder music sound better, but only to a certain point.

Listening to loud music actually desensitizes the ear (over a short or long term), forcing you to increase the volume further for it to seem normal. Many DJ's and live engineers have awful hearing, so they need to hear it loud for it to sound normal to them. It's like an addiction to volume, requiring higher and higher doses.

Record labels have fallen for this too, so most recent music has been mastered with so much dynamic range compression that it sounds awful at lower volumes (drums have no punch, no dynamic changes, etc). So DJ's/engineers/club owners turn it up louder to compensate. Because these songs are loud ALL THE TIME, ear fatigue also occurs more quickly.And the vicious cycle of loudness continues…","1304212085"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That sounds so pleasant!  

My husband can't sleep unless he's on his stomach and not being touched by me.  I hate going to bed, so I won't unless I'm dead tired or distracted by how pleasant it is to cuddle with him.  He thinks it is utterly preposterous to stay up past 11pm, so he always insists that I come to bed with him.

So, this is usually the routine:

With massive coercion, I can sometimes convince my husband to lie on his back so I can rest my head on his shoulder, and then we chat for a bit.  

Then (or we just start with this 99% of the time) we flip on our sides, and I'm the little spoon.  We chat like this for a bit, but if I don't get quiet and start to fall asleep in five minutes or so, he gives up and flips around to go to sleep himself.

I am never happy with suddenly being left alone on my side, so I flip over too and cuddle him (I'm the big spoon now).  Within minutes, he tells me I'm making him hot.  Then I pull the covers partially off him to cool him down.  Then he complains that that wasn't what he had in mind and very piteously begs to be left alone so he can sleep because he's sooo tired.

I then flip around and scooch back to my side and try to go to sleep, but I like to sort of sleep sideways, so he ends up complaining that my arm or rear is sticking out too much and bothering him and can I please contain myself to my side. 

Then there are some appendage adjustments and compromises by both parties, and I fall asleep.  Then he can finally fall asleep.  

Or, if I'm nowhere near falling asleep after the adjustments, I get up (which, at this point, he no longer objects to) and go internet in another bedroom and end up sleeping there.  And in the morning, he asks how late I stayed up and is always appalled.","1304212108"

I can't verbalise my respect and gratitude towards him and what he does because he has not only given us some wonderful songs, he has also given us a fantastic way to memorise facts from some of the greatest minds and get us interested in their other work.

To succeed, science needs to have great scientists working on new discoveries and pushing the boundaries, But it also needs people to popularise the area and break down the information to an easily accessible level like the Sagan, Kaku and deGrasse Tyson do.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Please explain how you think these ""Jellyfish genes"" can cause the food to be harmful.

The problem is Monsanto's draconian business practices, not the foods. A piece of the problem is that the unreasonable fear of GMOs forces them to act anti-competitively. For example, your fear of contamination was addressed over a decade ago. The majority of GMOs now contain ""terminator genes"" which don't allow the plants to reproduce. The economic implication of this is that farms are now solely dependent on Monsanto for their crops. There is a small flaw in the technology though because normal plants planted in a field after a GMO plant has been there will hybridize with the seeds that never sprouted and become a strain that can reproduce. To avoid lawsuits from farmers whose crops get contaminated by hybrids, they force their farmers to sign a contract that makes it so they can't plant anything in a field once using their crops for a period of a few years.

You can have it one of two ways, either GMOs are free to ""contaminate"" everything and you get a more reasonable Monsanto, or you get big, evil corporation Monsanto and preservation of non-GMO crops. They are mutually exclusive. The fear of GMOs has been scientifically proven to be unjustified, those jellyfish genes can't hurt you.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I know that some people can be very scientifically intelligent and very religious. I've met a few people like that in my life. I don't deny it.

But my point, I think, still stands: if the administration is incredibly crazy Christian, then what kind of faculty are they likely to hire? If they keep their nose out of medicine, fantastic. If they only hire intelligent medical professors, great, and I'm sure they'll get a reputation for having a great medical school. But, I think it's more likely they'll try and hire people that believe, at least partially, in non-scientific crap. No medical professor should be promoting prayer as a form of healing, period.

In regards to your prayer thing, a rather famous double blind study was done a few years ago. I can't find the original paper, but the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html) did a wonderful writeup on it a few years ago. The tl;dr - telling people who underwent surgery you're praying for them actually had a negative correlation with recovery rate.

When you're getting 30 applications for a single spot, the unfortunate truth is that you have to weed out applications on some sort of basis. If the school they're coming from is known to promote bullshit...that's going to be a screen. If their med school ends up being influenced by the administration, no matter how great an individual candidate might be, he looks worse for having come from that school. It's the unfortunate truth in medicine right, there are too many qualified people looking for too few spots. In theory, yes you are right, everyone should be considered. In practice, there simply isn't the time - if they wanted to increase their chances at landing a residency spot, they should have gone somewhere else.","1304212192"

Where are the fucking tears for the children Gaddafi has killed? What about the innocent parents and grandparents? It's just all mixed up that everyone feels so much humanity for his family members while ignoring the fact that he's a brutal, murderous dictator who has no respect for human rights and would gladly - even personally - kill peaceful protesters given the opportunity.

Also, from Al-Jazeera on this topic:

&gt;Al Jazeera's Sue Turton, reporting from Benghazi, said there were ""an awful lot"" of suggestions in Libya that the news of the deaths could be fabricated.

&gt;""One of the main spokesmen for the Transitional National Council, Abdul Hafez Goga, is saying he thinks it could all be fabrication, that it may well be Gaddafi is trying to garner some sympathy,"" she said. 

&gt;""Back in 1986, Gaddafi once claimed that Ronald Reagan, then US president, had launched a strike on his compound in Tripoli and killed his daughter. Many journalists since then dug around and found out that the actual child that had died had nothing to do with Gaddafi, that he sort of adopted her posthumously.""

If that's so, then this is just an attempt to sway popular opinion against NATO. Have you read these articles alleging that his 29 year old son defected and joined the rebels? It actually sounds quite reasonable to believe he murdered them and blamed it on NATO. The Al-Jazeera reporters say it's unfathomable that somebody could have survived this blast... yet Gaddafi and his wife did while his problematic son lay dead.

That could be because they are ill prepared by their upbringing or their could be other factors.

So the idea behind cases is that you love your device so much that you don't want it to get even a scratch. So you keep it in a case.
It becomes bulky and unpleasant. But you know that this is necessary - otherwise the beautiful iPhone will get nasty scratches, right? 
But when you take things into perspective you realize that you impede your enjoyment of the device the entire time you use it. And you do use it - many hours, every day. A year passes and Apple comes out with iPhone 5, and the iPhone 4 not only doesn't seem as awesome - but also it's not really worth as much - scratches and scuffs or not.

This is why I don't use a case - I bought the phone to enjoy it, not to imagine how cool it is inside a bulky plastic case. Parts online aren't that expensive too - I won't mind the cost of replacing some of them if anything gets really messed up.

Also - the iPhone 4 can really take a shitload of damage - the only way a drop can ruin it for real is if it happens to fall on concrete perfectly flat - and the chances of that happening aren't really that high.","1304212233"

(You'll need ACM library access to get the PDF.) It looked like, for rendering purposes, quantum algorithms beat classical ones fairly easily, but mostly by fast search. On the other hand, if you allow preprocessing and nonlinear space (usually *n* log *n* - ish), then some of the more sophisticated classical methods start to look pretty good again.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; If she has the surgery.. I honestly think I could still love her the way I did before I knew all of this. I asked not to see it because there is a big difference between seeing and knowing and she agreed and stated she hates it and thinks it's gross.

Is she in counseling, and is she planning to continue counseling after the surgery? Here is why I'm asking. 

I imagine that feeling like you're ""in the wrong body,"" especially in our uptight society, must be very stressful; and stress is no good for anyone's mental health. Let's suppose the surgery goes well and she's happy with the results. That's not a cure-all for whatever hangups or neurosis she has now. 

I'm not saying she's crazy -- I don't know her; I'm just saying that I imagine that she has issues that she's dealing with and should not be dealing with without professional help, and that she will continue to have issues to work through after the surgery. 

Surgeons are funny people. They don't give a shit about anything except what they do. We're *parts* to them, and they deal with the parts. Think of morbidly obese people getting their stomachs stapled to lose weight. Many of them go and get the surgery, lose some weight, and then put the weight back on. It's because they're still carrying psychological baggage that they haven't dealt with. You can bet their surgeon isn't working through their problems with them.

So, take a good look at your friend and reevaluate her based on what you've learned -- and don't kid yourself. The two of you may be very happy together, but there's work ahead for her, and for anyone she's with.

I've been through really fucking mad shit that I couldn't even type about. I've never killed anyone or served in the military or anything, but have been around mad shit lol. I know that the church would be there for me, if I needed it. 

It's like a backbone I could have if my own (or my own will) was crippled, and it's a place I could gather strength form. 

I'm form England, haven't had my mind spammed (for lack of a better term) towards belief. I grew up without going to church, and haven't even been baptised, as is common these days.

So I think the church here has that view of realness, like life is a hologram through science. Science leaves SPECULATION where the church can step in. But saying creationism is true is FUCKING RIDICULOUS and should NEVER be taught in America. Any christians who support that are undermining themselves.

People tend to keep the same financial habits regardless of increases in income - earn more, spend more.  They don't even do it on purpose, it's the natural course of things unless some outside factor causes them to re-evaluate and re-structure their financial habits. 

Net-worth is a fairly useless figure - it doesn't tell us anything other than a theoretical estimate at how much money a person could get if they liquidated everything they have of value. 
In reality, nobody does that willingly.  The truly wealthy don't look at their net worth like some kind of trophy - they look at making their money work for them to make more money and support their lifestyle reliably and consistently - and they spend their time managing that rather than working for someone else. (And by ""truly wealthy"" I mean ""wealthy because they understand how money works"" not ""Have the most money"")

Anyone who sits around worrying about their net worth is missing the point, and isn't likely to stay wealthy long.

You simply get the person to admit that America was founded on the ideals of the Free Masons, a religious group. After that you simply point out that one it's most cherished ideals is the separation of church and state.

Once that's established their entire argument falls apart, and they will move onto spouting the next bit of bullshit, which will fall apart even easier in the rushed manner that they are forced to think in.

I view it this way: in the beginning, the humanitarian intervention happened mostly because the Security Council and the Arab League were backing intervention in the name of protecting the civilians. Even Rebel command in Benghazi called numerous times for help.

Meanwhile, Gaddafi was all like ""there is an on-going ceasefire"" while his troops were shelling the rebels.

This shows two things : the regime has lost its legitimacy by using force against civilians, and the official declarations of Gaddafi cannot be trusted.

This creates a situation where the sole reasonable cause for a retreat of the american troops would be the death or deposition of Muammar Gaddafi. Even a pledge to a truce cannot be sufficient, since he already broke a few in the past.

You could say that the death of his son is collateral, but I digress. The fact that Saif Al-Arab was in the same house Muammar was clearly shows that the son supported the father.","1304212346"

I used to be a teenager and I know a lot of them that like to seem cool or whatever by raging/ challenging authority. The cop clearly had no intention of arresting anyone when he pulled them over, he just freaked when the one kid became uncooperative. Not defending the cop, he was wrong, just trying to make sense of your sensationalizing for you.  

Who carries around a camera with them and records police encounters unless they are expecting something out of the ordinary to happen or are planning on making something happen that they feel they need to record? That argument is weak at best.

In the evening, you slowly walk up to the highest point of the mountain, through 2 kilometers of graves, the path lit by lanterns on either side. You eventually arrive at a sacred temple surrounded by chanting worshippers that qualifies as one of the most beautiful sights in Japan, but I cannot show it to you, because photography of it is forbidden.

I believe drug abuse can be a problem in itself, but sometime it's only a symptom. Drug abuse can be cause by someone's psychological suffering. Treating drug abuse and believing everything is gonna be fine after withdrawal is wishful thinking. 

You can smoke weed everyday and live a meaningful satisfying life at the same time. But if you are emotionally scarred, smoking weed will probably either  feel awful or provide an excellent escape route.

So if you learn that your kid is smoking weed everyday, you have to consider every possibility.  Is his life going well? Are his grades degrading (haha)? Did he stop seeing friends or doing whatever gets him off? Etc. Talk to him, inform him of risks, etc. If you see he is using weed as an escape mechanism, try to understand where his hurting is coming from. Work with him to make life enjoyable sober. But if he feels like shit and weed make him feel good, regulate his use. We all know weed can be good.

A teacher might respond ""The reasons are complicated and hard to describe. Take many more years of science and math and you will be able to understand."" This response is pretty much the same as ""because I said so,"" but I wouldn't exactly call it indoctrination.

In contrast, there are no deep reasons for the existence of mythical figures. Religions push these ideas early because if they don't it is likely that the child will never believe these things. For religion, indoctrination is all there is.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Improving the margin of uncertainity surrounding cloud feedbacks will not qualitatively change any modern conclusion about anthropogenic global warming; there is just no empirical or sound theoretical evidence to support this notion.

But you can't just start arbitrarily eliminating or approximating forcing mechanisms if you're going to model the system as a whole accurately.  Just because the negative feedback of clouds has been proven to be less magnitude than the positive feedback of CO2 doesn't mean you can just omit that component and still 100% expect a valid result.  The entire system as a whole needs to modeled as a system, with every forcing component accurately equated.  That's all I want.  And again, there are quite a few climate scientists that have stressed how little we know about clouds and want to focus all our resources on them to understand them better.  Why is my position so wrong for wanting a better climate model before we start saying that AGW is as true as gravity?  

I'm not a denier.  I support green initiatives and I'm heavily invested in a few of them.  I expect to have a solar panel on my roof in a couple years.  I think it's best to go green to be safe rather than sorry.  I just want the politics to back away from the scientist to avoid contamination of results.  It's sad when I can predict someones view on AGW by knowing if they vote R or D.  This is not how we have reasonable scientific debate and discovery in this country! ","1304212464"

Yes but you see *there is nothing to indicate that this is true.*

&gt;Nor would there be if that was what does happen.

If you are proposing the existence of minds independent of bodies, you must be positing some sort of dualism, and all of the classical dualisms have been thoroughly disproven.

If you're saying that minds are caused by bodies while the body is alive but then somehow *becomes a separate thing* and fly away when the body dies, well, then what you are proposing is that the laws of physics are dramatically different from normal at the moment when a conscious being dies. Again, *there is no reason to think this is the case.* You are proposing something *extremely* unusual, unexpected, and frankly absurd, so if you have any desire whatsoever to be rational (that is, to possess true beliefs) you must have a mountain of evidence or some damned impressive logical reasoning to back this up.

Otherwise, what separates your idea from this proposition?: Five minutes after you are planning to kill yourself, everyone who is dead (apart from you) will come back to life because they are so sad that your depressing self is going to come visit them.","1304212465"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Rolled my first joint the night before going to a Tool concert.  I had been smoking for about 9 months at that point, but smoked almost exclusively out of pipes.

Bought some papers and watched a couple youtube videos on how to do it.  Practiced a couple times with just tobacco, and then rolled a spliff, with a crutch and everything.  

Then I decided I needed to test it.. so I smoked it in my backyard and got super baked (passed test with exemplary results!)  Then I rolled 2 even better ones to bring to the concert the next night.

A few days before the show I met a kid in a Tool forum who was going to the same show and was staying my town and needed a ride.  I thought, ""perfect, someone to burn with in the car before the show!!""  Turns out he hated people that smoke, but i was like ""fuck it, its my car, i'm smoking it all anyway."" And so I did.

Finally get to the venue and get away from antitree bro (tickets in different sections).  Going in concert, I stashed my other spliff in my shoes cuz they did patdowns and whatever.  Turned out to be a bad idea: not only did it get crushed, but it tasted like foot.

At my seat, during the first song, the guys next to me see me trying to light this mangled-ass joint, and theyre like ""dude just join our circle and hit this"" and pass me this massive joint.  I had never seen anything like it: about 7-8"" long, diameter of a half-dollar coin.  Got incredibly baked and saw one of the best concerts ever.

Now may be it seemed like my eyes were wondering, but we were both good students, the test was simple and it was a common spelling mistake.

This is a very popular claim, and I don't think there's any evidence for it. It's very comforting and easy to think the best strategy is to do nothing, because anything you do might make things worse. 

Sure, maybe they'll yell a bit louder at us, but is that really a bad thing? Suppose fundamentalists focus their efforts on the new atheist movement instead of the education and the law. We're well prepared to fight back, but we have no power for them to take away. It's a complete waste of time for them to argue with us. It's much easier for them to convert moderates to fundamentalism, and to attack education and science.","1304212493"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","You're absolutely correct. I hear a lot of people complaining about this, but I'm willing to bet that many of those same people would complain about a spike in price if their wishes were granted.

I wonder, though... Apple could perhaps create an entire campaign around the fact that they have higher prices because they demand that the people who work in the factories that produce their products be treated fairly with work hours that don't lead to suicide, pay rates that allow them to feed their families and live the equivalent of a middle class life in their countries, etc. There's a segment of the population in the West that *is* willing to pay more if they know they aren't part of this problem. Other companies have similar rules when dealing with the people who produce the products that they sell and their prices are a bit higher. The question is whether or not the *average* consumer is willing to pay a little more for the knowledge that they are *helping* someone else in the world. The bottom line is that China is still a very cheap source of labor even if the workers are paid more and not forced to work 80-hour weeks.

Apple could also absorb most or all of the added costs and perhaps the consumer wouldn't need to pay anything more than they do now (Apple shareholders wouldn't be happy with this, *at first*). Apple could still build a marketing campaign around it and maybe appeal to an even larger number of consumers as a result. I'm sure there are some people (although I'm willing to bet this number is very small) that are not doing business with companies based entirely on the way that the workers are treated. Those consumers could be reached with a marketing campaign that highlights the steps Apple takes to make the factories that produce their goods the happiest places in China.

Personally, I feel badly for the people who work in terrible conditions in order to create the devices that I use every day. I'd be willing to pay more if I knew that these people were treated fairly.","1304212503"

When people just don't want to deal with working it out and can't be arsed with maybe not drinking every night (or some such thing that's causing discord) then they need to suck it up and grow up. I was lucky, my parents were genuinely not right for each other and they both understood that and treated it like adults. They remained friendly, if not friends, and I had an amazing childhood with two full (both got remarried, though the stepparents weren't as good as the real parents of course) families who I am grateful to have had.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","Well, start simple, make sure you have clean gas because it could have just been that fuse. Also read the manual and go through the trouble shooting section. Not sure if this is yours or not, but there is a troubleshooting section on if it won't start:
http://www.troybilt.com/wcpics/TroyBiltUS/en_US/wwcm/769-03502.pdf  

Going the DIY multimeter route, you can test your battery yourself by setting it to DC Volts - touch red to positive and black to negative. If you have a 12V battery then it should read a little more than 12V almost 13v. If you have a low battery, that shouldn't pop a fuse. 

So, you can check the spark plug and wire next. Set your meter to Ohms and check the resistance of the wire. I'm not 100% on what yours should read, maybe 4k to 5k Ohms? It should be a consistent reading, anything more than that and I'd be weary. Also check your plug, you should check it at the beginning of each season anyway. Gap, fouling, etc...

Failing this I'd trace and check the conditions of your wires, ensuring there are no cracks or splits in the shielding, no corrosion on the connections, etc. I'd be most suspicious of wires that are actually touching the frame or body, and passing through holes in the body without a grommet, that could cause a short. You can use your meter to check continuity to assist you in finding a short.  ","1304212529"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; You still haven't properly explained why Bill Gate's children deserve wealth that they didn't create.

firstly because it's very simple: it's the law. for 150 years, we didn't an estate tax. as the country progressed, and we got further and further from the founders' vision, we added it (1913 is when stuff really started to break down - it was the start of the income tax and the fed). the constitution doesn't give the federal govt the power to levy an estate tax.

here are more arguments: 

- your parents' income is already taxed.

- it dis-incentives people to work hard, and hard work benefits others (in aggregate) more than it benefits the earners or their children.

- it caused businesses to go under (if most of someone's wealth is in their business (and VERY common occurrence, including almost ALL family farms), their children MUST SELL THE BUSINESS upon their parents' death to pay the tax, and hence that business fails. people are out of work, goods and services, and the gov't is out of taxes.

- it's the ""natural""/moral law - parents can leave their wealth to ANYONE, and often CHOOSE to leave it with their children. 

- often, wealthy people choose to leave it with their children, because they know they raised their children well (better than average), and know they will use the money in a way which will benefits others (ie continuing their business). 

- it's moral in that a gov't enforces it at gunpoint. whereas allowing the parents to do it their way avoids forcing anyone to do anything against their will when they are not hurting anyone else - the basis of a ""free society"". 

- it causes many productive people to leave the US to avoid the tax, as most countries don't have an inheritance tax. 

- Previous Tax Foundation research has concluded that the estate tax acts as a strong disincentive toward entrepreneurship. A 1994 study found that the estate tax’s 55 percent rate at the time had roughly the same disincentive effect as doubling an entrepreneur’s top effective marginal income tax rate.","1304212534"

I just don't enjoy arguing with someone who knows more than I do (haha :) I just really need some time to study all of it more.

I think for the most part people don't like climate change because they see it as being forced on them. There are of course those that reap great political reward from people's ignorance, and they are the real culprits that are responsible for much of the scientific illiteracy in the US. However, I don't want us to become like the UK, because most of the citizenry seem to believe the science because its ""THE SCIENCE!"", and whatever the scientists say goes. And to an atheist like me, that has the ever so blatant twinge of faith about it. Scientists are not priests. 

That said, it isn't the scientist's fault, its the base apathy most people have when it comes to learning. I just don't see anyone recognizing the fact that many of these individuals are intellectually impoverished. They don't care because its too dangerous to contradict the people that *do* understand the real science behind the facts.

As for some examples of Hollywood country, I'd say most of what Taylor Swift has produced could fit that label, as well as just about every country song that has made it onto the pop charts and/or got significant playing time on pop music stations.","1304212546"

My grandfather was the only person in his village to survive the camps, and he married a German woman after the war who'd been in the female version of Hitler youth.

That side of the family is a clusterfuck of mental illness, so I haven't been able to get any significant detail on anything. My grandfather on the other side was a US air force officer.

I'm standing in a sterile white room with geometric patterns on the walls, a girl is standing in front of me wearing a white jump suit.  She runs down a corridor and I follow; I find her dead, floating in a pool of water.  I scream and find myself back in the white room, the girl is standing and runs down the corridor - once again I find her corpse, which looks like it has been decomposing for several days.  This repeats several times.

The yellow canvas appears again, the cellos start to hum, the man's voice says ""infinitudes made of infinitudes.""  An exponential curve forms on the canvas and grows to reveal that it is made up of many smaller exponential curves.
 
I'm standing in another white room with a table in the corner, a panel slides open in the ceiling and a man starts crawling out - he's holding a gun.  I press a button on the table and the panel slams shut violently, crushing him, everything turns red.  There is no noise other than the sound of breathing.  This continues again and again until, during one cycle, I hide behind the table instead of pressing the button.  I look up and the man is standing right in front of me pointing a gun in my face, I look into his eyes and they are black, his expression is totally blank.

From this point, there are commonly three options how the debate continues:

* Pascal's Wager (never becomes old...)
* Christianity moralizes a society (answer: euthyphron dilemma)
* Faith is wonderful, faith gives strength etc. (answer: compare the faith in god with faith in unicorns)

They also have some days (depending on store) when they have certain items heavily discounted, just to showcase them. I think organic strawberries were this past week for $1.99/lb, cheaper than the $4.99/2lb usually.

I much prefer Trader Joes...generally cheaper, same quality and selection if not better...but I think my city only has Whole Foods so I've learned how to squeeze the most out of this place.","1304212569"

"keto","t5_2rske","Keto diets can be just fine for exercising, but you want to make sure you're doing it right. You wouldn't use a water extinguisher to fight an oil fire right?

The author in that article is basically harping on the idea on running on a all low carb all the time type of keto diet.  And he's right in the idea that you probably wont be able to support a triathlete or body builder on &lt;20g carbs a day doing that for very long.  Fortunately, there is a thing called Cyclical Ketogenic diets where you basically carb up on specific dates to fuel your low carb week/training.  It's extremely effective and carries all the health benefits of a regular ketogetic diet.

Check these out and give them a once over:

**[1](http://www.thinkmuscle.com/articles/mcdonald/training-on-ketogenic-diet.htm)  This is for training on a CKD.  This is the prefered method for athletes who are hardcore.**

**[2](http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/1/1/2) Much better article explaining what your friend was saying.  Basically all-low carbs all the time is not optimal for but can be done.  It's recommended to switch to a targeted carb diet like the one listed above for anyone hardcore, but light exercisers are fine the way they are.**


Also, if you aren't a triathlete or into some very demanding exercise everyday, then you'll be fine.  I lift 3x a week for about 1.5 hours on a non-cyclical diet for about 3 months now and a friend has be doing it for even longer.  You obviously won't see as much gains but you will be fine once your body adjusts to handling strains and exercise on a low carb diet.  There are literally hundreds of studies of types of keto diets and which ones work for who.  Keto dieting isn't just one way, so make one that works for you.  ","1304212574"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","My earliest memory of anything religious was when my mother made my brother an I go to Sunday school once when I was 2 to appease our bible-thumping neighbor. After we got back she apologized and said we didn't have to go again. My mother identified as episcopalian and had a bible on the bookshelf and I remember reading it like any other book but I don't recall her ever actually praying or going to church, we definitely didn't. My father, to this day, has never mentioned religion. So with that in mind definitely no influence from my family.

I do, however, remember being skeptical from a very young age. I remember _not_ believing in Santa/other holiday creatures. I remember not_ believing in ghosts especially since my brother was terrified of them, and is to this day, so if a fuse blew he'd make me go into the basement and fix it because he thought there was a ghost in our house.

Even when we moved to a very rural town with quite ardent believers I always identified as agnostic (before I knew the term atheist or understood that I was really an agnostic atheist) and taking pot-shots at the bible-thumping kids around me in highschool who weren't familiar enough with their faith to know how to retort but were still somehow stuck with it. My close friends were of similar stances though it definitely wasn't a reason they were my friends as I didn't find out until later: 3 agnostic, 2 deist and one solipsist (truly an atheist but he liked to pretend to be a solipsist to ""blow people's minds"")","1304212575"

Yes, it is.  They are separate people.  The people in the government are not the people not in the government.

&gt;The government is the people.

The government is not the people.  The government is some of the people.  The rest of the people are not the government.

&gt;Your insistence that it is separate and above everybody else is the only thing tying your worldview together, and it is utterly wrong. 

It is not the one thing tying my worldview together.  And it is not utterly wrong.  It is utterly right.  You are utterly wrong.  You believe in a mystical reality that is not objective reality.  By your asinine worldview, the Jews in WW2 Germany Holocausted themselves.

&gt;They are elected from the people, not from a special caste above them. 

They are not elected by ""the people,"" as if ""the people"" is one single blob that says yay or nay.  ""The people"" is an abstract mental term only that refers to the real objective world of separate individuals.  SOME individuals happen to support the institution of a monopoly enforcer of violence, who takes from some and gives to themselves and others.  Others do not.  Those who do not, are exploited and subjected to violence.  

&gt;They elected by the people, not by a mysterious illuminati controlling the world.

The choice is not between the people or the illuminati.

The choice is between a larger proportion of the population or a smaller proportion of the population.

In the area of land called the US, 21% of the people support the current government.

&gt;They are subject to the same rules as the people, no matter how much you insist that they don't pay tax or obey the rules.

The government is not taxed.  The government is the institution that taxes.  The government does not obey rules.  The government sets the rules.

&gt;If they don't then that is not democracy, that is corruption.

Democracy is just corruption that is supported by enough members of the population to make the corruption extended over time.

&gt;Allowing Amazon to be above the law and not pay tax? 

""The law"" is just a euphemism for the rules the state imposes on others not in the state.  To be ""above the law"" is to just not support or consent to the government's rules.  But that doesn't mean that one is against rules per se.

Taxes are against rules in a free society.

Not paying taxes is closer to a free society's rules.

&gt;That is corruption.

It is not corruption to resist corruption.  Taxes is corruption.

&gt;Corruption is a bad thing, if you couldn't figure that out on your own.

Stealing is corruption.  Taxes is stealing.  Thus taxes is corruption.

&gt;Only 51% may like a thing, but 100% choose to live in the democratic state understanding that sometimes they are in the other 49%. They are not being tyrannized by this.

Yes, they are, because it is tyrannical to pay money and to obey people you never consented to pay or obey.

&gt;If they did not like it, they can leave the state. 

The state does not include private property.  Private property means that if non-owners do not agree with the owner, then the non-owner has to leave the private property.

&gt;Don't say they can't leave, there are many ways to leave. Of course, you are probably too stupid or lazy to do them.

The government can leave.

&gt;You refuse to allow people freedom of association. To form a state if they want to.

Freedom of association precludes the state and makes the state impossible.

The state does not have 100% support, ever.  If they did, then they would not need to use guns to collect people's money.  People would pay them voluntarily.

Freedom of association is relevant at the individual level, not the 51% level.","1304212607"

But when I started reading about the other games they had planned on making way back in 1998, I started feeling like they were changing a great formula. I never really cared for *Munch's Oddysee.* I felt as though the transition to 3D changed what I loved about the original two. It didn't help that the game was a bit more cartoon-y than the earlier installments. I never played *Stranger's Wrath* though, and while I've heard good things I'm not sure if I was ever keen on the concept. And now we have a real-time strategy concept. I know it's something Oddworld Inhabitants planned from the beginning, and it might still be good, but I don't think anything could ever surpass the magic of the first two games. 

Basically, what I'm saying is, if you haven't played *Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee* or *Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus,* you should definitely check them out. ","1304212610"

Bullshit. Would you be here arguing if the law they were trying to pass was one that forbid the amputation of any other body part besides the one that was amputated from you? Somehow I doubt it. 

You feel that you have no option but to defend circumcision, otherwise you would be admitting that there is something wrong with your penis that can never be fixed; that there was an injustice perpetrated upon you by the people that were supposed to protect you. 

&gt;What is so essential about it? 

Essential has two definitions; it can mean necessary or fundamental/inherent. While the foreskin might not be necessary to live, it is definitely an intrinsic part of mammalian anatomy. 

What body parts would you say are necessary? The eyes are needed to see but they are not necessary for life. Are you honestly advocating that we be allowed to amputate any body part from another person that is not directly linked to keeping them alive? 

Even cutting off someone's earlobes is considered mutilation and earlobes serve a lot less function than the foreskin. 

&gt;Once again, I don't have mine and I've gotten along just fine. So far the only positive I've seen about having a foreskin is the alleged sensitivity issue. 

What about the men that haven't gotten along just fine, do they not matter? Why is your opinion more valid than theirs?

It is very difficult to find first hand accounts of the Holocaust, one must rely on very rare public testimony like heroic Katherine Schweitzer provided, or anecdotal evidence as in Moshe Kaplan’s case, one reference was a book maybe by Jersey Kosinski which was the memoir of one of the Jewish guides KS spoke of, who recruited then accompanied the transports of Jews to Auschwitz.

In that book there is an account of Hungarian Jews arriving at the Auschwitz rail head, who made a fuss about porters and such, surely it could have been the Schweitzers.

**This is Holocaust truth**, the Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed, witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s testimony re his Amsterdam family emerging unscathed, his claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for those Jews who were gassed.

&gt;Katherine Schweitzer was a Hungarian Jew the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust, last seen alive in Sydney 22 December 2006, she had gone public in the nineties on the television show Australian 60 Minutes, saying the Jew who arrested her and her family in 1944, had taken up residence on the same street in Sydney.

&gt;30 November 2006, I put her account of her arrest and internment in Auschwitz in a Union email that went world wide to around five thousand e addresses, 28 December 2006 her body was found in a wheelie bin inside her high security apartment!

&gt;Maybe she was murdered by Jew elements in reprisal for telling the truth, to warn any other Jews who want the truth to come out just what the consequences will be, Fritz-Harry Cremer could have talked his way into her apartment and murdered her.

**Ed:** FHC has subsequently denied involvement!

Kaplan was a pilot who had served in the RAAF in WW2, who had known Bomber Harris, the British commander of the air raid on Dresden in 1945 and had flown on that mission, after the war he had flown Lockheed Electras for KLM in Holland, and for Lufthansa. 

&gt;He was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

He was the image of the actor who played Emmanuel Goldstein in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I confronted him with that, and asked him how Radford had obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he was unforthcoming.

He told me that after the war he had returned to Amsterdam and took up where he had left off, my response was that it must have been heart rending to go back to Europe, which must have been empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way, he said no, that it was good, I said sure, but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine.

&gt;I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot of them rounded up and sent to Auschwitz, indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazis was set in Amsterdam. 

&gt;And Stanley Kramer’s great movie Ship of Fools, based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city, where the ship finally docked after being turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz, gas and death.

&gt;Moshe nodded sagely, he said that my understanding of the Jews was not all that it might be, he told me that he was indeed a Pharisee, and that the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted for instance in The Diary of Anne Frank, were although Jews, not in the same category as him. 

&gt;They were he told me, called Cheesies since their diet consisted largely of that product, and yes they were missing from the community, and that was because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand that as far as he was concerned they were neither missed nor mourned.

Look then at The Holocaust as being a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazis who would do the dirty work, to reduce the number of those Jews who might if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end. 

And to clean up any racial minority, or dissident group who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of being a threat some time in the future.

Thus the trade unionists, commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies, and the lunatic fringe were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles and in Hitler’s words exterminated. After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs that had carried the dirty deeds were themselves murdered. 

&gt;Ernst Rohm, murdered with numerous of his thug mates in The Night of the Long Knives massacre in June 1934, was leader of the thug SA movement, the bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day.

Witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gasfitters Union in Germany, deeds that were done to empower the Nazis, after they had emerged as a political force with Hitler at their helm in the late 1920’s, murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along until they were the dominant political force, gaining absolute power in 1933.

&gt;The relationship with Moshe Kaplan had run its course by the mid 1980’s, it was in many ways similar to the relationship between Rod Steiger in the title role, and Jaime Sanchez as Jesus Ortega, in Sydney Lumet’s great 1964 film The Pawnbroker, thus does life imitate art. 

&gt;He visited me in hospital, after antisocial scab elements had driven a dockyard crane at me, while I was union delegate at Cairncross Dock in 1984, severing four toes on my right foot, and was kind toward my sister and her infant child in 1985.

&gt;I left that address in ’86, in subsequent inquiries those that knew him were uncertain, and given his at least moderately advanced years, one supposed the worst. 

&gt;Until the television news one evening in 1993 had a report from Israel, of a violation by Israel, of deal extensively negotiated by Scandinavian peacemakers, that was to guarantee the at least limited withdrawal of Israeli forces from the city of Hebron.

Moshe Dyan Kaplan was visible in a group of similarly attired Jews, who were to their credit, witnesses of Israeli treachery.","1304212636"

"science","t5_mouw","Sorry, perhaps I didn't make that very clear. Let me try to elaborate: I propose that, unless we are climatologists arguing with other climatologists, we should acknowledge openly in these debates neither of us know what we're talking about and can't speak to someone's critiques or arguments in support of the scientific consensus. 

ie. ""I am not a climate scientist, and neither are you. So as much as I think your argument goes against the prevailing science, I am not confident in my qualifications to specifically answer your concerns. I am curious, though, what if any objections you might have to say, a cap-and-trade climate policy in* a hypothetical world where climate change is real? Those are concerns I feel more confident in speaking to.""

Not only is this position more honest (let's be fair, few environmentalists really understand climate change either), it's also more productive. This is* because we may be able to speak to their critiques of climate change or energy policy, if we know what those are. In most cases, those critiques go far beyond the simple contention that ""climate change is a hoax,"" so we should be interested in what critiques they offer outside of their more ignorant persistence in climate change denial.

TL,DR: I simply mean that we shouldn't waste our time in an argument about science that is probably going nowhere. We can actually have more meaningful exchanges about the issue if we dispense with the folly of trying to refute their pseudo-science.","1304212653"

Alright, personal story time, throw away account.

At the ripe age of 19 I was in the area with a hair trimmer, tending to the ol' gooch, when I decided to go a little further... then a little further... and before I knew it, I'd trimmed my ass crack fairly thoroughly, just about down to stubble.

Things were pretty alright for a while.  I'd experienced some of the sweaty-crack-syndrome you will read about elsewhere on this lovely page, but nothing too bad.

A few more days go by and things start to go terribly wrong.  I was experiencing some serious pain, which I assumed was from nubs of hair rubbing against skin in the area, and no amount of Gold Bond was soothing my troubles.  I did some research and the internet verified that this was a pretty typical affliction for idiots researching the dangers of shaving the male ass crack after they'd committed the crime.  There's probably support groups.

Anyway, things don't get better.  I'm taking off days of work to chill at home and endure the pain.  Then, against my will I make the decision to road trip three hours to participate in a somewhat mandatory bonding experience for new mentors in the service organization I had enrolled in.

We're swimming around in a lake, myself, with a very pained look on my face, I'm sure, when I decide to use the restroom and drop a deuce.  Things go wrong... I begin bleeding out of my ass, I probably lost more than a pint of blood.  Smartphones not being so widespread, I call a good friend of mine who happens to live nearby to ask him where the nearest acute care clinic is.

I roll up to the clinic, wondering if there's a huge blood stain on the shorts I'm wearing (luckily not).  Of course, it's a long wait, and when I get called back, of course it's a hott nurse.  She spreads my cheeks, and then leaves to get the doctor.  He arrives, she spreads my cheeks again and he explains I've developed a hemorrhoid.  Not just any hemorrhoid, but an external, thrombosed hemorrhoid... he administers a local anesthetic and pops that sucker.  More blood.

""How did you develop this hemorrhoid?"", he asks me.  I explain that I'd trimmed my ass a couple weeks ago, and he tells me that hemorrhoids do not develop simply from in-grown ass hairs or anal chaffing.  At the time, I couldn't pin it on anything.  ""Have you been engaging in rectal sex?"", he queries.  The nurse is wide-eyed.  ""I'm sorry?!?!"", I ask... he repeats the question.  ""NO,"" I reply, ""absolutely not.""  He lets me be on way, eventually.

Three hours later, after a shady phone call to the other mentors-to-be explaining that I suddenly got extremely ill, I'm home again.  Having been forced to call my parents to obtain insurance information, they also demand answers.  ""Son, one of the causes of hemorrhoids is sodomy.  Have you been engaging in anal sex??""  ""NO!"", I explain again.  ""Mom, Dad, seriously, I love vagina!"" (honest quote).

It was only later that I connected a strenuous ab workout as the initial catalyst of the hemorrhoid, but for fuck's sake... Don't shave your ass and get a thrombosed hemorrhoid, people start to think things.","1304212668"

PyPy's speed results definitely look promising. I'd also be interested to see a comparison to Jython, as I understand Jython is a python implementation for the JVM and should hence also benefit from HotSpot's JITting.","1304212674"

All that I was saying that you have a right to ask your SO to do any wacky shit you want, and they have a right to dump you if they find the request unreasonable. People asking their SO not to do something they find uncomfortable is not unusual or that crazy. If a couple agrees that porn and masturbation is a-okay, good for them. If someone isn't cool with it, and asks their boyfriend not to do it, and he's like ""yeah, okay, I don't need it"" (or the contrary), good for them. What works for them, works for them, it's no one else's business.

It's the difference between necessary and unnecessary risk. 
2. Financial pressures are very real and can leave people in a position vulnerable to exploitation. Again, considering the risk and the profit made by the distributors, I'd say that porn stars are poorly paid.
3. The individual porn star has an interest in projecting a positive image of porn to please their employers. A lot of customers would be discouraged if alerted to the fact that the object of their desire hates doing porn.

"Bad_Cop_No_Donut","t5_2qqdb","Just take a moment to really think about the four options you presented:

* **A) Some cop wants to intimidate you.** What does he get out of that personally? Nothing. In fact, if he's a cop with a bad record, this might actually make things worse for him. If he's a cop with a good record, why would he want to intimidate you? Neither possibility seems likely. I can see how the department as a whole might want to intimidate you, but the entire department isn't doing this. One cop is doing this, and intimidation doesn't make a lick of sense.

* **B) Get incriminating evidence for later.** No, that's not how it works. There's something called a [statute of limitations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations). If they have evidence that they can use to charge you with a crime, but they don't charge you promptly, they'll be unable to charge you if they wait too long. This isn't going to happen.

* **C) They genuinely understand your concerns.** Okay, sure. Let's assume that it's true. Then why don't they tell you that over the phone? Why not leave you some mail, or send an email back? Do you really think that they're suddenly going to hand you a list of internal affairs investigations, reprimands, etc. Why now? Why didn't they do that earlier, and why don't they just mail it to you now that they've apparently completely changed their minds? It makes no sense.

* **D) Arrest you.** Ding ding ding, you've got it! Why is this your last option? None of the other options you proposed made any sense. This, however, makes perfect sense. Police have quotas they need to meet. From their point of view, anyone complaining about law-enforcement is probably a lawbreaker, so they think you've got something to hide. What's more, they think you're an asshole because you're trying to dig up dirt on them. They can arrest you, their coworkers will think they're a hero, and they'll be one step closer to meeting their monthly quota.

You won't gain any of the information you originally wanted by going to the police station in person. I guarantee it. If they wanted to give you that information, you would already have it. Do not go there. You are not a lawyer. You don't know if you've broken some obscure law, but they do, and they're counting on it, and that's why they want you to go there.

If you want the information, send them FOIA requests. That's the proper way to do this.

"rit","t5_2qh3x","Well, I, for one, super love the technology field but I had no background in it. Between my mom's crazy hatred of computers and my backward southern high school, I had pretty much no chance of working with them. We didn't have Internet until I was in sixth grade (I'm 19 now, so that means about 11 years old...2003-ish?), and then it was dial-up. My mom would frequently take the cables and lock away ""her"" laptop that she bought for us to use. My dad always supported us with technology (actually he built us desktops and stuff), but we only saw him sporadically every couple of weeks and then not at all for years. In school the only classes that were offered in technology were typing and computers 101 (how to save a word document, how to turn on a computer, how to find a file, stuff any moron knows). 

I switched after my first quarter at RIT from biomedical sciences to ANSA, with the encouragement of several career tests and my SO who was in ANSA and very similar personality-wise. My mom almost flipped, but I love computing and info tech and don't regret the switch. Yes, it was hard as hell for me for the first couple of quarters while I felt like I was drowning in the geek terminology I had never been exposed to, but I made it through with all A's and have been very successful in my co-ops and everything else.

TL;DR: I switched from biomedical sciences (pre-vet) to ANSA with no technical background in computers, let alone networking, because my mom and high school didn't encourage technical learning, and have done very well and loved every minute of it. I had to work really hard to catch up, but just because I wasn't exposed to it doesn't mean I couldn't make the leap to the major.","1304212756"

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Range voting is certainly easier to explain to people than AV is (sadly more a reflection on the average voter and the media's FUD than on AV itself), and it does have some other benefits too. However, the choice we have now is between broken old FPTP and AV.

I'm a strong believer in PR, and of course there are many ways of doing that. I think the best way may be to use [Range voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting) or [Approval Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) to work out the winner of each constituency, and then have top up seats to make the results proportional. There's also [additional member system (AMS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mixed_member_proportional_representation) which uses FPTP for each constituency plus top up seats, and [Alternative Vote Plus (AV+)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AV%2B) which uses AV for each constituency plus top up seats.

Then there's [STV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) as favoured by the Lib Dems and the Electoral Reform Society. One of the main advantages of that over the other systems of PR I mentioned above is that it doesn't result in 2 types of MP, those that represent a constituency and those that are top ups.

They're all much better than FPTP though. AV is not perfect, but it's certainly better than FPTP, and it opens the door to future reform. A No result will be used by the top 2 parties as justification to prevent future reform.","1304212782"

I was into music and the anti-mainstream crowd, so I had long hair, smoked pot, and was in a number of rock bands. I love sports now, and really really regret not playing any in high school. The closest I can get to a competitive sport now is a bar league softball team or an intramural basketball team.

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt; If these ideas are just one or two concepts removed from a mathematical technique in wide use for understanding the real world, please mention that.

Algebraic geometry is the ""technique"" you might be looking for.  It is one of the most significant and modern fields of mathematics.  It is also famously difficult and abstruse, so even seeing the connections between its ideas, or its connections to other areas, requires a large amount of work.  Nevertheless, there are [many applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#Applications).  It is also reasonable to expect that there will be more applications, simply due to how connected algebraic geometry is to other areas of mathematics.

As mathman1 says, the particular area of étale cohomology has primarily been applied to number theory, which has primarily been applied to cryptography, but over-focusing on such direct links defeats the purpose of doing science.  When we look through a telescope, or study anti-matter at CERN, or dig into the Earth's mantle, or explore the mathematical consequences of solving polynomial equations, our primary interest is in answering the question: ""What is out there?""

Only once we know what is there, do we worry about what we're going to do with it.  This basic scientific principle requires some faith, but looking back through history is adequate to justify its effectiveness.  Even algebra, without which the modern world would not be possible, began as an exploratory game.

The fact is, 99% of science has no obvious direct applications, but for some reason it's always mathematicians that get heckled about it.  How about the 7.5 billion euro circle that is not guaranteed to produce a single practical advance?  Of course I'm being facetious; there is huge value in exploration, but it is very hard to explain it concretely to someone who must, in the famous words of Euclid, ""profit from what he learns.""","1304212794"

&gt;The list itself contains one female writer out of seventy five. 

When listing my favourite authors, most of them would be men, too. That is the case because most authors who can be called ""timeless"" or ""classic"" are men. Maybe you haven't noticed this, but the social position of women in the last generations led to them mostly being absolutely cliche and for emancipated authors becoming classics, it will take another few generations.

&gt;But the composers of that kind of list probably wouldn't be so exclusionary with the language they use to write their article.

Yeah, because not making every list for women is sexist.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","I should start by pointing out a few general things. ""[Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialism)"" is a *very* big tent, and that there's no ""One True Socialist Way"", and if anyone tells you differently, they don't know what they're talking about and they're instead trying to advocate for *their* specific brand of socialism. 

However, there are some general, broad categories of socialism on which most socialists can agree. For example, there's *[market socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/market_socialism)*, which is worker ownership of the means of production, except in a market economy. All of your questions regarding socialism are irrelevant when it comes to market socialism, because there's still financial incentive, wages, price as an indicator, etc. The only thing that changes from market capitalism is *who* reaps the benefits. Some people, like me, think that market socialism must happen first, to wean people off of capitalism, others disagree and want an immediate transition to socialism ""proper"". 

With ""regular"" socialism (or just ""socialism""), things get a lot more complicated. Under socialism, you generally don't have a market economy anymore, and with that big change, you need to seriously restructure society and the economy. Instead of ""production for profit"", all of the productive capacities of society are geared toward ""[production for use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_for_use)"", where goods and services are produced/rendered to meet the needs of society. Under such a society, you'd likely have no mortgages, no bills, social services like healthcare, retirement, etc., provided for free. You would work to do your part for society, and in exchange, all of your needs would be met. ""[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need)"". If, in a capitalist society, you were a construction worker building residential housing, in a socialist society, you'd still be a construction worker building residential housing, but in exchange for your labor (or whatever labor you perform), you would be able to have subsidized housing, a subsidized car, access to a plethora of free government services, etc. 

The attitude about work would change. Work would be a means to an end, and no longer seen as the end itself. 

The point is that you put in what you can, and take out what you need. Sure, you can technically get this in a capitalist market economy, but you'll likely **never** earn enough or have enough social safety nets to lead a dignified existence. So socialism, if properly implemented and allowed to grow, is all about guarantees for the producers of society. You work, you get your needs met. 

Now, to your specific questions: 

&gt; And how does a socialist society know if what they are building will be useful or not before they build it? In a capitalist system price in an indicator that tells people if they should or should not proceed with the production of a product (factory) so that resources are not wasted. Does an indicator like this exist in socialism?

""Price"" in this context is basically ""voting with your dollar"". Under capitalism, corporations produce products to satisfy demand, which is determined by what people have bought in the past. So really, under socialism, all you'd need is another ""voting"" mechanism to determine demand. This could be as simple as (my opinons) people logging onto a government website to literally vote on what kinds of they'd like to buy in the near future, or a more realistic scenario is for society to incorporate [labor vouchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_voucher), a non-monetary form of currency. Labor vouchers would be different from money in that only *you* could spend your labor voucher, and they couldn't be transferred to others or invested, so they could not be stolen, and no one could ""make money off of money"". The credits on your labor voucher would be used to ""buy"" goods and services, thereby determining demand, or let you have a bigger house than your neighbor, if you wanted to spend some of your extra labor vouchers on a larger home instead of having your government-subdized home (which would already be a generous size, since the working class is in charge). 

How you would distribute labor vouchers is debatable, and can be decided when the time comes. 

&gt; I am trying to understand how the principle of socialism “equality for all and the ownership of the means of production by the masses” is used to create large scale projects and progress a society.

and 

&gt; How does socialism work in this situation? Does everyone get an equal say on how or what type to build?

If we go with the labor vouchers above as an indicator of demand, and goods are produced for use instead of profit, then the answer is simple: just look to demand to see what people want, and build accordingly. ","1304212814"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not sure if you watched the video....

The title of the youtube montage title says ""The GOP Meets the Main Street Movement"". That's an indication the montage will be about financial problems/issues. The first clip shows a gentleman asking a questions about taxes, and the people booing when they are lied too by the representative. And it continues with the tax cuts. It moves to the medicare portion, with other representatives lying. There are people asking questions and making points that people under 55 (no fucking old people) will be screwed by Ryan's budget plan. There is a clip of trickle down entitlements not working, and paying people into the system and are worried they will not get their returns. Another gentleman questions why for profit insurance companies should be in charge of medical decisions. And it ends with a lady questioning why the poor should carry the water on broken backs, while the top skates by. 

So if you watched the video you'd see it's not the fucking elderly crying about what they lose, they are trying to be heard about what others will lose. It's people calling out the assholes who are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of Americans. 

As much as I will fight for gay rights, and woman's rights- this subject and effort is pointing out the GOP lies and resistance from people about economic issues. The economy is a more pressing issue to the average American. It's difficult for a family to feel sorry for a person in prison when people are wondering how they will pay their bills and if they can find work this week. Wondering if they should sit at home and hope the pain in their abdomen will go away because they can't afford the deductibles, time off work and increase in premiums to get it checked out and discover it's something serious. It's people wondering what the fuck this has all been about, wondering if their children will have a worse life then the ones we have led. ","1304212831"

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","Cafe: dizi very close to dizengoff square. Ask for the regular breakfast. It is a great example of a fun israeli breakfast, which is the best kind of breakfast in the world. :-)

Other foods you should try if you haven't already: Humus (in a real humus place), Sabich, Shawarma/falafel, white cheese - there are many kinds of white low-fat kinds of cheese which are unique to israel, in particular the israeli cottage cheese. Oh, and nonalcoholic malt beer which I love - it's like a nontoxic version of coke, and only made in israel AFAIK.

In general, Tel-Aviv has awesome food. Name your preferences and I'll be more specific. 

If you go to Jaffa (and you should) I recommend going to Abu-Hassan humus and eating the MASABAHA, which is probably the best in the universe. Come early, the place opens around 5:00 AM and closes at noon when the humus runs out - http://humus101.com/EN/2007/02/13/abu-hassan-the-glorious-jaffas-hummus/

Museums: too many to list but Yad Vashem is probably a must.

Beaches: many good ones - gordon/frishman/bugrashov and more. Most of them have beach-chairs with shade (which costs a little bit of money) or you can bring a towel to sit on.

The northern tel aviv port is quite nice to hang around at during the weekend, with many places to eat, lots of bicyclers, a farmers market and more. It has special events occasionally, like the toys exhibit starting this tuesday (till saturday, in hangar 22 building).

Night clubs/bars - many places, but the big parties are concentrated on thursday and friday evening. I would check timeout magazine to find clubs with music to your liking. Don't go to Joey's pub. Actually it's probably best to avoid places on Allenby street altogether (they're pretty seedy and mostly have terrible music and crowd).

Jerusalem: take bus number 480 (run by Egged). It takes less than an hour and gets from Tel Aviv Arlozerov bus/train station (also known as RAKEVET-MERKAZ, or train-central) to Jerusalem's central bus station. Jerusalem is a must, particularly the old town and the market (MAHNE YEHUDA market). There's a tourist information place in the old town (next to jaffa gate).

Bathing in the dead sea is also great for a day trip and a unique experience (probably a marked as a must in all travel books).

Don't worry too much about breaking any Taboos. Israelis are generally pretty rude and don't care about politeness. You can just say whatever you think. If you do anything inappropriate someone will tell you.

Something to note is that a lot of things close on saturday (starting from friday afternoon), including most museums and most public transportation, so plan accordingly and ask around.

Msg me if you're interested in meeting for beer. I might even be able to convince my girlfriend to come (""what? to meet some weirdo from the internet?"").

Enjoy your visit, there's lots to see.

But as long as Hamas' ultimate goal is the destruction of Israel, why should Israel do anything to help Hamas achieve that goal, such as lifting the Gaza blockade &amp; giving them open borders to import weapons.

Even now Hamas is regularly shooting rockets into Israel, despite the fact that Israel withdrew from Gaza.

So now that there is a unity government with the West Bank Israel has even less incentive to lift the occupation because they can say that doing so does not bring peace ... it merely makes it easier for Hamas to target more parts of Israel.

However, even though she's gained a ton of weight she still looks skinny at a certain angle because you can see her ribs.  Our dog is a pit mix though so they are generally skinnier and built more like tanks with a lot of muscle.  Its wierd because she's fed a ton of food twice everyday and gets treats like rawhides and other stuff.  I'd say just ask your neighbor about it like champagne_666 down there said, it can't hurt.

I have ~plus 15 wins with ~300 games won, my friend is on the same boat but with the -15. When I solo queue, and when I duo queue with him, I get immensely different games. On my solo, I usually find nice and friendly people, with a generally good team comp (it's rare to not get a tank + jungler on a team), and even when we lose no one rages. When I duo with him, I'm already set to a loss. Feeders, ragers, leavers, you name it, the play quality is awfull, and the people are even worse.  
  
My advice is the following: Stop picking to complement your team. Start picking to have fun, and ignore the rage. You're most likely not bad, but if you're not enjoying yourself you play worse.  
  
Once you get a positive ratio (or even a 50/50), you'll get nicer people, and you can start actually improving your game.

Hydrogen bonding is significantly stronger than Van der Waals forces, and therefore the energy they hold is significantly higher as well. 

For example, compare water (boiling point of 100C) to [dimethylether](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_ether) (CH3OCH3, boiling -23 C).  Higher molecular weight normally results in a higher boiling point, if it were not for hydrogen bonding we would expect water to have a boiling point below dimethylether.  

Common oils are significantly higher molecular weights than water, close to 1000 g per mole, compared to water which is 18 g per mole.   Olive oil boils at about 300 C, so it can get significantly hotter, but the actual amount of heat per g is actually less than water.","1304212901"

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","You're quite welcome, and I'm glad you've gotten so much out of my post.

About the conversion. I'm getting an orthodox conversion, and my reasons for this are twofold. First of all, I know that an orthodox conversion, being the strictest one around, will absolutely require me to know the most about Judaism. I have a lot of questions and just going through the orthodox conversion will answer many of them for me. It's a lot of work and study, and the amount of information I need to learn is quite intimidating. Nonetheless, it's important to me that I learn the most about the faith I'm growing into and adopting for myself, and I'm willing to put forth that effort and more. Second, I want everyone to recognize my conversion as legitimate. Orthodox conversions are universally accepted, and I don't want anyone down the line telling me I'm not Jewish, especially if it's because I disagree with them on some point and they pull out the ""Well you're a convert and your opinion doesn't count"" card. This isn't likely to happen; most Jews respect converts just as much as any Jew. However, more is expected of us...converting is taken so seriously that we are expected to practice stricter than most Jews even, if only for the sake of proving that we take our conversion seriously. We are looked at as suspect, and there are plenty of historical reasons to justify this, but it's still something to consider.

A conservative conversion, depending on where you go, can be just as strict as an orthodox one from what I understand. However, there is a lot of variation within the movement, so be sure to ask exactly what will be involved with your conversion process if you decide to go this path. Many people recognize conservative conversions as legitimate, and they certainly are most of the time. But each stricter movement has the tendency to look down on its less-strict counterparts, and so there is the possibility that you'll run into trouble with a conservative conversion. However, 99% of the time, the difference will just not come up...most people will respect your status as a Jew and you won't have anything to worry about. But every religion has it's assholes who will look down on you and tell you you're not good enough for them. They're mostly to be ignored, but I figure it's better to have people respect you first than doubt you before you even get the chance to prove to them that you take this seriously.

I'm not sure what I'm going to practice once I convert. The awkward thing about being a convert is you have no minhag, no custom to follow. Individual families and synagogues have customs about certain practices that aren't halachikally unambiguous, and as a convert you have no tradition to follow. As for how strict I will practice, that's a whole other question. I will probably practice modern orthodox or traditional conservative, which is what my friend who taught me everything I know about Judaism practices. I've already followed her example on a lot of things and adopted a lot of her customs...she is the closest thing I have to a Jewish family and so I'm okay with adopting her practice as my own. But at the same time I'm an individual and I can make decisions for myself about how I want to practice my Judaism. This tension will probably be something I have to deal with increasingly as I get closer and closer to my conversion. You've already seen that there's a lot of variation in how people practice Judaism, and while there is a tendency for some people to tell you that any way but theirs is wrong, I would caution you against giving these people too much concern. You can be whatever kind of Jew you want...conservative, orthodox, reform, whatever. You may run into problems in the future with people questioning your motives or your practice, but ultimately that decision is yours and none of their business.

My friend suggests that you start talking to rabbis, from both movements, and finding someone you're comfortable with. That's the most important thing: that you find someone who is willing to work with you, who is understanding of your concerns and your reasons for converting, and who will be both patient and instructive throughout the process. If you happen to find a conservative rabbi you like, raise your concerns, if any, about converting conservative instead of orthodox. He won't be offended...he has a degree in what he does and will know better than I how to approach that problem. He will surely be honest with you and take your concern seriously. So just be honest yourself and tell him what's on your mind. Be open to the process and be open to yourself as you proceed. There's a lot of change ahead for you (and me) if you decide to go through with this. And keep in touch with me as you do! I'd love to talk about conversion with you as we seem to have similar experiences and we can certainly learn from one another. Send me a private message any time!","1304212927"

"Pets","t5_2qh6o","As a non-registered veterinary technician, I can say that this is absolutely true.  Keep in mind also that the animal body can be a funny thing.  Pets can live, sicken, or die under strange or unlikely conditions.  Medical situations are not necessarily a matter of clear-cut ""do x treatment or y will happen"", and vets tend to make what they feel are the best/safest recommendations.  
That said, you should always feel comfortable with your vet, as well as with their diagnosis and applied treatment.  There's nothing wrong with going to a different doctor (or different practice altogether) for a second opinion.  I strongly believe that there needs to be trust between hospital and client.
I've been lucky to have always worked with wonderful veterinarians who know their stuff and care about pets and owners alike.  There are bad doctors and bad clinics out there, but just because your vet recommended an expensive treatment doesn't mean that they're one of the bad ones.  

tl;dr: The best care is often the most expensive.  I wish it weren't, but it is.","1304212930"

Just here to say that I'm very interested in watching you through your development and would ask in advance that you go into a lot of detail about all problems big or small you came into and how you resolved them.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt; Because I'm 40, fuck learning stuff.

First of all, ""learning stuff"" and ""getting a degree"" are not the same thing, though they may overlap.

""Learning stuff"" is a fucking job requirement for a developer. I started in game development (MIPS assembler and C++ on Playstation) fully self taught and have taught myself countless languages, methodologies, tools, APIs, etc. in subsequent years, working in everything from embedded devices/drivers to distributed web applications.  If you were under the impression that you learn everything in school, then just go out an apply it, you'll be quickly disabused of that notion by your first real job. Getting thrown in the deep end and being expected to figure it out is par for the course. If you don't have monster research skills, if you can't teach yourself and aren't constantly learning, you'll be shit in this profession.

I simply asked him to justify the remark, ""You'll want a degree by age 40."" Why? And why 40? Why not 30? Why not 50? I just wanted to know where that arbitrary number came from.

&gt; then why would creators have any desire to create for anyone else other than themselves

People create things that today are protected under IP law for money. It would be for the same reasons that people create things if we ended IP.

&gt; It seems to me that a lot of the ideas and inventions that we have today would not exist if the creators had no way of being compensated or method of owning their IP. 

This is completely incorrect, In fact if it was not for IP we would have more inventions and more advanced technology because everyone would be able to freely learn from each other without fear of IP law suits. People would get compensated for actually turning the idea in to a product that meets a demand. Right now there are big issues over programming patents where patent organizations purely exist to buy up patents and wait until someone uses something similar and sue them. Currently people actually do not get compensated directly from the IP. (unless from an IP law suit) They actually get compensated from the sale of goods and services. So even without the IP someone who creates a new method of making a sandwich could still sell that method to a company with a contract that gives him money when they sell a sandwich. 

&gt; This also leaves open the question of how should authors and musicians be protected from say someone else plagiarizing their work and releasing it (even if it wasn't for profit; ie. I take ""Against Intellectual Property"" remove the author's name put my own on it and host it for free on my website; now extend this example to what if I did do it for profit and started selling books with his written words without his permission). 

The person selling the goods will eventually be known to be selling fake goods and his reputation will not be as good. The person who originally wrote the book might have a chance of suing the person for fraud, due to pretending to sell his work as his own. If he is just selling his book without editing the name then that would be allowed, although it is frowned upon and you would be getting ripped off because the book is available for free on the internet. 

&gt; I have added value to the wood being burnt using my method? Do I not deserve some compensation for that value I have added?

If you invent a new method of burning wood you could either produce a full wood burning system and sell that yourself or you could sell the mechanism with a contract to someone else.","1304212940"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;Continuing on from that, if i say a random element on the table eg. potassium, could science tell us when that was created?

Sure. I'm no expert in chemistry but I would expect that for most elements we have an idea where the bulk were formed. The physics behind it is simple enough; for example, we understand very well the reactions which produce the light elements in the early universe, those which produce heavier elements in the cores of stars, etc.

&gt;Also would you have any idea if elements are spread evenly over the universe and if there could be some we don't know about?

Depends what you mean by evenly. Obviously there's more, say, iron in the Earth than there is in interstellar space, but if you consider averaging over a bit larger scales - larger than galaxies - there should be a pretty even concentration of elements. Our solar system should have chemical abundances similar to other stars its age, as many stars in our local neighborhood are, but in other parts of the galaxy stars are, on the average, younger or older, and will accordingly have a greater or lower abundance of heavy metals, respectively (since each new generation of stars comes from supernovae which produced yet more heavy elements).

Could there be some we don't know about? Not naturally forming. Elements don't hide; an element is defined by the number of protons it has, and we know all the elements up to those with 100-something protons.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It doesn't have much to do with luck.  Idiots inherit wealth and can blow it.  This happens all the time, as well.  Look at professional athletes and lottery winners.  They often stumble into riches and have no clue what to do with it.  A lot of them end up back in poverty.

Someone who knows how to accumulate wealth can invest correctly and turn small amounts into larger ones.  Dishonesty and luck are not necessary - adequately running a small business is about 99% of what you need.  (ProTip: fucking over customers and employees is a great way to end your business.  You have to treat people well if you want business.)

The reason you don't find many wealthy people with fancy cars and clothes is because they know what an utter and complete fucking waste those are.  Case in point: buying an ""average"" car for $35k and financing it will eat a good $50k-$60k out of your income over five to six years of financing.  Near me, a duplex sold for $59k.  That duplex pulls down around $1,300 a month in unearned income and comes with a load of tax deductions.

So instead of a new car, buy the income property and drive a shitty old Honda you got for $2,500.  Use the income from the property and the money you continue to save by not buying stupid things, and you can get more rental units or maybe buy an apartment complex eventually.  Then you can quit your day job and manage your investment.  It's not Gulfstream V money, but you can sleep in and take a weeklong roadtrip any time you feel like it.

Of course, I also didn't get to network or do internships or anything like that, since I was always working.  And I'm sure it would be much, much harder if someone had children.  

I'd actually be okay with paying extra taxes to fund secondary education, but only if the funds go to someone who has already paid for a few classes on their own.  I know too many people who go to college, take a few classes, then quit.

New signings aren't an excuse. Barca have had the likes of Villa, Mascherano and Afellay to name but a few come into the side. The problem has been self expectation and tactics. Pressure to be number one and then playing three defensive midfielders despite having a vast array of attacking talent.

regardless, i think it's extremely obvious by examining his administration's war record that he's attempting to assert U.S. control over Libya.  he's doing the same thing in Syria.  U.S. troops enter, or at the very least, a campaign of bombing is conducted, and then the U.S. pushes through a ""transition government"" which is nothing but a puppet of U.S. rule.  it's the same formula our Presidents have been following for a century, in Japan, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran, Kosovo, you name it.

Someone that has had most of the skin of his penis stripped away will probably—though not always—be able to become erect and ejaculate but their penis will move as it was intended during intercourse and it will not feel the depth of sensation that a whole penis will. 

You keep going on about *your* penis. What about the penises of those guys that are so scarred due to circumcision that they cannot feel anything at all or those that don't even *have* cocks due to complications from circumcision? What about the ones that are dead because of it?

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Yes, I'm Christian. Probably a bit more liberal and catholically minded than others.

I think that it's much more complicated than saying ""Jesus was God therefore he knew everything"". Incarnational theology in ancient Judaism was very complex; the High Priest, in the context of the specific rituals and liturgies surrounding Atonement, was understood to be yhwh incarnate, however no one would think that he was omniscient or omnipresent or omnipotent. It was the mythological framework surrounding the ancient liturgies wherein this incarnational theology was found. One should be mindful of this when understanding Jesus' self-understanding in light of late second temple Judaisms. Jesus probably felt that he had some sort of deep vocation however the Gospels are filled with his own uncertainty and his own personal development. His earliest followers probably thought of him as some sort of mystical figure, if we follow Crispin Fletcher-Louis' work they thought of him as a Heavenly Priest-King. However, even within this framework there was probably a number of ways in which his death-Resurrection were interpreted.

My overall point is that Satisfaction or Moral Influence were later innovations in Latin Christianity. They should be kept out of the discussions surrounding Jesus' own interpretation of his death and his earliest followers interpretations of his death. What one should search for (and in this regard I may have the paradigm right but not the details) is the cultural milieu surrounding Jesus' life within which his death-Resurrection make best sense. :-)","1304213032"

I can buy someone's labor power without a marketable product. Maybe I pay a guy to wash my balls. At the end of that labor process there is no product that I can then sell off to someone else. Capitalists sell products, not workers (unless they're self-employed, in which case they sell their own products).

Some employees don't want to have the union bargain on their behalf, but thanks to the agreement, they have no choice but to do so if they want to work for the government.

This is the collective bargaining agreement that the state of Wisconsin has with the largest government employee union in the state:

"politics","t5_2cneq","Taxation, being a form of robbery, should be considered if absolutely needed to pay for those things which would be important enough to rob for. So, maybe it would be acceptable to tax in order to prevent or repel foreign invasion, although, even national defense could probably be funded non-coercively. But other functions probably don't require robbery.

If a defendant on trial for robbery claimed as a defense that he was only robbing a rich person in order to finance his child's education, the jury would laugh and then send the defendant to jail. Yet, if a person votes for a politician to do essentially the same thing, somehow this makes the robbery ok.

Before people consider coercive means to accomplish a goal, they should consider if the goal could be accomplished non-coercively. If not, then they should consider whether the goal should be accomplished at all.","1304213048"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I reckon it takes a certain amount of strength and self-respect to end a relationship. I broke up my first ""proper"" relationship a year and a half ago, and that was due to the fact that things had gotten flat between us, we weren't communicating, she didn't want to spend time with me, I felt that things were very much out of balance, and it was tearing me apart (Lisa). So I asked my Dad (who is someone that has some great answers in situations like this) what to do, as I felt stuck and it was as though things weren't going to change for the better. And he told me that I should confront her, but not in an aggressive or offensive way, just ask if I could come over and talk about how we were because there were issues that obviously needing discussion. If it was decided that things aren't going to change for the positive for the both of us (which required that the both of us make fairly significant compromises), then I had to ask myself: 'am I willing to put up with this if this is how things are going to be forever?'

And to me, that's an important way to look at it. You need to ask yourself if you're willing to put up with how things are organised between you and your partner. You probably are a bit all over the place emotionally at the moment, and it's hard to tell which way is up when you're at this point in such a relationship. But you need to ask yourself, do you want to keep things going like this, and if not, are you worth making significant changes to the relationship that'll hopefully make things better? You need to have ""the talk"" (the relationship talk) with your boyfriend, and ask if he's willing to make the compromises to make things different. If the two of you are not, then I personally believe that it will be an unhappy ride if the two of you stay together, based on what you've said above. If he's making threats of suicide as a means of a) gaining sympathy from you (it might be an old habit), b) trying to make you feel bad/responsible, c) trying to get what he wants from you whatever it may be, etc, then that's a good sign that this arrangement isn't good for either of you. Don't be too judgmental, this is just his way of dealing with his own messed up head. There's nothing honourable about it, but it's just his coping mechanism, just like yours is to call him a jerk, let other relationships fizzle out and not deal directly with them, etc. We all have these mechanisms, and we only progress from them if we're courageous enough to make changes to how we go about things.

Don't isolate yourself within this relationship. Get support to bolster your self esteem. Get advice and support from friends, counsellors, parents, whatever may help. The pre- and post-breakup phases are things that should never be handled alone, that's something I've learnt now. BUT, don't bolster your self esteem as a way of attacking him, as that's the dishonourable way out. Do it to defend yourself against yourself. You grow stronger, and then you can offer your hand to pull him out of the slump he's in. If he's not willing to climb up, but rather keep pulling you down, then you might want to consider letting go, and walking away to adventures new.

And just in case you don't know, the whole Jerry Macguire-esque, ""you complete me"" idea is a big fallacy. You don't get a complete person by adding two halves of a person. You only get two half-people in an incomplete relationship that way. But if you have two whole people together in a strong relationship, that's worth the strength of ten people. And to me, based on what you yourself have provided, it sounds like there are two incomplete people trying to coexist in a toxic relationship that sounds pretty bad for both parties. If neither of you are willing to change things for a better future (read: change yourselves), are you otherwise willing to put up with what the consequential future will bring?","1304213062"

Our speed was way high (~6.5kts average) and we were navigating, not fishing, but I still managed to pull in a nice striper (~28in) and a tuna of some sort (just past the mouth of the Chesapeake).  cleaned and ate both right there on the boat.

later on in the trip, when we were about 100 miles offshore in the Atlantic, something ate one of my lures.  I was using 400lb line with pretty beefy steel leaders and shock cords to prevent strikes from snapping the line, with a 9"" plug on the end.  Something monstrous must have bitten because the lure, leader, and a good 50ft of line were just plain gone.  one of my friends on a different boat in our squadron was trolling using a large baitcast reel and 200lb line on a pole, and about the same time he radioed me to say something just took 400yds of line off his reel and snapped the line off as soon as he increased the drag to fight it.  to this day I wonder what that might have been.","1304213075"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I don't agree with sentencing people to death, heres a few links from the previous topic on this: 

* Quote on the hadith ([from theamericanmuslim](http://www.theamericanmuslim.org/tam.php/features/articles/shariah_is_killing_an_apostate_in_the_islamic_law/)): 

&gt;But this is a weak foundation because this hadith was only transmitted from Muhammad (pbuh) by one individual. It was not confirmed by a second person. According to Islamic law, this is insufficient confirmation to impose the death penalty. The Shari`ah has not fixed any punishment for apostasy.  The hadith is so generally worded that it would require the death penalty for a Christian or Jew who converted to Islam. This is obviously not the prophet’s intent. The hadith is in need of further specification, which has not been documented. Many scholars interpret this passage as referring only to instances of high treason. (e.g. declaring war on Islam, Muhammad (pbuh), God, etc.). There is no historical record, which indicates that Muhammad (pbuh) or any of his companions ever sentenced anyone to death for apostasy.

* Also assuming the Quran is the highest authority, take these quotes also from the same article: 

&gt;The Glorious Qur’an says, “Let there be no compulsion in the religion: Surely the Right Path is clearly distinct from the crooked path.” Al Baqarah, 2:256.



&gt;“Those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe again, then disbelieve, and then increase in their disbelief - Allah will never forgive them nor guide them to the path.” Surah An-Nisa’, 4:137.



&gt;For example, the Qur’an says: “Let him who wishes to believe, do so; and let him who wishes to disbelieve, do so.” (Al-Kahf: 29)

* Other views

I belive this [link to a pdf](http://www.alislam.org/library/books/Apostasy-in-Islam.pdf) is the Ahmadiyya view on the subject, which many people will proberbly not agree, or disagree with certain aspects, but I put it here because it was in the other post, and also to show (imo) that there is no, one, accepted interpretation of the religion. Who is 'right' and who is 'wrong', is another issue all together though. 

* [Loonwatch article](http://www.loonwatch.com/2009/09/apostasy/)

Also see this article, but there is something else from here, that more people should keep in mind, I thinks its important: 

Valerie Hoffman, a professor of Islamic studies at the University of Illinois, commented on the issue of apostasy in Islam: **“You can’t say Islam says this or Islam says that.” The question of course is “whose Islam” and “which Islam?”**

I'm sure you can find people and scholars that agree with it, as much as those that don't, the reasoning, and other such aspects are more of a academic/legal/theological discussion though, not peoples personal thoughts as you were asking for, and as I said in the begining, its not something I personally agree with.

I agree much of it is waste - and that's why the NASCAR organizers are looking into ethanol-fueled engines for next season - but there is more reason to it than most things people do with their cars. NASCAR creates employment opportunities: people work in and around raceways, there's pit crews, journalists, drivers, people selling all kinds of memorabilia and food, etc.

I'm not telling you to stick your head in the sand about it. I'm telling you that changes can be made, and that the relatively trivial fuel consumption is not a reason to shut down a beloved sport to millions. 

Why don't we go ahead and ban ALL forms of motorsport, while we're at it? Rally cars, Formula 1 cars, Indy cars, DTM, WTCC, etc. each and every single one of those race cars boasts fuel consumption that puts a regular car to shame. A single Grand Prix guzzles fuel like little you've seen before.

Also, abhorable is not a word.","1304213082"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Take a look at [a post I made yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/gzypn/120hz_monitors/) about 120Hz monitors. This may be something you would want to look into if you're getting a new gaming comp. Most LCDs today are set at 60Hz -- by getting a 120Hz monitor you can visually see the benefit when &gt;60 fps in or out of games.

I ended up deciding to get this [Viewsonic VX2268WM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824116452) after a lengthy time of looking at my options. Although a smaller resolution, some argue that 16:10 ratios are better than 16:9 for gaming. Also, 120Hz is still new for LCD monitors and there isn't a lot of options. I chose the Viewsonic because it's one of the cheaper options and won't set me back as much if I decide to upgrade to a new generation one coming out later this year.","1304213083"

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","I couldn't say whether any particular site is a scam -- I'm sure they all have sincere intentions. But in my experience, most execs are looking to establish a relationship with a writer. Preproduction can drag on for a couple of years, and at least one of the questions an exec must ask himself is ""Can I stand sitting in meetings with this person for the next year?"" 

An online pitch might make it easier to convey your concept, but it's much harder to assess you as a business partner in that forum. The online pitch might serve to get you a face-to-face or phone meeting, but it's up to you whether that's a worthwhile investment of your money. 

There are also a lot of executives in Hollywood who are slow to embrace new tech or avenues of access. ""Move to LA,"" they all say, ""or nobody will think you are serious."" I firmly disagree with this advice (unless your goal is to be a staff writer for TV), and think modern technology is a valuable tool for the new screenwriter to make it without pulling up stakes and heading west.

"SexPositive","t5_2r7c9","&gt; Don't you think your personal interpretation of whether somebody else believes a Rule34 pic is sensual versus ""art or satire"" is fundamentally irrelevant?

No, because the line between Art, Satire and Porn is completely subjective. But that doesn't mean your point doesn't stand. Reading Relevant_rule24's manifesto made a strong point for you and really highlights what may be satire or art to me, IS a faptacularly erotic fetish for someone else. 

This is where I see the internet as a great equalizer though. It has never been easier for people with any fetish to find a community instead of feeling like ashamed outcasts that have to hide their oddity. Also, it exposes those of us without that particular fetish to it, making it less obscure and widening the pool of people who will at least be accepting of it, even if they don't want to participate. Which is what seems to have happened to Relevant_rule_34 and in the process, he seems to have become more empowered and accepting of his own sexuality.

I really want to thank you for your reply. Reading that manifesto, reading your reply and writing my own really has me thinking. I never saw Rule34 as anything but entertainment before.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","Not really.  Those people asking for updates are usually those that feel they ""deserve"" more from the game, and frequently complain that there isn't enough content now.

Then there is the mod creators, who feel like what they create should belong to them.  They are right, to an extent.  They aren't drawing a profit from mods (as far as I know....), and ultimately the content goes to affect Minecraft, which is not their IP.  If someone wanted to create a compilation (that was compatible between mods), then I don't see how that is a problem with the proper credit given.

Hell, I see it on the Just Cause 2 mod website all the time (because certain mods use the same filename, example for the camera, and if you wanted to use 2 different camera mod's you would have to become an expert in creating your own mods to combine them).  Proper credit is given, and there is never any backlash (most of the time, devs praise the newer ones for helping others).

The only issue I have is if someone else starts to improve on a mod that is not his without consent.  There is a precedent for that once the modder has stopped developing it (see: many many WoW addons).

I think with Notch attempting to help mods be more effective, it should ultimately result in little no clash between mods (that would be the end result to aim for), which means compilations like the OP's would ultimately be redundant.","1304213100"

at work, the least competent person is likely to be promoted. don't make enemies of them because they suck at the job you both do, they may be your boss soon enough.

in relationships you should be prepared for heartbreak. that is an essential part of relationships.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Get the prices quoted by the dealer and ask them to do it fully searched and on a 30 day guarantee (i.e. so that they can't give you a price, then if you pick it for the deal you go in and suddenly it's a different one for not doing the deal on that day). Any dealer who will not do this is a charlatan. Walk away and find one who will.

Then with your price in hand go home and re-do their mathematics to make sure they're not telling you a percentage rate in one method to make it look lower than it would be using a more widely accepted method in the field of finance. I say this because dealers here in the UK will tell someone ""We're doing this finance at 6% for you, here, this is the proof - and your bank says 8.9%... So we're cheaper!"" - but what they do is in fact quote at 6% flat, and hope you don't understand that it's not the same as an APR figure that a bank is quoting. It's part of why I quit working for a motorbike dealer, because I hated not being able to look people in the eye at bike meets on my days off. (I lasted a month).

Anyway...  back on topic - with your price in hand from the dealer, shop around. Get the bank to offer you a quote, and maybe a competitor or two.

The things to make sure you ask for are:

* If the interest is fixed or variable.

* Monthly repayment.

* Total amount payable.

* Total amount payable on any inclusive insurance product.

* And get percentage rates in the same formats.

Then you simply compare and contrast.

Also note with any insurances for things like accident, sickness, and redundancy, you get a sample document BEFORE signing and check that you are eligible. So for example if you work for a company but haven't signed a contract, be it fixed term or rolling, some insurances will fail to pay out citing you as a temporary worker. Some require you be at the same employer for two years before they would pay out. Some will only pay out 100% of the repayment each month for 6 months if you're sick or incapacitated, then reduce what they pay each month thereafter. So let's say you work as a bus driver, get in an accident and lose your legs, spend a year in hospital and no longer have a salary, the insurance won't give a shit and you'll have to find the money or get sued or your stuff taken away and sold at a fraction of true value. So just make sure to read that fine print, okay?

I know I make that all sound a bit scary perhaps to some - but cover your ass, is all.

And if you're not sure, scan/photograph your documents, blank out any identifying details to who you are, where you live, dealer name etc, and post the picture here. I'm sure people will be happy to read through and give their opinion.","1304213142"

You did say to ask you anything, so I apologise in advance if any of these are too personal, and do feel free to ignore any you don't want to answer...

You seem very articulate and self-aware: do you think there's a kind of feedback loop between you and your twin where she feels guilty that she was born without a disability, and you were, yet you sort of feel guilty for her having to feel guilty about that? (I hope that makes sense). Has that been a bit of a barrier between the two of you?

What are your hands like now, in terms of what you can do with them? From what you've said, you lead a pretty ""normal"" life (whatever that means), but are there things that other people take for granted that you find to be a physical chore.

If I ever met you in real life I would never ask you this, and I know it is a shitty question, but do you ever measure yourself against your twin and feel like you're kind of competing? Growing up, (again, I don't mean this in a bad way), you must have got more attention than she did.

"science","t5_mouw","This man speaks the truth, upvote him.

CO2 absorbs IR radiation at a certain wavelength. However, once enough CO2 is in the atmosphere, that wavelength can become saturated, and each molecule has a diminished effect. Each molecule acts to widen the absorption band, which has a smaller effect than initiating the absorption band. 

The point Metasimilie is trying to make is demonstrated by methane, (CH4) since methane is at a way lower concentration than CO2. Each methane molecule has a much higher global warming potential because it is initiating absorption and re-emission of the earths IR radiation at a new wavelength.

Docosahexaenoic acid is correlated with high grade tumors (Odds ratio 2.5) while trans fats were inversely correlated with with high grad tumors (odds ratios ~0.5).

This is not awfully surprising given the anti-inflamatory role of omega-3 fatty acids.   The problem is, what is more likely to kill you?   In the US the #1 killer is heart attack, followed by cancer.   Omega-3s are thought to reduce the incidence of heart attack (also by reducing inflammation), but could increase cancer risks in general.

It isn't because they are more likely to know what is best for you, it is because you have more direct control over their elections and legislative processes.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Do you think that if your prices weren't the most insanely low thing ever you would be able to sell any of that ""pizza""?

Well, I live in Canada so the prices here are a bit more than the prices in the U.S. For example, the $5 large pepperoni pizza advertised so much in the States is a $5.55 medium pepperoni pizza here. Then again, things like pizzas and other fast food and snacks are definitely more expensive in Canada, so $5.55 for a medium pepperoni is considered cheap here, too.

I'm interpreting your quotation marks around the word ""pizza"" as the pizza you've gotten from Little Caesar's was pretty awful. :P I wouldn't be surprised, those prices are very low. So to answer you're question, yeah. If the prices weren't so cheap we wouldn't sell much.

&gt; Wait, do you make it in house?

Yes, we make everything in the store except for those flavoured dipping sauces (BBQ, Ranch, Chipotle, etc.). The marinara sauce (""crazy sauce"") is made in store, though. Oh yeah, and just between you and me, that marinara sauce is just the same sauce as what goes on the pizza ;).

But yeah, things like crazy bread, pizzas, etc. are all made in the store. We even make our own dough from flour, yeast, etc.

&gt; How do you make those awesome breadsticks... I believe they are referred to as ""crazy""?

Aw man I love those too! Here is how we do it:

1. Take a 10 or 12 ounce dough ball and work it into a rectangle.
2. Cut that into 8 pieces.
3. Put it on a tray and put that through the oven.
4. Take them out of the tray and onto a larger dressing sheet-thing.
5. Apply good amount of garlic butter with a brush.
6. Parmesan up in this bitch.

You can also order cheese-stuffed breadsticks, but they are a rip-off for the amount of food you get.

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; I find it remarkable that you are ok with keeping someone in jail without any formal criminal charge for 14 months on what legally should have been a civil matter

I don't think he was in jail that long.  He was [arrested in 2006](http://www.rlslog.net/maven-kingpin-geremi-adam-is-on-the-run-from-police/) but they couldn't file any charges because it wasn't a crime.  They arrested him again [outside a different theater](http://www.libertyvoice.net/) and he then waited 14 months for charges to be brought.  He clearly wasn't in jail though, because he then skipped his [Jan 2010 court date](http://www.rlslog.net/maven-kingpin-geremi-adam-is-on-the-run-from-police/) and was then on the run.  He was ultimately apprehended and [given a 2.5 month sentence on March 17th 2010](http://www.examiner.com/city-buzz-in-montreal/geremi-adam-died-one-week-after-completing-his-jail-sentence] and died a week after his release.  The news articles (dated Apr 6) says he died  on Sunday (Apr 4) and a week earlier would have been about March 25. It says he only serverd 7 days of his sentence.  There is nothing that says he spent any considerable time being incarcerated.

Sorry but you make this out to be that he was being harassed.  What happened is he got caught up in the legal system and made matters worse for himself by doing things like... not showing up for his court date.  I don't see anything where he was in jail for 14 months.

I know what an ex-post facto law is.  Please show me how this is relevant to the case.  I can not find enough details about the case except he was arrested, had a court date 2 years later, was sentenced for something, and died a few months later.  I'd like to see some more details.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I've just helped a friend get out of this cycle / situation.

he had $9k in cc bills but it was enough to cause him to do something. Every month he would pay off a large amount of money on the cards and promise that the month ahead of him would be frugal, but things always popped up. Plus, because he was cash poor, he just used the cards, promising himself that he would spend less than he'd paid off - thereby barely affecting his total owed.

Here's the six steps I helped him with to get him to pay off his debt in three years:


1. Cut up the cards (The rest of this plan is worthless unless you do that first)


2. Go see a bank about a personal loan to cover the cost of the credit card debt. The personal loan is at a much lower rate than the credit cards, and, importantly, can't be 'respent'. Once the money is paid off a loan there's no credit facility to redraw that cash, so each payment is a step in the direction of total debt reduction.


3. Borrow only what you need to cover the cards and nothing more, NOT. ONE. CENT.


4. Immediately pay off the credit cards - some banks will do this for you.


5. DO NOT go and get another credit card for at least three months. You need to change your behavioural, and money management, patterns to understand that credit cards aren't there to support your spending any further. Even if you think you know this already, until you actually live without them for a while you won't truly understand this.


6. Do not carry more than $75 in cash at any time and re-evaluate every purchase you make. Commit yourself to saving the equal amount of every major purchase (groceries for example is excluded) thereby effectively doubling the cost of it. If you see a $60 sweater, pause, think about it, and go to your bank account and put $60 in a savings area (special savings account, money jar etc) and then see if you have another $60 to buy the item. If you don't, then you can't afford it. Doing this is a physical reminder that money really is valuable, and it takes a long tmie to make, so it should take a while to spend it too. If you can't do the saving's thing, then carry even less cash on you, and every time you see something you want to buy, go and get money from the ATM and look hard at your account balance. Sit on a bench and look at it, count the days to your next paycheck and think hard about whether you *really* need that item.




My friend did this plan about two months ago. He's now far less stressed about money in general. He has more cash on him, is happier and knows he has a plan.

Banks in Aus, look at this kind of behaviour favourably, because they understand that this is the responsible course of action. I'm not sure how it works in the US in terms of your credit score, but regardless, this plan is a path to actually becoming debt free.

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","the only thing killing boxing is the stupid state of governing bodies. 74 belts over 17 weight classes then it goes up a hell of a lot more if you count bullshit like 'diamond champions' and interim champions, super champions or whatever the hell that bullshit is.

Still, local fighters easily fill home arenas and the stars are still easily filling Vegas arenas, despite a lot of god awful under-cards. The UFC are doing amazing, but take away the solid under cards and they'd take a huge hit.

That said, a stupid time to publish such drivel, boxing has been downright awesome since last November, a lot of good fights, upsets and a lot coming up. Not to mention we're currently experiencing one of the greatest boxers to ever grace the sport, as well as a potential match-up with someone who should be one the greatest boxers the sport has ever seen (if it happens). 

Another problem is lack of heavyweight stars. Boxing is synonymous with the HW division and the talent is poor there. It should pick up soon enough when stars start retiring so other fighters start fighting instead of chasing the pay days. That is where Dana really shines, being able to make the big bouts because he has the fighters by the balls.

Chell will not go away now that she's gone. I'm inclined to believe her tenacity will keep her going back to Aperture Labs.

In fact, my personal theory is that she survived the ""Bring Your Daughter to Work Day"" incident, was rescued by someone, and made it her goal to return to Aperture Science to find her adoptive parents. This is how she came to be in Portal 1. 

Her tenacity will also bring her back in Portal 3, as she confronts GLaDOS on her relationship to the facility, whether it be through Caroline, Doug Rattman, or Cave Johnson, or someone we haven't met yet.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","From the FAQ:

&gt;What's the math behind all of this?
&gt;
&gt;    It's Newton's law of universal gravitation using either a basic n-body (particle-particle) algorithm or Runge-Kutta 4 integration which is much more accurate, but runs a bit slower. You can toggle between these two modes in the software.

So ya, ignores general relativity (I don't know how relevant that would be in this case though) and its accuracy using Newtonian gravity is dependent on the mode you use and what your timestep is (how often it recalculates the forces).  

Keep in mind that with computers, as long as you have enough memory, the only difference between a super computer and your phone is how long it takes to do a computation.  Super computers and desktop computers are all turing machines, in the end the only significant difference is speed and memory capacity.  If you decrease the timestep to its minimum, it will probably be reasonably accurate, but it will just be very slow.  Also, they're probably just using doubles for position, which at the scale you're looking at, would be pretty inaccurate in distance.","1304213245"

I'm in my first year of college, and have a few friends on my floor.  Well, it's about 2am, we're hungry, and all the campus places are closed.  So we all decide to walk across the street to McDonald's.  Even though the lobby is closed, the place put a doorbell on the drivethrough so you could order if you were from the dorms.  So we're waiting for our food, and this girl comes walking up.  She looks dazed, hair frazzled, a little too skinny, and is walking kinda stiffly.  She comes up and says, ""Hey, there's something * medieval* about this, you know?  Like it's giving us the evil eye...""
My friends and I give each other looks of confusion, and just kinda stand there while she sorta stares off into space and pushes past us.  She then proceeds to hang on the open window of a car behind us, which had a lady and her kid (age 8-12?).  We have no idea what the hell she's saying, but the poor lady is on her phone and trying to get this chick off of her car door.  Suddenly we hear, ""WELL, IMMA 'BOUT WHIP A WHITE BITCHES ASS!"", from the car.  The lady is pissed, her kid is laughing her ass off, and the chick kinda stumbles on.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The scenario puts me in the centre of a circle 1 kilometre across.
Are the Romans spaced equidistantly around the resulting circle (which is, like, I-forget-my-high-school-maths really huge), or grouped in more traditional Roman fighting formation..?
Each scenario requires a different response - if all the Romans are in a [Tortoise (*testudo*)](http://moblg.net/media/p/l/e/plewis/testudo.jpg), for instance, and at a distance of 500 metres, the mingun and body armour solution already delivered would seem ideal.
This system is less than ideal if the Romans are individually spaced out, or clustered in small groups.

However, another factor which cannot be over looked is the description of the enemy ('Their only intent is to kill you') and the victory conditions ('In order to survive, you must eliminate all 100')
Forgive me for delivering bad news, but these Romans can only be zombies...

Now the factor of distance and spacing become an issue, modified by the behaviours of the Roman zombie horde - for example, are they shamblers or sprinters..? Do they cluster before attacking?
In this instance, a [jet pack](http://martinjetpack.com/) and a weapon capable of delivering zombie-dropping headshots from low orbits around the battlefield, just out of javelin range, seem to offer an ideal solution. However, this approach is likely to attract more attention than necessary, calling bloodthirsty hordes of the undead from miles around.

NBC protection and a weapon which can sufficiently saturate the battlespace with zombie-killing nerve gas might do it though. In the event of non-zombie Roman hordes, it'd be a hoot to turn up with two cases of best quality moonshine, one laced with LSD and the other full of magic shrooms; assuming I could stay alive long enough, that'd be some hilarious shit.

Edit - punctuation.

Inpatient studies ALWAYS pay more money.

It's not the Prime Minister's (or federal government's) role to deliver individual goodies to each geographical division of the country - that's why we have local governments.  At the federal level, it's porkbarreling.

The whole reason why we have a federal government is that there are things that benefit all, most, or many Canadians in many places at once. Trade policy matters to Vancouver, Timmins, and Oromocto. Criminal law matters to Whitehorse and Peace River. Copyright law matters to me, a Torontonian, but not any less than it could matter to someone from Halifax or Churchill.

After about 3 months, you should be regain 90% of your wrist function, and after 6 months you dont even notice having surgery done. The surgery itself is really simple, you count back from 10, and wake up an hr or 2 later with your hand wrapped up with very little pain. They usually give good meds, and you can remove the bandages in about a week or two after the surgery. The scar looks really cool though.

The opportunities are there, you'll just have to volunteer and find them :) Once you have some credentials under you belt, you can then start really applying with a more robust resume in the field.

"politics","t5_2cneq","True and then there is the fact that the definition of ""net worth"" means how much all of his assets (land, business, car, etc.) are worth in dollars. Mepper conveniently left off his exact quote. It reads:

REHBERG: I’m a small businessman. My wife is a small businessman. She hasn’t taken a salary in ten years as a result of business. We’re struggling like everyone else. With the economy.
CONSTITUENT: What’s your salary?
REHBERG: I’m land-rich and cash-poor. Like ranchers and farmers and small businessmen throughout Montana.

He is a small business person meaning his net worth also includes the money he pays his employees. His wife's net worth is in the millions but she doesn't see that money as he told his constituent. Her employees do and the rest keeps her business alive. Say his land is worth 10 million, thats a part of his net worth. Say his business generates 20 million, that's a part of his net worth. But his business includes insurance, employees, cost of production of whatever he does, etc. 

Net worth does not mean he has 31 million in his bank account. Also, who are ""these guys""? Small business owners? Entrepreneurs? People who are rich as a result of hard work? It's ok to defend the rich. They are not evil. This ""eat the rich"" mentality in this country has got to stop. I'm an 19 y.o. minority female and I hope to have a small business someday that generates 10 million or so in yearly revenue so I can employ a couple hundred employees and secure my retirement and my children's college education. I just started business school and you guys would be shocked to know that with the 10 million my future family would not be rolling in it as you would think. Take a business class or two people.

The exact same problems that a man would have. Lack of genital hygiene can lead to an increased chance of UTIs as well as infections. That's it. 

Did you know the females produce more smegma than men do? They also produce it under their clitoral hoods just as men do under their foreskins. But smegma, while unsightly does not necessarily lead to health problems; it actually has antiseptic properties. 

Lack of hygiene is not a valid reason to circumcise, it is a reason to practice proper hygiene.

"canada","t5_2qh68","As a scientist I appreciate the mathematics of Keynes, so I am naturally drawn to his models. However I agree with the Austrians in that it is fundamentally flawed. You see, even with all the math in the world, we can't even solve the Helium atom, at best we can make approximations. So while Keynes models work in a perfect world, where everyone is perfectly informed, they are dismal in reality. Keynes model is the equivalent to the perfect sphere in a vacuum, the problem is that the perturbations are huge and unknown. However, you are absolutely right about the Austrians not adding anything new to the table.

Even if Friedman is the biggest asshole on Earth, it doesn't discredit his idea's. Either something is logical or not, the source doesn't matter...

&gt;I'm not claiming that left-wing individuals are perfect. 

You are the first left-winger on r/canada that I have seen admit that; thanks. I fully admit that us libertarians need to budge on some of our positions too.

&gt;What I'm saying is that when centers of research and education distinctly favor one set of ideas over others, it's a sign. 

To me it's a sign of groupthink, an invisible and dangerous phenomenon that has effected many groups in the past. All I am saying is that monoculture idea's are as bad for the ecosystem as monoculture crops. Diversity is the key.

I have had some bad experiences, and no doubt I am biased because of them. However, do think that there is a lot of intellectual merit to non-liberal arguments; this merit has largely been ignored.","1304213358"

And the Lense-Thirring effect doesn't just make you observe centrifugal and coriolis forces if you're inside a spherical shell. It actually makes you feel centripetal acceleration, and thus actually makes you rotate. There's no way to simmulate centripetal and coriolis forces anyway; they're ficticious forces, which means that nothing can be *causing* them in your reference frame.","1304213397"

And like FoleyDiver kindly pointed out for me, I never said I stopped liking Family Guy or any bands because they became popular, I said I stopped liking them because they turn to shit.

I would still make the point though that popularity does take away from the more personal experience of certain things. Like if I was to meet someone and say ""Hey have you ever heard The Beatles?"" chances are they would say yes I like The Beatles, and it wouldn't mean a fucking thing to me, but if I said ""Hey have you ever heard Bueno/All Autonomy (underground punk band)"" and they said yes I like Bueno/All Autonomy we would have a more personal connection because there are much fewer Bueno/All Autonomy fans than there are Beatles fans.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","I don't know about pigs but I grew up on a goat farm. If you only have two goats, 100 square feet would be enough, assuming they had the right mix of sun and shade and a sturdy shelter. 

Though, what would work best for the nutrition and happiness of the goats would be to go with a movable pen so you could move the goat pen to a new, brushy area every few days once they'd eaten down all of the browse in the old spot. 

Alternately, you could train the goats to obey a few commands and let them out for a few hours each day to chomp down the brushy areas of your property. 

I've done both. The second method is easier but requires someone to stand around for a few hours each day to make sure the goats behave. Moving an entire pen every few days is a pain in the ass but it requires less of a time investment. 

Both of these methods actually work out better than giving goats a huge pasture to live in constantly. They end up over-grazing the entire pasture and then having nothing to do in between feedings of grain. Goats are at their happiest when they are introduced to an un-grazed area that is overflowing with fresh browse and they get to munch on leaves and brush all day long.","1304213406"

I'm not sure it would be visible during the day without a ton of extremely bright LEDs.  There are also certain panels that would need to be fireproof to meet fire codes; I have a few small doubts that it would be possible to integrate the electronics with fireproof mullions, and I don't know of anyone that makes fireproof fritted glass.  I'm pretty sure it's doable, but probably prohibitively expensive.

The truth is that there used to be practical reasons to get married young also.  50 years ago, most people graduated from HS and went to work.

Now, most people graduate and go to college, pretty much extending our adolescense and we have a ton of life ahead of us.

50 years ago, the prospects for a female in the workforce was limited and it was beneficial for a female to find a partner, since job opportunities were limited, and for males to find a wife to make babies with... as that is what people did.

Careers.... since girls were not in the workforce, it was not AS easy for them to make their way in the world.  Now, a girl can do pretty much whatever she wants..... not only can she, it is now expected that a girl goes out and gets a career.

Now I feel like I have to defend common sense.

&gt;Well, I think he means to ask how you can reject god for lack of scientific evidence and not reject ghosts.

That's all well and good, but it's not what's being asked. You know that as well, or you wouldn't start with, ""I think he means..""

And this brings me to my point-

&gt;This doesn't really jive with a rational, scientific approach to the universe

This is not atheism. You are attempting to supplement Atheism with your own ideas and beliefs, your own motivations, and you are completely ignoring what it *is*.

Atheism *is*, a lack of belief in god. And this is what Atheists tell themselves.

What it also is, is a belief that there is no god. And here is where Atheists get fussy and try to make a distinction.

When you include the 2nd definition, which, mind you, is the first definition provided by [Princeton](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=atheism), you imply that Atheism relies on faith precisely as much as Theism.

And it does.

Moving on...

Nowhere in the definition of Atheism is there a mention of ghosts. They are unrelated. Furthermore, there is no mention of ""non-physical realm"", there is no mention to, ""scientific approach"", there is no mention of, ""evidence"", and there is no mention of, ""science and rationalism"".

When someone says they are Atheist, they are not saying, ""I'm a scientific, rational individual who believes only in things that have scientific evidence."" they are saying, ""I don't believe in god.""

"reddit.com","t5_6","From Al-Jazeera : Report questioned

Ibrahim had earlier taken journalists to the remnants of a house in Tripoli, which Libyan officials said had been hit by at least three missiles. Given the level of destruction, it is unclear that anyone could have survived.

Benghazi rebels, who control a vast swathe of the east of the country, say they cannot trust Gaddafi.

Al Jazeera's Sue Turton, reporting from Benghazi, said there were ""an awful lot"" of suggestions in Libya that the news of the deaths could be fabricated.

""One of the main spokesmen for the Transitional National Council, Abdul Hafez Goga, is saying he thinks it could all be fabrication, that it may well be Gaddafi is trying to garner some sympathy,"" she said. 

""Back in 1986, Gaddafi once claimed that Ronald Reagan, then US president, had launched a strike on his compound in Tripoli and killed his daughter. Many journalists since then dug around and found out that the actual child that had died had nothing to do with Gaddafi, that he sort of adopted her posthumously.""

Three loud explosions were heard in Tripoli on Saturday evening as jets flew overhead. Volleys of anti-aircraft fire rang out following the first two strikes, which were followed by a third.

There was no immediate NATO reaction, nor was any independent confirmation of the deaths possible.","1304213475"

The funny thing is, I was probably on the lower side of the applicant pool, academically, but I am holding my own grade-wise. Im somewhere in the middle of the class, and while being surrounded by high school valedictorians, Im proud of myself. Its all about effort. If you care, you'll do well, end of story. 

Athletically, the biggest challenges are the AFT and PFT. The AFT is a 1.5 mile run, and you need to beat like 11 minutes in order not to fail. Better times mean better scores, maxing out at like 7 minutes or something. Remember, this place is around 7k feet, so it can be deceivingly difficult the first few times before you get used to the altitude. The PFT is a ""physical fitness test."" Its pull ups, long jump, sit ups, push ups, and an 800m run. To get a passing score, Id say you should be somewhere around 8-10 pullups and 50 pushups. The rest should be cake with your running background. 

I always hear about what a problem religious intolerance is here, but ive never experienced it, ever. I, like you, am an atheist, but never have felt pressured to attend any religious events. Mostly, I think the problem is over-zealous college students just looking to make a stink. Honestly, this should be among the last of your concerns.

That was not what I was saying at all, but I do I doubt the effects of such efforts and don't participate myself, but I respect people who do. I just think that the people that show up to those types of events don't need to be taught to respect others, and you'll never get someone who doesn't respect Judaism to go to those events. I'm sorry if I frustrated you, but your phrasing implied that you were teaching Jewish beliefs to the gentiles which is what I was cautioning against. I do not know why everyone assumes the worst out of orthodox beliefs and reads so much negativity into what we say. We say something moderate, everyone assume we say something extreme.","1304213498"

"math","t5_2qh0n","That's an incredibly short-sighted answer for several reasons.  First, applications tend to arise on their own from interesting math -- as overused as this example is, nobody cared whether elliptic curves solved some important scientific problem, but eventually they were found to be very useful for encryption.  A cryptographer wouldn't have had any reason at all to develop the general theory of elliptic curves because the application was discovered only after decades of independent work.  Similarly, group theory was invented and studied for reasons that had nothing to do with the real world, and only once it was well-developed did people realize that it could answer questions about inorganic chemistry as well.

Second, most ""real-world"" applications of math are not very technical.  You really only need some calculus, some linear algebra, and maybe some discrete math most of the time, and you don't need to be a great mathematician or even a good one to master those subjects.  Wouldn't it be a real waste if the most brilliant mathematicians in the world were spending their time computing Laplace transforms (or something equally mundane) instead of developing new ideas that lead to a better understanding of mathematics?

Third, it's pretty arrogant of you to decide whether other people are ""wasting"" their talents.  Why should people work on something they have no interest in just because *you* deem it more useful, especially if you don't understand what it is they're doing?

Talk about rewriting history! The US strategy from the beginning was to shatter the existing police and military systems and proceed to fund and then defund different militias and the zones they took control of in order to get the Shias and Sunnis at each others' throats while the US established its puppets as the government.

Don't get me wrong man the civilian casualties are bullshit we used to be better then that but the war itself and the fact that the pussy ass soldiers of the taliban hide themselves in civilian populaces and force the hand if we actually want to get at them. hiding behind women and children is the pussy move not the bombing. 

As for bullys well not everyone in america is a bully often we're the bullied that raise up and do whats needed. I mean there was 9/11 and all .. yeah it could have been an inside job but hey what if it wasn't what if maybe the taliban deserved to have their hornets nest rattled for harboring the fugitives that did that to us, without 9/11 none of this shit would have happened.

you can call american's pussies all you want but I gurantee if you called me a pussy to my face I'd be doing my best to beat the shit out of you. If you meant it as for being in an army and fighting I already served my time in the marines and did what needed doing, was  I scared? of course, scared shitless butterflies and nausea and the whole 9 but I still stuck my head up and took my shots, I still walked patrols as a stranger in a strange land. 

don't mistake having higher technology and using it as being a pussy if you took the drones away, the jets, the tanks, and put our forces and their forces on an even playing field we'd still be there doing what needed doing, yes it would be a bloodier mess, yes they would have a huge chance to win but we would still be there fighting and not sitting chickenshit behind a computer on reddit bitching about how the afghan's are such pussys.

We all have a set of privileges based on not only our race and sex, but also our class, able-bodiedness, education, height, physical appearance, social grace, and many other things.

It doesn't matter if you are white, black, yellow, brown, gay, straight, lesbian, or whatever. When you make the dismissive assumptions like slurs have ""no real meaning"" or that a certain group of people should just stop being so-oversensitive-gosh-darn-it!, you are exercising privilege.

And then to equate the criticism of privileged dismissal to ""racism/sexism""? That's an even better example of privilege!

Emalkay. Now we're getting somewhere. Sounds familiar... I like it. Let's see the next level.

(I really wish I had a subwoofer, and not these tiny little 10 dollar walmart speakers. x.x I feel like all of these songs would be insane if I had a nice speaker set up)

Bear Trap was pretty good. 

DatsiK I already have downloaded, his stuff is prime. 

Mstrkrft is too hip-hop for me.

The Recluse, didn't feel it too much.
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm shitting all over everything you like, before Dub I wasn't even into electronic music. The Algorithm got me into dub.

Hold Me Close could have gone without the vocal sample, but the dubstep itself is pretty good. I'll look more into him.

16 Bit has the right idea. Not bad.

Rusko - Hold On was not bad, a little too much build up before the WUBWUBWAW

And now your stuff? Let's see... I heard the first few seconds and was like ""Okay... get on with it"", noticed the sound change at :54, skipped to it, and was like ""Yeeeeeeee""

There you go. 
Gave 'em all a listen. :]

I tend to look at players themselves and how they play more than their stats now. I think you can tell by the way they do things what their stats are, as opposed to the opposite. I always think about Greg Vaughn, where you'd think the dude was just a power monster, but when you watched him at the plate, you saw he had no clue what he was doing half of the time.

That's how Ortiz was when he was bad/allegedly stopped doping.

When I watch him now, he seems more patient. I'm sure he wants more pop, but he's not making bad decisions like he did. Generally, these guys just seem to have it come together eventually and things happen.

When I think about the steep decline, I'd have to see him lost at the plate mentally or have a serious hitch in his swing...something like that. Or be hurt and have that affect his mechanics.

&gt;Nobody will achieve complete justice, it's just not realistic. What we need to do is achieve peace. This can only happen with compromise and acknowledgement of each others' right to exist. If there's any point I make that Reddit internalizes, I hope it is this one. For all of our sakes.



I honestly don't know much about how Isreali state was formed. I heard they bought all the land from the palestinians and I keep hearing that the land was taken unfairly(I don't know how). If it was taken by force in 1948 then it's completely not legitimate . Time does not in any way erase the damage that was done to the palestinian people(if it was taken by force or any unethical way).  However maybe the reownership of the land is unreasonable, but isreal still needs to put on trail if they took the land unethically for all the damage they have done to the Palestinian people. To illustrate this point I would also agrue that the United States needs to hold themselves accountable for the unethical taking of Indian lands. Maybe we have done enough or or maybe we need to do more. I hear Indians in reservations are treated like shit however as I said about Isreali I would never consider giving our entire nation to them. I understand most of the value this nation has is because of us. Isreal needs to make reasonable  estimates of the damage they have done to the palestine people and pay them out. It's not complete justice but it's the least Isreal can do(againif they did acquire the rights of the palenstians land unethicallyEdit: or government-ship of certain lands unethically).","1304213581"

As for your reasons: ...man, I don't even know where to start.  They can CHARGE me for killing JFK, and maybe even indict me for it, but things play differently in trial court.

If it helps you clear things up in your mind: I was actually sentenced to 5 years (not 8 months), but 4+ years were put ""on the shelf"" ie-- probation.  The 8 months is ""time served.""  If I had violated my probation, the judge assured me that I would do all of my remaining time in prison (which meant 4+ years in prison).  The top charge carried 5-10 years  (assault with a deadly weapon) and my lawyer worked it down from there.  13 years was the worst case scenario (albeit unlikely) because it implied that all the small additional charges (disturbing the peace, menacing, other things) would be non-concurrent.  However, during my first months in jail I was told that the prosecutor really didn't want to reduce charges, and told my attorney ""I expect he will do the max for the ADW"" which meant 10 years.  This was certainly because the assault involved a police officer.

The real scary thing was signing a paper that I was guilty with the words ""5 years"" written on the bottom, and then waiting (on bail) for months until the sentencing date to know if it meant jail or probation.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","So I know this is a few days late, but here goes:
I found the problem with the Imperator, or at least one.  All Imperator models use a defective laser sensor (the same in the RAT 7/9 from cyborg).  Both mouses, when raised and lowered, tend to shift towards the bottom right in a diagonal ""without exception""  which means for quick FPS players that lift their mouse a lot, there is extra adjustment required each time.

The problem with the (Lycosa) keyboard is just it is shoddy build quality.  There is a screw inside that pushes the board just a bit, so that certain keys never connect when pressed.  There is a workaround to do, but after awhile the problem just comes back and you have to open it again.

I've since bought the Steelseries 7G keyboard and Xai laser mouse, and both work and feel absolutely amazing (in terms of quality and usability).  I almost went with the Deathadder or the steelseries Ikari, but I managed to find both at my local futureshop, and they absolutely do not fit in my hand the way I hold mouses.  Which is a shame, because deathadder and Ikari are reputed to be amazing (Especially for FPS), but the Xai is no less amazing.  And also, I hate the smooth plastic Razer uses for it's products, steelseries is just the right amount of ""matte"" texture.","1304213621"

If you kill a civilian, deputy, or innocent animals within town districts (dogs, horses), you'll lose honor.  But they take it too far, because sometimes I'll ride my horse out into the wild, kill a civilian who is camping out for the night, and somehow my honor system goes down (with no witnesses).

The only problem with this is that if your honor gets too low you won't be allowed into some places.  So the honor is directly correlated to what people think of you, rather than what you think of yourself.

A ""battle"" map - build two strongholds facing each other. Two teams need to vie for resources and battle each other. The goal would be to capture something in the heart of the enemy stronghold and transport it back to one's own. Respawn points would have to lie far enough outside of the stronghold that killing people would actually matter.

A Viking expedition - a ton of people build boats and head out to seek new land and wage war against mobs abroad. No crafting allowed. We build our supplies before we ship out, and keep whatever we find. With a map-editor, gold and the like could be hidden in far-off lands.

A treasure hunt or scavenger hunt - Set up a specific map with a treasure hidden somewhere, and leve signs with hints as to how to find it.

Battle royale - set up an arena, everyone gets diamond armor and one or two weapons (Sword, arrows, wolves?). Fight to the death.

Night of the living mobs - A perpetual night with extra high zombie spawn rates, regular spider/creeper spawn rates, and no skeletons. Struggle to collect resources by feeble torchlight, build up a stronghold and survive.","1304213627"

To tell you the truth...it hard on the guys, they have to deal with something that they (usually) have never had to deal with before. You just have to find someone that once you feel like you can tell them that you know that they'll still be there. It's hard, the relationship I was in in HS was so unhealthy, he was an abusive liar and cheater, but that wasn't because of me that was because he was just a bad guy. But I was still able to have that relationship no matter how hard it was. And now that I'm in the amazing relationship I'm in I can appretiate it so much more. So you need to put yourself out there or you'll just continue to think you can't handle it. Try and if you can't then at least you know that you gave it a shot. And eventually, maybe even right away, you WILL find that amazing guy who will love you for who you ARE. My HS boyfriend when we would fight he'd call me a cunt and say I was a stupid bp bitch. Relationships are hard no matter what. But some guy some day will make you soooo happy, just make sure that you can make yourself happy. I depended on guys too much but then I found out who I was without them, on my own, not having that guy to depend on. Only then I was able to find the guy I love and have a healthy meaningful relationship. Just 1. Know that you can make yourself happy 2. Try! and you will get to the place you want to be.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; I've been convinced for quite a long time that women are far too shy about asking for higher compensation.

From [Salary, Gender and the Social Cost of Haggling](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/29/AR2007072900827.html):

&gt; The traditional explanation for the gender differences that Babcock found is that men are simply more aggressive than women, perhaps because of a combination of genetics and upbringing. The solution to gender disparities, this school of thought suggests, is to train women to be more assertive and to ask for more. However, a new set of experiments by Babcock and Hannah Riley Bowles, who studies the psychology of organizations at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, offers an entirely different explanation.

&gt; Their study, which was coauthored by Carnegie Mellon researcher Lei Lai, found that men and women get very different responses when they initiate negotiations. Although it may well be true that women often hurt themselves by not trying to negotiate, this study found that women's reluctance was based on an entirely reasonable and accurate view of how they were likely to be treated if they did. Both men and women were more likely to subtly penalize women who asked for more -- the perception was that women who asked for more were ""less nice"".

&gt; ""What we found across all the studies is men were always less willing to work with a woman who had attempted to negotiate than with a woman who did not,"" Bowles said. ""They always preferred to work with a woman who stayed mum. But it made no difference to the men whether a guy had chosen to negotiate or not.""

&gt; In this study, Bowles and her colleagues divided 119 volunteers at random into different groups and provided them with descriptions of male or female candidates who tried to negotiate a higher starting salary for a hypothetical job, along with descriptions of applicants who accepted the offered salary. The volunteers were asked to decide whether they would hire the candidates -- who were all described as exceptionally talented and qualified. While both men and women were penalized for negotiating, Bowles found that the negative effect for women was more than twice as large as that for men.

&gt; Subsequent studies used actors who recorded videos of themselves asking for more money or accepting salaries they had been offered. A new group of 285 volunteers were again asked whether they would be willing to work with the candidates after viewing the videos. Men tended to rule against women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; women tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more.

&gt; In a final set of studies, Bowles's team had 367 volunteers play the role of job candidates and left it up to them to decide whether to ask for more money than they were offered. Women were less likely than men to negotiate when they believed they would be dealing with a man, but there was no significant difference between men and women when they thought a woman would be making the decision.

If you put Beebe's comment about natural hair color into a context where douchebag guys (exemplified in movies and on urbandictionary -- real life guys *do* say these things, even if it's not something you've specifically witnessed) use women's pubic hair to judge whether women's hair is natural or dyed, and if at the same time you remember that the situation where he would have had a chance to see her pubic hair was as he was raping her, can you see where your statement that I've quoted above is, well, wrong? In that context and with that cultural weight attached to the concept of pubic hair/natural hair color, to say that he was ""explaining himself"" or that he was ""ashamed"" of himself is just completely missing the point.

Also, it's just gross for him to talk about what ""drew him to her,"" if that's your take on it.

Once in the bathroom I was happy to discover that none of it had made it out of my boxer-briefs.  Aforementioned underthings, however, had been seemingly destroyed.

I stood there contemplating where to hide them.  In my in-laws hall bathroom.  I thought about the closet, I thought about the trash, I thought about the toilet tank.  No good.  *Eventually* they would be discovered.  There wasn't even a window to throw them out of.  It slowly dawned on me that I was going to have to smuggle these things back out with me somehow.  Pockets?  I was wearing a pair of nice-ish khakis with only four tiny pockets; two side and two rear.  Even if nobody noticed the giant bulge, there would still be the stench to contend with, not to mention the oozing pool of goop that would no doubt eventually be dripping down my leg.  I was starting to get desperate.  I went to the sink and tried to wash them out.  I added a little hand soap and BEHOLD!  The offending liquid washed right out!  Not a drop was left!  I wrung them out best I could, put them back on and went on about my day with at worst a mild case of swamp-ass.

Sometimes they'd have a pig, and they usually had several chickens running around. They didn't buy food in a store ever that i was ever aware of and they didn't have electricity or a car.    
They were living out in Cherokee, Kansas (I've went back to where the house was around 1991or2, parts of it are still there, can still see some of the wallpaper and linoleum in the kitchen).

Here's the best part though...as soon as you open the dispute the money from the transaction is frozen in his Paypal account. So the seller is motivated to fix their mistake or make the buyer happy.

I have had this happen to me as a seller, a guy in Canada didn't accept a Nintendo DS because he didn't want to pay customs...so he opened the dispute and the money was immediately deducted from my Paypal.

Paying attention to your body does wonders for your mental state and will improve your life significantly.

Hell, the way I see it, men are just as if not more biologically determined to seek beautiful things than women.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Demanding, perhaps, but let's put this into another perspective. Everyone here seems to view a girl telling/asking her SO not to participate in such activities as ""possessive/crazy/jealous"", but what if it's a request made because it makes her uncomfortable, makes her feel belittled and insignificant or insufficient as a girlfriend, or she has past trauma? For example, some girls have been with abusive boyfriends who have done such things and from then forward associate porn/masturbation with abuse. My mom's a living example of this. My dad watched porn and masturbated and treated her like shit, punched her down a set of stairs when she was pregnant, ran up bills making phone calls to sex lines and eventually got fired from his job (when he was my family's sole breadwinner after my mom worked to get my dad through school in exchange for staying home with us) because he was charging pornography and long-distance sex calls to the company. Now my mom freaks out when the subject of porn even comes up, and if my brothers were to be caught watching porn/masturbating (as far as I know they don't) the whole fucking house would come down. Now tell me, can you honestly say she's being a demanding, possessive, evil bitch for not wanting that in her home, after what she's been through?

So maybe it does work for me because he has no interest in it, or maybe he just respects the fact that I grew up watching my dad destroy my family over pornography (after their divorce, I walked in on my dad on a few occasions doing that, accidentally stumbled across pornography trying to find a game on his computer at the age of 6-7, turned on a VCR once to watch a movie that had a movie in it which was porn at a young age, then eventually my dad was caught in a sting operation after going to meet a ""14"" year old at a gas station to do god-knows-what when I was just 12 years old) and knows that it isn't something I can emotionally deal with. I tend to believe for the same reason he doesn't drink in my presence (not that he drinks much at all) he doesn't watch porn or masturbate--because I had a fucked-up childhood and the trauma created triggers that make me turn into a dysfunctional emotional disaster. I'm sure some of it is because he doesn't have the sexual drive to need the release, but I'm equally certain he does it out of respect of my feelings and scars. It hasn't hurt the quality of our relationship at all, either. And I tend to believe, unlike most people, that masturbation is not at all a need, but simply a desire. I've never masturbated in my life and I've never had the need to do so.

**TL;DR**: Sometimes a girl isn't trying to force a viewpoint, she's just trying to protect herself from past trauma. In some situations the male realizes that she can't deal with that and out of respect does not participate in such activities. But yes, if two people are unable to meet each other's needs or compromise, then they shouldn't be together. The same can be said for any aspect of a relationship, not just porn/masturbation.","1304213752"

My parents have raised me off meals that include meat every single day, so I get a lot of extra sodium and meat fat along with plenty of protein. My body is muscular and fat at the same time; mostly the fat just fills in what would be muscle tone.

Any tips for getting motivated to get rid of this fat? My plan starting tonight is to go for nighttime runs of 1-2 miles every other day and increase the distance as I get back into shape. (I ran cross country for my school last season, but I was only average at it.) The nights which I alternate with running will probably just be push-ups or sit-ups to build tone. I don't have membership at any local gym as I haven't really seen a pressing need for it.","1304213773"

No silly you're being punished for your actions.

Considering they don't even follow their own laws, the government is a criminal group. Unfortunately they have a monopoly on producing the money we all use. If some other criminals come along and print money, the reason the government objects is not because of the welfare of their citizens or the soundness of their money, it's because someone dared to compete with them.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Depends on what you mean by ""accurately"". Simulating the motions of celestial objects is done by a technique called [numerical integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_ordinary_differential_equations),which accumulates errors as the simulation progresses. At first the simulation will be very close to reality, but since the solar system is [chaotic](http://ptrow.com/articles/ChaosandSolarSystem5.htm), it will eventually become less and less reliable. Also, there's some uncertainty in our actual measurements of the planets' orbits, so even if the simulation itself were perfectly accurate, the results would eventually diverge from the real world.

On top of that, that Universe Sandbox program is probably designed for entertainment value rather than scientific accuracy. So it probably only models Newtonian gravitation and ignores a bunch of other real-world effects, like radiation pressure, the curvature of space, etc.

The size of the program is pretty much irrelevant. I suspect that most of that 35MB is taken up by fancy-looking graphics and textures, not actual code.

Finally, it's not entirely clear from your question, but if all you care about is calculating the motions of the solar system throughout, say, human history, that's much easier. Most orbits are very stable over those kinds of timescales, and you can do the relevant calculations with a [pocket calculator](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Astronomy-Calculator-Peter-Duffett-Smith/dp/0521356997).","1304213811"

That's a bit of a leap. No classicist or historian calls the Iliad or the Enuma Elish 'fiction', it's a purposefully prerogative term. The Iliad and the Enuma Elish and much of the OT/Tanakh are mythological or poetic by nature. Mythology is not fiction, it's an entirely different discourse. If you want to reject the OT, (I don't care if you do, I'm not a fundie), do it on its own terms, reject it for what it itself is not what it is not. ","1304213814"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Roman legions, while an incredible fighting force, worked supportingly poorly as individuals. So while a phalanx (line after line after line) of Roman legionaries is an incredible force, if one can shatter that line one can easily mop them up. But fist lets take a look at what one faces with an average roman soldier. The soldiers come equipped with a long wooden/metal tower shield, long spears which the second, third ect. ranks poke out of the line and stab at the enemy. The romans were not known for their use of archers, but they were there in the back of the legion, all solders also carried medium length metal swords and had light metal/leather armor and a metal/leather helmet. 
So if one was to take on a maniple(unit of devision in the Roman army, 120 solders) of Roman soldiers, and lets assume they are all native born(non mercenary) combat veterans (aka triarii-third line soldiers), then I would get some good crowd dispersant, so I could not be penned in too much, some tear gas, or maybe a flame thrower. Then as a secondary weapon perhaps a SAW or a mini-gun to mow them down, aiming for the unprotected legs and backs as they begin to run.        ","1304213856"
"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; Perhaps you have neither studied the documents or the early church

Perhaps I have, and the the Nag Hammadi Library has little authority in today's Christianity because it was just found in 1945, and many of the writings were lost and were not used.  if your not going to make the effort to debate and  and just go with the ""I am right and I you are wrong"", then don't waste my time.  I have citations and sources backing me up, but you have your awesome mind!  Congratulations. 

&gt; Historical evidence doesn't show that at all.

All you have to do is click my source, click the top list and go to history of gospel of mark  and it explicitly lays out the proof?  One piece of it is a letter from Papias the 2nd, a Bishop from Asia minor, claiming Mark was the something like a secretary to Peter.  If you want to be a Christian by faith, not reason, go back to r/Christianity.

&gt;No

WHOA. YOU JUST BLEW MY MIND WITH THAT EXPLANATION!  This is why atheists think of the average Christian as a simpleton.  Give me a reason why or why not, or go back to r/Christianity.

"Design","t5_2qh78","Hey I just checked out your portfolio site; from first impression, I thought it looked pretty suave. Even though its hosted, you've obviously still tried to create a well designed site. However, I would be disappointed if I was a potential employer because most of the images you've included (of your work) are too distorted to really consider. 

I had a similar problem on my own portfolio site, with finding a balance between image size and quality for the web. But these images have to represent your work at its best; consider providing several images of the same project or a gallery that lets the viewer zoom in on an image. I say this because almost all of your projects' typography is illegible. 

Also, consider how less is more. Some of your work is really good, and should probably be on the first page– whereas some of your projects you've admitted aren't your strongest work, so why introduce any shred of doubt in your abilities?

[""As for the ad, it was something put together haphazardly at 2AM""]: future employers don't know this, they think that you are just as proud of that as any of your other work posted alongside. Quality over quantity is your best bet here. Great stuff though, interesting scope!

I'm already a supporter of the left but if there's one thing I could change, it's their attitude towards Alberta. It's not a lost cause. People here are so blinded by fear, a very real fear that alleviating it, regardless of what else their platform may say, will win a candidate/party a riding. The oil sands can be hideous, but oil and gas have a significant stake in the well-being of our entire province (and to an extent, all of Canada). There are many, many people who are so focused on this fact that they're scared to think about anything else. And when people are afraid, they're easily manipulated.  We need to work towards an economically viable solution without tanking the economy, which I'm hoping (and fairly confident, but hey, this is still politics) the NDP are capable of doing. If people in Alberta knew they didn't have to cling to the CPC for their (our) well-being, it would be a heavy blow to Conservative ideology. 

tl;dr - NDP, you have my support because for all reasons I believe you're best for the job, but please...should the power be given to you, be smart about this, and don't throw my province to the wolves. When you say ""let's work together"", I hope you truly mean it in every sense. ","1304213882"

The idea with agnosticism and generally the case with atheism is that your belief in a deity is not yet decided, most likely because of insufficient evidence. But who is to say that in the future compelling evidence will not present itself.

But more importantly, indoctrinating children is not so much an epistemic issue as it is a moral issue. The consequences of indoctrination beginning at birth are often long term and in some cases permanent. Your boss may beleive that even if he is certain that his beliefs are correct it is not appropriate for him to decide for his child what his child is permitted to believe. In the same way, a parent may be certain that a large facial tattoo would be the most beautiful complement to their child's appearance but because the effects are long term and because the child may have different aesthetic preferences than their parents, most would advise the parents to postpone the tattooing until the child is old enough to consent.

 It isn't right, it shouldn't be that way, but there are plenty of things about how young men relate to women that might not be great either. We get together and we work on it, hopefully. 

I think the thing to do if you think you're being taken advantage of is to pull back, and don't be that dock. You don't have to be, you know. Pulling away or withdrawing might piss her off at first, but it will force her to reassess the value of your relationship. You have every right to make it known to her that you feel too strongly for her to go on that way, so she should pick a boat and row it.

Good luck. Don't stop being a nice guy, at least as much as you can, and don't be afraid to be an asshole when you need to. It's okay, and sometimes it's necessary. ","1304213887"

Also, a lot of skepticism may also come from our own experiences.

I also hit snow at the end of Oct in Germany 2 years back and the locals said it was abnormally early.

My friend was raped in by a fellow student in Hua Zhong University in China. It was the boyfriend of a friend of ours. He had been stalking her for a few weeks.

The boy told the guard at the frontdesk of the dorms that he had lost his key, and told him her room number. So at 3 AM the guard let the boy into her room while she was sleeping.

She told the university. We have the feeling that the police would never do anything, I'm not sure if that's true or not, but the police would have been such a bureaucracy and might not want to get involved with the boy's embassy (we're all foreigners). The university didn't do anything. They moved the guard to another building. They asked her to hand in a report telling them what happened, she couldn't bring herself to write it so I wrote it for her with her standing next to me. The university never sent the boy home. What I find ASTOUNDING is that they invited him back for the following year.

Both the uni and the people act the same way. At first the people who knew about it were so angry at him. But he was friends with their friends (and his didn't care) so eventually everyone just let it go because they didn't want to be a downer. She &amp; I were the only ones who refused to hang out with him.

**tl;dr:** Not only did the university not expel the guy who raped my friend, they renewed his scholarship for the next year. Everyone lets it go because it's more convenient that way.","1304213899"

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","The Saudi offer does not include ""a full right of return"", that's false. Look at [the text of the plan at BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1899395.stm).  It calls for a ""just settlement"" of the Palestinian refugee crisis based on UN Resolution 194 (which calls for a diplomatic resolution to the conflict and resolves that any refugees ""wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors"" should be able to do so or if they otherwise wish to be provided with compensation). So that is compatible with accepting 100,000 refugees back and paying off the rest.

Look, the other canned right wing talking points you bring up are completely pointless - they are so easy to debunk - such as ""there never was a state of palestine"" (there never was a state of israel either, so what) or ""transjordan is palestine"" which is stupid.. There were never Jews on the East side of the Jordan so don't act like Israel sacrificed something by not getting what is now Jordan.  If as you say ""Transjordan is Palestine"" then why was it called transjordan ?   It did not encompass ""the original British Palestine"" there was no such entity as *British Palestine*.  There was the *British Mandate* but that included more than Palestine, it also included Jordan.

As to your second point it is a 78% to 22% split.

&gt;""It is often alleged that there was, in fact, an earlier 'territorial compromise', namely in 1922, when Transjordan was excised from the promised 'national home for the Jewish people,'...a decision that is difficult to criticize in light of the fact that 'the number of Jews living there permanently in 1921 has reliably been estimated at two, or according to some authorities, three persons.'"" Noam Chomsky, ""The Fateful Triangle.""

Third, after 10 years of having their own state the Palestinians are not going to start another war.  Militants will be folded into Palestinian society and marginalized just as the Stern Gang/Etzel/Irgun terrorists were folded into the Israeli state after 48.

As to your 4th point - whether the Negev is useless to anyone, number 1, all my life I've heard the Hasbara line that Israel works miracles and makes the desert bloom ? are you now saying that was bullshit ?  And the Negev is full of nuke plants and Beer Sheva and airforce bases and Eilat and gives Israel access to the gulf so clearly it isn't useless.

Your 5th point, that ""Muslims"" have no claim on Jerusalem is false, distorted, irrelevant and silly.   It is so full of hasbara propaganda spin that it takes several paragraphs to unspin it and address the individual falsehoods:

It's false because ""Muslims"" aren't making a claim against East Jerusalem -- the Palestinians are. The Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem as their capital doesn't rest on any kind of an Islamic argument.  It's all about International law and individual and national rights.

It is irrelevant because your religious arguments - while interesting for debate - carry no validity under International law.  Both the Torah and the Quran are *storybooks*, not history and not legal texts and they carry no weight under International law.  What matters is the legal rights of individuals under International Law. The right of return has nothing to do with Judaism or Islam or Christianity, and everything to do with individual rights under the law. 

It's distorted because The Israel-Palestine conflict is not about Israel vs. *Islam*, it's about Israel vs. *Palestinian Arabs*; many of whom are not even Muslims. Trying to disingenuously claim that it's all about Islam ignores that many Palestinians are Christian and are the descendents of the original Christians and they all support the right of return and Palestinian statehood.  So you are trying to wipe the long history of Palestinian Christians and the central role they played in the struggle for Palestinian Independence from the map.  Many Palestinian Christians founded resistance groups which  participated in the PLO and fought in the struggle.  For a prime example, look at [George Habash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash) who was originally from Lydda/Lod and founded PFLP. Or look at [Ghazi Hanania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazi_Hanania) or [Emil Ghuri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Ghuri) or [Dr. Wadie Haddad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadie_Haddad) or [Nayef Hawatmeh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayef_Hawatmeh) who were all Palestinian leaders.  All those guys supported the Palestinian struggle and an Independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and it had exactly NOTHING to do with Islam or the Quran.    Even Arafat - while nominally a muslim - wasn't religious (married a Christian woman) and never made any arguments based on the Quran. Fatah is not Islamic and neither is the PLO.  Arafat only talked about political rights, Palestinian national rights and individual rights, not MUSLIM rights.

Second, even though religious arguments from scripture carry no weight under the law and are irrelevant, trying to erase Islam from the history of Palestine is simply revisionist - The Al Aqsa mosque and Dome of the rock is the 3rd most holy place in Islam.  It has been a place of pilgrimage for Muslims for hundreds of years.  Your analogy to the Vatican makes no sense.  There isn't a 1200 year old Synagogue in Vatican city and 1200 years of history of Jews being the majority there or making pilgrimage there is there?  No there isn't.  So that analogy falls flat on it's face.  But there is 1200 years of Palestinian Arabs being the majority in Palestine and Jerusalem.   The vast majority of the population of Palestine had been Arabic since the seventh century A.D. (Over 1200 years). This is not a fairy tale from a religious text, this is actual documented and undisputed history.

Further, despite that religious arguments are irrelevant and carry no weight under the law, you are trying to pull a fast one.   Despite the fact that there are many other Islamic texts beside the Quran you try to compare ONLY the Quran to a whole category - ""Jewish Texts"" which is a huge category of volumes which span hundreds of years and are not supposed to be the word of God.   The other Islamic texts are the equivalent of Ketuvim and Oral Torah. 

Jerusalem is not mentioned even once in the Torah. NOT. ONCE.   That's why your hasbara line says ""Jewish Texts"" instead of ""The Torah"".  There are many other ""Islamic Texts"" besides the Quran.

What does ""Jewish texts"" even mean? Can you be more vague ?  Does that include Philip Roth novels?  ""The Joys of Yiddish"" by Leo Rosten  ?  It has no agreed upon definition and it goes way beyond just the Torah which is the only authoritative Jewish text.  Sure, other Jewish religious commentary - which was *not* supposedly handed by God to Moses - but instead written by Rabbis hundreds and hundreds of years later mention Jerusalem.  But in terms of scope, the Torah is the equivalent of the Quran and Jerusalem is not mentioned in the Torah.

Besides, if you start making arguments based on the scripture, even though it's just a collection of myths and fairy tales, and despite the fact that it has no weight under International law, then don't forget that *the Torah says that the Jews didn't even come from Israel/Palestine/Canaan.  It says they came from Babylon which is in Iraq.*

You claim an Israeli government would accept 1967 borders yet that flies in the face of the FACTS.  No Israeli government has ever been willing to compromise and accept the huge share of 78% and let the Palestinians have the other 22%.  Every single Israeli government argued about how much of the occupied territories  they would not return.   No Israeli offer ever included 22%.   Likud's platform clearly states **""The Government of Israel flatly rejects the establishment of a Palestinian Arab state west of the Jordan river.""** http://www.knesset.gov.il/elections/knesset15/elikud_m.htm   There is absolutely no wiggle room there for you to spin around in.  Whatever Labor under Rabin might have done is not relevant today since Labor has roughly 0% chance of winning control of the country again.

And finally as to your claim that The Saudis are interested in destroying Israel- that's ridiculous.  All the Saudis care about is what's good for BUSINESS.  They would throw everyone and everything else under the bus.  The Saudis did not participate in the 1948 war, the 1956 war, the 1967 war, the 1973 war or any war against Israel...  In fact the only war I can remember the Saudis participating in was the 1991 Gulf War and they fought on the same side as the USA and Israel - against Iraq - because as far as they were concerned, what Iraq did was BAD FOR BUSINESS.   The reason the Saudis offered their peace proposal was that the continued conflict is bad for business.  And the major incentives for Israel in that plan are business reasons - that it would get diplomatic and trade rights with the ENTIRE ARAB LEAGUE, so it wouldn't be economically isolated and have to import gas from as far away as Russia.

I'm not much of a capitalist myself but I think the Saudis are on to something by basing their plan on economic and trade incentives. The more bilateral trade there would be between Israel and the Arab League States, and with the end of the occupation, the less likely war would become since it would be economically unattractive and hurtful to all the parties involved.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Sorry. I'll see if I can explain it better.

Here are three ways of looking at time and time travel:

1.  Time is a single line that you can move forward and backward on with a time machine.
2. Time is like a tree, where it starts out as a single line that you move back and forward on, but if you make a change at one part of the line, then a new branch is created, splitting off in a different direction from the original with different events happening in each.
3. There are an infinite number of straight lines, all right next to each other running parallel, and each of these is an individual timeline, an individual reality or universe. There's no way to go backward in any of them, only forward. But you CAN jump over to a neighboring line or reality that perfectly imitates your past or future.

The first one isn't very useful. The second is useful as a metaphor, as a way of understanding it, but not quite literally accurate. The third is the closest to the way things actually work.

Each of these parallel timelines, these parallel realities, is unique. And there is an infinite number of them. Many are VERY VERY similar, so similar that you could not tell the difference by anything but a single atom between them. Others are so radically different that they likely resemble nothing we can imagine. And then there's everything in-between. Some of the realities are perfect copies of other realities as they existed in the past. So when you get into a time machine to go back in time, you actually are jumping over to a neighboring reality that is exactly like your past was - even though it isn't actually your past.

In order to step out of one of these timelines, you have to isolate yourself from it, you put yourself into a pocket or a bubble that is completely separate from everything to do with that reality, that timeline. Once you're separate, isolated, then you have open access to any of the other lines, those other universes or versions of reality.

In the case of the popular story of the greys, there are two relevant realities, two timelines. One is ours, the other is theirs. Alternatively, you could say that there are two branches in time, one is ours and one is theirs. At some point in our past, and a further point back in their past, we shared the same time, the same reality, the same universe. But something happened and we went one way and they went another way.

Now they have hopped out of their reality, entered ours (which is like a parallel branch on a figurative tree of time). Imagine that somebody tied a string from one tree branch to another. A line of ants begins at the trunk of the tree, and splits into two lines with one going up one branch and the other line of ants going up the other branch. A few ants from one of the branches cross the string to the other line of ants.

I don't claim any of this is true. It's just my best understanding of the story/theory. I hope it was less confusing this time... :-/

Here, I even put it into haiku format:

Like this country really cares about small businesses. That said, this is actually your only good point. Still doesn't give them a ""right"" to that wealth though.

I think they should leave it to everyone.

Sounds more moral than keeping the wealth in the family.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Sorry, couldn't find a comparison with a longer time frame. Since massive earthquakes are so rare, it would be better to have a sample of a hundred years or more. But the fact remains, that 20 year data has tornados scoring ten times higher than earthquakes. AND, you can limit your exposure to them by simply not living near a fault line. (disclosure: I had a house within one mile of the San Andreas Fault, and am currently about 15 miles distant)

My main point is that earthquakes happen in known locations. You can choose to subject yourself to the possibility of one happening, or not. Tornados happen all over the south and midwest, and there's no way to avoid them if you live anywhere in that whole region. Earthquakes are local, tornados occur across a widespread region. 

Of course, there are hundreds of thousands of people living on, or very close to, faults in the Bay Area. When *The Big One* finally hits, the death toll will undoubtedly be massive. 

&gt;are you really trying to say that we are better at spreading the word of an incoming earthquake than letting people know about impending tornadoes?

No, where would you get that idea? plat_osx above, said ""they have no warning"". I pointed out that you can have a warning (based on P waves) up to 90 seconds before the seismic waves arrive, and there are gas line switches activated by those warnings. Granted, the closer you are to the epicenter, the shorter the lag between the two waves. Re-watch some of those vids from Japan and you'll see people talking about the cell phone alerts they received before the earthquake struck. Those were generated by the arrival of [P waves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-wave).","1304214001"

Both cities get enough tax revenue to dump a lot of money into schools and city-sponsored events/classes.  Also, having a wealthy community usually means wealthy donors to schools.

In fact, I'm pretty sure that this is true for any f: X -&amp;gt; Y and g: Y -&amp;gt; X. Proof: If x is a fixed point of g o f, then x = g(f(x)), so f(x) = f(g(f(x))), and hence f(x) is a fixed point of f o g. Likewise, if y is a fixed point of f o g, then g(y) is a fixed point of g o f. Therefore, if we restrict f and g to the fixed points in X and Y, respectively, then we get a bijection.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Two things strike me. 

You're not well versed in your history.

You're not aware of what ""Soft money donations"" are. 

You also seem to see the phrase ""War is hell"" as justification for the horrors, where those who said those words did so in lament. The quote ""It is well that war is so terrible -- lest we should grow too fond of it"" is not an acceptance of the horror, but an admission of it. These are important distinctions. To torture and enemy is to accept that those who fight with you may be tortured, and to put your self at the same level as your enemy. Tactically sound to be sure, but not in no way moral or right. That you're unaware of history clearly blinds you to the prospect of a just and clean war.


&gt;A statement grounded in nothing but bias. You characterize the people you dislike as being wrong whereas those you are on the side of are virtuous.

I characterise those who take money out of your hand so they can keep it in theirs as wrong, where as those who have need and do the same as virtuous. Absolutely. And you would be a better person to do the same.

I feel like I'm talking to someone who has no concept or understanding of history, philosophy, or economics.

&gt; Dear UVA Staff:

&gt; A woman named Liz Seccuro recently, and very bravely, shared her story of being raped on your campus more than twenty years ago in the British newspaper, the Guardian. Link following;

&gt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/apr/30/rape-justice-after-20-years

&gt; Although she was able to bring her rapist to some form of justice in 2005, it also seems to be the case that members of your university conspired to protect the rapist from prosecution in this case, lying and quite probably violating university policy to do so, including the former Dean of Students, Robert Canevari Sr., whom according to your website continued serving in that role for another fifteen years after the rape in question. 

&gt; I write to bring this matter to your attention in the event that no one has yet done so, and inquire as to what the University has done, can do, or is willing to try to do in order to mend matters, and whether an apology or compensation to Ms. Seccuro was ever made or will be forthcoming, and whether action has been, can or will be taken against Mr. Canevari Sr. and others who may have been involved in covering up this vicious attack.

&gt;Respectfully,

&gt;- A concerned citizen of the Commonwealth.","1304214063"

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; I'm not a denier. I support green initiatives and I'm heavily invested in a few of them. I expect to have a solar panel on my roof in a couple years. I think it's best to go green to be safe rather than sorry. I just want the politics to back away from the scientist to avoid contamination of results. It's sad when I can predict someones view on AGW by knowing if they vote R or D. This is not how we have reasonable scientific debate and discovery in this country!

Being an environmentalist or conservation-minded has **nothing** to do with the scientific validity of global warming.

&gt; But you can't just start arbitrarily eliminating or approximating forcing mechanisms if you're going to model the system as a whole accurately

Define '*accurately*'. If my goal is to approximate the mean climate state and re-produce 20th century variability, then capture 1st order effects of radiative perturbations using such a validated model, then what more do you need than what we have now?

&gt; Just because the negative feedback of clouds has been proven to be less magnitude than the positive feedback of CO2 doesn't mean you can just omit that component and still 100% expect a valid result.

It's not omitted. But more to the point, do you know what is happening as we improve the fidelity of cloud representations in GCM's as compared to the last generation of models? **Diddly-squat**. Yeah, that's a gross over-simplification of about a decade of research. But improving thre representation of clouds in GCM's and improving the theoretical tools and observational records has - as early theory and evidence suggested - not produced a mythical, large negative feedback. It's like you pretend that no one thinks about the implications of the 'gaps' in our body of scientific knowledge. I assure you that that's *all* scientists think about. Where else would we come up with ideas for projects and research topics?

&gt; And again, there are quite a few climate scientists that have stressed how little we know about clouds and want to focus all our resources on them to understand them better.

No, there are partisans like Lindzen and Spencer who overstate the significance of the issue and play politics. Then there are people like me and my peers who actually tackle this problem and do some awesome research, but ultimately don't alter the foundations of the science because there's a century of prior work underpinning it.

&gt; Why is my position so wrong for wanting a better climate model before we start saying that AGW is as true as gravity?

Your position is dishonest. *You don't need a climate model* - at all - to support the solid empirical evidence and theoretical mechanisms upon which AGW is based.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Well...You would hope that people would be responsible with the food stamps, right? Just give them free money, and they would get healthy wholesome food for the family. Not too much. I have an employee (restaurant business) with like six kids and a wife that don't (won't) work, and he gets the food stamps. 645 bucks a month or so. Aaaannndd he's constantly hitting us up for food/money at the end of the month, saying that he can't feed the younguns. 

Well, I run into him one day at the local WinnDixie, and he's got two (2!) carts full of shit. And I mean shit. Choco-chip Eggo Waffles, high sugar breakfast cereals, hot pockets, microwavable dinners, big ass steaks, Cokes, everything name brand, nothing generic. I wasn't dissecting his carts, but I didn't see any vegetables. Or grains. I saw pastas, but Kraft Mac, and microwavable stuff only. Anybody surprised that this guy who had to beg for food/money at the end of the month was fat? Want to guess what his kids looked like?

I'm not trying to come off all judgy and shit. My wife and I (and my son) were briefly on food stamps when I lost my job, and they were a lifesaver. But it blew my mind what I could buy with them. The answer was anything, just about. Dr. Peppers? No problem. Steaks? You got it. How about pre-made subs from the deli? Surprise! Yours. Candy bars? Take 'em. 

We stayed responsible, and we were kinda healthy eaters anyway, so we didn't go nuts with the food, and when I went back to work, I duly reported to the EBT office that I was done with the food stamps and didn't need them anymore. Tried to give them my card, and they told me that I would get one more month of food stamps before they ran out, so yeah I kept them. And because month to month the total food stamps rollover, even though I had a job, I had this gov't card, with a big old flag on it, worth just shy of about $1500 bucks worth of groceries, that the lady at the EBT office was encourging me to keep. 

Should we offer a little more control for food stamps? I think so. They didn't even hand out a pamphlet talking about healthy foods to eat. Just here's your money, go spend it. Compared to programs like WIC, that only purchase healthy whole foods for mother's and infants, you can buy just about anything you want with your EBT money, even lobster.

The two reasons it boils down to seem to be i) many meteorologists work for mainstream media outlets which play a big role in perpetuating the denialist views, and ii) weathermen are faced with the daunting task of predicting weather over and over again and they know it's hard to even make an accurate three-day forecast.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","In the UK it's available, and it's offered (and they'll try hard to sell it to you - they get a kick-back on the policy, and it increases what you borrow so it increases their credit kick-back too). But if they tell you that you have to have it or you can't have the credit, they're in a whole world of shit from the regulators that can literally cost them millions in punitive punishments, regardless of the size of the business or the value of the sale they were trying to make. So it's entirely voluntary.

The basic idea is if you're too sick to work through sickness or accident/injury, or lose your job, then your repayments are made for you (after a qualification period of anything from 30 to 90 days where you continue your own payments - preventing people from getting repayments made for taking off regular weeks or fortnights here and there for chronic or faked illnesses). But if you have genuine need then you're not repaying something when you've got reduced or possibly no income.
Of course if you don't use it, then you potentially added 5-30% more to your repayments but that's the gamble you take.

I got depressed when I noticed others were enjoying their college life so much more than I was. I thought about joining some clubs or sports, but I felt like I wouldn't fit in. My days were usually spent in my dorm just doing work, and reading things on the internet. The loneliness really got to me, and I found it harder to want to do my work. School quickly became hell as my grades started to drop. Eventually I was forced to leave as I couldn't justify trying to repair my grades. 

What I'm trying to tell you is get out of your room, and join a group you might even have the slightest bit of interest in. The pain of feeling awkward and out of place hurts so much less than feeling like you have abandoned your future. 

Ask your friends what clubs they are in. Chances are that you'll like the same things they do, as friends tend to have common interests. If you do this you'll already know someone there and won't feel quite so much like the ""new guy."" Your friends might also be able to introduce you to some of their other friends. So stop feeling like you don't have any options or are hopeless when it comes to meeting people. Colleges are awesome places with so many awesome people, you will make some new friends, you just need to put yourself out there.

"history","t5_2qh53","There is nothing wrong with revisionism. It's not wrong to think differently and research more on the past even though such a past has been illegal to research upon. Why is the holocaust the only event that's illegal to ""revision""? That's a serious question. 
I am not a Neo Nazi. I do not hate Jews. I do not hate Gays. I do not hate blacks. I have never once in my life felt even a bit of hatered towards Jews. I don't believe a god damn master race. I just have a different viewpoint of history. That does not make me a Neo Nazi. It is NOT right for people to call me that.
I said what i thought, i got called a Neo Nazi, Holocaust denier (Something I never denied), and a moron basically. That's ignorance. 
The Allies, specially the soviets had many horrific war crimes covered up for they won the war. I believe they (the soviets) had worse war crimes. This is what  I believe. But yet they get to celebrate their heroes who raped thousands of german women and killed hundreds of thousands of poles and 11 million Ukrainians in the Holodomer. I believe Germany has the right to appreciate the soldiers and leaders who defended their country to the last second against Stalin, they were heroes not monsters, and yes, they were ""Nazis"".
Yes, I do have a passion for the Third Reich as you can see from my comments history but I do not support their racial supremist policies. I believe a homogenous society like Japan for example with properly ran National Socialism would be great (No genocides, ethnic cleansing).
I believe the Holocaust happened, I believe they were put in cattle cars with in gruesome conditions and were worked to death as i've said. No I don't believe gas chambers though I do know they used the crematoria for burning the dead for they were dying faster than they could bury them/ If you can show me real evidence of the gas chambers I will view it with an open mind and listen. 
As you say you lost a lot of people in the camps, we (Iranians) have lost a lot of people to the allies when they invaded our country, we lost a lot of people who volunteered for the Battle of Berlin too. 

And yes. I would not be offended by a Nazi flag on someone's car as long as he's not a neo nazi punk. And yes I would have rather had Nazis win than the soviets. How is that even wrong? Just because you don't agree with it does not make it wrong or evil. ","1304214119"

At the very least, can you please do your friend a huge favour? Ask her to go out for breakfast somewhere, and when she arrives, give her a huge hug and thank her for sharing her secret with you, and that you are honoured by it. 

Remember, at the very least, she is /your/ friend. Make sure her trust in you is validated (because surely you can understand why she wouldn't just tell anybody and everybody, and how a lie gets caught up like that). 

Talk to her and see what happens. If you decide to pursue a path of love, I'm sure you'll make things work. ","1304214125"
"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","**Short answer**: because we love you and we don't want to hurt you or make you feel stupid before we've given it a couple hours of thought. (Or we're too angry to care enough to tell you.)

**Long answer**: because you wouldn't understand anyway, or you'd say something to make us angrier. Sorry, but it's usually the truth - we (some of us) try to give you an escape route (a slight hint as to how you could make things better, but we don't want to say flat out ""say this/do this and then it will be better"" because if you're told, then it loses impact). If we have something in our minds that we expect you to say, and you say something that we deem negative,  you're looking at a one-way ticket to couchville (if you're with a girl who'd do that sort of thing.) 

Okay, I'm a very over-analytical person and I do not mean that this works for ALL women (nor even close to it) but I've tried to create a scenario to better explain how I think this works.

**The scenario**: You and I are dating. My dog just died, I loved my dog. I'm very sad. I tell you in a text, but your response is little more than an ""Oh."" or a ""That sucks"" -- I'm hurt that you don't immediately offer me some sort of ""I want to cheer you up"" (""I'm so sorry - do you want to go for a walk tonight to talk about it?"" ""Ugh that sucks, I lost a pet once, it was horrible"" ""That must be really upsetting.. can I do anything to make you feel better?""), so when I get quiet - you ask me ""What's wrong?"" I say ""Nothing."" -- in saying this, my thought-process is ""if I tell him I'm mad because he's being insensitive, he'll become defensive and I'm not in the mood to fight with him - I'll say things I don't mean because I'm upset."" -- so I say ""nothing"" so I can go calm down. (Although now I'd say ""can we talk about it later, I'm just really down right now and not quite sure what I'm feeling."" or something similar.) 

So - consider this. Consider you are one of the entirely clueless males that aren't very good with empathy. (Not all of you are, I don't mean to generalize.) Let's pretend I answered you honestly; ""I'm upset because you aren't offering me an understanding shoulder to cry on / assistance in feeling better."" Let's follow some of your possible response routes, shall we?

1) You: ""I'm sorry."" / My thoughts: ""It doesn't take a genius to know that you should console someone when they're down. Is it he just apologizing to shut me up? Does he even understand what I just said or is this just a damage control defense?""

2) You: ""Oh."" / My thoughts: INSERT RAGE FACE HERE

3) You: ""I'm sorry, I should've been more understanding."" / My thoughts: ""Uh yeah. So why don't you just start being understanding instead of just apologizing for it.""

4) You: (Best possible response) ""I'm sorry, I do want to cheer you up but I wasn't sure how to show it / wasn't sure what I could offer / wasn't sure if you needed space alone. Do you want to talk / go for coffee / go for a walk / watch Seinfeld?""  My thoughts: ""Aww, okay, all better."" (Because you show regret for your lack of action, and an understanding by initiating contact)

5) You: (Worst response) ""So? It's just a dog.""  My thoughts: RAGE FACE x YOU + GAS CAN / FIRE.

By the standards of ancient history that's pretty much a slam dunk, and much better than what we have for Pythagoras or Heraclitus.  Do you doubt the historicity of Pythagoras and Heraclitus?

Jesus was mostly forgotten for decades after his death other than by a small group of followers who left Jerusalem and his tomb (assuming there was one) was in a city that was sacked and depopulated.

Also, the wiki link I gave says there is a test plant being built in Alaska now, and it is expected to produce 25 megawatts, and the potential there is magnitudes greater.  

Anyway, you don't have to accept it, but enhanced plants are successfully operating, and more are under construction right now. I can't find any sources that say they are going to take more energy to produce than they will provide, so unless you provide a source, I'll assume what I know is correct.

Edit: because I assume you are American I just had a quick look at the US page for geothermal in the US and it says this:

&gt;As of August 2008, *103 new projects are underway* in 13 U.S. states. When developed, these projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 MW of power, meeting the needs of about 4 million homes.

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","In case you didn't pick it up, propagationofsound's comment is a quote from the Fallout series. My comment was a quote from Metal Gear Solid 4.

Although the quotes seem contradictory on the surface, when you examine their contexts it's actually quite interesting.

In the Fallout series, the statement refers to the inherent nature of man, that if there were only two people left on earth, one of them will try to kill the other. Basically, that it's human nature for conflict to emerge. It also refers to the fact that war is never a pretty, clean thing, and that whether it is fought with sticks, swords, guns or bombs, it's always a brutal, ugly event.

In Metal Gear Solid, ""War has changed"" is not saying that the fundamental nature of war has changed, but rather that the fundamentals of why and how have. Weapons are networked, and there are lots of drones, AI controlled. The decision to kill is cold and calculated, with no human input. Human soldiers have nanomachines in them, which helps stabilise emotions, remove fear and make them into ruthless killers. But most importantly, it refers to how wars are fought by proxy, that people are not fighting over land, over ideology or 'for a cause', but simply as cogs in a machine to keep the military industrial complex profitable.

Of course, this exactly happening right now, but as a piece of fiction, it is somewhat plausible.

But yeah, basically, the manner in which war is waged has changed, but the fundamental nature (one guy doesn't like another guy for xyz reasons) hasn't.

Of course, it could all just be a load of bullshit.","1304214177"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Do you think you would be able to get into a Biology program if you were very outspoken about how all of Biological research is complete garbage?

Well, that's actually not a good analogy. According to wikipedia ""Religious studies is the academic field of multi-disciplinary, secular study of religious beliefs, behaviors, and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasising systematic, historically-based, and cross-cultural perspectives."" As such, a better analogy would be:
&gt;""Do you think you would be able to get into a Biology program if you were very outspoken about how some premises of Biology are complete garbage?""

I personally feel that you can't be denied education based on your beliefs alone, so I'd answer yes to your first question. Sure, you might say that his beliefs are a good indicator that he will likely be a shitty researcher in that area, but that still wouldn't be a good argument, because no one forces you to go into research after graduate studies.

Now, the answer to my more appropriate analogy, the answer is cleary positive. In fact, if the person trying to get in has a great background, you might even hope that one day he might revolutionize an area of biology. Contesting current theories is at the bedrock of scientific progress. That of course raises the issue that Biology is a science, and Religion is not, and they can't really be compared by a simple analogy like that.

In either case, Religious Studies is a secular study, unlike Bible Studies, which isn't, and therefore is not taught at public universities (or at least, shouldn't be).","1304214190"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I work in a grocery store.  One a week, there's a Mom with 3 kids, in homely clothes, who buys baby carrots, ranch dressing, various cheap chicken products, juice, milk, eggs.

Good stuff.

EVERY DAY, MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY, I see people buying Cake, Doritos, Oreos, Coke/Pepsi, Sodas, Ice Cream, and Filet mignon.  No, I'm not kidding you.  Filet Mignon.  We can't deny them.

I think the worst of the worst, was this woman who was CLEARLY doing alright... probably because she circumvents the checks and balances by not reporting income, or having a boyfriend support her...  she came in, nice earrings, done-up hair, nails, iphone, LV purse, nice clothes.  She bought a birthday cake for her son.  It was REALLY nice too..  It had his picture printed on edible rice paper and it was covered in fudge and raspberries.  Very classy.  Cost?  $60.00 USD.

Guess how she paid for it?

Food.  Stamps.

...

I don't have a citation man, you're correct that I'm pulling that figure out of the air, but I've worked in this grocery store since I was a kid, all the way through college.  8 years.  I've seen it all, and I've seen all the people who abuse the system.

There are people who need it, ... and those are the only people who use it correctly, ... but women, (irresponsible women), have a child and keep it, knowing they can't support it.  So the government steps in and offers to pay for food, but she takes it and quenches her own desires for oreos, instead of buying baby carrots and healthy things for her kid.

...

Never forget this story^

If VaHi, Murphy's is maybe an option, though it may be a little casual for prom.  Decatur has Wahoo, Leon's Full Service, Cakes and Ale, and Watershed but all of these are more casual, and not what I would do for prom given the choice.

If you're still in comm school, when they let you pick your unit at the end, don't pick some big G-6 or anything (like HQSVCBN Okinawa...holy shit did that suck).  In my experience, the smaller units where they may only have 2-3 data guys/girls were much more fun since they actually treated us like people and appreciated our work.  The higher level G-6 stuff does look good on a resumé though...

Don't worry about college, but instead get as many certs as you can while you're active duty and the military will pay for it (they have ""boot camp"" classes all the time).  The certs and experience will help you with getting a job more than college will and you can take advantage of the GI bill to pay for college later on.  I only did 4 years and got out as a Corporal, but I got my Network+ right before I got out.  That 4 years experience plus the certification landed me some awesome contracting jobs in Okinawa paying 2-3 times as much as I made active duty (I have several more certs now though).

I dunno. Where there's smoke, there's fire. Seems to me that this is the case of ""likes familiarity, afraid of change and losing what you have"" sort of thing. But your subconscious seems to have already moved waaaaay the hell on to other things, like this guy. Or maybe any guy.

The question he's probably asking himself is why you'd do such an obvious thing or how you could be so oblivious. Maybe both. Hell, probably both. And the worst part is it doesn't seem to make you appreciate what you've got, just sorry. Sorry in general.

Sorry is one of those necessary words I don't like, I think it's a bit cheap and/or overused. There's a lot of times where people cop out and say ""sorry"" instead of actually owning up, clearly explaining how they've done wrong and then laying out concrete steps to ameliorate and/or permanently correct the behaviour.

Look at yourself. You're fighting hard for this relationship and then sabotaging it. Come on, woman. Life ain't supposed to be that hard. Yeah, it's all noble and shit with the ""it's worth fighting for"" stuff, but here it seems like nonsensical garbage. You are like the person who does things just for the sake of doing them, you go through the motions without setting achievable goals...or even knowing why you do it.

This is why your counseling has failed and it's how you got yourself into this mess.

If you're really as sorry as you say, you should stop being afraid of being alone and go do it for awhile and figure some things out. It's like running. You need to know when to stop and catch your breath. You're running for the sake of running and running yourself into the ground.","1304214228"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Going into team and player instructions won't disrupt the overall tactic *during* a game, but between matches, watch how much you tweak.

Use your first season to get your tactics down and then settle on one or two main tactics. You can check the ""match preparation"" section to see how comfortable your team is with your tactic. Ideally you want the comfort level to be at max all the time, but if you go making radical changes to the setup you really interfere with this.

Going into a match, have your tactics set from the start, and use the opposition instructions and touchline commands to alter how your team plays. I typically will leave my tactics alone until I can assess the game at half time. 

Also, make sure you have the right players in all of your positions. Try not just matching up a player's natural position with his place on the pitch, but his key attributes and qualities with the role you want him to play. It can take a long time to get a system that works, but once you do you can really roll off the results if the squad stays healthy. 

I have a tactic with Arsenal that brought the very best out of every player. I modeled it after the current Arsenal tactics (from the best I could decipher) and fixed it in certain areas that made it work better in the game. But it took a full season to really isolate the deep changes necessary to make it perfect. 

It is so good I've thought about mailing it to Arsene. Honest to God. I went through a full season and won all but the Carling Cup. And it wasn't even close. ","1304214238"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Old post, but I have to say... you think exactly like me.

But you know, I've often wondered what exactly happens when we go to sleep.  Consciousness ceases at that point, and it's essentially restarted when we wake up and at certain points during the sleep process.  Why don't we fear this as well?  It's because we know we'll be back afterward.  But the consciousness itself is nothing more than the product of the electrical activity within the brain.

If your consciousness was transferred while you were asleep (perhaps sedated more heavily than that though) and your organic body was killed shortly afterward, you would never even experience it.  The only consciousness that would ever exist after the transfer would be that of the digital copy.  And there really wouldn't be any difference between you and the copy because consciousness isn't something that exists on its own.  So no, it's not the ""same"" consciousness, but in much the same way as the consciousness you are experiencing now is not the same as the one you were experiencing yesterday.

Also, I just ran across this article.  It's a good read.

As far as I understand (and I don't understand it very well) the US gives foreign aid to Israel for a bunch of reasons:
1. Military control in the middle east (including american soldiers cooperating and training with israelis). It might be less expensive than building a permanent base somewhere around here.
2. The jewish lobby using its power to increase support of israel.
3. Military-industrial influence over congress - those 3 billion are a major  subsidy to companies like Lockheed-Martin.

&gt;The Canadian Motion Picture 
Distributors Association's (CMPDA) Montreal anti-piracy 
division and the Montreal division of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) gave two different perspectives on 
the scope and impact of camcording in Montreal theaters to 
Econcouns and Econoff on December 6.

An industry association and government law enforcement had different opinions on the role the police should have in combating piracy.  One out of context statement by some unknown person says that someone was arrested as ""a personal favor"".  Nobody really knows who said that, what the context was, who wanted the favor and who it was asked of and if that really had anything to do at all with anything.  

&gt; RCMP officers stated that they arrested the individual ""as a personal favor"" to a  CMPDA official, and that they did not view theater camcording as ""a major issue."" 

Wait, so who are the RCMP officers who said that? Are they high up administrative personnel, or just the officers who made the arrest? It doesn't name the official, it doesn't name who made the order higher up.  It doesn't even say if these 'officers' opinion have any real substance ? This is a couple of pawns bitching because the king asked them to do something they don't like.

I was recently on the hunt for a new smartphone and the cheapest available voice plan. I'm in Canada, things may differ elsewhere, but I can pass along what I learned from my research. My requirements were: new smartphone for cheap, only need minimal minutes, no data plan needed, cheapest voice plan available. I also didn't want to muck around with a used phone (unlocking them or whatever intimidates me) and I don't trust strangers selling me a good working phone, plus I dunno, it's sorta gross :)

Pay as you go plans offer a good bang for the buck if you don't use a lot of minutes. For example, with Bell, I could buy a $100 minute card (equates to about 333 minutes) and the minutes were good for a year. For me, the minutes would had sufficed for the year, so that ends up only costing me about $10/month. Problem is, pay as you go plans, you will not be able to choose a smartphone direct from the carrier. Yes, as others suggested, you can take the sim and put it in another phone, but that involves buying another phone (could be expensive), possibly doing some fiddling around, blah blah, so I ruled out that option

All other big carriers in my region offered smartphones at $100 or so if you took a 3 year contract, but that also involved that you had to take a monthly plan that included a data plan. Those all started at $50 a month (too expensive for me), so I ruled those out. With the same carriers (Bell, Rogers, Telus, ...) if you bought the phone, you could choose whatever voice plan you wanted, but buying the phone meant anywhere from $400 and up.

I then researched Koodo and went with them in the end. They offer smart phones for low prices (plus you can use the tab) and they do not force you to take a data plan. There is no contract, and lots of plans to choose from. I got an Optimus One phone for $150, but I put all of it on the tab, so I paid nothing upfront. I also got a $100 visa gift card when signing up. I chose the 50 minutes a month plan that costs me $15 a month. I made sure the data transfer on the phone is turned off (just an option checkbox in the settings) and I am a happy camper! I got the new smartphone I wanted, and the monthly cost is reasonable. I use wifi at home, and my bill doesn't run up when I'm elsewhere (it won't contact the 'mothership' unless you are connected wifi or have the data enabled option turned on).

Hmmm, I also just thought about this after writing all of this up: I wonder if Koodo is even available in the states (assuming that is where you are....).","1304214286"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I agree with your point that learning how to connect manually to a database is important. Not knowing how a database works can lead to performance problems with lazy loading, etc. And with ORMs one will inevitably hit the wall of its limitations, so knowing how to work around them is a vital skill.

However, I believe that new developers benefit greatly from instant gratification. There is nothing more disheartening than wasting days learning how do to a simple task like retrieving data from a database. And when I was at that stage I developed many bad habits when I tried to reinvent the wheel by solving problems that were already solved. You get to see this a lot with PHP. Most new PHP coders that I've met have spent a lot of time sanitizing code to prevent SQL injections that could have been easily solved with basic prepared statements. (When I was young I spent a week inventing the Abstract Factory Pattern. I didn't know that it already existed.) 

SubSonic saved my neck a few years ago. I inherited a really bad heap of code and was tasked with putting up a web page to display some statistics. Gentle.net was crapping out so I picked up SubSonic, learned it, and created a prototype in just a weekend. I had never learned or developed anything so quickly. The prototype is still used in production today.

However, I am not a fan of the Active Record pattern so I dropped SubSonic. I checked Massive but quickly realized that it also didn't work with clean static POCOs so I lost interest. PetaPoco, a data layer inspired by Massive, seemed to address that issue but I don't think that it works well with relationships so I stopped investigating any further.

I used other ORMs like Fluent NHibernate, but dropped them when the Code First mode of the Entity Framework came out. I really hated the Entity Framework, but its last release made me a convert. I hadn't used anything so simple and useful since the last time that I used SubSonic.

That connection string website is very useful. I still think that .net connection strings and the entire idea of using xml files as configuration files is a bad habit learned from Java. I can never remember how to write those things.

Dapper seems interesting so I'll keep it in mind for the inevitable moment when the Entity Framework starts to crap out on me.","1304214293"

I'd just round change up to the nearest .05 cents, keep track of my shortage, and pull the difference from the give/take-a-penny cup.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It's not really a matter of being able to hack it, it's far more complex than that. 

Women are already held to a different standard than men when it comes to physical fitness (this is definitely true in the Army and I believe in the Marines as well). Allowing women into the Infantry means that physical standards will lower significantly. As much as it doesn't sound PC, women are generally weaker in upper body strength than men, meaning that you can't expect a female to be able to do 80 pushups or 10-15 pull ups the way that male infrantrymen should be able to do any day of the week. 

I see the infantry as the tip of the spear that shares a disproportionate amount of the actual fighting in any wars, so of course we want to have the highest physical fitness standards possible, these will inevitably lower if women are allowed into the ranks. Of course there a many, many women that are in better shape than many infantryman. We aren't talking about allowing just the elite women into the infantry though, you would have to accommodat the average female. 

Really this is one of the simpler complications with allowing females into the infantry. You also have to deal with the fact of accommodating females into separate showers, sleeping quarters etc. this just is not possible in the infantry as it exists today without fundamentally changing the way we train and fight. 

Then you have the inherent fact that most men are going to want to protect women, meaning that guys are going to put themselves into unnecessary risks when their female battle buddy comes under fire because of the cultural bias that guys are supposed to protect women. 

The real, uglier problem, is the very real risk of sexual assault and harassment. Imagine suddenly allowing women into the guys locker room of a college football team but multiply it by three. There is already a huge issue of sexual assault and harassment in the military, and there is no reason to expect that this wouldn't occur even more frequently in an infantry line unit. 

I'm the most progressive guy you could ever meet, really, but as much as I think that allowing females into the infantry or other combat roles is technically and theoretically possible and probably right when it comes to complete equality, i don't think the military as it exists today is capable of accommodating women into the infantry without fundamentally changing the way we do our business. You probably know how much the military abhors change, so this is naturally a pretty thorny issue without a simple solution. 

People can talk about the issue philosophically all you want, and I'm sure this won't be a popular post on Reddit, but anyone who has spent any time in the infantry can tell you that it's an entirely different beast than the rest of military, you can't simplify the issue into some easy PC female-equality issue when you really have no idea how we do our work. 


At any rate, thanks for your service and I've enjoyed reading your female perspective on the military.

What you are describing is feasible; turbos spin at very high RPMs and in order to harness that energy, you would need a large (read: heavy) electric motor and probably a supercapacitor bank.  The setup would also add complexity to the turbocharger itself.  For those reasons, it probably wouldn't be cost effective.  Interesting from an engineering perspective though.

&gt;Also could it act as an ~~alternator~~ generator if it drew power from the turbo instead of using a waste gate?

Sure.  You could feed this energy into the supercapacitor bank, but you would have to keep the wastegate in case the bank were full.

&gt;Could the turbo be then used to start the engine itself by forcing air into it?

Possibly, in the case of a diesel engine.  But this would be much less effective than just using a starter motor, due to frictional and heat related losses.

&gt;Could it be used as a form of regenerative engine braking?

Yeah, similar to a 'Jake brake' in semi trucks.  It would operate in the generator mode you talked about in your first point.

In all, the electrically assisted turbocharger is an interesting idea, but is more complex than a solution such as wedging an electric motor between the engine and transmission, a la the new Infiniti M35h.","1304214360"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","There was a terror apparatus operating in Soviet Russia since the 1917 Revolution, millions and millions were killed including most members of the Russian communist Party, like Ernst Rohm and the SA men that died on the Night of the Long Knives, they were used, then sold out then murdered.

They had been the Communist Revolutionaries, who had peacefully made the decision to endorse a Communist government.

&gt;Understand that the land borders between Russia Poland and Germany were only loosely policed, except in time of war, thus political ideals crossed rivers and mountains, so did the Zionists, thus a Yiddish speaking Khazar was equally at home in Poland as in Germany or Russia.

So reading below, Plocker has identified Jews as the most part of the terror in Russia, surely their influence extended as far as Germany. Who funded and planned the vast Nuremburg type rallies held throughout Germany as the Nazis came to power, the whole world was in the grip of a depression so where did the money for the uniforms, and the flags come from.

Jews established and staffed the Secret Police forces who took advantage of the upheavals of the 1917 Russian revolution, who used draconian laws similar to modern US anti terror legislation, that enabled arrests without trial and indefinite detention on anyone they wanted, that caused the millions of deaths blamed on Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin.

**Sever Plocker @ Ynet News**

&gt;The Jews were responsible for both Hitler’s and Stalin’s excesses .. Some of the worst mass murderers in history were Jews …20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. 

&gt;Within a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names: From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB.

&gt;We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags.

&gt;Whole population strata were eliminated: Independent farmers, ethnic minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers, intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, “opposition members” who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the Communist party itself. 

&gt;In his new, highly praised book “The War of the World, “Historian Niall Ferguson writes that no revolution in the history of mankind devoured its children with the same unrestrained appetite as did the Soviet revolution. In his book on the Stalinist purges, Tel Aviv University’s Dr. Igal Halfin writes that Stalinist violence was unique in that it was directed internally.

&gt;Lenin, Stalin, and their successors could not have carried out their deeds without wide-scale cooperation of disciplined “terror officials,” cruel interrogators, snitches, executioners, guards, judges, perverts, and many bleeding hearts who were members of the progressive Western Left and were deceived by the Soviet regime of horror and even provided it with a kosher certificate.

All these things are well-known to some extent or another, even though the former Soviet Union’s archives have not yet been fully opened to the public.

&gt;Who knows about this? Within Russia itself, very few people have been brought to justice for their crimes in the NKVD’s and KGB’s service. The Russian public discourse today completely ignores the question of “How could it have happened to us?” As opposed to Eastern European nations, the Russians did not settle the score with their Stalinist past.

&gt;And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name “Genrikh Yagoda,” the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU’s deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. 

&gt;Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin’s collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the “bloodthirsty dwarf.”

&gt;Yezhov was not Jewish but was blessed with an active Jewish wife. In his Book “Stalin: Court of the Red Star”, Jewish historian Sebag Montefiore writes that during the darkest period of terror, when the Communist killing machine worked in full force, Stalin was surrounded by beautiful, young Jewish women.

&gt;Stalin’s close associates and loyalists included member of the Central Committee and Politburo Lazar Kaganovich. Montefiore characterizes him as the “first Stalinist” and adds that those starving to death in Ukraine, an unparalleled tragedy in the history of human kind aside from the Nazi horrors and Mao’s terror in China, did not move Kaganovich.

&gt;Many Jews sold their soul to the devil of the Communist revolution and have blood on their hands for eternity. We’ll mention just one more: Leonid Reichman, head of the NKVD’s special department and the organization’s chief interrogator, who was a particularly cruel sadist.

In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. 

&gt;They too, of course, were gradually eliminated in the next purges. In a fascinating lecture at a Tel Aviv University convention this week, Dr. Halfin described the waves of soviet terror as a “carnival of mass murder,” “fantasy of purges”, and “essianism of evil.” 

&gt;Turns out that Jews too, when they become captivated by messianic ideology, can become great murderers, among the greatest known by modern history.

&gt;The Jews active in official communist terror apparatuses, in the Soviet Union and abroad and who at times led them, did not do this, obviously, as Jews, but rather, as Stalinists, communists, and “Soviet people.” 

&gt;Therefore, we find it easy to ignore their origin and “play dumb”: What do we have to do with them? But let’s not forget them. My own view is different. 

&gt;I find it unacceptable that a person will be considered a member of the Jewish people when he does great things, but not considered part of our people when he does amazingly despicable things.

Even if we deny it, we cannot escape the Jewishness of “our hangmen,” who served the Red Terror with loyalty and dedication from its establishment. After all, others will always remind us of their origin.” Sever Polker ","1304214360"

A number of years ago, I was a TA for an introductory computer science course where the students, as a final project, implemented a Newtonian gravity simulator that could handle tens of thousands of particles at interactive update rates using the [Barnes-Hut method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation).

If you're talking billions of particles or more sophisticated physics, then you probably need more than just your desktop computer.

For what it's worth, here's the authors' answer to your question:

&gt; Solar System sized simulations at a small time step (~2 minutes) are very accurate.
&gt; Galaxy sized simulations are only representative and not very accurate (as Universe Sandbox doesn't take dark matter into account which doesn't have much of an observable effect on our solar system but noticeably affects galaxies. Nor does Universe Sandbox consider Einstein's theory of general relativity as the basis of any of its calculations.).

I don't know how large the relativistic corrections to these simulations would be, but I'd think that omitting dark matter from galaxy-scale simulations would prevent you from getting good results.","1304214367"

You don't need a tongue to talk, just ask the deaf community.

You chew with your teeth, not your tongue. The tongue is just used to move the food around the mouth. You can still eat without a tongue. 

&gt;Eat your girlfriend's pussy

You could still stimulate the vulva with your mouth, just not as well.

&gt;Whistle 

Some forms of whistling are actually done solely with the lips or even the hands. 

As you can see, while the tongue is very useful it is not strictly necessary for most of the functions it serves. The foreskin is exactly the same with, a few exceptions: 

Circumcised men cannot enjoy docking or other sexual acts that require a foreskin. They also cannot enjoy the sensations of the foreskin itself, whose nerve endings are very sensitive to stretching and pressure. ","1304214387"

&gt;A sphere is not flat, but a cylinder is: imagine a piece of paper, you could easily roll this into a cylinder without stretching it, but you can't make it into a perfect sphere without creasing or stretching it.

By ""flat"" here, you only mean that the cylinder has an *intrinsically* flat geometry, right? Viewing the 2-dimensional cylinder surface embedded in 3-dimensional space, we would say that it has extrinsic curvature but is intrinsically flat, right? I understand that it need not be embedded in a higher-dimensional space, but I just want to clarify this point for myself.

So when we talk about the curvature of 3d space (or of n-dimensional space perhaps), it's usually assumed that we mean the ""intrinsic curvature"", unless otherwise specified?

&gt;We can know the local topology because there is much less to know, but knowing things like the curvature is difficult.

This may be getting out of the realm of math and more into physics, but how exactly could one measure the local topology of the space in which our solar system exists? How have we determined it (that quote from Jeff Weeks seems to imply that we know what it is, but maybe we don't)? I understand that to measure the (intrinsic) local geometry of 3-space, you just need to sum up the angles of a triangle (made up of geodesics connecting three unique points). So what would you do differently to measure the topology? What tests could you do?

Also, if you know the geometry of some space, do you also then necessarily know its topology? I would assume the answer is yes, but I could definitely be wrong.

Finally, when people talk about Euclidean space (of whatever dimension), are they ONLY referring to it having a flat geometry, or does the term Euclidean also imply some specific type of topology (or maybe it even implies other characteristics of the space beyond geometry that I'm not thinking of)?

Please forgive me for asking so much. I'm just starting out developing an intuition for this stuff and I have a hard time even figuring out what the right things to ask are to clear up my confusion.","1304214408"

I want to read books that profoundly affect me, and in my experience just because a book has the designation of a 'classic' doesn't mean it will or won't. War &amp; Peace blew my mind, Anna Karenina not so much, for example. I like reading books that make me believe in the power of literature, that awaken the possibility of communicating at a profound hard to describe level.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Same here. A few years ago, I got scallion pancakes and some other stuff at a Chinese place in the Boston suburbs. I ate most of mine, and my friend just had one of the pancakes. 2 hours later I'm at home and passed out. I wake up around 1am with the need to take a massive, gassy dump. I sit on the pot and start spraying shit juice as my stomach starts gurgling and waves of nausea pass over me. I'm not sure what the fuck is going on and right then I begin puking on myself while still shitting. I was delirious and it took a while for me to realize that I could use a bucket, so I used it for a few minutes, but both ends were releasing half-digested juices, so I said fuck it and just kept dribbling on myself. When you're that sick, eventually you just don't care. It was the first time I've ever had food poisoning, and there's no question that's what it was because I've never had an experience like that in my life. ","1304214426"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","This is going to need some careful wording. Date rape drugs are mercifully rare, and while people really fear them, the overwhelming majority of rapes like involve only alcohol as the incapacitating agent. Simply put, women are told to fear date rape drugs, but the culprit is often just one drink too many.

Let me emphasize that I am not suggesting that what happened to Liz was any less of a rape, or any less of a crime- just that it did not involve drugs. 

She's working with implications. She does not say she was drugged, and most likely the medical examination she received did not give any evidence for them, so she couldn't say so in the book. The effects she describes could be an inexperienced drinker having way more than she's used to.

The fact that a rape occurred was undeniable. But there is no evidence that ""The House Special"" a) was drugged, b) was anything more than a popular mixed drink, or c) was given regularly to newcomers. With liberties taken in the book, she is free to imply all of these.

What happened to her sounds much more chilling if this is regular protocol. If this was a procedure that the frat had perfected, it makes for a more frightening atmosphere. 

Again, I am not trying to minimize what happened to her. I am just stating that we cannot make these assumptions.","1304214433"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I hear that exfoliating the crotch every day, applying deodorant and moisturizing with vitamin E oil is supposed to help a lot.

If you keep shaving and maintaining every day, your crotch skin apparently does get used to it, but most guys can't be bothered to spend like, 20 minutes extra minutes a day just shaving, scrubbing and moisturizing their crotch. It's a lot more work than shaving your face, and most guys don't even feel like doing *that* every day. I know that a lot of guys actually do like being smooth down there, but i've never met a guy who can consistently shave without issues. It'd be kind of interesting, though.

You could also try waxing; the pros are that you'll avoid stubble entirely, and you'd only have to do it once a month. . . so it's very low maintenance. The cons are that it can be a bit more painful or expensive than you'd like. I'd probably recommend [Sugaring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugaring_%28epilation%29) instead; it's a lot cheaper, way less painful and you can do it at home.

To me, this means we can post here on all issues affecting women, whether it be about our periods, our makeup, our hair, sexual assault, or our rights. I've been reading this sub almost my entire time I've been on reddit (over 1 year now), and I think it has always been a fair balance of everything. 

This is the first I've heard that believing in total equality among men and women is ""uncool,"" or not relaxed or comfortable, as your edit says.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I recommend one of David Burns' books like Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy or Intimate Connections. I think a lot of the advice given so far is right on but Burns can give you some cognitive-behavioral techniques to actually show you how to start liking yourself.

Remember, whenever you’re worried about what others will think of you, you’re really just worried about what you will think of you.

If you're really committed to weight loss I recommend some form of intermittent fasting or at least some way of eating less that works for you. There's so much health and fitness advice out there that tries to make losing weight complicated so they can sell us expensive books and programs. But I think it really is just about eating less.

I got to a point in my life where I wanted to lose weight but felt overwhelmed with all the diet and fitness information on the internet and frustrated by little progress. The best advice I can give you is while working out is good for you, probably 90% of weight loss is diet. This might even seem radical but I don't think you even need to do a bunch of boring cardio to lose weight. That was freeing to me because I hated feeling like I have to get on the treadmill to lose weight and then I could begin to do active stuff because I wanted to and not feeling like I have to.

Anyway, if you're interested, a good resource for fasting is Eat Stop Eat or you can just get a lot of free info from the guy's blog bradpilon.com.

Good Luck!","1304214442"

My ideas are mine, and if I see anything that looks derivative (as long as my idea has come to fruition), and I don't get credit, I'll not be very happy. Intellectual property, to me at least, boils down to giving credit where credit is due.

In the instance of torrenting, I'm not using the movies and music I torrent for anything but my own pleasure. I'm not making derivative works (for-profit or not). I'm just not realizing the potential profit of whatever production company or record label gets the profit from the movie or music, respectively.

Either way, the answer you gave is totally off the mark for what the OP was asking for. 

I think we are misunderstanding each other in terms of what ""authority of Islam"" means. 

When you get a fatwa for a problem (not `aqeedah related), **you do not ask a sheykh or scholar that has died or lives in a completely different societal context than yourself.** You ask local shuyoukh who have the necessary knowledge.

When a community is in need for a leader, they go to their local mosque and look to their Sheykh/Imam - this is authority.","1304214475"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Individualism encompasses individual rights, I don't really share your view that is teaches us that every man should be an island. I suppose some extremists might take it that way though.

I will point out that you are probably not *really* for this kind of social justice which you seem to promote. This normally causes cognitive dissonance and downvoting though, but hear me out first:

You point out that the disparity between the rich and the poor is great, and I agree. However, I point out that the poorest in America are far richer than the poor of the rest of the world. This leads to the question: why are these people poor? Is it because they lacked the opportunity, I would argue: no. I would say it was their choices. If you look at the statistics most poor people fall into some category, a category based on choice, that lead to their situation. They used drug, had children, bought iphones they couldn't afford, whatever. (before I sound heartless, I grew up poor, I felt hunger). 

But this isn't the point. My point is that you probably don't really favor the kind of socialist reforms that the left seems to subscribe to. Why? Because even the poor here in Canada, say someone earning minimum wage, would need to be taxed at 50% to bring about equality on the world wide scale. I can run the numbers for you if you would like, they are solid. They lead to the simple fact that *almost every Canadian is rich*, on the world scale anyways. So the question is, would you be willing to live on 11,000 USD a year? Because it is the ultimate outcome of the kind of equality you are talking about? (I am neglecting deadweight losses, losses in productivity, etc. for the sake of argument (it would be worse in reality)).","1304214477"
