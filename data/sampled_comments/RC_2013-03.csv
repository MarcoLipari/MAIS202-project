It's hard for me to comment on the religious side of it though. It's easy enough for me to say, ""Do what you want. You're the parents, not them."" but I don't know your situation. 

Personally, there is no room for extremism in my life, and I'd consider ""extremely Orthodox"" a form of extremism. Will it cause animosity in the family and potential resentment towards your son? Maybe. But are there advantages of shielding him from that sort of negative lifestyle? Sure.

Apparently the man is a taxidriver and was ""obstructing the traffic"", so the police had to intervene. Then this happened, according to the police: 
&gt;The officers claimed that the man assaulted one of the officers and grabbed his gun, before the other officer “overpowered the taxi driver and handed the firearm back to his colleague.”

After that they handcuffed him to the truck and dragged him a few hundred meters to the police station, where he later died from head trauma. An unnamed prisoner claims that the officers continued beating the taxi driver at the station.","1362096001"

&gt; The US has never developed a cyberweapon aimed at china.

He is free to continue claiming this even after acknowledging Stuxnet until there is proof that the US ""aimed"" it at China. Almost all indicators point to Iran being the intended target, but due to the fact that it is a worm, found itself in computer systems of countries that likely have large amounts of communication with Iranian machines. There is no indicator the intended target was China, so the US did not ""aim"" it at them.

&gt; The US has never used a cyberweapon against china (successful or not).

Again, this depends on your definition of against. The intended role of Stuxnet, from all analysis of it, is that the worm was intended to infect specific Iranian machines and cause disruption to their nuclear program. Stuxnet infected the personal computers of AEOI staff, and likely nodes that communicated with these computers, or nodes that those computers were likely to communicate with (for the purposes of eventually infecting the target). There's also evidence that the Stuxnet payload only was intended to operate on the specific machines targeted in the attack, and for the most part did. The infections of computers other than the targets were mostly tangential. Yes, the US likely used a cyberweapon if you consider collateral damages.","1362096005"

If they're substantively different, you can't ignore the substantive differences unless you can show that they don't affect the probability distribution.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I agree.  There definitely is a debate regarding actual combat effectiveness.  They deal damage at the same speed (shown below), but the Red9 allows for more accurate follow-up shots and conserves ammo.  The Blacktail has higher capacity (but I personally have found that there is little need for capacities over about 20) but also needs it due to the lower damage.  They really are so close in combat capability that it can be a preference (and more importantly, style of play) issue.

Damage per 10 seconds: (this calculation neglects capacity)
Red9: 125.0 = [5x(10/0.4)]
Blacktail: 125.9 = [3.4x(10/0.27)]

Damage per magazine:
Red9: 110 = [5x22]
Blacktail: 119 = [3.4x35]

So, they are essentially identical in raw damage dealing capability (the Blacktail only *marginally* outperforms the Red9 in *exceptional* situations, like emptying an entire mag at once).  The Blacktail is going to be better for ""Oh Shit"" moments due to the rate-of-fire (we must remember that every bullet has the capacity to stagger opponents, regardless of damage dealt).

The vast, vast majority of the game consists of player-initiated and manipulated skirmishes with small numbers of enemies for which both guns will perform almost identically.  Also, conserving ammo is always a concern (at least for me) in RE4, which is why I much prefer the Red9.  The Blacktail requires a steady diet of 47.1% *more* handgun ammunition than the Red9 (and this excludes accuracy issues, where the Red9 is undoubtedly superior; computation obtained by [5/3.4-1]x100).

There is an issue of inventory space, which the Blacktail obviously dominates; but if you have a full inventory, you should have no worries anyway.

For players who rush into combat and virtually seek out ""Oh Shit"" moments, the Blacktail will serve you better (not hating on this gameplay style, the 'adrenaline' style of play is more fun for some people).  For those who play more strategically (and use the handgun even for mid to long range engagements), the Red9 will be a better option.

For numerical references: http://strategywiki.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4/Weapons_and_upgrades

This comment until now assumes both guns are fully upgraded.  However, the Red9 is available sooner, allowing you to obtain proficiency with the weapon sooner in the game.  *EDIT: I revoke that last comment because the Blacktail plays almost identically to the handgun and Punisher.  The Red9 plays much differently than the rest, suggesting it has the higher learning curve*

TL;DR: Red9: Range, ammo preservation; Blacktail: CQB.  Both guns will perform equally well under most circumstances, but the player's style of play will determine which gun is better for them.

EDIT: Formatting; added Tl;DR","1362096012"

But I disagree. There's usually plenty of very good discussion on this subreddit. Sure, there's some knee-jerk reactions and sometimes its difficult to go against the hivemind. But that happens to every subreddit once it has a fairly large number of subscribers. There are lots of people who regularly contribute here with lots of good content as well as discussion. And some people have worked really hard from day one to make this subreddit a good place, specially the mods (and it is a good place, compared to any other subreddit I can think of, imo). 

I'd personally want everyone, specially people like you (sometimes controversial maybe, but atleast you speak your mind and bring your own opinion into the discussion) to stay instead of just walking away.

Personally this whole Rafa thing is kind of stupid. Its really surprising and weird how polarized this sub has become over a silly issue like this. I've never seen anything like this before over here. But in the end we all want him gone, and would have preferred RDM to not be sacked. I think once this issue cools down, this sub will be back to normal as well.

All the other baristas who were supposed to open with this supervisor should be involved in this complaint as well. Also mention that complaints to the SM and DM have been useless. Also, ask Partner Resources for the contact information of the Regional Director, who is in charge of the DMs and complain to him/her.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","yes you have to spend 2100 CP to get the ability to carry5 AT mines ([source](http://planetside.wikia.com/wiki/Engineer) just hover over the pips for the utility pouch) 

one thing to note (which is not mentioned on any info text) though is that by increasing the amount of your perfered explosive (c4,AT or AP mine) ALSO increases your maximum amount of them to be actively out (say you have 3 AT mines, you can have 3 AT mines out before they start being replaced)


honestly the utlity pouch is rather useless unless you're using c4 in which case you'd only want the first level and both from c4 itself (700 for c4, 200 for the pouch so 900 CP total) which gives you 3 sticks which IIRC is enough to a sunndy regardless of mineguard or blockade armor ([source in case you wanted it](http://www.ps2calc.com/#vehicle1=Sunderer&amp;vehicle1Upgrade0=0&amp;vehicle1Upgrade1=4&amp;weapon1=C4))  


if you use your mines kamikaze style mainly cause 3 mines is usually more than enough and a lot of times you are barely able you drop 3 mines let alone 5, and should that sunndy have mineguard then you either need backup or 3 sticks of expensive c4 (as mentioned earlier)


TL;DR:

don't bother with it unless you're using c4 or you want to be able to set up multiple traps","1362096018"

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","I think it's because of what makes One Piece the best: the amazingly well-constructed stories sprinkled with awesome characters and actions, where as in Bleach/Naruto's case (more so in Bleach's case) yes the story was there, but as it went on, it just seems like the mangaka can't get a handle on the huge casts and the world he created and the story begins to lose focus. The anime then become a lot less engaging with a lot of plot holes, turning to be mainly about the fighting, the special skills, flashy visuals, another abruptly-appeared-super-strong enemy..etc. Those things can more easily draw people in, but doesn't retain the same interests/love as One Piece, excluding the very loyal fans or teens that only like awesome fights and pretty graphics. I was one of those people sadly, I liked the cool skills and visuals, was in love with Bleach and Naruto from the very start (when they first come on jump), and couldn't bother with this ""pirate king"" manga because the characters and art style just doesn't look as cool. I gave it a try when I have no other manga to read and after the Arlong arc I'd begun to love it, and now it's my absolute favorite on-going manga. TL;DR One Piece is the best because of its stories which takes time to get into, Naruto/Bleach and most other manga/anime focus more on fancy shit which people get into more easily. (Only follow both anime/manga for One piece, for naruto/bleach I've only read manga, feel free to correct me if I have some misinterpretation on them in anime)","1362096027"

"windows","t5_2qh3k","The product key on the bottom of the PC is generic. 9 times out of 10 it won't even activate windows, you can probably call and that might work but don't worry about that. This is getting a little advanced but I will explain it simply without going into a lot of detail. Each OEM PC has a marker in the BIOS called a SLIC table. The OEM (Dell, HP, Fujitsu, Acer, etc) when they develop the BIOS for that particular board do a process called tattooing, this process puts markers in the BIOS so that when they install windows it will automatically activate out of the box and never need reactivation as long as you never change the BIOS of the board. Now its possible to flash one of these tables into your BIOS but I won't go into that here. 

Now depending on the OS that the machine came with the process for activation is different. Windows Server 2003/XP (Windows NT 5) use a process called SLP 1.0 to check for activation, the downside to this is that you need OEM media, and an OEM key because the files that check for SLP activation are not present in retail or VL media. So you can't convert an existing install over to an OEM install without some work. Well this all changed with Windows Vista and beyond (Windows NT 6), up until Windows 8 and Server 2012. With Vista MS changed the method to look for newer parts in a SLIC table and then tied this to a certificate that was issued to the large scale OEM and then used a generic key to activate windows. This was a lot easier because you can convert any install (except Enterprise) to OEM, Retail or VL (in the case of Professional) as long as you have the markers in your BIOS and a corresponding certificate that matches the SLIC table. Windows 8 is a lot more involved because of the amount of people that activated Windows 7 using SLIC loaders. 

Now back to your problem. First step is to identify the version of Windows the machine came with. 

If it came with XP then you need an OEM XP disk, it has to be OEM and you need the OEM key to install from that media. It can be any OEM media as long as its OEM is all we care about. Once you get done installing Windows you need to find a utility called [OEMScan] (http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/82638-oemscan-automated-multi-manufacture-pre-activation-utility/), then get the OEMBios files from [OEMBIOS.net](http://www.oembios.net/) and replace those files with the one from Toshiba. If the tables match the next time you reboot Windows it will be activated. If not then you will need to get the correct OEM BIOS files from the restore media then copy them out of Windows once it is installed, then you can reinstall a clean copy of Windows without all the OEM junk. 

If you have Windows Vista then you just need to find an untouched copy of [Windows Vista SP2](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/23379-Windows-Vista-SP2-Retail-amp-VL-mirror-link!!!). Once you get that installed you need to use [OPATool] (http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/7126-The-Official-Windows-7-Repository/page23?p=149816#post149816) to install the cert and license key for your edition.

If you have Windows 7 then you just need to find an untouched copy of [Windows 7 SP1](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/28517-Windows-7-w-o-SP1-and-SP1-Media-Refresh-Direct-Download-Links). Use [OPATool] (http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/7126-The-Official-Windows-7-Repository/page23?p=149816#post149816) to do all the heavy lifting of installing the cert and key for your edition and you are ready to go.

the point is, in an objective field like science, the top 'professional' scientists all have one thing in common - they are DAMN good at science. in a subjective field like music, the top 'professional' musicians are nothing more than a social litmus test, and not always inherently skilled musicians.","1362096030"

What we don't realize is that, Allah (swt) has provided us with guidance and structure but we are limited by our human capacity. There have been times in history where rulers have implemented Shariah law to the best of their ability and in those times the Islamic empire flourished. What some Muslims fail to understand is that Shariah is not something written in stone where there is a bunch of rules and laws to implement. It's a fluid system that was adapted differently through out history. Unfortunately, since there hasn't been a Calipha for almost 200 years, this system stopped developing.

You could also look at it that we all have a desire to keep living and thus should have a right to do so, but killing someone in their sleep is denying them that right. Well if you look at ethics itself there are two major ethical frameworks, a utilitarian framework which says that what we do should reduce suffering and increasing happiness and the otherframe work is a rights based framework where we determine a set of rights we think people should have based on concepts of fairness and justice.

my girlfriend and I took a set of jenga blocks and etched in the word ""truth"" or ""dare"" into the blocks, and a number that corresponded with either the truth sheet or dare sheet.    
each sheet was a list of truths or dares... all of them mildly humorous on paper, but devastating in reality.   
Questions like: ""when was the last time you faked an orgasm, if you haven't or can't recall, fake one now.""  
or  
""what's the strangest thing you've ever masturbated with, if nothing unusual, smell the finger of every person in group and describe the smell.""  
Dares like ""Demonstrate your favorite sexual position with the person on your left.""  
or  
""Let DeadSeaGulls tattoo your right thigh."" (I have almost no tattoo experience.)   
Among the truths and dares there were 5 group choice in each category.  

Any truth or dare could be declined by a shot, and if anyone intentionally knocks over the tower they have to lick the left nipple of all same sex players until the nipple is erect.  
Loser has to take a shot and do a group choice dare.  

This game nearly broke up 3 couples.  in the picture above, the girl eating the sunchip out of my ass is the guy on the rights girlfriend.   The questions were too real. too raw. resulted in people walking out of the room. but at the same time it was like a train wreck, they kept coming back.  At first you decline so many of them by taking a shot... but after 7 shots.... you're answering what the sluttiest thing you've ever done was, right next to your girlfriend, who decided that she's going to TRUTHFULLY answer the last time she faked an orgasm... shit was brutal.  everyone ended up naked and in the snow.   

all relationships still in tact, but in the way that people who survive a disaster sometimes stay in touch. 

**TL;DR**: Truth or Dare Jenga, Adult Edition.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;&gt;""Because other big media innovations didn't occur as a result of people taking things without purchasing a license.""

&gt;Actually, yes they did. You can argue till you're blue in the face about whether piracy is right, but you cannot tell me that it hasn't been effective.

You said ""...that if these companies don't change their merchandising method they will die, the same way it happened for every other big media inovation.""  I said that that piracy of media is not way it has has happened, and that it is a modern phenomenon.  Then you counter argue by citing your claim of modern piracy as evidence of it always being the case? Okay. That's the equivalent of saying that super-teams like the Lebron James Miami Heat are not a new phenomenon, and citing the Lebron James Miami Heat as proof of that. Strong work.

&gt;Piracy is the only tool that we have against big media to force them into changing, because they sure as hell won't do it on their own (DRM being one negative example that piracy fought against in the music scene).

This assumes that you have a ***right*** to these things.  You do not.  Is the *only* way to convince a parking lot to lower their fees to park there and not pay? Is the *only* way to get my coworker to give me access to his computer files that he refuses to give me access to to hack into his computer? No.  Why? because I don't have a *right* to these things.  If music, movies, games, etc. are too expensive for my preference, then I can not purchase them, right?  

I don't personally give a shit if you pirate things or not, but can you please explain to me how things not being in your price range makes it okay to access without permission?","1362096036"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; See, you lying little racist shithead.

Rage more, that's going to help your argument.

&gt; Your claim: ""The crime rates among blacks in the US are [1] 7-8 times higher than that of whites."" False.

[It's actually true.](http://www.examiner.com/article/federal-statistics-of-black-on-white-violence-with-links-and-mathematical-extrapolation-formulas)

**""Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery.""**

&gt; The facts concern only homicide, not crime

Yeah, because homicide totally isn't a major crime or anything. By the way, my original link also compares robbery.

&gt; and in a range going 29 years, which you want to compare with the poverty rates of one year. Old data is not representative of today.

Except it also shows that the rate is 7 times higher in each individual year. 

&gt; The facts also state that about equally as many blacks are the victims, as offenders.

That's because the main victims of black crime are blacks themselves. But blacks are way more likely to commit crime against whites than whites are against blacks.

&gt; The facts also state that Whites and Blacks are about equally as often victims or offenders. (All between 45% and 53%)

Now it's obvious that you lack even basic math skills and logic.

Blacks are 12.5% of the population, whites are the majority. So if the total share of all crime is about equal, then blacks are still way more LIKELY to be offenders.

Do you not understand what a rate is?

Hot damn you're failing miserably.

&gt; The facts: Victims and Offenders by Demographic Group, 1976-2005 Rate per 100,000 population ""Blacks are disproportionately represented as both homicide victims and offenders. The victimization rates for blacks were 6 times high er than those for whites. The offending rates for blacks were more than 7 times higher the rates for whites.""

Yes, thank you for validating my argument inadvertently due to your inability to properly interpret data.

You just failed so hard right now it's almost surreal. ","1362096046"

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","hello! i am still trying to figure out what name i want to use in bdsm context.. i started using Daddy's little prin-sith, but as i explore more kink, i find i like other things too. right now i'm trying out Lady Lolita. but i digress.

* When and how did you find out about your kink?

would have to be when i met my Daddy, around november of 2011. he introduced me to D/s and i haven't been the same since.

i didn't always know i was Dominant. i've always considered myself submissive (and i feel like that is what i am, first and foremost), but my most recent lover changed that for me. i am a very blunt, take charge kinda girl outside of the bedroom, and he's very service oriented. as a submissive, i felt i could introduce him to BDSM safely. and since i'm also a masochist, i have a pretty good idea of what i like, and i would just try things out on him. and this role has really grown on me.

* Did you have many issues coming to terms with your kink?

not really. i guess i always felt submissive (at least in the bedroom), but i just never explored it before. it's not that i didn't know i was kinky, and i think it sounds weird to say that BDSM completes me, but it's more like something that i guess i always knew i had, but didn't have the words to define or describe it before

* What kinks do you have?

Domination, bondage, cuffs, ball gags, face fucking, (trying to) deepthroat, spanking, bruises anywhere and everywhere, cross dressing, face sitting, crops, belts, nipple play, biting, hair pulling, collars, leashes, crawling, foot worship, pain, teasing, face slapping...

* Do you have a partner? If so, how long been kinky?

i have 3 partners that i play with, but only one that i Domme for. i've been with my sub around 7 months now, and we started exploring D/s probably 4-5 months ago

* What does female dominance mean to you?

to me, it's more of celebrating the feminine, the woman. celebrating and enjoying all the wonderful things that make me a woman

* What does dominance mean to you?

it's a responsibility i accept and take seriously. to truly dominate my sub, i make sure to be, not only an excellent example of a decent human being, but also a nurturing, honest, and loving Mistress. 

* What does submission mean to you?

it's about giving yourself, every single part of you, up to be of use for another person. not just any other person, but someone who you trust to take care of your gift. it's about doing everything you are capable of doing to make this person's life easier/happier/less stressful

* What pleases you most about your sub?

oh, to choose one thing would be too difficult... i love the boy dearly. the way he rubs tiger balm on my bruises after a beating. the way he makes sure i'm fed, hydrated, satisfied, and warm. the way he holds my hair back when i'm throwing up from drinking too much. the way he drives me everywhere, no complaints. he takes exceptionally good care of me, and i haven't even gotten into how much i enjoy having sex with him.. he is such a loyal and devoted pet. idk if i can say anything else to show that.

* What does your domme do that drives you wild?

my Doms are male... and i could go on about the things they do that drive me wild, but that doesn't really belong here (:","1362096047"

Do you really think the generation after them will care about privacy?  Do you think they'll care about privacy when the option is - all the information mankind has every possessed and is currently creating as accessible as a personal memory, or pretend 'privacy' which wont actually be private b/c we are already using every bit of communication information to monitor everyone as of today.  I mean people with out this will be as primitive by comparison as insects are to humans.  No, transparency is the future and combined knowledge will make us something completely different then is even conceivable today.  You know, assuming this tech works and doesnt kill people after 5 years of use, or drive them insane.

And dont even get me started on the AI factor, when some of our new AI come online, you'll be able to link with them too.

Using phrasing like ""There are black people then there are... (you know the rest)"" which you did not but is often seen in this sort of thread is something political correctness opposes, not open discourse using appropriate language. Political correctness does not disallow the statement of statistics. 

From the Proper Use segment of the referenced Uniform Crime Report:
Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place. UCR statistics include only jurisdictional population figures along with reported crime, clearance, or arrest data. Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale. Some factors that are known to affect the volume and type of crime occurring from place to place are:

• Population density and degree of urbanization. 

• Variations in composition of the population, particularly youth concentration. 

• Stability of the population with respect to residents’ mobility, commuting patterns, and transient factors. 

• Economic conditions, including median income, poverty level, and job availability. 

•Modes of transportation and highway systems. 

• Cultural factors and educational, recreational, and religious characteristics. 

• Family conditions with respect to divorce and family cohesiveness. 

• Climate. 

• Effective strength of law enforcement agencies. 

• Administrative and investigative emphases on law enforcement. 

• Policies of other components of the criminal justice system (i.e., prosecutorial, judicial, 
correctional, and probational). 

• Citizens’ attitudes toward crime. 

• Crime reporting practices of the citizenry.

Really, think about, for a moment, the nature of race relations in the USA, and tell me if none of those factors to at least some extent invalidated the 'clear as day' notion that your linked article suggests. Statistics are only ever as useful as the context in which they're fielded. ","1362096052"

I'm not saying be apathetic or expect companionship with no effort, but once you transition from a mindset of need fulfilling (I NEED to be in a relationship because ____) to wanting a relationship (I am content with me and I don't need anything other than myself for happiness. I want to enter into this relationship) then it seems like love always follows. I've observed this in my own life (spent 3 years desperately searching without dating a soul. Had a major reality check and reevaluated my wants and needs. Found my SO of 3 years within the next 4 months) and the lives of my friends as well. 

As for specifics to your query, generic xSTJ warning applies.

In seriousness, I guess I'll just describe my most valued facet of my relationship (M [Ne] INFP and F [Fe] INFJ)  

I feel listened to and understood. Like really listened to. Usually when I talk to someone I sense their disinterest and fade my thoughts into dejected silence. Even among friends who do care what I have to say I perceive a difference. My INTP friend is wonderful to discuss any academic topic with but horrible for sharing feelings with. My INTJ friend always *thinks* he understands me but I sense some disconnect that becomes clear when he attempts to regurgitate my feelings back through metaphor, similar experience, etc. The gist is there, but its not completely me. My ENFP friend *feels* he understands me, but he thinks we are identical and so I feel 95% understood by him, but not wholly. With my INFJ Gf I felt what it feels like to be understood so much so that it brought me to tears. She *gets* me like no one else I've ever met (save two other INFJs :p) 

For me, feeling understood beyond the feeling detached logic level is very important.","1362096055"

Also, it is obvious that they were counting their shots as every reload happened with the last round in the chamber.

Every time someone asks where to eat, the easy responses here are Northside, or in OTR on Vine, but frankly a $10 hotdog at the Senate isn't cheap! And I know this will get downvoted due to the ""Downvote If it's not OTR or Northside Conspiracy"" but here goes.

You want cheap?  Here's a list of inexpensive, but not ""hip"" restaurants, that are local to Cincy.

* Camp Washington Chili - From out of town? Give it a shot, it's a great place, and inexpensive.
* Skyline/Goldstar - Both can be Cincinnati flavors, and both are not expensive.
* White Castle - Cheap...and a chain, but cheap
* Anchor Grille Covington
* Dixie Chili - Newport 
* Eastside Chili - Out by Amelia
* Empress Chili - Westwood/Cheviot 
(You get the idea about Chili places, but which one is best is another thread. I'd hit Camp Washington for it's uniqueness)

Some other places that don't have the ""buzz"", but are inexpensive with tasty food.

* Main Street Cafe - Newtown
* Zip's - Hyde Park
* Arthur's - Hyde Park
* Quatman Cafe - Norwood (Great food AND cheap! I love to go there for lunch.)
* (For expensive try Terry's Turf Club near Lunken Airport, it's great, but not cheap)

You wanted cheap, that's cheap, not necessarily the hipest, nor trendiest. But they won't break the bank, and they all have good food.","1362096062"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","This is a pretty interesting question. One can say that not all muslims are exactly the same in the way that not all Jews or christians are the same. Some christians think evolution is a lie from the devil while others acknowledge the scientific truth of it. I think it's important to acknowledge that not all muslims around the world have exactly the same thoughts about evolution. 

I think overall, a statement could be made saying that globally religion often gets in the way of scientific advancement. There are many examples of this throughout history. The second general statement that can be made is the god-of-the-gaps argument.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","You've gotten a lot of good advice in this thread, not sure if I can add too it.  But I only spend a handful of my first 40 or so points on dps/utility - keeping in mind not to spend them in a way to take longer to get to HP nodes (or at least no more than 1 point or so out of the way).  Then I plan out my HP nodes that I'll want at a 'finished' build, around 80-85 points.  Then I head straight for those, taking the most efficient way I can and grabbing the gravy resist nodes along the way.  Once those HP nodes are complete, likely around 65+points in, then you can branch off and grab a few more of the dps/utility points or continue to head to more HP nodes.

Don't be afraid to grab a point knowing that you'll respec out of it.  You get plenty while leveling and it's not hard to get orbs of regret here and there either.  IMO, a good plan is to be prepared to respec out of 15 points to clean up your tree later.

In the end, you'll get more than enough dps from your gear and gems making those points spent on your tree not worth very much.

Good luck.","1362096063"

Hinduism preaches being vegetarian, but meat has vitamins and proteins crucial for life. If God didn't want us to eat meat, then why would he make us dependent upon it? Buddhism ask you to let go of desire, I can't let go of wanting to cuddle with cute wittle puppies and food. :P 
I also don't like that certain religions discriminate against homosexuals and other religions.
Since these are the reasons why I'm atheist, I never act cocky around religious people or discriminate against them. I sometimes admire people who are religious, kind hearted, devoted but refrain from judging others.
Atheists who make fun of religious people are just typical people who like to think they're better than others (i.e. white supremacists, nazis, Regina George, etc)

If you've ever had any back problems, building up these muscles will also help prevent previous injuries from becoming a chronic issue as you age.

In a dark setting (like a poorly lit stairwell) dip your head a bit and put your hand above your forehead, with the palm facing forward. We have a stairwell in the house I grew up in that once I got tall enough I started hitting my head on, and I'm by no means very tall in this subreddit. I got into the habit of running my hand along the ceiling in that stairwell as it curves down to meet the ceiling of the lower level so I knew when to duck.

Always pick to fight the horse-sized duck.

In order to assess that construct, you need to show that multiple measures that are very different are all correlated to one another. Don Campbell referred to this as ""heterogeneity of irrelevancies"". Essentially this mean that any measure will assess a construct to a certain degree, but it will also miss the mark a little bit. That is why it's important that we use different measures for the same construct so that when we statisitcally isolate their shared variance, we are working with the core nugget of introversion and not any of the fringe, statistical junk, Campbell also called this the local molar causal validity"".

So the person who didn't bring any alcohol had to be subject to one dare, no pussying out, no limits. Basically i had no choice or say in the dare, i could only agree and do it. 

So, in the middle of the party the host (girl who was same age as me) shouts that it's time for brockotaco to do the dare. She gets all her girl friends together and they plan the most embarrassing, exposing, devious dare ever. ""You have to let us blindfold you, tie you up, and do whatever we want for 15 minutes.""

EDIT: Here's what happened

It felt like they were putting cold water on me. They told me it was ketchup, mustard, and other shit like peanut butter. Eventually they started to get pervy ideas, and soon enough my pants are being pulled off. I feel the cold water again but on my shlong. I freaked out, mainly because they whispered to take pictures. I'll never know if they did, but it was embarrassing as hell, and i was really nervous of nudes circulating or something.

I enjoy to see people helping out other people around here.  So, I decided to give you a flair that says ""Helpful Fella""

If you don't care for that, or someone else can think of something else that's more clever, i'd be glad to change it.

Thank you for making this sub. A better place,

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Yeah Platinum player means you actually understand stuff that a lot of new players wouldn't, minimap vision and positioning, for example, are important in both games and since those skills do transfer over to an extent you likely had a huge advantage. Think of it like if you were a really good Halo player who decided to play CS1.6, sure some of the mechanisms are the same, but at the end of the day both games are completely different and you have the upper hand but you have to learn a lot of new stuff. 

I have been playing LoL lately because my computer is not working and since LoL runs on my 4 year old laptop well, it's a cool game to play. I do enjoy the game, but I basically won my first 10 games straight and then now it seems like I'm actually facing players who are half decent. I do die a lot though, but it's for the same reason I'm sure you die in Dota, you don't know enemy abilities. 

edit: oh and overaggression, I always forget that towers in LoL actually protect you. You can't time aggro from towers cause the second you attack an enemy hero, the tower will start hitting you. I'm sure there are ways that people actually do it, but it's probably a skill you learn over time. 

What's kinda funny is, you have similar problems in both games, no one wards and everyone likes to pick carries :). ","1362096100"

After quite a bit of both mental encouragement from my other friends and liquid encouragement from the bar, I finally walked her home one night and expressed everything. It went down worse than the Hindenburg disaster. I essentially made a complete fool of myself and she never felt the same level of comfort around me ever again.

* Have a robust public profile, that shows your stats, last seasons stats, etc
* Have community voted maps put into pool play each season, I mean do people really still queue for vertigo/dust1/aztec? Lets see mirage, mill in the mix for once. This would also give people more reason to make either new maps or rebuild ones from 1.6/css if they can see it go into pool play. Blizzard does something similar each season why can't we?
* Hell even give people achievements for getting so a certain ELO rank, or real achievements like ""Win a 1v5 round in matchmaking, Acing, Get 30 frags in 1 Match""

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Poor Jatt. Every time he co-casts with Rivington, it goes like:

* Jatt says something about Singed going full tank because Singed has Sunfire and Warden,

* More than five minutes later, Rivington is like ""And Singed backs and buys a Sunfire Cape"", sounding all excited that Singed has a new item,

* Later, both teams have an oracle for at least a minute and several wards have been destroyed, and Rivington says something like ""They put a lot of wards, but no pink ward and no Oracle, they really want a lot of vision [blablablablabla] and really a lot of ward but no Oracle, oh wait that guys has an Oracle now"" (still only noticing one of the two Oracles).

I don't get it. Rivington is entertaining, yes, but not more than some other casters, and he keeps saying things that are blatantly wrong and that he could check in a few clicks. I mean, why would anyone say that the teams have no Oracle before checking? There are keyboard shortcuts to select the jungler and support of each team, in 4 keypresses you can be pretty confident sure that no-one has an oracle indeed. Check the two top laners too and you're almost guaranteed to be right. Why risk saying something wrong and make a fool out of yourself?

I mean, many times, Rivington says something false, and Jatt just blanks for a second, sounding like he's debating whether he should correct Rivington or not (at least that's how I feel like things are going). It's embarrassing. Jatt performs so much better paired with other casters...

I don't expect the technical depth and quality of duos like DOA+montecristo (who never cease to amaze me with their Jatt-quality pick predictions, their knowledge of the scene they cast, their analysis of the strategies in game rather than play-by-play. the Asian scene seems to go for very unconventional picks more often than the NA or EU ones, and they always adapt very fast and figure out what is going on and why this team did this lane swap when, etc). But it would be nice that, at least, casters don't say things that are obviously wrong and that they could have checked.

TL;DR: Jatt, good job and loves. Rivington, please work on not saying stupid things that often. Casting is hard and I definitely wouldn't be able to do it as well as Rivington, but trying to fill blanks by saying something that may be wrong is *bad*, I'd rather have a blank. Also, Riot shouldn't just be looking for decent casters, but for really good ones: they can afford it.","1362096104"

"opinion","t5_2qkcf","I don't think the argument is fallacious. His authority as a medical doctor has nothing to do with the validity of the analogy. If there is anything, there is an implicit appeal to his ethos by noting he's a doctor. That's not fallacious. His title, and the academic background that birthed it, are highly impressive. Magna cum laude from Brown, and a MD from John Hopkins. Not only that, but he's also worked for Newsweek, the Washington Post, the Baltimore Sun, and USA Today. He's a highly intelligent, educated, and informed individual. That matters. 

But that only matters if his argument rests on him being a doctor. But it doesn't. No one, including him, is proclaiming that further debate is forestalled by his credentials. And his arguments do not rest on the premise that, ""I am a doctor, and therefore I know."" If you think ""people may take it as fact"" then that's not fallacious reasoning on his part; that's just people being stupid.

But, I'm not saying you shouldn't question his credentials. I'm saying you should question it only when it's used as part of his argument. If it's not, then you're committing an ad hominem fallacy and attacking the speaker rather than the argument. This piece isn't a new analogy. Take him away and the argument still survives. Hell, take away the analogy and the argument still survives. Your macroeconomic arguments are spot on, but I think this focus on his credentials isn't very useful.","1362096109"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","There are several problems with your code.

    buffer=(char *)malloc(SIZE);

Don't cast the return value from `malloc()`. It defeats the compiler's type checking and serves no purpose.

    fread(buffer,2,1,input);

You only ever read these two bytes. Shouldn't you be reading `SIZE` bytes?
  
    *curr_bytes = *buffer &amp; CHECK;

`curr_bytes` has never been initialised, so it is likely to point into segfault land. You then compare `buffer[0]`, which you have somewhat unidiomatically written as `*buffer`, with `CHECK`, but `CHECK` is `0x8000`, and `buffer[0]` is a `char`, which is very unlikely to be big enough to ever contain a bit in that position. I'm guessing that you want to check the high bit of the first byte, which would be `buffer[0] &amp; 0x80` assuming eight-bit bytes. But don't store it into the unknown place where `curr_bytes` points. I don't know what you're trying to do there.
 
    if(*curr_bytes  == CHECK)

Again likely a segfault. Instead of storing the result of the test you could just do

    if(buffer[0] &amp; 0x80)

Then comes this:

    return control; 

which is fine except you have only tested the first byte of the file, so it's not much of a count.

I would have expected that certain TYPES of crimes are more prevalent in certain communities, yes. But I would also expect that people who have ""status"" and more money would also be caught and prosecuted less frequently. E.G. Drug use is observed in people from any socio-economic background; but those who are rich can afford their dependency or treatment.

Do you mind waiting 20 minutes for food once it gets busy?  If not, get GA. Fancy Pants food takes about 30 seconds by and large. Plenty of options on the street to eat.  Only a few in the tents.

I've had FP ever single year and the extra few bucks is worth it for me.  It's a no brainer for what I want.  If I was 21 and looking for value, GA is just fine.

I didn't have to deal with the lines because I got there early but I did se the GA line stretching back to Montrose and beyond.  It still didn't take anyone 4 hours to get in.  Worst I heard outside this thread was like 90 minutes.  I'd pay $50 bucks not to be the schmuck in a 90 minute line.  I doubt the lines will be as bad this year, as they said it was the #1 thing they were addressing.  A lot of the wait I saw had a lot to do with idiots not going through the gates fast enough, not the ticket takers.

Sidenote: If you're dumb enough to stand in a four hour line instead of sending someone to walk/drive to the other side to check out where the line was maybe 20 minutes, you deserve to wait.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","As someone who would - if forced to - label themselves as agnostic (by the common definition of being unsure), I find your argument somewhat insulting. My choice of agnosticism isn't due to a lack of evidence supporting or disproving the belief in God(with a capital G, as you made a point to do every time), a lack of commitment to the idea, or even an attempt to be non-offensive. I absolutely believe that the christian ""God"" is full of shit, along with any other focus of religion, and I'm certainly not afraid to state that to anyone who asks (because to do otherwise is shoving your beliefs down their throats, which is just as bad as when they do it to you). 

The idea that any being would create an endless universe just to splash some life in one tiny corner of it and spend time communicating with a select few of those creatures (of which most subsequently become obscenely rich or famous, but that's another issue entirely) in an attempt to garner worship is absurd and you'd either be kidding yourself or just off your rocker to think otherwise. But on the other side of that token, you can't be certain that there is no creator because we *don't* know what sparked the beginnings of the universe. I can, however, be certain the intent wasn't to be worshiped based on empirical evidence. 

Maybe it was a wizard who started it all. Or, ya know, a scientist.

Would that really change anything though? 

To me, agnosticism isn't a belief in the potential of the magical or divine. It's just admitting that you don't know everything there is to know about the origins of everything. I think we'd all be better off if everyone stopped worrying about this shit and got on with living their lives the best they could. ","1362096124"

He later found out that she got fired from a job at restaurant and needed a place to live with her boyfriend who couldnt work due to a fucked up leg. she didnt really care about the children but thought that, taking care of them would obligate her to get his apartment for free, she moved to France a year after (where her new boyfriend was from) the twins are about 5 years now and he's going strong.

Our defense isn't shit, it's comical; almost 50% of our goals conceded (14 out of 30) have come directly from an egregious defensive error. And even with that, we have the 2nd best defense in the league by goals scored. 

It basically comes down to how well Koscielny is going to play (assuming he starts). At his best, he's handled Messi and Suarez on numerous occasions. At his worst, he's embarrassed by the likes of Obafemi Martins. If he can even come close to slowing down Bale, I like our chances, but that's a big if. ","1362096125"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I completely agree with you. I have never seen another girls' genitals in the women's restroom. I really fail to see any logical argument against allowing this young girl access to the girls' room. Comments saying that doing this will make other children uncomfortable makes little sense if you think about it. All the ""discomfort"" some children ""may"" feel would stem from society (their parents, the school in this case, etc) telling them that it is weird and/or wrong to be transgender. Not to mention that now, suddenly barring Coy from the girls' bathroom will DEFINITELY make her uncomfortable, and probably lead to the multitude of problems/issues that transgender folk experience which I, as a cis woman, can't ever expect to understand. 

Nowadays I get the impression that it is acceptable to explain gay couples to children, i.e. if a kid asks why those two women are kissing, it's now socially acceptable (in the more liberal/mainstream areas of the US anyway) to explain that sometimes women love women and sometimes men love men, etc. Look at how support for marriage equality has exploded in just the last ten years!

Why can we just explain the concept of being transgender to our children in a similar manner? Of course, there are still going to be shitheads out there who are transphobic, and their children are probably going to grow up believing transgender people are inherently wrong, but that doesn't mean we should just let it go on without ever trying to change anything.

EDIT: When I say I can't expect to understand the problems transgender people experience, I do not mean I don't sympathize, just that I'm aware that since I'm cis I have a great deal of privilege relative to transgender people.","1362096128"

A Lawful Good that stays strictly on that path can't do anything that wouldn't be Lawful or Good, unless they switch alignments, right? But a Neutral Good or Chaotic Good can do things that all Good alignments allow, correct?

Couldn't The Governor be Neutral Evil, even though he starts out making choices that are Lawful, and sways from Lawful to Evil? He seems to have his own set of morals, but ultimately will do anything to achieve victory. He seems to just be more Lawful or Chaotic based on his moods. Isn't that kind of the idea behind a Neutral character?

Although I have considered her a narcissist for awhile, it didn't really come into a clear focus for me until I read that [link](http://parrishmiller.com/narcissists.html) laggedy had posted. Funny, I went over the official list published by... oh shoot, I am just can't find the reference now. But one of you folks posted a link to a blog that talks about narcissistic mothers and their daughters. I had a much harder time fitting my Mum into that list.

My Mum is in the long drawn out process of dying from cancer. She's 75. She's not as hard as she used to be. It comes from two basic things, I think. Nobody wants to rock the cart at this stage in her life, so she is getting everything her way. She also seems to be mellowing a little bit.

Where we seem to be running up against a rock is her absolute rule over her home. My sister and I are spending a considerable amount of time there. As she gets even closer to her end, we will be living with her, part time for each of us. I don't know how we're going to handle it. She has discarded all of her bedroom furniture. As it is we have to sleep on the couch when we need to spend the night. She discards any food that is left at the house. We each have a drawer in which we can keep essential toiletries and a change of clothes. That's it.

But it's a decent fall-back skill or trade. One of the benefits of being a repair/tech is that you can actually get *more* work when the economy is down because people would rather pay less to fix something than buy a new computer.

But if you have bigger dreams (programmer, doctor, lawyer, and many more) you should follow 'em. You can still learn tech support on the side and use it as a safety net.

And since you like gaming - don't go into the gaming industry. It's a meat grinder. Everyone wants to get paid making or testing games, so there's too many people willing to do it for cheap and work 80 hours a week for the ""privilege"" of working in the industry.

Unfortunately game companies know this and they'll abuse you. (But developing your own games and going indie like Mojang is a different story, but that's also a lot of luck no matter how good your games are.)

But comparing her to a real carry as they exist in Dota/HoN it becomes quiet obvious that she isnt really one. Yes she has the CC immunity but thats standard for any carry in Dota/HoN. But she has pretty much zero steroids every real Carry in Dota/HoN has at least one or two steroids.

To give an example:

Dark lady from HoN:

(80% dmg boost + 2.5s silence on each autoattack + dash + hugh attackspeed steroid + slow + nocturne ultimate + magic immunity via item)

Selling it for $1500 and buying a $2000 car means you've used a car for only $100/year, and will be gaining the greater reliability that comes with a newer car.

Finally, I had some friends in high school but we only ever hung out at school, never outside of it. As you many guess, I drifted from them too and stopped talking.

Yeah....I was pretty socially awkward during my childhood. I still don't hang out with people outside of school even though I get along great with my classmates.","1362096153"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","It would be extremely difficult to enact these types of reforms. On the other hand, people are starting to notice some of the deficiencies of our current system.

* Gerrymandering means that the Democratic party actually earned 0.3% more of the total vote for Representatives than the Republicans did, but only won 200 seats compared to the Republicans 232.
* Obstructionism in the Senate means that a minority of 41 can block almost any legislation or appointment, and experience shows that the minority party is willing to abuse that power for political motives at the expense of the wellbeing of the country.
* There is an active campaign by Republican party operatives to disenfranchise minority voters, and the Supreme Court is set to gut some of the few enforcement mechanisms.

Our current system is pretty disastrous. 2 Senators for Alaska and 2 Senators for California, what a joke. And none of the arguments for defending the status quo are valid. I'm not trying to present strawman, but the 4 arguments I hear most commonly are:
* If Presidential elections were determined by popular vote, Presidential campaigns would ignore rural areas so rural voters' political and economic interests wouldn't be as important
* We can't have a more proportional representation because we need local representation so that every citizen has a specific legislator that is accountable to them, or so that local issues are represented in Congress
* We can't have more proportional representation because that gives a more powerful voice to fringe opinions and in fact can over-empower small parties similar to how FPTP over-empower's big parties.
* The bicameral legislature with 2 Senators per state was a compromise contract between big and small states that allowed us to form America in the first place, and that renegging on this bargain would be illegal/would cause small states to leave the union / would cause small states to be ignored.

Response 1: ...And when rural areas are overweighted, rural areas receive a disproportionate amount of the attention and influence. From a moral perspective I don't know how you determine whether it is better for rural or urban citizens to be more influential, expect perhaps the facts that 250 million americans live in or around urban areas and 75% of Americans live on 3% of the land, so urban issues affect many more people and would be more important from a utilitarian perspective.

Response 2: Classic case of a false dichotomy: we can make our legislature more proportional without completely getting rid of local single member districts where a single politician is accountable for every citizen. Many countries around the world have such systems that combine FPTP and PR, either by having both single member districts and seats reserved for proportionally elected representatives, or by having multiple member districts, or some other method. Germany, for example, has a system of single member districts, but then after the winner of each district is determined they shore up the total number of politicians in the legislature from party lists to make the overall makeup proportional. So a smaller party with only 15% of the vote might only win a couple percent of the districts, but in the end they will have roughly 15% of the legislature.

Response 3: Another false dichotomy. Many countries with PR place limits on how small a party can be to prevent extremist parties from being seated. A 5% minimum is pretty common.

Response: And in that same compromise, slaves were each counted as 3/5 of a person but not allowed to vote... enough said about this appeal to tradition.","1362096154"

People who rob houses usually chase owners down through the woods and then dispose of the body, no evidence of the invasion of course. 

You think guns create less crime and safety? Are lives more safe with guns? Not really. Most countries without civilian ownership have extreme violent crime and rape problems, Like Japan and Switzerland?

You just rhyme shit off that backs you up. Show me that 43% of GB invasions were done while people were home. Show me this list of millions with gun defense stories. 

Like in the attic? It is laughable you suggest that as viable. So you find one story about a dumb criminal who searches attics for valuable possessions. Then gets shot by some dumb bitch who doesn't have the intelligence to call the cops, give off warnings and etc..

Over the last few weeks, I've been listening to consecutive audio versions of full episodes of the Atheist Experience (an atheist call in show) while at work. There were a number of calls from atheists asking about spirituality and its compatibility with atheism. Essentially, what happens is that the hosts will ask the caller to define spirituality, and the caller can never define it. 

[Here's one episode where it comes up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4LLrd8JfYQ). Skip to the 6 minute mark to hear the first caller who asks about it. A lot of times these spiritual things are hard to explain because they're really just convincing sounding pseudo philosophical sounding stuff. 

Wanting to find truth is great. Being excited by neat things in the world is great. But I wouldn't say that those things hinged on you being on a ""spiritual quest"". I mean, we could dig up a definition of spiritual which would describe me, but I wouldn't want to openly label myself spiritual if only because that word has a proven capacity to confuse.

Hemophilia did come to be because of decades of inbreeding among royalty in the UK but these things are rare, VERY rare and wouldn't necessarily be a problem if incest was a normal thing since not everyone would fancy doing it. And it was decided much earlier that it should be forbidden before hemophilia came to be. But why was it suddenly frowned upon? why is it frowned upon today. Seems like there's nothing wrong with it.

Sorry, no. I'm assuming he's either lying or not telling us how much it cost to buy paint supplies and whatnot. He might have ended up only making a few thousand in profit.

The ex is *always going to be there*.  Through her child, she is now a permanent part of your husband's family.

There are great **male** warriors in history doing some of the things depicted in video games. There are great **male** warriors today doing the same things- Dakota Meyer, Salvatore Giunta, Clinton Romesha.

So, even though realistically a human can't complete many of the feats completed in video games- the leadership, courage and strength has been demonstrated by countless. 

Yes, some women have done it too- but its not even a fair comparison. They were ALL exceptions.

I'm not trying to make this a debate of ""this sex is better than that one"" but developers have a wealth of depictions of **men** making the ultimate sacrifices throughout the entirety of human history. There is no comparison.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","I would start with watching Lisa Eldridge videos. She really helped me understand things and get into it. She makes things easy to follow and she doesn't go crazy with the makeup-it always looks effortless and elegant. You could start by trying to recreate simple looks from videos like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH1az2Ebng4&amp;list=UUFghPtzFcmyDiID1ASMA4Dg&amp;index=34), and then slowly start adding more as you get more comfortable. I remember when I knew little to nothing about makeup...I didn't even know what concealer was meant to be used for and I was so intimidated about things like applying eyeshadow. It sounds cliche, but a lot of it is trial and error, so you're going to have to keep trying to improve. Also I didn't really look up one particular thing with watching videos. Even though I got into makeup watching a lot of people, I just really like Lisa Eldrige, so a lot of the time I would watch a bunch of videos in a row and try to learn from them. Over time you start to get the hang of things more and you'll find that you start picking up little tricks that help you understand more in the long run. Haha, sorry this is so vague but it's true! Watch a ton of videos and see if it helps! Also emilynoel83 on youtube is really good to watch for product reviews (as well as other things). That will help you learn about different brands and products.  ","1362096175"

So if you wanted to discourage that through purely mechanical means, you'd have to make the consequences of a misfire pretty horrible -- like a permanent decrease to an ability score, or loss of a feat, or spell slot.

The key, and most difficult challenge is to convey to others the magnitude and importance of that experience. To make people believe as strongly as you believe, in order to offer their support.

&gt;Having a girlfriend is something I have been wanting for 6 years.

&gt;I feel like the world is against me, that I am not allowed to have a girlfriend.

I know we all can get discouraged and get down, but ever verbalise it. Don't put your fears to words, they're not even real so why acknowledge them? When you hear yourself say something, subconsciously it becomes more real.

Second, when she says, ""who is this?"" you always joke around. Don't let your desperation make you too serious. ""OHHH WHY DOESN'T SHE REMEMBER ME!? SHE MUST HATE MEEEE!!"" Would you want to hang around that kinda attitude? Gross.

&gt;We just kissed and now I’m sitting here with a boner ;)

That's funny dude. I actually spat out my orange juice. LOL

You sound like you're getting some pretty solid successes here dude. Don't get down on yourself. Just relax though, your mentality of I NEED A HOT GIRLFRIEND is making me sick.

You're putting too much value in having a girlfriend. Just enjoy fooling around and have a good time. You're 18, I can almost guarantee that whatever girl you find now will not be around in a few years.

TL;DR? RELAX...you're too intense about NEEDing a girlfriend. ","1362096185"
"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","For 50 points there are a couple of tough statues to get. Obsidian armor is one of them (roughly 1.4 million gold), and a PvP statue is the other one (most people choose to get the Zaishen statue as you only need rank 3; that will still set you back another 1.4 million gold or so). You'll need at least one Tormented weapon as well, which will set you back a cool 35 ecto, roughly another 300,000 gold.

Now, this is totally doable, but it's going to be a huge time sink man and 3 million plus gold to do it. 

30/50 is a more reasonable goal; start by adding MOX (no extra work required) and taming the Black Moa and Imperial Phoenix (you'll need to level phoenix to 20 to add it). You can easily solo Sorrow's Furance in a few hours. We're at 25 now! Do the Dajkah Inlet and Glint's Challenge missions to get armors for Koss, Melonni, Acolyte Jin, Acolyte Sosuke and Dunkoro, and all the EOTN heroes. This will put you at 27. You can buy the Clothes of the Brotherhood for 4K apiece in Kamadan instead of farming them.

Do War in Kryta; that will snag you a couple of Opressor weapons. (28!) Finish up your Sunspear title and the four EOTN reputation titles. You can get Sunspear easily by vanquishing Nightfall zones; the EOTN ones can be done in a variety of ways, check the Wiki for more details.

For the last point, the skill hunter titles are not hard, but will cost you 294 platinum for all four (90 for just Tyrian).

Drunkard, Sweet Tooth and Party Animal will cost you around 1 million gold per title.  ","1362096185"

I've had a few bad ones over the years, mainly nobody including my parents remembering my birthday, but I had learned not to expect much by age 12 and had quit bothering with parties or anything anyway. 

My BF and I were on a pretty tight budget, but we saved up a few hundred dollars to throw a big party for my 21st birthday because I hadn't had a birthday party in about a decade. 2 nights before at about 1 am I notice some red dots on the floor of the hallway as I'm heading to bed. The floor was dark wood with a lot of grain and pattern so at first I thought it was code red (my drink of choice at the time). I realized while trying to clean it that the dots were blood. We quickly realized not only was it blood, but there were bloody paw prints all over our apartment. We finally found my cat and her still bleeding paw (we never did discover what happened or where she cut it) and called an emergency vet clinic. They had us try a few things and said if it doesn't stop bleeding she needs to come in. Well it didn't, we had to wake up two of our friends who had a kind of junky car and drive to this rather rich neighborhood to get to this vet clinic. We drove past it at first and had to turn around in a parking lot at which time a cop sees us and decides because it isn't a nice car, we're suspicious. He followed us into the vet clinic parking lot and got out behind us. Obviously, if a cop pulls you over getting out of the car is the wrong move, but he looked at my BF (who was driving) then me. I was sitting there holding a crying cat in a bloody towel and giving him the ""if you do not get out of my way right this second I will kill you"" stare which thankfully he understood pretty quickly and let us go in. We ended up being there about 2 hours while they got the bleeding to stop.  She had a nasty cut deep in between her toes so it couldn't be stitched or any normal way of closing the wound. Needless to say I'm pretty upset the whole time not to mention exhausted. They finally got her all taken care of and back to me and we ended up having to spend all of our birthday savings for the vet visit and cancel the party with less than 24 hours notice (and we had one out of town friend who had already driven down so I felt like a big ass). I spent my birthday locked in a room with the cat playing WoW because she hated the cone with a passion so I had to supervise to make sure she didn't chew on the cast they had to put on her to keep the bandages on properly.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt;What’s up with the new set/studio?

&gt;As you may have heard, The Score was split into two entities this fall. One company, The Score TV, was purchased by Rogers Communications, a Canadian media conglomerate. The other, The Score Inc., was spun out into a new digital company. The Basketball Jones is part of this new company.


&gt;This is good news as it means that The Jones team stays intact and we can keep bringing you the high quality show and blog you’ve come to expect. Unfortunately, it also means that the studio we recorded in last year is no longer available to us as it’s part of The Score TV.


&gt;The studio we’re currently recording in is temporary for the next few months until The Score Inc. moves into its offices and we have a dedicated studio.


&gt;That being said, there are advantages to this new way of recording the show. It’s a more intimate setup, all TBJ members are on mic (which allows Trey and Leigh to be a bigger part of the show), and there are fewer technical hoops to jump through to execute new ideas. We think this new setup will allow “The Fix” to be more spontaneous, more fun, and more unpredictable.


&gt;Yes, change sucks, but give this new look a bit of time and we’re sure you’ll be as optimistic and excited about it as we are.

Sex with children is rape because the child is under the age of consent. Children cannot consent. Fantasies about sex with children are fantasies about rape. I don't think this is getting through to you.

&gt; A paedophile is not a malicious person by nature.

Except that their nature is to rape children.

&gt; CBT can change the way people think about things quite dramatically

Sexual orientation is in-built and cannot be changed. Pedophilia is probably as fundamental as sexual orientation. It isn't what they're thinking that needs to change, it's how they're wired. But we can dial down the sex urge by reducing testosterone levels.

Something missing from this whole thread is evidence - it so happens studies have been done showing castration actually works. There is a high reoffense rate for pedophiles and sex offenders who are not castrated. In effect, the fact we aren't castrating rapists and pedophiles right now is causing many more rapes and molestations.","1362096198"

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","&gt;Yes, but 07scape is not the service you're buying. RuneScape membership is what you're buying. 07scape is an addition to the membership service, along the same vein as FunOrb.

And why is this? The 2007 version of RuneScape is just as much of a standalone game as current RuneScape is, so why should it be restricted to being an additional feature when many players only intention with subscribing is to play 07scape. There are no good arguments to why 07scape shouldn't have seperate subscription options (at least I can't seem to find any). The only reason Jagex is doing it is to gain more money, but I think this strategy will backfire on a later stage.

&gt;Also, on top of this, if you want to play 07scape you should support the development of the actual game, not the 2007 version. This is why it should be an additional fee instead of a different option.

The 07 servers barely need any development and/or maintenance, so the majority of the money from these subscription payments would still go into developing the main game. If it was a standalone membership there would most likely be more 07Scape members around as well, as a less pricy option attracts more players. I have no doubt people would mind paying between $7-10 a month for it either, but then again I can't speak for the entire 07Scape community.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTLM):

&gt;While Kerberos has replaced NTLM as the default authentication protocol in an Active Directory (AD) based single sign-on scheme, NTLM is still widely used in situations where a domain controller is not available or is unreachable. For example, NTLM would be used if a client is not Kerberos capable, the server is not joined to a domain, or the user is remotely authenticating over the web.

it sounds like whatever is going on isn't true SSO if it would work with NTLM. in true SSO, the user will hit up the domain controller to get a token that grants access to the resource. So basically, you shouldn't have to put your password in ever after your initial sign on (hence, single *sign on*, not single *username/password*). This is like halfway there in that they will use NTLM protocol to piggyback the auth request to the domain controller anyway, same result - different path, although you will likely have to provide it with the password if not the username as well.","1362096202"

Once a week, once every couple weeks, maybe twice a month if I was lucky. Eventually got to the point where we would go 3 or more months. 

Now we love each other, but there is just a lack of intimacy in general there. I am very affectionate and supportive and we have tried lots of things, but at the end of the day I'm lucky if I can get her to give me a handjob once a month.

We're so entangled in each others lives, and 9 months ago we had a son, that I can't even imagine living my life without her. Sadly, I think it's more about how hard it is to untangle our lives and be able to mutually survive financially than over love. Not to say we don't love each other, but it's definitely not the cement that holds us together anymore.

Hopefully things improve for you, give it all you got. Try couples counseling, all that good stuff. Just don't move the relationship further until you figure things out. Please, don't move the relationship further. Really make sure you're both involved in this because of love, passion, and that you really do enjoy being with each other, not out of convenience.

but yeah maybe some day i will feel confident enough to take the plunge. i'm not 100% sure right now that i'd want to, which is also why i haven't of course. also the genre i work in isn't really conducive to turning profits (ambient/neo-classical)! :) maybe someday. but yeah, i still have a way to go yet.

The teacher actually had dinner with the family beforehand, explaining to them how the process worked &amp; such. She was treated to dinner and beverages served in all plastic cups since the family couldn't afford to get glassware. Now the test is based on age, so the proctor had the student naming thing that were on cards that he held up. (like a Rorschach test, but with actual pictures instead of inkblots) The proctor pulled out a card that was a tea cup on a saucer, and the student is befuddled since he wasn't familiar with anything but normal plastic cups.

"pettyrevenge","t5_2vg7t","Hitler was an anti-semite and a troublemaker at an early age. He wouldn't have been happy to settle down and live a peaceful life. After the death of his brother, his personality changed. He was on the path to becoming Adolf Hitler as we know of him before he reached puberty.  

There are so many variables. If Hitler had been accepted into art school, he wouldn't have stayed there. Politicians and people in power were vocal in their hatred against the Jews. Antisemitism was on the rise, and it gave people an outlet and a voice to express the long running prejudices they had. It was like dead grass waiting for a match. If Hitler wasn't the match, someone else would have been. The hatred against the Jews was strong, and Hitler would have been part of the movement.  

In 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the same year World War II started. If both parties had cemented their relationship and kept the negotiations open and fair, then they would have formed a strong alliance. The Soviet Union would have their machines, and Germany would have their war goods. The Axis would have formed and stomped China, dividing China's resources amongst themselves. Japan would go on to control and keep the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, Korea, and parts of China. If there was a mass scale invasion of the United States, the country would have been divided between the countries in The Axis.  

Backed and supplied by The Axis countries, Japan would have invaded the Western United States while the rest of The Axis invaded the Eastern and Central US.  

Being part Japanese wouldn't be so bad. 仕方が無い","1362096214"

"evolution","t5_2qhs7","I'm no microbiologist, but I'm not sure if comparing rates of virus evolution to rates of human evolution is valid. As you alluded to, viruses and human genomes undergo vastly different developmental processes, among other things. It's also possible that the vastly higher mutation rate of HIV is *bad* for evolution: a higher mutation rate doesn't always mean faster adaptation.

I'm not sure what you're getting at, though. Are you arguing that it couldn't have been evolution by natural selection that created homo sapiens? (In which case, that's not something I would like to discuss in this thread, since there's plenty of material available online discussing both sides of that argument.)

&gt; While it may be a subset of it, I see no evidence that computation can lead to consciousness.

Here's published evidence: http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002236

&gt; In Tononi's view, if I perform the same calculations on paper, is it also conscious?

Clearly, no, just as if you calculated Phi for a rock or any other nonliving material. As far as I understand, in Tononi's view, an organism must integrate information across multiple stimuli to be conscious. Consequently, most (all?) living creatures are conscious to some degree.","1362096218"

GPU's are faster at doing a lot of smaller tasks at one time. This is called **parallel processing**. Ex.: What pixel to turn on at what time with what intensity.

The CPU is responsible for deciding what information gets pushed to the GPU to be parallelized. These drivers better optimized at helping the CPU choose which items are sent to the GPU thus resulting in a better experience because the CPU wastes less time doing what the GPU should be doing and spends more time doing what it should be doing.

**TL;DR:** CPU/GPU workload is optimized better.

One of the things I did to help cope with my situation was to try set up a few hours of solid sleep before the late night shift started - I would have my tea (dinner), feed Bobby at about 6pm and then go to bed while my husband looked after him. Then he would give him his next feed at about 9pm and pop him in his bed. When Bobby was due for his next feed at about 11-12 I would get up and take the night shift. On the weekend, my husband would sometimes take the morning shift and let me have a sleep in.
I kept reminding myself that it doesn't stay like this forever, and I found that to be a great comfort.

So it ends up the cop says ""well what do we have here"" and shows him the bag. My friend says it isn't his. The cop proceeds to tell him how he could lock his ass up and tow his car, etc etc. Then, and this is where the story gets weird, he pulls out a coin and says ""call it in the air."" My friend is like, dude, wtf, are you serious and the cop reiterates by saying that if he calls it correctly he'll let him go, if he doesn't it'll be the worst day of his life. So he calls heads and gets it right. Cop says ""get the fuck out of here"" and to this day my friend is baffled by the whole situation, and also wonders if he actually would've gotten locked up had he called it wrong. Btw, he was from out of state which may have had something to do with it being he wasn't a resident.

Sometimes they are accurate predictors of future behavior, and we remember those times and reinforce those memories when they are proven true. But my gut reaction has often been wrong. 

Children are just little people. Some of them are awesome, some are little shits. Most are both some of the time. 

Both adults and children have lied about sexual abuse. Both adults and children have used their gut feeling as justification to bully people.

I got my position because I demonstrated I was confident and knowledgable enough to talk to people, which led to doing the keeper talks, which led to a paid position.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","I'm genuinely confused, how could this be worse in three-factions than in two-factions?

In a 2-faction MMO, faction imbalance is simply game-breaking, and it happens in most of them. Horde in WoW, Empire in SWTOR, Destruction in WAR - one faction drastically outnumbers the other and once that happens, nobody wants to play on the underdog faction, so the problem just gets worse and worse.

I think three factions will not eliminate that, but definitely soften the impact. Say it were just Ebonheart versus Daggerfall - Ebonheart would be the super popular one, and it would steamroll Daggerfall through sheer force of numbers. With the Aldmeri thrown in, however, the populations will even out a bit more, and even if one has a stronger initial advantage, the other two combined will likely still be able to take them down.

So, your post just strikes me as contradictory. You seem to only want two factions, because...of a problem that is far worse if there's only two factions?","1362096255"

If our purpose does not come from a god, where's it to come from? Do we make it ourselves, or is there something else to strive for?

 How do we cope with death, knowing there's no higher power waiting for us - or is that in fact a good thing? 

Do the teachings of Jesus/Moses/Mohammed still hold wisdom without the backing of an omnipotent being?

Theoretically, what would the existence of a god imply?

All these are questions directly coming from a lack of belief in a god, and could be discussed. In addition, you can discuss people's personal experiences, or be welcoming to religious people on this sub and have constructive spiritual debate.

You could not do both at the same time, e.g. drive with a flight stick left handed and aim and shoot with a mouse in the right.

It was the perfect setup, trumped completely by a silly software limitation. So sad. 

(while that might sound dumb to an FPS player, MW players remember that controlling legs and torso were separate, and good flight sticks can twist, so piloting a 'mech with a stick is actually very fluid.)

Your first claim is a little...ridiculous? No disrespect, really, but please check math first. Let's examine our friend, player Bob. You're saying Bob will always be assigned a weaker team? Then what about Alice? Who's on the stronger team? ;)

The point of skill-based MM is that both teams have historically been equal in terms of skill. Let's talk about your scenario. I'm guessing you're talking the case of the MM originally underestimating your skill level. Let's say the player you're talking about is called Chuck. MM currently thinks Chuck is a 1000 skill player, when Chuck is actually stronger and should clock in at 1200 (either through improvement, or whatever). Chuck would be placed in 1000 skill matches with 1000 skill players most of the time, with occasional up/down matches where he's in 800 or 1200 skill matches. Chuck will win maybe 55% of the matches in the 1000 skill bracket, 60% of the 800, and 50% of the 1200. Given this evidence MM will adjust Chuck's rating and eventually get slowly bumped up to the 1200 skill level.

I used the term ""bracket"" in the wrong way. I was thinking of SC2's league system, but they are just artificial boundaries. There may be a need for XP scaling, but you'd still get a bonus for winning a match since you want to dissuade people from not caring about winning.

It all depends on what you mean by progression. I'm the most concerned about skill. I want teammates that aren't terrible. If we're talking purely about skill, progression does span across matches. In fact, that's what we're measuring when people obsess over efficiency/wn7/wotlabs/noobmeter. SC measures this skill progression by assigning you to a league. Whether it is a team game or not doesn't matter since you're playing against the average of the enemy team in the long run. I don't know too much about the implementation of ELO in LoL/etc., but such ratings can work for team-based games which assemble teams for you.","1362096265"

You can be like ""Hey honey! Look what I found, this cute quiz thing online, you want to take it with me?"" Then you take it and show each other the answers. Then be like ""Ohhh, this is how I like to receive affection and that's how you like it. Let's try to fit this into our lives! Isn't this great, baby? We're learning and working on our marriage! Yay us! I love you!"" 

Something like that? It'd be pretty non-confrontational. Then maybe you can bring up how you'd maybe like her to do some stuff and you can ask how she'd like you to act for her. She might appreciate what you do, but she might enjoy giving/receiving gifts or tokens, like a poem you wrote or a goofy handmade card, it doesn't always have to be expensive. ","1362096266"

The CD was pretty plain. I wish I remembered what the title was though... So basically, I was working that night with my coworker, and the same lady comes in. She asks my coworker if he watched the CD. He said he didn't. She then proceeds to tell him that he's missing out on a great opportunity and it is best to join young and reap the benefits exponentially as he grows older. 

When I first heard my coworkers story, I had a faint belief that this was a pyramid scheme. But, since I got to see her ""sales"" pitch first hand, I confirmed that this was definitely a pyramid scheme. She then proceeded to give me a CD and told me what a great opportunity it was. I kindly returned the CD and told her I wasn't interested. She kept pushing it a little, saying things like, if I recruit other members, I can get my money back plus more.

Checked to see if ndiswrapper is installed with ndiswrapper -l, returned ""The program 'ndiswrapper' is currently not installed.  You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-common.""

From my own experience I know that they (Amish) are becoming more secular with each passing year. Sure, they still wear the hats, grow beards and drive buggies. But, just like every other religion they find loopholes that allow them to do pretty much whatever they want and still be ""Amish"". 

They don't drive cars - BUT - they can OWN a car and pay someone to drive them around in it.

* EDIT * sorry, they can't OWN the car, but they can pay for it and hire a driver....

They don't have electricity in their homes - BUT - they can have it in their barns (for the sake of the animals) and run extension cords into their homes. And this is beginning to change too... More and more are getting electricity IN their homes for ""Business"" reasons...

The rule bending goes on and on.

Many people would be surprised to know how many Amish have cell phones, Computers, T.V.'s and attend sex parties with free flowing booze.

At least they keep to themselves and don't go door to door telling us how super it is to be Amish.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Dawkins mashes together agnosticism and atheism, just like you are doing. I have little doubt that he is the reason I needed to make this post.

You're right that Dawkins' definition is not semantically accurate (which I already admitted). However, it's the common interpretation. What's the point of being technically correct if no one else cares? The English language is made by the people who speak it, not by the dictionary. So when word usage changes so does that actual word.

&gt; I am in no way claiming that all beliefs are reducible to one of three archetypes.

Yes you are. You are saying that all beliefs about the statement ""At least one God exists"" can be reduced to theism, atheism, or another thing you call atheism (1,2,3 in your original post). What else could you be saying? You even say that Christian and Hindu are both theists (which they are), you are characterizing every range of belief into your 3 categories.

There's no fundamental problem with your categories (besides your logic attempts), but all I'm saying is that your 3 categories are no more valid than someone else's 7 categories or 10 categories. All your doing is overgeneralizing belief into 3 parts. I could take it one step further and say ""There's only 2 positions you can take on any statement, you can either have an opinion, or you cannot have an opinion."" And even though I'm right my statement is obviously overgeneralizing to the point of incomprehensibility. It's like the common ""There's only 2 types of people in this world"" statement, which obviously oversimplifies all the people in the world. That's what you're doing too.

&gt; It may seem that way because you've misunderstood something. In my example, p is not a logical truth value. Nowhere do I address the actual truth behind the claim ""there exists one or more deities.""

P never used to refer to truth values, that's True and False, P represents statements. And I know you don't ever address the actual truth, that's the problem. Logic is supposed to be used to evaluate truth, not belief. When you start talking about belief in terms of logic you run into the obvious problem that belief is not binary, and that logic is only made to talk about binary systems (True and False). At least the kinds of logic you're using. The not statement is inherently binary as it means ""opposite of"", suggesting there's only one alternative.

&gt; Exactly. ~p is strong atheism.

No. ~P would be contra-theism is you want to be technically correct. Your whole post is based on semantics and you're using words like strong and weak instead of -a and -contra. Which is fine with me, but you should realize that language changes and that technically correct terms are not always the best choice. No one calls strong atheism contra-theism even though it's the semantically correct term.

&gt; Weak atheism is when you propose neither p nor ~p.

And this is the problem. In logic systems you can't have P and ~P. P and ~P is the definition of a contradiction, in logic it is called a tautology and it is always false, no matter the actual value of P. As you can see, belief is not binary and truth is. That's why logic is only used for truth. What you're doing is assuming that the not(~) symbol is equivalent to the -a prefix, which it's not.

&gt; Since you are so in love with logic, give me a counterexample of a belief that falls outside of all three categories. Again, the conviction behind the belief doesn't exclude it from one of the categories.

Just to reiterate, it's obviously possible for you to categorize belief into 3 things (just not with logic). I'm not arguing that beliefs exist that don't fit into your categories, I'm arguing that your categories are no more valid than anyone else's. And on top of that, even though your system is equally valid as other frameworks it's a lot more confusing and it's not used by most people, so it's a lot more useless than other systems.","1362096279"

We certainly still have playdates (that usually include wine), and we do hang out without our kids.  Last year we started a book club, which is (usually) kid free.  

For me, meeting other moms that I actually liked was a life-saver.  My son was a miserable infant (not colic, just miserable), and around other moms I could actually relax about it.  Also, I am a pretty shy person generally, so having a baby actually gave me an opportunity to meet new people.  If you are in the NYC area, I will be your friend!","1362096280"

My whole point is that the media reporting of these two horrible crimes gives a false impression.

Even if the stats have changed one way or another in the last 20 years, rape is still more common and it bothers me that the media presents it like men are the only victims (yes I am aware that men are raped, but women are also sometimes falsely accused, too).

I think it causes more anger and a gender fight that is silly and unneccessary.

I think both crimes should be treated with seriousness and the
sentencing should be roughly equal.  

Let's work as a society to stop rape AND false reporting and try to stop this us-vs-them crap and treat everyone with decency.

I think people might get the wrong idea, or their views wouldn't change at all. There have already been documentaries on the fandom, and not all of them have been positive, but not all negative either. I think an unbiased documentary would be nice. Both negative and positive.

The question was ""You have two nickles, three dimes, and five quarters. How much money do you have?"" 

I knew that that a quarter was 25 cents (the name gives it away), but the others I didn't. So I gave a very long speech (in nearly perfect english) describing how I had just arrived, didn't know the money denominations but could figure out quarters, and that it was probably either $1.65 or $1.55. 

The guy said he had to fail me on that question, leaving my score as ""unsatisfactory"", but then he saw my address (white, rich neighborhood), and put me in an advanced english class anyway, because the other ones were mostly for the mexican population being bussed in.

"space","t5_2qh87","Mir was built by the Soviet Union, not by NASA or the ESA or US companies. The ISS is the first time ever most ISS partners have really worked on a modular space station. The ISS has certainly been a great way to take advantage of the experience Roscosmos has. Skylab was NASA's first ever space station, but it was a very different design from Mir or the ISS.

Everyone who stayed on Mir for a long period were Russian/Soviet cosmonauts, and they weren't healthy or able to walk by the end of their stay on Mir. There aren't hospitals on Mars where astronauts will be able to recover.

Many of the experiments being done on the ISS require maintenance, replacement parts, etc. Just as an example, the article on [the Materials Science Research Rack](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/msrr_heats_up.html) I linked to says

&gt; In late 2011, there was a loss of communications between the MSRR and the computer that controls it. The automatic safety procedures on the rack caused it to shut down as designed; but, in doing so, it also caused the temperatures inside the furnace to exceed their normal limits. These higher temperatures caused some of the material inside the furnace to become bonded to the furnace itself. This required the station crew to clean the furnace and remove the materials. 

This equipment has required major maintenance and work. Much of the parts that are launched to the ISS are there for similar replacements and maintenance. Many experiments need fuel, coolant, food, water, or oxygen, etc. Other experiments might require examination back on Earth after they are finished. In all these instances it's more efficient to launch them to a crewed space station like the ISS, one that's regularly supplied by cargo vehicles.","1362096296"

What I am getting from it, and from your response re: Quicktime events is that you value your free time and prefer to be entertained in a more active fashion while simultaneously ""progressing"" to unlock abilities for your characters (leading to even more action.)  That's not an unheard of viewpoint.

I tend to view games more as a series of discrete elements: story, puzzles, events, action, etc..  There are some of the games that you listed that I'm terrible at:  WCIII, Souls games, e.g., that I am terrible at and find not so fun--or rather I find a way to make them fun for myself if I continue to play them.

I adored the leveling concepts of KoTOR I/II and Jade Empire, I enjoyed the action of Skyrim (and the [nudity!](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2488)), and Deus Ex:HR was a blast.  

Me, I'm a solo player who is in no way inconvenienced by a sudden puzzle that I have to defeat to progress involving buttons, bars or non-poke-it-with-a-sword/kill-it-with-fire/shot-the-bastard methods.  That's just me though.  Your preferred gaming style and mine are different.

Right now, when the entire team pushes up into the oppositions half, it essentially leaves Puyol and Pique alone as the back line and neither have the speed to keep up with a world class counter attack.  You saw what happened when those two had to track Di Maria and Ronaldo at full speed, it was comical in the saddest sense of the word.  This formation at least keeps a back line of three and Mascherano, while not a speedy player, is still faster than Puyol and Pique.

I'd love to see this implemented but sadly I doubt it will be.  Whoever is creating the line-ups, whether its Roura or Tito, is obsessed with playing Cesc on the left and leaving Villa on the bench.  And as long as Roura is in charge, in-game adjustments won't be an option.","1362096298"

Lot of people immigrated to the U.S. at that time, and the north had their pick. Unless they were trying to make a statement, they'd probably hire a white, well-educated male. 

And no, I'm not talking about African people, I'm talking about black people. African people didn't immigrate to the U.S. at all. Black people moved here from Europe and up from South America, and congregated in the south. ","1362096302"

On an already enchanted creature, removal works just as well. It's not awfully difficult to play around Boros Charm either. Moreover, Azorius Charm and Detention Sphere don't destroy your creature so Boros Charm does nothing. Same with Devour Flesh and Liliana of the Veil.

Finally, you're gonna get a lot of starting hands that don't do anything. 20 of your spells are useless without a creature in hand, and you only have 16 of those. Prepare to mulligan a lot. Tri-color aggro decks with 20 land already mulligan a lot as it is.","1362096302"

&gt;Do you have any links to studies/papers suggesting that any of the other substances you mentioned have a nontrivial effect on vasodilation? I'm genuinely curious because I have really poor circulation to my hands.

Just the same things you'll find by googling. [Examples of vasodilators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasodilation#Examples_and_individual_mechanisms), [1.5 g of citrulline malate a day improves erection hardness in men with minor ED -- this would occur by increasing blood flow](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21195829), [L-Arginine and citrulline increase vasodilation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17662090), [L-arginine and citrulline improve endothelial function in heart patients](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20865676). 

Basically if you're looking for over the counter stuff, you want capsaicin, L-Arginine, citrulline (which increases blood arginine better than L-arginine), and AKG. However, if you have peripheral arterial disease, talk to a doctor first. ","1362096303"

&gt; God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions. ""God willed that man should be 'left in the hand of his own counsel,' so that he might of his own accord seek his Creator and freely attain his full and blessed perfection by cleaving to him.""

If man is allowed to control his own actions, then he must also be allowed to suffer the consequence of those actions. Just because the man happens to be a priest doesn't mean that God would interfere with the consequences - molesting a child as a priest does not negate the resulting controversy.

I'm actually glad the Oregon play made it, namely because I'd never seen that one before. It was cool that they mixed some slightly older plays in with the more recent ones; a lot of times the ""top ten"" lists tend to be ""top ten of the last two years"" or something.","1362096309"

This actually got me thinking about something vastly irrelevant to this topic, about how minimum wage circa 1950 was still respectable and above the poverty line, whereas it is not now. However now most small business (mom and pop size, not ""small"" business as defined by some) struggle to pay a much lower minimum wage. As the minimum wage decreases, ability to pay it also decreases.

Anyways, Atwater v Lago Vista is about arrest from a warrantless misdemeanor charge.

This case did not remove any rights, it said that if an officer catches you in the commission of a misdemeanor, they may arrest you without a warrant.

What that has to do with Obama is beyond me, as it was a SCOTUS decision about a Texas local police case. He had no power over any of it.

The second case holds that strip searches during jail intake are not required to have probable cause. This codifies what has been standard jail procedure since forever.

You come in, strip out of your outside clothes, possibly under their supervision, and get your jail colors on. they may at any point stop you and insist further searches, and sometimes do.

Note at this point you must have been arrested, transported, booked and put into general population intake before this ever happens.

You'd have been better off to point towards some of the invasive cavity searches they're doing on the scene in the south.

Anyways, none of that has anything to do with President Obama.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","I actually really like the color you did on your lids, but I would blend it really well in the crease area. If you feel like you used too much you can always dab your brush in some powder and blend it in.

Also, are your cheeks like that naturally, or was that the blush you used? (Not trying to be a dick--I knew a girl in HS with rosacea and everyone thought she did her blush like that). If it's the blush, get a pointed brush, or squeeze it tight near the end so it's flat, then sort of suck your cheeks in--apply it from where you feel that hollow part in your cheek up to your ear area, then up into the temple, then blend downward. If that makes any sense.

And I totally agree with speakstruth, if you don't have an eyelid primer invest in one! Even from Elf. They work soo well and keep your eyes looking awesome for hours on end.

Chris Marquette, Brooke Nevin, Kinsey Packard, E. Quincy Sloan    
Director: Kyle Rankin; Writer: Kyle Rankin

&gt; Our hero, Cooper, awakes to find himself nauseous, weak and covered in webbing, hanging from the ceiling of an office where, just minutes ago, he started his new job. As he struggles out of his slimy prison he comes face to face with his opponent - a grotesque, powerful and very angry bug. All 3 ft of it. And so begins a hideous, nail-biting, comedic, all-action adventure to find a safe haven while constantly outwitting an infestation of monstrous proportions. As Cooper embarks on his journey, he befriends a ragtag group of survivors including Sara, a feisty attractive female. Although the situation is dire, Cooper can't help himself from trying to solve his dating problem while trying to save his life. Will they make it to safety before they are picked off one by one? And what other surprises are in store for our group of unlikely heroes?

No, you are pretending that the state recognizing marriage provides no legal or other benefits. I mean, the simplest one, being able be on your legal spouses medical insurance is huge. Because you can't really logic your way to opposing gay marriage, so you pretend marriage isn't that big a deal. It's truly sad.

Even if that was the only right, you realize how important that is don't you?

1). New Testament Gospels. This is a complicated source because they are Christian sacred scripture, but that doesn't mean they aren't historical.

2). Pauline Epistles. Written only about 20+ years after the death of Jesus. Paul also claims to know Peter, a disciple of Jesus, and James, Jesus' brother.

3). Tacitus, a Roman historian, wrote this in his Annals 15.44 ""Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, *called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus*, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.""

Grandmothers are far more idolized in black culture than most other culture. Sure, everybody loves Grandma because she gives you 20 bucks for whatever holiday you celebrate and your birthday. Maybe she knits you sweater, or cooks an awesome pot roast on sunday. Meanwhile in black culture: Now, lemme say this first off so you don't huff up and go ""haha, I got the racist son of a bitch now"" You cut that mental circlejerk here and now: While it is true that what I am about to say is based on socioeconomic stance and **not** race, it does indeed coincide.

Over 1/3 of black children are raised in poverty. 3/4ths of all black children are raised by single mothers. Childcare is expensive as fuck, so who watches the kids while momma works? Grandma. Yea, a few white people here who want to feel 'offended' like you want to feel were raised by grandma, but that statistic is far from common.  Grandma was the one who made sure you ate at least twice a day. Grandma beat your ass when she heard you were skipping school. Grandma took your ass to the library when she didn't know the answer to your homework, at least before you got caught up in the culture that perpetuates this cyclical statistical shirking of responsibility.

1) I'm a full time student, an almost full time worker, and am extremely fucking poor. I barely have time to text or the money to socialise recently. Being a happy, relaxed person gets creative juices flowing - and right now college work is too much for that.

2) Maybe Chris is looking at my texts in a more critical light?

3) Maybe I'm just not funny any more. Darn.

Anyway, I think Chris should be putting up some new stuff shortly. But, just in case anyone's interested, here's some slim pickings taken straight from my phone in the last week or so, which you may or may not like:

- Idea: trousers that have a discreet flannel backside, because after going to the loo you just wipe your wet hands on your arse anyway

- Hahahaha. HAHAHAHAHA. I can't make my text font any bigger so put your eyes closer to the screen. HAHAHAHAHA.

- I feel like Whitney Houston's song ""I have nothing if I don't have you"" is overly dramatic. She would still have several things. Lots of things. Just one less thing, in fact, if she lost you. ""I would have less things, LESS THINGS"" would be an altogether more honest song I think.

- I think I just got flirted with by a gay teacher. I feel strangely proud.

- My mum called me to ask me what my favourite dessert was. I found myself, much to my surprise, saying ""Peach... peach sorbet?"". Apparently I like peach sorbet. Apparently I really enjoy peach sorbet.

- Bitch-ass honkey. Throbbing gorilla cock smothered in day-old jizz. I would vomit on your mother if she let me. Are you concentrating. Are you. Stop.

- I always feel victimised when I get splash back while pooping. I'm sitting here enjoying a relaxing dump and suddenly I get a jet of piss-filled horror trying to work its way up my unsuspecting anus. And I think ""why, why did you do this Toilet? What have I done to deserve this?""

- I once sat down to write a list of my problems. I was quite disappointed with myself at the time. It took me half an hour and I got as far as:

1) you never have any money

2) you can't even think of a list of problems

3) fuck you

But, since a thousand years is a second to Jehovah, it's like barely any time has passed at all from his point of view!'

Which made him seem even more dickish to me than a God who can't help the own situation he created. Like, for a microsecond he couldn't put himself in the shoes of the suffering humans who did nothing but be born in the middle of this little pissing contest and realize time and determination doesn't work for us like it does for him? 

I came to the conclusion that the entire narrative of fallen mankind's eventual redemption is just a massive, ill considered ego stroke for a creature who shouldn't need it. Whether he chooses to obey his rules or is as inexorably bound by them as the rest of us, he comes off as weak and lying about the true breadth and depth of his power and wisdom.","1362096331"

By posting on here and getting feedback I'm just trying to get myself moving again; but that's all internally.

I would REALLY like for everything in the project to be 100% original, but I realize that's not realistic or best - especially with authentication, where a LOT of things can go wrong (heck, right now I'm using SHA1 and no salt; talk about horrible security). I find I sometimes learn things best when I set an unrealistic goal and try to achieve it, and I suppose that's what I'm trying to do.

On the other side, this is something I WANT to succeed. With the simple blog site I did for my final, it didn't really matter much. Just an assignment, and there are PLENTY of blog solutions out there. One more dosen't matter. This is something I'd actually use, and others might want to use too... I feel like I need to do this right from the start, so I'm being very careful.

So really, ANY advice - even advice I don't want to hear - is good. I'll look into the things you've suggested, and of course I'll do more reading and digging. I know someone who lives in the same city as me who wrote their own professional PHP framework (and it's REALLY professional - I met them through a coincidence on Google+) who I can ask as well.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","As another European that was in your shoes a few years ago:

* Start reading the Wikipedia articles. They will be confusing as hell first, but just keep skimming them and read the ""see also"" articles. Reread everything and with time you can stitch a lot of things together.

* Watch the [Anatomy of a play](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-films-anatomy-of-a-play) videos on nfl.com, read through PFF's [Analysis Notebook](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/category/games/analysis-notebook-features/) and read Matt Bowen's posts at [NationalFootballPost](http://www.nationalfootballpost.com/matt-bowen.html) and check on his twitter. These three resources will help you understand and 'get a feel' for what happens on each play and why some plays are truly great - and not just because some player ""wanted it more"", ""has an instinct""  or other media blabla.

* Read through the /r/nfl [judgement free Newbie threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/10i8yk/nfl_newbies_and_other_people_with_questions_ask/). Especially the whole 3-4 vs 4-3 vs 4-4 vs hybrids thing comes up quite often.

* Check the resources in your own language. Check if the Wiki articles are available in your language. Also many european sport websites and even newspages post Football 101s before the Super Bowl and with some googling you can also find the football boards in your own language. These places often deal with these basic/intermediate kind of questions and you get the answers in your own language, dumbed down (= compared to soccer) and most of the football vocab is translated or explained.

* Playing Madden isn't the 100% perfect cure everyone makes it out to be if you're still confused about basics. But it does prove useful if you just use it to play around with different Defenses etc. If you don't want to spend 50 bucks on the new one, you can try to get an older copy, but those are rather rare in Europe. I would recommend 'acquiring' Madden 2008 (last PC release) - it works perfectly for this purpose and due to its age it should run nicely even on non-gaming PCs.","1362096332"

My textbook that I used in my undergrad (Kelley) used the terminology. Gesenius also uses Polel and Polal, though it doesn't treat hitpa'el separately, so I don't think the word hitpolel actually appears.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","[Here are the Earth and Moon to scale](http://i.imgur.com/pjnFP.jpg).

The Moon  orbits around the Earth about once every 28 days, so it  would only be in the Earth's shadow for a very short time every month.

\- But in  addition to this, the Moon  isn't  in  exactly the same orbital plane as the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so usually when the Moon crosses  behind the Earth, it's  slightly ""above""  or ""below"" the Earth's orbital plane and still gets sunlight.  (It's only actually in Earth's shadow  when there's a lunar eclipse, and that only occurs for a few hours per year at most.)

\-  However, the Moon  is  ""tidally  locked""  to the Earth  -  the same  side  of the Moon  is always  facing the Earth.  This means  that the  Moon's  day  is  28 Earth days long  - 14  Earth days  of  daylight, and 14  Earth days  of night.  This  would  be more of a problem for plants.

.  

\-  All this  being said:  

Other moons  and other planets  would be different from the Earth and Moon.  (For example, Mars has two moons which  are tiny, close to the planet, and orbit around it in only a few hours.)

tl;dr: Could a moon be habitable for plants and vegetation?

Maybe.  There are probably  many, many moons in different solar systems that are  not habitable for plants and vegetation and a few that are. ","1362096334"

I simply bended it in. When the problem continued i just re-soldered the wires near that small flange and all was well.. no more problems.

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","The sad thing about most economics is its nearly impossible to tell whether it was these policies that worked or whether the economy worked in spite of it.  I'm not a huge fan of Reaganomics, myself, but I think its probably better than what most Republicans have tried.

&gt; budget deficit went into a surplus during Clinton's term because of the 12 years of policy from Reagan and Bush Sr.

I think the surplus was more to do the end of the Cold War (you've got to credit Reagan and Bush for that if you're going to credit Obama with ending the Iraq War) and the dot-com bubble.  Most likely the surplus was a temporary part of that bubble and would not have been sustainable even without the Bush tax cuts.  Again, its really hard to say, mostly because 9/11 happened as well.

&gt;The retort most commonly used here is that the disparity between ""rich"" and ""poor"" was increased because of Reagan's policies. In reality, the NUMBER of ""poor"" people was decreased, so the ""very poor"" were the new standard.

This would be best understood by looking at the [Gini Ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) as compiled by the [Census folks](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2011/H04_2011.xls).  In 1980 it was .406.  In 1988 it was .426.  That means income inequality got worse over the period (this is all races, column B).  Then again, you'll that it is increasing pretty much every year without fail.  I'm not going to bother with figuring the slope - if anyone is really math nerd-enough they can do that.

Now, ultimate did it work?  Ultimately, the only measure would be how did the GDP look before and after?  Here is a [White House Historical Table that include GDP](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z2.xls) and you can see that it went from 2.7 trillion to 5.0 trillion - basically doubled in 8 years.  You have to say it worked in some regard.  Or it went to 6.2 trillion if you accept that Bush I was Reagan III.

But then again, Clinton's term did really well too... so was it Reaganomics/Clintonomics?  Let the debate begin.","1362096337"

It's like something modern, *by virtue of it being modern* is somehow wicked or unholy. I think it has to do with a mistaken theological expectation that the world is destined *to get worse*. I was just talking with my dad today about an old time Pentecostal preacher who refused to use a microphone when preaching because, ""you lose the anointing"" when you use newfangled technology. There is a built-in bias against the contemporary, and a mistaken notion that a few generations ago was somehow more righteous.

Not to mention that any ""scriptural"" condemnation of a fashionable women's hairstyle is just horrid isogesis at best.

I can say you have a good eye and you seem to be seeing the light and value changes which is something lots of people struggle at.
Keep taking pictures that appeal to you, worry less about what others think but don't be afraid to try what they suggest.
It's always quicker learning from other peoples mistakes and successes but sometimes the lessons don't stick as well.  
Learn the fundamentals and operational control of your camera and then explore different/alternative techniques.

The enemy bot lane will hit level 2 and level 6 faster than your AD carry which enables them to apply large amounts of pressure to the lane. The level disparity outweighs the value of the buff that you would get in lane. If you give that buff to your jungler instead, if you ever walk into lane, you're already weaker due to lack of exp. Furthermore, the popular junglers, such as Vi, Jarvan IV, and Xin Zhao have CC built into their kit and therefore red buff only helps, it's not mandatory. Additionally, you have one less combat summoner in straight up duels and don't have Exhaust to deal with champions like the aforementioned champions.","1362096354"

"urbanplanning","t5_2qhp7","&gt;Mariscal's building would, however, offer two bike parking spots per unit.

Also, the 57 and 57A run very close to that intersection and provide reasonably frequent service. I'd include the 66 in a transit assessment, but that is one of the most unreliable buses because of Boston's failure at signal timing in this entire area.

***Traffic is the single reason these three frequent buses often have such poor service*** and why twitter is always ablaze with people complaining about the buses running back-to-back with the first completely full. Ban cars and you solve the transit problem - buses run faster, more frequently, more reliable. That is also entirely outside of this single developer's power.

Allston straddles a very very uncomfortable edge between city and suburb - dense enough to have really awesome culture, but sparse enough that it requires cars to get around. Addressing the 'need' for cars is the first step Boston needs to take, possibly looking at Cambridge's successful implementation of road diets.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Yeah I mean just like any subculture, some people love each other, some people hate each other, etc etc.  I think there is a great deal of camaraderie that results just from shared experiences, and also the fact is that a lot of us are very similar in personality and temperament.  It can definitely get difficult sometimes just because when you're on the road with people you're seeing them so often, it can become almost sibling-like in some ways.  The competitive nature of it can also be difficult because when you're ultimately competing against these people, it's hard to believe that anyone truly supports you or has your best interest at heart 100% of the time.  I think it's rare to be able to have those sorts of relationships. Still though, I like almost everyone I've met on some level or another.

There is this cool thing that happens that is unique to poker though which is that there will be people I've never really hung out with before or even met, but if they are in a group of people I am hanging out with, we can just strike up a conversation as if we're old friends.  Usually you know who everyone is and some mutual friends have talked about that person to you before, so it's like you've known them forever yourself.

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","it's not meaningless. You've had previous comp experience in tfc, tf2 etc. HotRod's had a tonne of experience in t2, I'd guess rtcll is the same wrt experience. there's obviously no definitive rule saying that a rank 40 is always better than a rank 30; I'm rank 37 and have played against a few very good silvers and gold rank players. But as a general rule of thumb, the people who are rank 50 have played this game for hundreds and hundreds of hours. 

there's a whole tonne of variables that are better ways to determine somebody's skill before playing against/with them;fps experience, tribes history, kills/assists in a game, etc. But rank is definitely one of them.

also like I said before 

&gt;generally, more time means more practice, more skill development etc.

You can see it with ePi and VeX who've been practicing tirelessly. compare them to zfz, who don't get as much chance to play and even though zfz has absolutely phenomenal players like kudos and crzg, the lack of practice hurts them when they play against well practiced teams like epi or ego. 

I guess it's more to do with how much experience with fps games and tribes games you have in general. as a rule of thumb, people who've played TA a tonne or played previous tribes games a tonne do well; in beta, top players were people like proj, mabel, naner etc. 

As an offhand example to show my point, I only know of one top sniper who could be considered low rank; knutsson. almost every other top sniper I know of is a high rank, most of them rank 50s. ","1362096362"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;i dont agree with that ...or they dont affect GDP growth the same, spending cuts affect GDP far more because the government doesn't pay worker that well so government employees are middle class who for the most part participate wholeheartedly in terms of how much of their income they spend. tax increases depending on where they are applied can have a large affect, like increasing taxes on the poor or to a lesser extent the middle because of how much of their income the spend, and to a much less extent the rich, because they dont spend most of their income. the rich for the most part wont miss 50,000 out of their salary if they make 1 million. the middle and particularly the poor will miss a 2000 from their salary.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","It depends. At full adoption the deflation probably wouldn't be any worse than the mortgage interest you would pay in fiat - a lot of which is to compensate the lender for time value and inflation beside just profits (subtract ~2% per year from any current foxed rate loan to see the lender's real earnings) 

You also would need to incorporate deflation into any appreciation of alternative asset value. If bitcoin were stable and deflating at single digit percentages every year (let's say 5% for no reason at all) than the opportunity cost would impact a house that might have appreciated at 7% in the current climate so that no tangible appreciation were taking place (5% hypothetical btc deflation + 2% current USD inflation). 

Investment in a bitcoin only economy would look somewhat different than investment in the fiat economy does. People would need to develop (and would develop) a practical appreciation for the difference between nominal growth and real growth. 

So the answer to your question is that the market would adjust the terms of loans for homes to make sense and while there will always be a strong motivation to save versus borrow (rather than the reverse encouraged by the current fiat system) the purchase of large durable items will still require credit and the use of credit and the terms of credit will adjust to make sense.

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","I'm at a university in the US (not comfortable with saying which one)

What method of evaluations does your institution use?
During the last week of class, instructors are given scantrons to pass out to students. Students are asked to rate instructors on a scale of 1-5 on a variety of topics (are assignments graded fairly, was the instructor available for office hours/email, was the class helpful, etc) as well as give additional feedback. To maintain anonymity, the instructor must not be in the room while the students are completing the form and a student must collect and deliver the forms to the department's main office.

How quickly do you receive the results?
This entirely depends on the department. A staff person handles this in my department and we typically get the results in the middle or so of the following quarter, depending on how busy she is with other projects. So, it takes several weeks.


How time-consuming is your process? (setting up, handing out, generating reports, etc.)
Not time consuming at all. I spend about 10 minutes at the end of the last day of class doing this. I have no idea what it's like for our staff person, however. I imagine it's quite time consuming because she also scans them all in and emails them to us.

What is your overall student response rate?
This depends on how many students show up on the day the instructor decides to do evaluations.","1362096375"

(it has helped me A LOT)
For example:
*Vibrato 3 min
*break 1 min
*alternate picking 3 min
*break 1 min
*sweeping 3 min
*etc. (the one minute break between excersices is really important, it gives your brain a chance to take in what you've just done.)

And most importantly, play for fun/write/play songs as much as you practice, so you get to utilize what you're learning, and have fun ;)

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","&gt; That could just be because werecreatues are creations of Hircine, Daedric Prince of the Hunt. People are blessed/cursed by him so that they transform into savage man-beasts and hunt whatever they can. The Khajiit are far less savage and do much less hunting. Why would Hircine want to create them? He wants savage hunters, not civilised farmers.

The savageness and hunting could just either be an aspect of Hircine or a result of the melding between animal and man/mer.  Overtime, left to their own devices, they may develop their own culture and become less savage and therefore need less of a reason to change back to a man.  Hircine obviously does not want that, unlike perhaps Azura and her animal/man-mer melding.

Then again, we know there to be several different 'species' or 'races' of Khajiit; some that look almost human/mer (Ohmes), probably due to poor initial design decisions /graphical capabilities from Daggerfall and/or Arena mingling with the full fledged cat designs of Morrowind (Cathay) to then be considered both canon, and some that are essentially just giant cats (Pahmar, Senche) that are ridden and probably enjoy being savage and hunting, and some that are intelligent cats with no human physical characteristics that practice magic (alfiq)

If so many types could 'evolve' from Azura changing Mer's into a single race of Khajiit, why is it so hard to believe a conclusion of varying degrees or shades of cat/mer based on their after cultures/breeding, perhaps with other Mer (Proto-Bosmer) to cause this?  

Or is it just easier (albeit sillier to me) to believe Azura(h) automatically new to create specific species for specific purposes and all with specific varying degrees of cat-ness? 

&gt; Just because the Khajiit look similar to an animal, they don't have to be related to some kind of werecreature. In fact, it's quite racist to think so.

How so?  We know that when the world first started, there were only the Ehlnofey and the Hist.  The Ehlnofey further separated into Man and Mer, and the Hist have always been Hist.  

There's no proto-explanation whatsoever for man-beasts other than perhaps the wild-hunt leftovers creating the monsters of the world or the pre-existing populations of man and mer being altered some way magically by the Daedra ( Vampires by Molag Bal, Were-beast by Hircine, Orcs by Boethiah/Trinimac-Malacath, Chimer by Boethiah, Dunmer by Azura, Khajiit supposedly by Azura, Argonians supposedly by Giant Trees that have nothing to do with lizards or reptiles).  

Therefore the various beastmen of the world, including the various beastmen races of Akavir, have no logical explanation for their existence other than magic of some kind.  

And yet to you it makes perfectly logical sense to have cat-men and lizard-men spring up from entirely different types of 'evolution' or 'creation' rather than having it be a similar creation such as Were-beasts evolving after having been created?  

So it makes more sense to you that man or mer eating tree sap caused them to change into Lizard men for some reason while Daedra changed mer into varying degrees of cat-men for another reason?  

All the cats of the world including Sabertooth cats in Skyrim stem from the khajiit but wolves and bears already existed and Hircine uses them as pre-existing models for were-beasts?  It's nonsensical, unless the creatures known as cats were created the moment Azura(h) dreamed up the khajiit.

&gt; Or have you ever wondered whether Nords are related to wereapes, eh? Same line of thinking, but why do people never ask that question

Actually, this is a good point, and is precisely the reason why I bring this up.  We know logically men, in our reality, sprang from the ancestors of us and apes (unless of course you're a creationist, then you believe in something akin to MK's wacky world/reality). 

However in MK's world, men and mer stem from a common ancestor (The Ehlnofey), and there were no other sentient species other than trees (Nevermind how trees became sentient, because it can just be explained away by Magic! )  So we know men aren't considered 'evolved' from apes let a lone perhaps even related to apes in this wacky fantasy world/reality. 

Therefore, once again, the beastmen of this world/reality had to come from something else.    It's not that much of a stretch of imagination to then believe the same magics /ideals used to create werewolves were used to create Khajiits then, even if it was done with varying intentions and different Daedra.  

Now, if cats exist solely because Khajiit exist (which is looking to be the stupid case based on the sabretooth cats of Skyrim being related to), then that's easily refuted and cats are a creature that were created the minute Azura created the Khajiits.  If Azura used existing animals, namely the knowledge of cats, to create the Khajiits, then I don't see why this can't be a possibility.

And why don't we see beastmen of all degrees?  Where are the Bird-men, bear-men, frog-men, spider-men, owl-men, ladybug men, mothmen, dragon-men, goat-men, etc. etc.  I mean, if you're going to have one or two animals special enough to become men (Cats-Khajiit, Lizards-Argionans, Apes-Imga, Foxes - Lilmothiit,  Monkey's - Tang Mo, Snakes - Tsaesci, Crabs - Dreugh, Tigers/ Cats - Ka po tun), why not every animal that's in existence?  That's kind of the stupidity of using animal races in the first place rather than unique races like Men, Dwarves, Elfs, Goblins, Orcs instead.  While these are unique and hold no sway to one animal or another (Other than primates perhaps), actual 'beast' races stem literally from a specific animal, and there,s no rhyme or reason why there's sentient races of specific animals and not others.","1362096378"

"technology","t5_2qh16","You claim fair use covers the distribution of copyrighted material. Downloading while not violating fair use would just be copying a song/video you paid for from cloud storage to another computer that you also own/control. You won't ever see a copyright claim for doing that. Publicly torrenting and thusly sharing said media is not protected under fair use. In the case of a private torrent, which I've never seen, you could argue that. Public torrents share the pieces of the file publicly which makes you guilty of distribution. It is how the DMCA claims up until now have been made. Someone starts a torrent file and everyone they download from has shared it and they use that list to make claims. 

Does that make sense? Basically, downloading is legal because it is too much burden to prove some one guilty of ""theft"" as antipiracy groups like to call it. If you purchased a single copy of the material, you can claim fair use.

 Uploading is illegal because now you are taking part to *distribute* copyrighted material. Torrents always upload while the file is ""active"". That's why the focus on torrents. It is the easiest way to get caught.","1362096381"

That is very far from true.

It's around 5% of the number of deaths attributable to smoking.

"vexillology","t5_2rygj","&gt; It's useful to have a gold standard for evil.

Godwins are almost always in bad taste. I'm sure you find it ""useful,"" but using the pain and suffering of millions of people as a rhetorical weapon in whatever petty political dispute you're having is ridiculously offensive. You're not treating the event with sensitivity and respect, you're just using it as a tool to defame your political opponents.

&gt; Especially in face of such a hideous claim as that there is no such a thing as right or wrong.

1 + 1 = 2 is an objective truth. It will be true even if every human on the planet thinks it's false. It'll be true even if humans cease to exist. It's a truth that exist independent of human perception. ""Good"" and ""evil"" are different. They exist nowhere outside the human mind, and they can change depending on which group of humans is making the judgement. In different time periods or in different areas, things we consider ""good"" could be considered ""evil"" and things we consider ""evil"" could be considered ""good.""

If everyone in this discussion agrees that the holocaust was evil (almost certain to be the case), that still would not prove that the event was ""evil"" in an objective sense. That judgement is still dependent upon the subjective experiences and preferences of everyone here. For our purposes, yes, the holocaust was evil. But turn back the clock five thousand years, when genocides were more common place, and the judgment may have been different. Look into the future 10,000 years, and who knows what people will think. 

&gt; And the points and concerns of all these people are solved by civilised means, not with military invasions and occupations.

Civilizations have been using war as a means of solving political disputes since their inception. Saying that invasions and occupations aren't ""civilized"" is pretty much meaningless.

&gt; Turkey is wrong, and that is a fact.

The arrogance of this statement is rather stunning. Do you think you have perfect knowledge of all the events surrounding the partition of Cyrpus? I'm sure the people actually involved in the dispute have a variety of views about it based on their differing experiences and interpretations of the events surrounding the creation of the Turkish state in northern Cyrpus. Are you honestly going to assert that all other possible opinions on the subject are objectively wrong?","1362096391"

The theory maintains that, in the instant—a trillion-trillionth of a second—after the big bang, the universe expanded with incomprehensible speed from its pebble-size origin to astronomical scope. Expansion has apparently continued, but much more slowly, over the ensuing billions of years.

Scientists can't be sure exactly how the universe evolved after the big bang. Many believe that as time passed and matter cooled, more diverse kinds of atoms began to form, and they eventually condensed into the stars and galaxies of our present universe.""","1362096391"

and just went downhill from there. I started questioning the veracity of scripture mainly through an information integrity argument. Moved on to the moral nature of god and arrived at the conclusion that: In my opinion the version of the universe that makes me the happiest is that god does not exist. If it DOES exist, then its a dick and not worthy of worship. Basically: I dont think there exists something that can satisfy all three of my criteria for ""god"" omnipotence, omnibenevolence, omniscient.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A good friend of mine, Abe, has two sisters, both close in age to myself. I've slept with one and fooled around with the other with mixed results.

Sister 1 I actually knew before Abe (very early on) - as in 3rd/4th grade - and she was one of my first crushes. Fast forward a couple of years and I've become friends with her brother Abe through another childhood friend. As Abe and I became better friends and got older, my crush for sister 1 gradually subsided. She attended a different middle and high school, so the lack of proximity (even though I would see her from time to time as a result of hanging at Abe's house a lot) sort of killed the issue slowly. This was great in my opinion as any guilt/weirdness gave way to what I considered a great casual friendship with my buddy's sister, having known her for so long.

So jump ahead and I've just finished my first year of college. I'm back at home for that long 4 month summer with nothing to do but work a BS job for cash and hang out. Early into the break, sister 1 throws a party and long story short it sets off a chain where soon me her and two buddies of mine start hanging out a lot over the next few months. Abe attends school far away and doesn't come back home for the summer, and these two buddies are part of a different circle of friends as well. Sister 1 has grown up stunningly gorgeous, I might add. One of my friends (who I was also working with at the time) was unabashedly trying to get into her pants, but she clearly wasn't interested (probably because he was trying too hard) and it just made for a funny dynamic. It was actually a great summer with the four of us making a kind of core group that lots of other characters would come in and out of. Her love for partying (she had become a bit of a wild girl) and organizing us together, plus my one buddy's attraction to her guaranteed that we all spent a lot of time in each other's company. I've always been good at making friendships with girls, and I was happy that sister 1 was becoming a closer one without my being into her.

And there, apparently,
was the recipe for disaster (or perhaps secret to success, as I would see repeatedly in years after). Being confidently not interested in a pretty girl while spending considerable time in her proximity often seems to have the uncanny ability to foster an insatiable crush on her part. 

At first I didn't see it, but as the summer entered the final stretch I began to pick up on her signals toward me. My initial reaction was to play it off or pull away from it, both because of Abe and my other friend who was pursuing her. But she was persistent. And eventually I couldn't stand up to the attraction and lust of such a pretty girl aimed squarely at me and I buckled. 
My timing was perhaps somewhat poorly chosen, as a few of us were hanging out on the porch of the interested friend's house. But at some point in the night sister 1 and I were left out there alone and within seconds we were making out and groping each other urgently. I was smart enough to break it off before anyone saw. But at that point things were set in motion. Sister 1 was on me like a wild animal every chance she could pull me into an empty hallway or we were left alone in a room (which was happening more and more as the gathering was thinning out). She couldn't keep her mouth off mine or her hand away from my crotch and kept telling me she wanted me inside her. I knew we had to get out of my buddy's house both because we were bound to get caught and I felt like the serious boner I had was extremely obvious.
Neither of us had any business driving, but when you're 19, agonizingly horny and have already made the fateful decision to sleep with one of you best friend's sister, that seems like a small obstacle to cross. 

Both of us were staying with our parents that summer, so our options were limited. We both stupidly drove and I followed her to her parents' house where she got out of her car and climbed into mine. I guess we were impatient enough to think we didn't need to go anywhere else and the driveway just outside the front door would be perfect. We tumbled into the backseat of my SUV and within seconds were both naked with her doubled over furiously sucking my dick like she was starving for it. We had amazing, passionate, drunken sex with her making these sexy high-pitched moans and gasps while urgently shouting for it deeper and harder, which I was all too happy to oblige. This was early on in my sexual experiences, and was my first time boning a girl with such a high sex drive. Looking back I don't know how I held it together for as long as I did. Somewhere deep down I must have realized if I was going to do this I needed to give it my all. I managed to perform like a champ, holding off until she came twice and finally finished after she begged me to come inside her. It was incredible. Afterward, sprawled across my backseat catching her breath she told me how much I rocked her world. I noticed that the front passenger side window was still halfway down. It was probably 2 or 3am and the whole neighborhood must have heard. I just hoped her parents didn't have their bedroom window open. I pointed this out to her and she laughed with an insouciant ""whoops"". I was in a state of shock over the fact that I had just nailed my friend's sister and elementary school crush feet from the front door of the house I had spent so much time in as a kid, I just couldn't stop laughing. Of course, her saying ""whoops"" about the window so irreverently after such a wild episode was pretty funny.

We ended up having sex a couple more times in the week before we each had to leave for the fall semester. One of our rendezvous was my old middle school parking lot in a not-at-all discreet location under bright lights. But it was a wild rush and we were far too young and reckless to care.

Leaving for school, I hadn't told a soul and was ready to take what had happened to the grave. Sister 1, however, apparently had absolutely no qualms running her mouth about it. By winter break both of the buddies in our foursome from that summer knew. One thought it was hilarious and couldn't believe it had happened with his not suspecting at all. The other who was after her was probably less amused but was cool about it. In a funny twist of fate, he and sister 1 went to college together and would end up dating a couple of years later for a time. Sister 1 and I remained friends and (probably because we were always dating other people and because the situation was messy because of my close friendship with Abe) never hooked up again, which was probably for the best.

A lot of time went by and as far as I could tell, Abe still didn't know. Then, a couple of years after college I was back home for thanksgiving (Abe was not) and I'd been hanging out for a couple of nights with a group that included sister 1 and her slightly younger sister 2. I'm not sure exactly how it happened but I saw the evil glint in sister 2's eye the last night and decided to go for it. Long story short, I'm at the girls' parents house at 5am with sister 2 on the couch, my mouth on hers and my fingers inside her. Things definitely would have progressed further but we were interrupted by a door down the hall slamming. Apparently sister 1 had been off (ironically getting fingered by the same buddy who used to date her in the next room) but afterwards she had decided to come into the den. Apparently she saw everything but rushed off immediately, the door slam marking her exit. Sister 2 and I broke it off for the evening and I left with my buddy to walk across town to the neighborhood our parents lived in. Sister 1 was pissed. Probably madder than she had ever been at me. She told me I was on her ""shit list"", and it took a few months for her to let it go completely. But in the end, being a cool girl, she settled down and seemed to forget that she had ever been that angry about it.

However, at the time, Abe, sister 1 and myself were living in the same city. Apparently a week or two later sister 1 was hanging out with brother Abe and in her anger over it proceeded to tell him about what she saw with me and sister 2. To make matters worse, she also mentioned that she and I had hooked up in the past, apparently to incriminate me more. I found this out from a mutual friend who was hanging out with Abe just after, who felt compelled to share and ponder this info with. The mutual friend promptly called me up and was laughing at how bold and stupid I was to reach for such forbidden fruit twice.

It was a moment of sheer panic. Fortunately, Abe is hands down one of the coolest cats I know and apparently his response was very measured - akin to a ""they're grown women they make their own decisions"" kind of attitude. He's never really brought it up to me directly and our friendship has miraculously not suffered at all.

I count myself lucky, but this is a situation I don't recommend getting yourself into. It's just not worth it if you value your friend's friendship more than getting laid or fulfilling a fantasy or having a great story (which you probably won't want to share anyways). Things like this are bound to get out eventually, even if it takes a few years. When I later confronted sister 1 about why she would tell Abe about us, she just grinned at me and said ""whoops"".

"allthingsprotoss","t5_2tkqb","I think the main idea to dealing with both broods and swarmhosts is to not engage the broodling/locust unless you have to. It's fine if you're defending your base and you have no other means of fighting said opposing unit, but if you encountered a bunch of broodlords on the other end of the map from your base and had no blinkstalkers, you would turn around and run away. 

Same idea goes for swarmhosts. Especially since the cooldown to spawning more locusts is much longer than that of the broodlord spawning broodlings, you should have time to get around the locust and snipe a few swarm hosts before a new wave is ready. Locusts actually move relatively slow, so as long as they don't surround your units with lings or fungal you, it should be fine (or use zealots and don't care if they die).

Especially if you have tempest, which far out-range queens, you could just sit the tempest behind a wall with colossus and shoot the swarmhosts until they die or run away. ","1362096409"

I would describe myself as ""masculine"" although I identity as a woman. My boyfriend would, and does, describe himself as more ""feminine"". But he does identify as a man. I tend to initiate sex, make the decisions, and have a harder time expressing my feelings. While he gets emotional often and tends to be more nurturing. We complement each other but if you wrote our traits down on paper, you'd confuse us. 

I think you just ""know"". Or, rather, perhaps you don't notice it unless you feel like you have the wrong physical parts. I can't think of one thing, or a group of things that defines me as a woman, because I could attribute those things to a male, too. So, I think it's the trauma of not feeling like your body matches your insides that you really notice whether your gender and sex match.

It's incredibly simple, I (and most atheists) don't believe in a god because there is no evidence for one. I personally find it absurd to believe in a god.

Atheism is ""belief that God does not exist"", and theism is ""Belief in the existence of a god"".

Atheism isn't ""anti"" anything. People who are atheists aren't inherently against religions or theism in general, they just don't believe there is a god. Like my first sentence suggests, anything more than that is just annoying. If people want to believe in a fantasy, than good for you, but don't make anyone who doesn't believe in that bullshit out to be ""anti"" anything. Most atheists couldn't give a shit about any theists beliefs in the first place. It's all equally absurd to most atheists.

So no, Humanism doesn't offer an alternative to theism. Atheism is the alternative to theism. The alternative to having a light on, is having that light off... not a set of beliefs about why that mother fucking light should be should be off.

"harmonica","t5_2rru3","&gt;Never really done anything music related cause i lack the ""vocal ear"" for it or w/e

Neither did I, but 3 months later... I can play pretty well, single notes came in around the end of month 1 (but had problems when jumping from hole to hole). Now my notes are very clear, though no bending abilities yet.

What you need to do is find the easiest hole to blow in that's not too low (usually 3 or 4 on a C harp). Cover the surrounding holes with your fingers and blow - you'll hear a crystal clear note. Remember that note well. Move your fingers away, pucker up on the hole you're willing to play, CENTER YOUR LIPS\*, and just blow. As you're blowing, go ahead and go into a ""whistle position"", aka contract your lips, but concentrate on the back of your lips, instead of the front - keep them on the harmonica in order to form a seal\*\*. You'll either hear a chord (more notes played - keep contracting!) or a single note (yay!) or a pffffft sound (you've gone too far, son, loosen up). If that doesn't work, do it again, but this time try moving left and right until you get the position right. You WILL get a single clear note, but the real issue is keeping that position in mind when playing and going from hole to hole - that takes more practice.

When trying to do this, don't try and blow too hard, take it easy.


\* I must emphasize this, it's very very important - you can pucker all you want, but if you haven't got the position right, you'll be playing two notes! Move left-right until you've got it.

\*\* Take note, the seal is also very important... but you won't be getting any of that if you're whistling in the harp, your lips are just too dry, hard and bumpy! Use the *inner*, more moist and smoother part of your lips. Push your lips forward a bit, kind of like making a duckface.

Use this for a guide:

http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/harmonica-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html

See that hole on the ""pucker"" technique? Your mouth can only contract so much before it gives up... if you move a bit to the left, you'll start screwing up and playing two notes. Practice, practice, practice. Make sure you're not using a busted up harmonica, or a toy of some sort...","1362096413"

The other biggest tip I ever for humor writing was to make sure the subject matter was universal - at least to the intended audience. You can make a joke about Schrodinger's Cat, but if the person you're telling it to doesn't have a basic foundation in particle physics, they're not going to get it (though it may kill at a sci-fi convention). You make a joke about the design of doorknobs, everyone's going to get it because everyone has encountered a doorknob in their life. This doesn't mean you can't write niche humor, you just have to make sure that whatever joke you're making is universal *to the intended audience of the joke*.

If you want to see a master of the craft, George Carlin. The guy can make anything hilarious solely because he understands the meter of comedy and pretty much every single topic he covers is something that everyone encounters in their own life or at the very least completely understands.","1362096423"

"keto","t5_2rske","Your numbers look fine, weight loss usually lowers your HDL and can increase LDL, you need to be weight stable for a few months to see the real effect of diet.

With low triglycerides your LDL numbers are overestimated, it's closer to 105 mg/dl ([calculator](http://homepages.slingshot.co.nz/~geoff36/LDL_mg.htm)).

&gt; In patients with low serum triglyceride and undesirably high total cholesterol levels, Friedewald equation may overestimate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and it should be either directly assayed or be calculated by a modified Friedewald equation.

*Ahmadi SA, et al.* [""The impact of low serum triglyceride on LDL-cholesterol estimation""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426324) *Arch Iran Med. 2008 May;11(3):318-21.*

But cholesterol numbers are very weak predictors of risk, check out Peter Attia's article series over at eatingacademy.com, [""The straight dope on cholesterol""](http://eatingacademy.com/nutrition/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-part-i), it covers just about everything of importance on cholesterol.

The most important marker, and really the only good way of knowing risk, is the LDL particle count. You need to do an NMR test to get this value, a VAP test that measures apoB (not calculates, ask for a protein immuno assay) can be used as a relatively similar marker, but it's not as accurate (divide your apoB by 0.055 to get the particle count). [Ideally you want the particle count to be below ~1000 if you're at risk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_density_lipoprotein#Optimal_ranges), but below 1300 is still ok ([healthy young men having 1500-1600 seems normal](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1991842)).

If you want to lower LDL you can swap to unsaturated fat (olive oil or canola oil instead of butter) and reduce your dietary cholesterol intake (eat avocados instead of eggs). Fiber helps reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol (and cholesterol from bile), so that can help reduce LDL.

Paul Jaminet's [""High LDL on Paleo Revisited: Low Carb &amp; the Thyroid""](http://perfecthealthdiet.com/2011/09/high-ldl-on-paleo-revisited-low-carb-the-thyroid/) might also have some tips (copper/choline/iodine).

"medicine","t5_2qhff","In many clinical trials you can know what treatment you are getting. Some are blinded, where you don't know. Also, cancer trials often do not compare against placebo, and not all clinical trials are looking at experimental treatments; some are looking at two different standards of care and comparing them. Phase 1 trials usually look at treatments that haven't been used in a particular disease before, so they are often reserved for patients with relapsed disease. In these trials you almost always know what treatment you will be receiving. The primary goal of these trials is to evaluate safety. In phase 2 trials, the goal is to understand if the treatment is effective. You often know what you will be receiving on these trials. These trials can be good for patients that are newly diagnosed or relapsed. However, if someone is newly diagnosed with a cancer with good treatment options, then a phase 3 is probably better than phase 2. Phase 3 trials compare 2 different treatment regimens that are both thought to be effective. Sometimes they are both standards of care, and it is unclear which is best, and other times one of them is a new treatment option.

My point is that installed correctly (like if they came with the car) they're not going to blind anyone.  If it's shining into your car, someone installed them wrong and they're an ass.

&gt;You should stop trying to justify using them, the law clearly states no.

No it doesn't. Here's the [law in my area](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=veh&amp;group=24001-25000&amp;file=24400-24411):

""A motor vehicle may be equipped with not more than two
foglamps that may be used with, but may not be used in substitution
of, headlamps.""  It even goes on to describe how far in front of the vehicle they're allowed to point (25 feet).  Those people who blinded you had their headlights pointed more than 25 feet in front of the vehicle. Not only that, they're not supposed to be higher than 30 inches, so unless you drive a go-cart, correctly installed fog lamps will never bother you.

The law clearly states they're being used correctly. 

&gt;Would you drive around with your rear fog light on? Didn't think so.

If it helped me see better and didn't blind oncoming traffic, then yea. Seeing as it doesn't do that, I really don't care about it.  Cars in the US don't really have that anyway.","1362096432"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I was an intern at a radio station. At our station,  the DJs didn't do a lot besides talking on-air and making sure songs and ads were queued up. They'd queue up half an hour of music &amp; some ads, then go outside for a smoke or chat whilst it all played. Getting back in to the studio in time was a DJ skill. If they were working on material (intro, promo stuff, clips, reading comments and feedback), they would usually do that in the time they were working at the station, but weren't working on air. 

For some syndicated shows or other shows requiring someone to switch between ""live"" radio and the feed from a network, a tech might be involved to make the swap. Some of the DJs did that work themselves if required, but not many.  Syndicated shows run one after another on a channel. The station pays for the shows they want and the time they want to run it.  If you've ever wondered why some cool syndicated shows are on at a sucktastic time for your area, it's likely because that's the only time that particular show is on the syndicate feed.

There usually was someone on hand to answer the phone whilst the DJ was on air.

All of my intern experience with radio comes from the late 80's/early 90's, back in the day when they actually had banks of cartridges to pop in machines and switching a feed
 involved physically moving one cable from one plug to another, like some old telephone switchboard in old movies. Curious to hear how it all works now!","1362096436"

I really really miss the variety of equipment from the older games, but I'm glad they retained some RPG elements.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Went to a play in NYC called Sleep No More. It was/is an adaptation of Macbeth that takes place in a 5 story hotel. You would walk into this hotel lobby right out of the 20's, completed with live jazz and flappers, and you're handed a playing card. Eventually, you are given a mask after being put into groups by suit, and sent up an elevator, into the top floor of the hotel. You are left free to walk around as you please, and touch/interact with anything you like(drawers, books, pianos, etc...), provided you do not remove your mask, and do not talk. The actors interact with you as they please. The place is at the same time a fucking nightmare and the coolest fucking thing ever. 5 different and independent floors of macabre metaphorical Macbeth. I walked in on everything from a wild dance of abortion between a Bellhop, maid, and pregnant woman, to the actor playing Macbeth, who was covered in blood, having some hot, very rough sex with his Lady. The pathways between floors are always changing, new doors being opened to new creepy shit. There's rumored to be an orgy room.

There is one thing I'd like to ask your opinion on. We can sit here speculating about the perfect form of society all day, but just as the problem with anarchism is, many of these philosophies are simply unrealistic at this point in history. (Outside influences, for example, almost always end in anarchists being slaughtered or absorbed by the surrounding influences)

In other words, if you try to impliment the 'perfect society' within an imperfect world, it would probably have the opposite effect that we attempt to achieve. The only solution, really, would be to completely start from a clean slate which is a VERY dangerous notion, *cough cough* communism and reeducation *cough cough*.

Do you think it would be more beneficial to look towards a more realistic approach rather than the most ideal one? Maybe I am thinking about this wrong.","1362096452"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I've held off on submitting a review on the JET, but here looks like as good a place as any.

This is hands down the best water pipe I've ever owned. I made a little more than expected this year and decided to invest in a durable bong after my last honeycomb perc bong broke. The ashcatcher is the last remnant of my glass setup that included a sidealong perc and carbon filter as well.

You could chuck this through a wall, put a hole through a cinderblock and throw it off a bridge and you could still smoke it immediately after. The plastic insulates heat well, so any cold water stays cold longer than borosilicate. It collects resin oils on the sides the same as glass and cleans just as easily. I just through some rubbing alcohol in and shake it around.

As said below, the X-5 diffuser has 50 holes, but sucking through it gives you a nice chugging pull that can take a lot of fluccuationin lung pull before it the pressure gives in. It's just too damn easy to mil this thing to heaven. The pucks are where the magics at. It give you a foamy, diffused clearing that gives bubble stacks straight to the lid. 

Occasionally, it stacks so high I get a little water it my mouth. Yeah. The rip and clear on this thing is amazing, one pull can couchlock the unwary. The smoke rolls in smooth as a meadow breeze. Your first indication you dun goofed is a slight chemical burn feeling your lungs give from over saturation on smoke. Then, your sinuses burn, like Satan's firery cock is pissing into them. Then, your brain goes numb, like you were just hit in the face with a medicine ball. Congratulations, you have takeoff.

Everything is watertight, but easy to unscrew and clean. I clean it about every 2 weeks and change the bong water after a few sessions. Fora grand total of $365, plus shipping, i'll have paid a dollar per day in 10 months, for a bong that will outlast my weak carbon-based vessel. This is made out of the same materials our military uses for their guns. The aluminum has a 3rd level annodization, so the metal parts will never fade, stain, peel. Plus, it looks awful pretty with red, white and black.

10/10, would smoke again.

So you can extrapolate that across the nation.

Also, the chart you chose shows unintentional firearm deaths for that children aged 1-13, and does not include other forms of firearm death. You linked to a chart looking at ""unintentional injuries"". 

So I suppose it depends on whether you consider school aged kids to be children. I am a little older, so I'm fine with that. A young college aged redditor may not think high schoolers are kids, but I think they are. If its good enough for the gun nuts, I suppose its good enough for me.","1362096454"

I am more interested in the ""domestic discipline"" side of things, but we've already had the discussion about it, and she just can't bring herself to try it. :(

I wouldn't enjoy the *actual* spanking itself, because it would hurt... Obviously, and it's supposed to. But what I would enjoy is the emotional release, and being able to let go of the guilt of bad behavior. I can guarantee that not only would it help our relationship with me being held accountable for misbehaving, but the threat of a spanking would make a pretty good deterrent as well. I'm not sure if your partner identifies with the situation like I do, but if so, he'd probably like being scolded, a little bit of humiliation (like standing in the corner), and being spanked for actual transgressions, not just arbitrary playtime. But if it is an actual punishment, make it count, no taking it easy! And after, lots of cuddles and forgiveness. Hope this helps!

We don't try to do it all at once. It sounds like you're on a breakneck pace for serious burnout. Listen; salvation, healing, theosis - it's a process, a process that takes longer than a lifetime. These things that you're talking about giving up are all a type of fasting - just as we fast from meat in Lent, so we fast from masturbation every day. Sometimes you're going to fail, and that's ok - it's part of the process. And the great thing about fasting is that it's nobody's business but yours and your spiritual father's.

There were some young Orthodox pilgrims visiting a monastery. They heard loud rock and roll music blaring from one of the cells. Shocked, they came closer, and saw the monk sitting outside smoking a cigarette and listening to loud rock music. Indignant, the pilgrims went to the abbott and demanded that the monk be chastised. The abbott stood up and very sternly said, ""When that monk came to us he was possessed by 30 terrible sins. These are the only two he has left. Leave us alone!""

"JusticePorn","t5_2sokh","&gt;I honestly see the difference but I seriously don't believe that one is worse for society than the other.

Your response definitively demonstrates that you either don't understand the difference, or don't understand rheus' point. In either case, you are claiming an understanding you either don't have, or are lying about not having. Troll or fool, your choice. 

&gt;Rape undermines confidence in society, it undermines the faith in the police, it undermines our faith that repeat offenders will be locked up, it costs us millions and millions annually.

Most of what you said here patently false, or irrelevant. Rape does no more damage in undermining faith in cops than does any other crime against an individual. No one expects cops to live inside a woman's pants and jump out whenever needed. People understand that interacting with others and society comes with certain risks. So that point is dumb. 

Society didn't rape anyone, an individual did. If you're not equipped to make that distinction, then you're equally unable to have confidence in society because you lack a basic understanding of a fundamental component: society. 

This babble about repeat offenders is just nonsense. Most people already have no faith in repeat offenders, but there is nothing inherent about rape or a rapist that implicates recidivism. Just stop talking out your ass, and you won't look like such a fucking idiot. I hope you understand that point. It's ok to accept your limits, that's how we grow to expand them and improve ourselves. Assuming you're smarter than you are will retard your intellectual progress. 

It costs money to lock-up rapists, yes. Rape is bad, m'kay. We punish rape SEVERELY. We stigmatize rapists, even after they pay their debt to society, as society has demanded. And it seems like you want to trivialize people willing to wrongly impose these horrible burdens on innocent individuals. Not to mention, this point about cost works against you to speak against false accusations. 

&gt;False accusations are terrible but no more life destroying than rape.
I said from the start that they should face equal sentencing.
Now, if you take the time to look through my comments, I have been polite and civil to everyone. I havent even downvoted anyone. You may disagree and that's fine, but why do you have to jump in with petty insults?

Lying about your knowledge is not civil. Offering misleading support to advance a poorly formed position just to win an argument is fucking disgraceful. What you've done here is grossly insulting. You've done little more than obscure the truth, and if I had my way, I swear to god, I would cut out your tongue for doing such a disservice to your fellow humans. The pile of shit you have produced is not civil, no matter what window dressing accompanied. There's an adage that fits in with the general tone of this reply: you can't polish a turd. 

I offered substance, you stupid piece of shit. I have continued to offer substantive replies, to pretend that I only insulted you may be consistent with your dishonest approach to arguing, but no less egregious. I litter my substance with insults because I feel they are warranted. You see, I think so lowly of you, and people like you, that I have no faith that you will take any steps towards becoming a better person: someone who doesn't spout bullshit and lies just to win an argument. I fear that you will die a sad stupid piece of shit and I've already seen that someone offering you calm reason is ineffective, but I am hopeful that by embarrassing you, you might find motivation to become less of a piece of shit. It's a long shot, no doubt. ","1362096461"

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","Any gun from 9MM to 45 will work if you can handle it confidently in a trained manner.  All modern firearms are mostly reliable, but all of them (including revolvers) can and will malfunction.  The main thing is about training.  Can you place 2 rounds center mass in an attacking target intent on killing you in less than 2.7 seconds (average gun fight) who is closing from a distance of 7-10 feet.  Can you also manage what to do when you gun goes click instead of Bang?  The other thing to consider is wardrobe.  How are you planning on carrying this tool concealed?  Make sure you're willing to adapt your choice of clothing if necessary to carry the tool you feel most competent with.  The element of surprise is worth its weight in GOLD!

I personally carry the Glock 30 .45 ACP.  I carry it because I believe it to be the weapon easiest to manipulate under stress.  My safety is my training.  I don't want pressure plates, switches, or anything else to prevent my gun from going bang when I want it to.  I chose the .45 because I know that I have to inflict major tissue and organ damage to incapacitate an attacker.  I know the penetration is key to doing so and more powder = more penetration.  I know that even after I have completely destroyed the heart, an attacker has 10-15 seconds left to continue the fight due to reserves in the body.  That's a lot of time left to kill me with and I need to know that I've caused the maximum amount of damage I can.  As long as you're using modern hollow point ammunition in a non-magnum caliber then over penetration should not be an issue for most ""adult"" targets.  Keep in mind that you intend to stop the threat NOW when you choose to use deadly force.  If they happen to die as a result of the need to stop them, well that's too bad.

Some people think that certain mechanics are unfun and change the rules to accommodate those beliefs. Others increase the resiliency of their decks. Both are completely legitimate, given that this is a casual format and the end goal is to have fun. Having said that, I will leave this debate with one last anecdote, from my own experience a few weeks ago.

It's a 4-man table: Jenara (me), Wydwen, Mayael, and I think Grimgrin. Late in the game, at the end of Grimgrin's turn, Mayael activates her ability and smacks down ol Blighty. Collective groans. I have the most threatening board presence, but I'm kind of caught with my pants down because my dudes are tapped and I don't have an instant speed answer. Oops. Wydwen player has isochron sceptor with Darkness attached to it.  Of course, Mayael swings at me. I look over at Wydwen and ask if he's going to sceptor. I get a smirk back. I should mention that I have an O-stone on the field and enough mana to pop it, so I do. Then I tell the wydwen player ""Blightsteel is about to be the only nonland on the field. I have an answer to it in hand. You sure you don't wanna hit that darkness?"" So he hits darkness, and I live. My turn I cast bribery on Mayael, thinking to steal a Duplicant. Instead, I see Sun Titan and realize I have Gilded Drake in my graveyard. Heh. So I end up with a Sun Titan and Blightsteel, pass turn. Grimgrin player throws down Karn, who eats Blightsteel.

So there you go. Blightsteel comes down EOT and swings at an open opponent. Rather than win the game, he gets fogged, then stolen, and then exiled, accomplishing absolutely nothing. ","1362096463"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Yeah, I can't tell the difference between faces. When I identify people, I go by everything about them other than their face. Most of the time, it is their hairstyle and voice. However, if I were to see one of my co-workers in public, I would probably walk by unless they said something since their hair is covered up by hats at work. 

It's not like their faces are blurry to me. Often, that's how crime TV shows will portray it. I can clearly see their faces. But as soon as I look away, what I saw was a muddled mess or I will only remember the color of their eyes or a feature on their face. Basically, I can't ""put together"" the parts of a face. You see a face, I see a narrow, almond-shaped eyes with distinct folds, light blue irises, short eyelashes, a big, pointy nose, thin lips, a mole on the left cheek,  straight hairline...everything doesn't melt together.

I didn't even know I had it. I thought it was normal to identify people by things other than faces.


I actually have a preference for cartoons or shows with reoccurring main characters and random side actors of the week instead of a huge cast. If there's too many main characters in a live-action show, I'll get lost. But even in the shows with smaller casts, it causes some trouble. For example, I love Supernatural, but if Castiel isn't in a brown trenchcoat (signature outfit), I will confuse him with Dean because the actors are the same height and have a similar hairstyle. I never confuse Sam with the other two because he is a lot taller and always has longer hair. Just because I have trouble recognizing faces doesn't mean I can't find a face attractive, though! I focus on parts, like the eyes or the smile. In another thread, I said that David Tennant only looked average to me. Well, that's because his eyes aren't attractive to me, but his hair is very nice and makes up for it. But Jensen Ackles (Dean) is very attractive because he has really nice eyes, a good smile and nice hair.

However, cartoons and CGI with stylized humans are very easy for me know who is who because the faces of the characters are stylized and abstract.","1362096465"

The plot is pretty decent, and since you already know Claude and Catalina you'll be more interested and knowledgeable of it. Gangs and organized crime are very prominent in the story and plot. Mechanics are alright, but since you've played VC and SA you should be familiar with the controls and driving. Radio stations are good; I much prefer Lazlo in this game than in GTA IV (in III he's one of the few sane normal people who ever speak on his hilarious talk show).

If you do end up playing GTA III, I recommend starting by stealing a taxi and doing a bunch of taxi missions. This is very useful for getting to know the layout of the city. I'd also recommend doing the very difficult ambulance missions early on, before [you have gangs shooting you on sight](/spoiler). This is because the reward for completing the 12th level of the ambulance mission is the ability to run indefinitely.

I've played GTA III on Android, and the control scheme is the same as the one used for VC on Android. Works well when using the touchscreen controls, not so well with a ps3 controller (I have to use the left analog stick while on foot and the d-pad while driving). This is because there is apparently no native support for controllers.","1362096466"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not my story.  
  
I moved around a lot growing up.  One of the many high schools I went to I made two friends; FriendA and FriendB.  One night FriendA and I were drinking and he confided in me.  His home life was pretty crap.  So he stayed the night a lot with FriendB.  FriendB lived with his mom and his dad that travelled a lot for work.  Basically gone 3 or 4 days out of the week, then home the rest.  
  
FriendB’s mom would take sleeping medicine.  It would knock her out.  She’d announce that she’s taking it and going to bed to make sure FriendB didn’t need anything.  He’d always say nope, they were good.  One night FriendA woke up and FriendB was gone.  He walked out to use the restroom and heard something from the other room.  FriendB’s mothers room.  He peeked in and saw FriendB doing his mom while she was out cold.  
  
He also told me that he woke up one time with FriendB sucking his dick.  FriendA said it freaked him out but felt really good.  FriendB didn’t notice he was awake and FriendA even said he debated saying anything since he was getting close.  But he did speak up, and asked FriendB what he was doing.  FriendB said that he was curious and that’s all.  Then he offered up his mom if FriendA wanted to finish off into her.  
  
FriendA took a really big drink and then told me he did.  He said that he and FriendB took turns on his mom.  He hadn’t stayed the night since.  He was pretty fucked in the head over both events.  First, he liked the blow job FriendB gave him and was freaked out he may be gay, especially since he wanted him to do it again.  And secondly, he wanted to take another ride on FriendB’s mom.  This freaked him out too.  
  
We moved probably a month later, to the other side of the country, and I’ve never had contact with any of them since.

As an actor, you need not stick with them necessarily, but you can star with them. Look at local film schools and ask about casting calls for student films. Students are going to give you a chance that an established director is less likely too. It's not about talent or skill, but rather about building a body of work. Make a few shorts, maybe find a friend who wants to direct and have them shoot a scene with you in it. Cut together your best moments and you will have what you need. Agents want people who can book gigs and well paying ones. They won't rep you or send you out unless they know what you can do, and can see your range.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;To all those highly talented bankers in Europe, let me be the first to welcome you to the United States, Singapore, Canada, Hong Kong, or wherever you decide to move.

They won't move. They'll probably go to hedge funds. Which is fine. That's the whole point of this exercise.  For the last few years, banks profits have been pumped up by a very small amount of employees in their trading departments working with complex financial instruments, and motivated by giant bonuses, while the other thousands of workers working in normal banking areas missed out. This was one of the main causes of the financial crisis. Capping bonuses will mean several things:

1. If the investment people go to hedge funds, banks will need to make money from traditional areas - mortgages, business and personal loans, financing etc. This means pumping money into the real economy, and making use of the majority of the workers not involved in high risk instruments.  

2. If they want to keep their traders with bonuses, then they'll need to separate the investment and retail parts of the bank, something which was previously the case. 

3. They could also focus more on longer term incentives, rather than reward short term, high risk activities. 

  
The basic premise is to remove the rewards for excessive risk taking behavior on commercial and retail banking, thus separating the high risk financial sector from the banking sector servicing the real economy.

Smoke smell sucks and it understandably upsets customers that rent the cars, but to say it affects the resale value is simply not true.

Edit: I also don't think it's fair to make a parent give up their child just because they can't afford something most parents will never have to grapple with - especially when it's out of their control. For most people, raising a child to 18 doesn't cost as much (total) as a bill for 3-4 months of care to a premature baby. They have an unexpected thing befall them so they have to give their child up?  Why don't we focus on helping these kinds of parents pay for their children to survive instead of separating parents who otherwise would have no problem paying for a healthy baby? That goes for parents of disabled kids as well.  My comment was more an illustration of why some people just can't afford to keep a preemie alive, which would render it non viable (without medical care). We should expand resources to help these parents keep their children alive.","1362096480"

"NewSkaters","t5_2tqri","Note: in the skateboarding world, turning heelside is called ""frontside"" (from surfing). Conversely, turning toeside is called ""backside"". To remember, imagine what part of your body points up if you were to do a turn to toeside on a vert ramp. Hint: it's your ass. AKA ""backside"".

To kickturns: I know the feeling. I've been skating since the late 80s, and still can't manage a decent 180 degree frontside (to heelside) kickturn on transition. BUT I'M WORKING ON IT! I can do them just fine on flatground though, so I'll tell you what I find helps me when I'm trying frontside turns on trans because I'm pretty in tune with that challenge.

1. Wind up your upper body first. You're going to want your body rotating frontside, so turn your upper body slightly backside (towards the tail) and then when you unwind, keep turning and lift the nose, so that your whole body and board turn frontside.

2. Turn your head A LOT. Spot your ""landing"" i.e. where you want your front wheels to finish. With backside kickturns it's easy - you just look down in front of your back foot and think ""there!"", but with frontside turns that spot is behind you. So crane your neck right around over your front shoulder and spot that place. If you're also doing step 1, you'd do your neck twisting as your upper body unwinds. e.g. Wind back, start unwinding, crane neck around, continue untwisting.

3. Lean back (just a little bit). This is the mildly terrifying part, because you might feel like you're about to fall down on your ass. Trust your back wheels not to slide out, and have your bodyweight inside the turn, otherwise you'll topple forwards off the board to the outside of the turn.

4. Exaggerate arm movements. Use your arms as levers or flyweights or whatever. When you wind up in step 1, wind your arms around you so that you can unwind them and then steal back momentum from them to help twist your body. You'll look like a doofus doing these big overdramatic body movements to just do a little turn, at first, but once you get it working for you, you can dial back the exaggeration. It's fine to look like a beginner when you are, in fact, a beginner.

I hope this helps. Keep practicing. Little turns (like 30 degrees) at first will lead to 45 and 60 and 90 and 90+ and 180 and freestyle continuous spinning and short shorts/long socks and eventually you'll be Rodney Mullen.","1362096482"

I said no such thing, I said the drivers actions would be the exact same in each case, and therefore it's the same culpability and crime on his part.  It boggles my mind that you, and others, think the number of victims should make a difference.  That makes sense in the case of a premeditated murder, but in the case of an accident it's just bad luck to hit a car full of passengers.  If you are speeding and drunk and ram another car, your actions are what make it a crime, it's not more of a crime if it was a car full of sleeping babies.  Your logic is in part what leads people to drive like him, they decide that the odds are they'll make it home without incident.  They realize that the chances of them t-boning a car full of football players are extremely small, so they roll the dice.  Their crime isn't who they hit, it's that they choose to roll the dice with other people's lives at stake.  Personally, I think that if he had hit a tree, he should be treated the same.     
   
&gt; Negligent homicide is still homicide.   
   
So?  You're making silly points now, are you suggesting that premeditated murder is the same thing as manslaughter?    
   
&gt; At least five years per death.   
   
Thank you for answering.  I've already said why I don't think the ""per death"" sentencing in this instance would be fair, but I don't think 20 years would necessarily be unjust.

Exactly.  This is what should happen.

That's the best part of it to me, it's the truth too..  Evans was a great player for us, I was upset when they let him go. Only the diehard fans will remember how clutch he could be when they brought him on the field in his final season with us. It's not going to standout by looking at his stats for that year but if you remember the games he actually showed some brilliance.  Very underrated player, he did well in New Orleans though for the role he had but I just wish we could've kept him another year or two.

Easy to say that when we already know what they found out.


&gt; What I'm saying is simply that scientific research has a cost, and I am perfectly willing to pay that cost to further scientific research.


You are paying no cost, the rats are. Perhaps you consider that the benefit brought by the suffering of those mammals is justified. You can't deny that the benefits brought by scientific research using a black, uneducated, unemployed and handicapped person as guinea pig would be far more significant than using rats. Instead of opening the head of those rats and connecting them, we could have done that with those people I mentioned; the results would be far, far more useful and groundbreaking. Some people would say that this would be justified, and would benefit society as a whole, outweighing the will of those ""useless"" members of society; a *cost* the employed, white and educated people are willing to pay. Just as for you it is ok to use animals for the sake of science, for others it would be ok to use convict prisoners or mentally retarded people for the sake of science; costs *are* justified. Perhaps you consider that barbaric. So does the individual you replied to consider when done to mammals.

Every year they have a joint birthday party because they know eachother really well. Last year i got to attend a party with hayabusa and i got to meet him.

You seem to be missing my point. The universe is what it is -- and what it is, is relatively orderly. Theres no changing this. Whether or not its creator is good or evil would not change this in any way, shape, or form. After all, evil can sometimes do things correctly, can it not?

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","It is possible to get a decent supply of emeralds by trading with villagers but it takes a lot of work. The idea is that I would consider the time and energy put into trading with villagers for emeralds (without the use of a breeding cell to hoard them) as money earned by the player. Since most or all players on my server would have things to sell, the emeralds would go back and forth.

[For example:](http://youtu.be/b9ADLBbpQTQ)

At one time I needed a lot of Jungle Wood Logs and didn't want to cut down the jungle near my base because I enjoyed seeing the natural beauty of the biome from where I was building. I agreed to pay 16 emeralds for a stack of Jungle Logs and the next day there was a chest full of Jungle logs for me that another player had taken the time to put together. I know that 16 emeralds sounds like a lot but at the time I was much farther along on the server than the other players and I was hoping that I could entice the other players with such an outlandish offer in order to get the emeralds circulating to encourage other players to make similar requests.

That said, maybe 4 emeralds is too high. Perhaps 1 emerald for 64 dirt blocks would be better. Using hoppers the shop keeper could easily make a huge supply trickle into the shop even if someone, like myself, comes in with a stack of emeralds to spend.

not enough to matter from a practical standpoint.  Is it ONLY water?  No.  Is there enough purification happening through sweat to actually be able to make the claim that sweating is a viable form of detox?  No.

&gt;I don't know exactly what's in there, but it might as well be toxins.   I feel better when it's gone

That's some bad logic.  It might as well not be toxins, too, and feeling better after exercise doesn't mean you detoxed through sweating. 

&gt;Thinking critically is one thing,

You're throwing critical thinking out of the window to agree with a claim you feel must be true despite an absence of actual evidence.  It's good to have an open mind but you need to have some sort of critical thinking otherwise you'll believe anything with a weak claim behind it.

&gt;The 'scientific' argument, that sweat is mostly water, or that no component of sweat carries wastes away, isn't very scientific.

Based on what scientific evidence otherwise?  (and it's not that no component of sweat carries wastes away, it's that the amount is so small it is of no practical significance)

http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/28/health/he-skeptic28

&gt;Sweat does contain trace amounts of toxins, says Dr. Dee Anna Glaser, a professor of dermatology at St. Louis University and founding member of the International Hyperhidrosis Society, a medical group dedicated to the study and treatment of heavy sweating.

&gt;But, Glaser, adds, in the big picture, sweat has only one function: Cooling you down when you overheat. ""Sweating for the sake of sweating has no benefits,"" she says. ""Sweating heavily is not going to release a lot of toxins.""

&gt;In fact, Glaser says, heavy sweating can impair your body's natural detoxification system. As she explains, the liver and kidneys -- not the sweat glands -- are the organs we count on to filter toxins from our blood. If you don't drink enough water to compensate for a good sweat, dehydration could stress the kidneys and keep them from doing their job. ""If you're not careful, heavy sweating can be a bad thing,"" she says.

So a professor of dermatology and founding member of a group that studies sweating says that there are a negligible amount of toxins in sweat.  Go back to ""I don't know exactly what's in there"" - do you think she does?

&gt;Sweating definitely won't help clear the body of mercury or other metals, says Donald Smith, a professor of environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz, who studies treatments for metal poisoning. Almost all toxic metals in the body are excreted through urine or feces, he says. And less than 1% are lost through sweat. In other words, you'll do far more detoxifying in the bathroom than you ever could in a sauna.

And then a professor who studies metal poisoning says less than 1% of toxic metals are lost through sweat.

edit: http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/inkyh/why_do_we_sweat_more_from_our_armpits/

&gt;Sweat does contain trace amounts of ""toxins"" (trace metals, lymph, etc.) that come from the lymph nodes located around your armpit, but sweating does not remove any meaningful amount of toxin. You cannot rid yourself of free radicals by sitting in a 130F sauna for a few hours.

and

&gt;Sweating out toxins is one of those instances where a tiny statement like ""there is a small small small small amount of ""toxins"" in your sweat"" is taken out of context and hyperbolized to the point where people sit in a sauna all day trying to detox. Detox is not the function of sweat.","1362096506"

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","Well, I've had a few friends have some experiences, so here we go:

A.) Friend lives out in the country and goes to a small public school filled with rednecks and country kids.  Naturally, hunting is a really big thing out there and a lot of the kids go hunting before school or after school on Fridays.  So, some of them are dumb enough to bring their guns in their trucks to school and leave them in the backseat, visible to anyone peering in.  

My friend drives to school in his truck and has a gun in the backseat so he can go hunting after school.  He gets called to the office and suspended for 5 day, his reaction was, ""sweet, I get to hunt for five days"".  Parents really didn't do much about it.

It really isn't that uncommon out there because almost all of the students hunt and the sentiment towards guns is hunting, not shooting up kids.  Heck, if you go to a school with a few rednecks or country boys in it, chances are quite a few cars have guns stashed in them.

B.) This is personal experience, one time our school had a bomb threat.  These are usually MUCH more prone to be complete BS or duds.  It's very hard to make a bomb, let alone enough bombs to spread throughout a 100 classroom building.  We just went to a secure location and they took care of it.  In another case, a teacher of mine had an incident where after 9/11 a kid would keep calling in bomb threats from a payphone, and because it was untraceable, he continually did it and they had to call off school because of all the bogus threats.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;So why is this thread being flooded with people saying she is a lying whore? 

In this thread the only person I can find using the word whore is actually another comment of yours. 


&gt;Why are most of the comments about false rape accusations and how women are liars? 

The inconclusive nature of the case lends itself to debate on the subject of rape accusations, both genuine &amp; false. What's often referred to as ""spousal rape"" is far from a clear-cut subject.

As for why some people suspect she's lying, I've seen a variety of viewpoints expressed here. 

&gt;Why are most of the commenters assuming she is lying

I'm just not seeing this, most commenters don't seem to have made a decision in either direction. 

&gt;when MANY more people, male and female, are raped than are accused of false rape? I don't understand.

Part of it is differing views. Some view false accusations as happening anywhere from 2-10% of the time

Others feel that false accusation rates could be far higher in some areas/circumstances, and point to some studies that found ~40% of accusations to be false among small sample areas ([the article referenced here discusses a few](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/19ecur/university_of_north_carolina_is_threatening_to/c8nh97v))

Personally, I feel there is a serious lack of quality data on the frequency of both rape &amp; false rape accusations. Both sides have their statistics of choice, and neither really tells the full story. (I cringe every time I see someone mention that the USA has 18x more rape than India does per capita)

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","Okay, I am ready to review:

1. I like your voice a lot. Good diction and reflection.

2. Your intro is Hey Everybody, I'm back,  but remember you need to focus on new viewers as well as old, so perhaps tell me what your playing if I just dropped into the vid. Like ""Hey everyone I'm back with some more GAME NAME. Last time we blah blah blah"" Or something unique to your style. Just dropping me into things leaves me not know what is happening. Also from a branding standpoint mentioning your name in the intro is good: Hey everyone, SuicidePrinny here, and I'm back...etc...

3. Audio levels are really good! The game is not too quiet and your voice is not too loud. The only tip is that auto ducking would work well here. It lowers game audio automatically when you speak. It is a feature of audacity. Google information on it.

4. Your uploading in 720p, good job.

5. I am not a fan of a lot of cursing, so I'd cut that down a smidge. Also, think that someone may be listening to you without headphones and you do not want that coming out of their speakers. That's just me though, I have a potty mouth offline. Just not in my vids.

6. You are very personable in style and you really come off friendly.

7. You may take the slow parts as time to mention something of interest about the game or about you, even (in moderation).

8. The video ending is very abrupt. It just stops. I am a big proponent of outros. They give the viewer something more to watch. Study up on outros and what you could do to add your videos. **If someone has reached the end of your video, then give them more as a reward.**

9. So I've watched your video. I like it. I want to know more about you - if you're on twitter, or if you have a facebook page or a website. Don't make me go hunting for this info, put it in the description! Put a subscribe link! People really don't maximize the power of the description box.

10. If you have done the hard work of getting some to your video, then to watch it, then sit all the way through, don't just leave them hanging there! Give them more, give them someway to connect, greet them in your outro, something!


11. You are not using all the keyword tags you can use. Fill up that entire box. The tags you have are pretty good, though! Tagging is hard at first, you have really think to come up with the many relevant keywords.

12. Your channel tags and descriptions are really weak. So much potential to pack both those with keywords and you are not using all the great marketing space. 1000 characters for your description box to fill with relevant information that can help your channel be found.

13. Your background is cut off on my 15"" laptop monitor. Also, are you suicide prinny or limited potential studios? Branding should be SOLID SOLID SOLID throughout. If I forget your name later on, but want to find you again, do not confuse me on your name.  Brand the heck out of your thumbnails. See Nerd^3 or my channel for an example. So if I see a thumbnail of yours later on, I'll go, oh yeah, there's that guy I like! And click it.

14. On twitter, you are Andrew Brinkley, so what is it now? Prinny, or Brinkley? Or who? Do not give me so much to remember. I do it simple:

TheJessaChannel that is my handle EVERYWHERE. No confusion.

And when you tweet someone as Andrew Brinkley, they are like who da fuq is that? But when I tweet someone, it is clear as day who I am and what I am about. And it sticks in your head.

You are making yourself EASY to forget. Decide on a brand and build the fuck outta it.

Understand?

Good luck.

Doing it this way will waste a little power with the delta-V over the resistor, but I doubt it will be much since the current should be really low, meaning R will be comparatively large, making the power dissipated across R [P (in watts) = V^2 /R = 4.84 / R] fairly small.

Combined with the ability to teleport through walls like a boss, this is the ultimate hit and run class.  Since it basically hits any enemies within it's charge area, you can hit mooks two or three times in a clumped group (This class is best used in Glacier, like the Fury).  It's also great for repeatedly striking clumps of big enemies.  You can do a combined amount of like, 5K damage if you hit three or four enemies with your strike.  

This also makes a better AOE Primer's detonator, since the strike (I think) has no limit for hitting enemies.  Combined with area reave, this class is devastating.  

The heavy melee is one of my favorite things about this class, combined with the teleporting of everything.  But it doesn't 1HK like it should, I feel.  I can't 1HK mauraders on silver for some reason, even with max melee and martial artist + 25% from the shotgun bayonet.

Valve has , in its entire history, made about a third of the games that EA publishes in just a single year.  

EA has published 74 games in 2012.  Out of those, its easy to find something to dislike.  Some games here people love a great deal, some games that they looked forward to were not as good as they hoped. And then we just bitch eternally about it.

"wow","t5_2qio8","I'm having this exact same issue. I'm leveling multiple characters in this bracket. My best advice is:
 
1) Only play a character if (s)he is rested. Then jump to another and keep cycling through them. If none of your characters are rested, start another alt or play your main for a while. Rested greatly decreases the required play time for each character. Avoiding the character if you're not rested provides you with a break. If you don't have it, I highly suggest you grab [Altoholic](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/altoholic). It tracks if your character is rested or not.

2) Grab the [Darkmoon Faire buff](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46668) if the faire is in town.

3) Buy a [Battle Standard of Coordination](http://www.wowhead.com/item=64399). Plop this down in dungeons or while grinding if there is a high concentration of mobs you're going to be farming.

It could be as simple as being required to wear the collar to bed and make Dom breakfast in the morning. Failure could be punishable sexually, or the reward could be sexual.

"keto","t5_2rske","Just wanted to comment, coming from a studying nutritionist(just started my senior year)

Keto diets are effective at losing fat, as you're essentially putting your body into ""starvation mode."" But this is diet can ultimately be very unhealthy for your body in the long run.

Ketones are acidic, and causing your body to produce large amounts of them can cause the pH of your blood to drop, causing a condition called ketoacidosis (this was mentioned in the first paragraph).

Ketoacidosis can have very negative effects on your body. One of the worst effects is the catabolism of your bones, as Calcium Carbonate(what your bones are mostly made of) is used as a buffer by your body to regulate the pH of your blood. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis (just a wiki link in-case anyone is interested)

Ultimately the Keto diet, is another fad diet that will probably die out for the next. 

My advice as a nutritionist is that the first step is coming to terms that fad diets are what they are... fads, and that if you want to lose weight and keep it off, then the first thing that has to change is your lifestyle, and it has to change forever.","1362096526"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Yeah it's a good debate and I think one of the few ones that WLC has lost. I also have a lot of sympathy for contractarianism.

Contractarism can also be used as follows to give a good answer to the OP's question. We start with John Searle, who in [this paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/2183201.pdf) gives the following conterexample to Hume's Law:

&gt;(1) Jones uttered the words ""I hereby promise to pay you, 
Smith, five dollars."" [an 'is' statement]

&gt;(2) Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars. 

&gt;(3) Jones placed himself under (undertook) an obligation 
to pay Smith five dollars. 

&gt;(4) Jones is under an obligation to pay Smith five dollars. 

&gt;(5) Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars.  

Now assuming that this is a good counterexample, what makes it so? It works because the act of promise making carries with it a contractual obligation to keep the promise. We can similarly argue that if Jones signs a legal or business contract he is obligated to follow that contract. 

Contractarianism allows us to generalise this argument to cover a wide range of behaviours via it's application of the social contract. When Jones is in a community operating under a social contract all his actions will have bundled with them certain obligations as laid down by the contract. We thus have a sequence of steps something like this.

1. Jones agreed to the social contract 
2. Jones placed himself under an obligation to follow the social contract (follows from (1) as *that's how contracts work*)
3. Jones is under an obligation to follow the contract
4. Jones ought to follow the contract

With (4) established we have our goal that OP required, we can now judge Jones' actions against the dictates of the contract. To go beyond this an establish the *objectivity* of such judgements we have to argue what the contract objectively ought to be. To do this we might appeal to the theory laid out in John Rawls' [*A Theory of Justice*](http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Justice-Original-John-Rawls/dp/0674017722). 

This argument of course has a number of weak points in it, but I still find it rather impressive in the bridge it builds between 'is' and 'ought'.

I posted this piece on TalkClassical too, and some of the composers there were nice enough to offer to show the work to some string players to get feedback for me, so hopefully that will prove helpful :). I don't think you can really get definitive feedback on a work until some players actually sit down and try to play through it, but I think it's better to get broad feedback and try to refine things as much as possible before you ask them to do that.

Part of me thinks so. I wouldn't say a single *type* of car, though. A 1960s Ford GT, for example, shouldn't all be locked up in a museum--there were north of 100 of them produced over the years.

Having people rent seeking on homes does nothing good for the economy either.  People with disposable income making home ownership unaffordable or much less affordable for those with less income has zero net benefit for society.

Buying with the intent to have a property sit empty until the market increases enough that you can turn a proft, and doing this on several properties, is an asinine way to make money.

More recently, I wanted to experience a beach body for the first time in my life. I've always just maintained 15% body fat. I started keto because I'm very lazy when it comes to counting calories and macros, so it seemed like the simplest way to go about it. 

It has blown my mind how effective this has been. ","1362096551"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Do you know how rare and tough that is? To break up with someone and be able to have a stable enough relationship with them to be able to have a stable relationship with their child? You realize he's only 4 right? That most the emotional trauma and blaming themselves will start later on in life. When the bullies ridicule him for it. When he can actually realize that his parents are actually together. He may be a special case and be a great father, but that doesn't mean that every person this happens to can do this. Otherwise this wouldn't be such a problem and people wouldn't marry to avoid it. Whether it's the mother, the father or their SO that eventually puts a strain on the parent's relationship with his father, external factors can cause more problems. Yes you have one example of a guy being a great father. Let me show you examples of how bad the opposite can go.

I have a friend who until the age of 17 hated her father. Why? Because she never knew him. Not because he didn't reach out to her. No. He apparently took her mom to court to even try to get custody on her but, he apparently had another child with another woman that he was not with, so they ruled against him. Now she's 21 with 4 kids and she finally knows her father but her life was rough and she was such an emotional wreck because she thought she caused her dad to run out on her mom and her mom never told her the truth.

I have another friend who was raised by a single father. He always wondered why his mom left. The kids in our neighborhood who didn't like him would always make fun of him for not having a mom and this caused him to get into lots of fights. He just found out last year that he was the product of a one night stand and his mom decided that if she couldn't marry his father, then his father could just have him and she left without ever coming back. To this day, he still hasn't met his mother and feels responsible for that. His father is a good father, but the kid is a great basketball player. If he hadn't have gotten into so much trouble in the streets and turned to weed to solve his problem, he could have probably been in the NBA. That's my opinion though.

I could go on with more personal stories, but that doesn't prove me right, or you wrong. It's just examples of how it can turn out. Not everybody is ready to be a parent when a kid is born and some run out. Shit, that's people's favorite thing to say about my race(Black). Being not married and having a kid together is tough for some. They don't feel the commitment and may run. They may not get along with the other parent, so that may be their reason for leaving. So many factors.

TL:DR; You make it sound simple, but taking care of a kid with a person you don't care about may be hard. Their SO/family or some external factor may make it hard and strenuous to continue trying. Your kid may still suffer emotionally from the fact that their parents are not together. This is before you even include the societal expectations of marriage when you have a child.","1362096555"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Went to a play in NYC called Sleep No More. It was/is an adaptation of Macbeth that takes place in a 5 story hotel. You would walk into this hotel lobby right out of the 20's, completed with live jazz and flappers, and you're handed a playing card. Eventually, you are given a mask after being put into groups by suit, and sent up an elevator, into the top floor of the hotel. You are left free to walk around as you please, and touch/interact with anything you like(drawers, books, pianos, etc...), provided you do not remove your mask, and do not talk. The actors interact with you as they please. The place is at the same time a fucking nightmare and the coolest fucking thing ever. 5 different and independent floors of macabre metaphorical Macbeth. I walked in on everything from a wild dance of abortion between a Bellhop, maid, and pregnant woman, to the actor playing Macbeth, who was covered in blood, having some hot, very rough sex with his Lady. The pathways between floors are always changing, new doors being opened to new creepy shit. There's rumored to be an orgy room.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","**High Priest**: super beast against aggro, decent against midrange (who the hell wants to trade Huntmaster/Smiter/Reckoner/Silverblade Paladin/any ground dorks for this dude?), and serviceable against control (notice that you can use him + Temblor/Olivia to off PWs/DSpheres/etc.).  Basically he's an all around solid creature (better than the Surgeon) because they can't even burn him down.  He's like Reckoner 5-8 (okay, not quite that good but up there).  

**Rolling Temblor**: I would say this is one of the top 5 best cards in the deck.  Basically with the popularity of Burning-Tree Emissary, this card says ""nope"" after their sequence of T2 plays.  It also has *insane* synergy with High Priest and Reckoner.  The deck can (and has done) a curve of High Priest into Reckoner into Temblor kill everything on opposing side.  It also has Flashback so you don't mind just throwing this out there on T3 when they have 2-3 x/2s to slow them down before throwing down Liliana/Sorin/Reckoner/etc.

**Boros Keyrune**: My main reason for splitting it up is for the colored mana.  The deck is main Black so the mana base is mainly B/x lands.  Sometimes you just want the W to cast a T4 Obzedat.  After 1 Sorin Emblem, it scales about the same as Rakdos Keyrune and at 2+ Emblems, this card is ridic.

**Staff of Nin**: this card gets boarded out a lot in my super aggressive Meta (a BOATLOAD of Frog in a Blender, Super Naya, Red/x Aggro, etc.) so I don't mind running only one.  My current dilemma is whether to cut Rakdos's Return for the 2nd one (another card I board out in that matchup).

**Boros Reckoner** is easily the best card in the deck (no kidding right?).  It is the best man on defensive and allows the deck to do some potentially bonkers play (T3 Reckoner, T4 Temblor your field + Shock you + hit for 3).  The 2nd best card is a tossup between Olivia and Obzedat.  I'm sure you know how nuts old Ghostie is but Olivia is on another level of insane against any Midrange decks (provided you don't just toss her out willy nilly and get Searing Speared).  There is almost nothing that can kill her currently while Ghostie can still get Victim of Night'd.

Currently, the potential cuts in the deck are probably some Lingering Souls and Rakdos's Return.  Souls just gets eaten up by Rancor/Thundermaw/Staticaster/DSphere and I end up siding 2-3 out a lot except vs Esper where you want to be super grindy.  It's hard to cut though since it is a superb card, just meh in current meta.  ","1362096565"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt; &gt; but that it was not an ""idea"", not something we can choose.

&gt; Why not? I'm sure we could if we wanted to. How much better off that way we would be I don't know.

Because of what I explained. Different cultures develop all the time. Being accepting of other cultures is a necessary trait (that can be learned) if you don't want to be in some form of dispute all the time. Being welcoming of other cultures on the other hand, offers you an advantage over those that are not, intellectually as well as economically.

&gt; your body can subconsciously pick up on subtle differences in appearance that would indicate a genetic difference.

Nope, your body can do no such thing, it is your mind that does that, and that behaviour is learned. There's however some evidence of the olfactory sense being able to indicate genetic compatibility for creating offspring, but that relates to mating and is very individual. And if that were race related, I wouldn't have had the hots for the scent of my asian roommate.

&gt; I think if there weren't any 'black communities' or 'white communities' and people were distributed evenly by race, religion, and class we would have virtually no difference in culture at a large scale

No, there'd be massive differences. As I explained, what makes us different in our own eyes is learned. You could find a racially diverse group of people not reacting in any way towards their individual racial differences, as well as a racially homogenous group, beating at each other due to politics or religion.

That the brain takes a shortcut for recognizing differences in people is something that is *easily* overcome by normal education and tolerant upbringing.

Racism on the other hand (including that segregation and human biodiversity figleaf bullshit) is giving in to the first impulse of a bad upbringing, and not recognizing it as a personality flaw makes you incredibly weak. 

A feeling of superiority or exclusivity should never be a lie, as it will put you at a bad and continuous strategical and economical disadvantage in life.","1362096566"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;there is no political will to pay any attention to fiscal policy except when the deficit is large.

In US history we've accumulated federal debt for 3 things: War, economic crisis, and sustained high trade deficits. [Chart](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Publicly_Held_Federal_Debt_1790-2012.png/800px-Publicly_Held_Federal_Debt_1790-2012.png)

Focusing on the fiscal debt *now* is simply the wrong focus to have. It's more of a political issue than an economic one.

Most of our fiscal debt (and private too) was acquired over the last 30 years to compensate for our trade deficit. If/when that issue is solved, higher employment and economic growth will make the fiscal debt easy to manage.  

Sure, it's quite large now... and it was very poor economic policy to have accumulated it for no good reason. But the interest rates indicate that it is not yet at a crisis level. At any rate the *private* debt we've accumulated dwarfs the public debt. And that one is being reduced, by necessity.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","They actually *did* try to change the tales quite a bit.  A good amount of scholars have gone so far as to call it ""fakelore"" (see Alan Dundes specifically for this). This is because these tales were not sensible to Christian values, and the Grimms wanted children to grow up to be good Christians.

They changed the women to be more subservient and even worked very hard to remove active roles of women in the tales (read ""Aschenputtel"" (Kinder- und Hausmärchen 21) from the first version, then read the last version they released).  For more information on general changes, you can also read Jack Zipes, since Dundes is a little bit controversial.

Furthermore, the fairy tales coming from ""lower class people"" is a myth, actually.  Most of the women that they interviewed were in the middle class.  As far as I know, only Dorothea Viehmann was from a peasant family (interestingly enough, she uses the most female agency in her tales).  For more information on this, read...

Her Pokémon at home include Abra, Snorlax, Cyndaquil, Swinub, Makuhita, and Skitty. All the Pokémon share the fact that they all have squinted eyes, which influenced Lucy to later develop an interest in Brock. Their battle extent is not known, as it seems they are only used as pets.""

That atheists, agnostics, and non-religious others support Democrats and select features of the Democratic platform does not make them Democrats.

Preponderance, tendency, and congruence =/= party affiliation or identity.

Least of all does it mean ""most"" atheists are Democrats. Their may be many millions of atheists are below the voting age; are not registered to vote; are not eligible to vote; actively choose not to vote/ register; are registered but politically unaffiliated; or are some other status which means they're not Democrats (i.e., they're libertarians, socialists, communists, etc., and are not registered as Dems).

Conventional American practice has been circumcision without even EMLA.  *See* [Lander et al. *Comparison of Ring Block, Dorsal Penile Nerve Block, and Topical Anesthesia for Neonatal Circumcision*, 278 Journal of the American Medical Association 2157 (1997)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9417009).  My understanding is that that's started to change in the last decade.  Furthermore, EMLA is the least effective of several pain-management techniques.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Throwaway for this:

This is about ""I never"" btw, not ""Truth or dare"" but here it goes:

When I was around 17-19 I had this really cool thing going (or at least I thought it was cool), that whenever I ate a girl out I'd add a lollipop (the confectionery, not my dick) to the equation.

None of the girls ever complained which obviously made me think that I was the greatest cunnilingologist under the sun and that my lollipop-thing was the new Kamasutra.

At some point I met that really awesome girl and you guessed it, I used the lollipop strategy once again for old times sake.
She enjoyed it tremendously and asked me to do it whenever I ate her out.

Some time later (the ""relationship"" was maybe a month old at that point) my friends and I went to a festival and because we had a spare ticket I asked the girl to join us.
So one evening we were sitting around the fire, beer, bbq, etc. when someone started a round of good ol' ""I never"" and when it was the girl's turn she made the mistake to say ""I never received oral sex that included the usage of a lollipop"".

I'll never forget the tone of her voice and the ""it's our sexy secret thing""-look in her eyes when she uttered that fateful sentence.

I'll also never forget how her facial expressions changed when 6-7 girls started drinking their beers simultaniously.

**TL;DR I'm a whore.**

I think you don't understand the point of a dyno.  It is a tool used to characterize engine output and AFR, so you can diagnose, tune, and make adjustments to your current setup.  Then you run ANOTHER dyno and keep adjusting until your tuner is happy.  Often times the last step is to give yourself a safety bump at a minimal sacrifice of power.  You need to dyno many times throughout the process, not just once at the end so you can show off numbers.  

If you think dyno is just the last step in the game you're doing it VERY wrong.  Seeing someone with a modified forced induction motor NOT doing dynos along the way is cringe-worthy to most of us.","1362096603"

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","Personally, I think there's a distinct possibility that the ""Empire"" won't be involved in the war. It's entirely possible that the Empire is completely dissolved, and some sort of treaty is forged between Hammerfell, High Rock, Skyrim, and Cyrodiil. An alliance against the Thalmor, but not a unified Empire in the true sense of the word. After the events of the Red Year, Morrowind will likely remain neutral, if any support is provided it will be minimal, and they will align against the Thalmor.

There's pros and cons to each side. On the one hand, the Thalmor are primarily made up of the most magically gifted of all the races. They also have the Khajiit, well-known to be fearsome warriors, especially when considering the 20 or so sub-types, some of which are large enough to use as steeds (Senche, Senche-Raht). There are also subtypes that are magically gifted, although not to the level of the Altmer. This leaves the Bosmer, who are great archers and fairly good warriors, but must also cannibalize anything they kill. However, if the Thalmor were truly behind the disappearance of Masser and Secunda (and the moons' return), it's safe to say they have access to some Dawn Magicks, and there's no telling what else they have under their sleeve.

Men have their own magic-users, the Bretons. The Redguard are also mildly fond of destruction magic, but prefer head to head combat. The Nords are well known as fearsome warriors, and Imperials are no slouches either. It's also conceivable that (if the war happens within a reasonable period of time) they have the Dragonborn on their side. An immensely powerful Warrior (or archer, or mage, etc) with the Thu'um. The Dragonborn can clear out Dwemer ruins single handedly, where entire contingents of men have failed.

However, all the weapons and training more than likely aren't going to matter, as the war will be decided by some sort of event that occurs outside of major battles and war in the traditional sense of the word. it can be reasonably assumed that it will involve the Dragonborn, but it also may not.","1362096612"

"keto","t5_2rske","Usually the increase in risk on keto are due to the higher protein intake (uric acid from the protein, and increased calcium excretion in urine) and the increased acidity from excreting ketones. Eating vegetables (reduces acidity, can lower calcium excretion) and drinking enough water (reduces acidity, and dilutes the urine) counters this.

Longer discussion in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/12kzy2/post_induction_questions/c6vzq3b), here's the ""what can I do to avoid kidney stones?""-part:

---

The simplest way is probably to just buy pH test strips and see what your urine pH level is at, then increase vegetable intake until urine pH increased to around 6-7, at that level uric acid stones dissolve in 2-6 months:

&gt; On the contrary after 6 weeks of potassium citrate/bicarbonate treatment, complete stone dissolution was found in three of the patients. In the other five cases a partial dissolution was observed and in two of them complete dissolution of the stone was achieved after prolongation of the treatment for 4 and 6 month respectively.

*Trinchieri A, et al.* [""Dissolution of radiolucent renal stones by oral alkalinization with potassium citrate/potassium bicarbonate""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19911683) *Arch Ital Urol Androl. 2009 Sep;81(3):188-91.*

In the above study they used heavy doses of potassium citrate (4 grams) and potassium bicarbonate (2 grams), those levels are likely not recommended without consulting your doctor first. [Calcium oxalate stones seem to be affected by urine pH levels of 6-7 too](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6793122) (didn't see any human studies on this).","1362096629"

Now, the best part.  The more volume of food in your stomach, the longer it takes THC  to reach your blood stream.  This can result in either becoming medicated long after the desired effect, or not being able to achieve a suitable level of medication sure to a higher tolerance (takes too long for the food to breakdown, meaning that the THC levels never reach the level to effect.

Best idea is a small, strong edible.  Learn how much ABV you need for yourself, and then take it in the smallest form possible to reduce the negatives above.  Use this dose to gauge how many doses you should divide your batch into. : )","1362096635"

That being said, I'm very sorry that you have to deal with people pressuring you. They likely mean well, but I completely understand how it doesn't translate that way.

"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","Many thanks, Integralds! I am happy to be here, and appreciate very much the warm invitation I received.  In a word, ""relieved"". I'm relieved that macro is climbing out of the Skinnerian box of toy economy calibration, and I'm encouraged by the real gains made by Bayesian macro forecasters, such as by my friend, the late Arnold Zellner and his co-author (and mine, in works in progress) Jacques Ngoie.  Put briefly, Zellner et al. have developed a Bayesian based Marshallian Macro model (believe it or not!) which beats the standard competition in forecasting in a number large scale forecasting studies, in the United States, in South Africa, and elsewhere.  See here, for example, on Zellner's website:

**http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/arnold.zellner/more/**

I think we are making progress on the economic vs. statistical significance front, but the pace is horse and buggy while the real economic and human losses, based on widespread neglect and confusion of the two very different concepts and facts, continue to mount.  Medicine, political science, and psychology (to name only a few of the other sciences) are not doing much better than the econ are in the current decade, a forthcoming study by my student Edward Teather and I will show. One big problem is that, as you say, the teaching in the classroom has not changed enough (a matter of oomph, one might say!) Another major problem is the gridlock and path dependency of journal refereeing and editing; the journals are still confused by p&lt;.05, and thus the grantors in government and business are too.  But there is hope from the law: a recent U.S. Supreme Court case, Matrixx v. Siracusano, March 2011, rejected all bright line rules of statistical significance in a major case of biomedical and securities law. Unanimously, the Supreme Court rejected  the idea that statistical significance is necessary for material proof! See here:

"politics","t5_2cneq","The difference is one is a private party, and the other is the government. A private company can make their own rules for employment. On the other hand the government is held to a different standard. The Constitution laws out the guild-lines by which our government is (should be but isn't) run. Essentially the rules for private business and government are wholly different.

It should be noted that the fourth amendment really is the key here. If you are suspected of being a drug addict because you need government assistance (handout isn't the right term here) then the government is treating people as criminals based on their economic condition. I won't engage in slippery slope antics but let's just say that it creates prescient which based on our legal basis on English law is bad news bears. 

In addition it applies a false causality of drug use -&gt; being poor or worse the opposite. Often times the jump from where you need government benefits to when you don't is huuuuuuge. Sure, many people who use govt benefits smoke pot (because, let's be real, that's who they will catch with this) but however much they spend a month (likely around $80) isn't going to rocket them out of poverty if they don't spend that. Many of the people on these benefits wouldn't be able to buy nutritious food or get assistance while they find a job *even if* they were clean. Simply put, the amount they spend on drugs isn't likely the cause of them being poor, the use drugs because it helps them escape the fact that they are poor, if only for a few hours. 

When Shell, GE or Lockheed Martin get money from the government (be it in bailouts, no bid contracts or other such things) we don't mandate the entirety of these companies (janitors and mail clerks to the CEO and CFO) get drug tested as well, even though arguably they are taking government money. Or, as another example, why isn't a drug test mandatory if you need to use a public defender?

TL;DR This ignores innocent until proven guilty, it makes assumptions about people on a broad scale and this type of practice will never be practiced equally and fairly for *all* peoples receiving government assistance.","1362096647"

Although it might make me sound mean to children, I feel really uncomfortable with the concept of classroom pets. I really don't feel the majority of them receive a very good standard of care or an ideal environment. Just as an example, how many classroom guinea pigs have an [appropriately sized cage](http://www.guineapigcages.com/)? Since I pride myself on trying to provide a high standard of care to my animals, this always sits badly with me.

There was a really interesting article in [Guinea Pig Magazine](http://www.guineapigmagazine.com/) previously about a lady who had two therapy pigs. They had chilled out personalities and she would take them to different places (I believe in the article they were looking at a nursing home) and there was great benefit to the people she visited. That sort of therapy piggy I can get behind 100% as it was supervised by an experienced handler, the people got a lot out of it, the pigs were fine with it and at the end of the day they're going home with a great owner to be well cared for rather than left in a classroom.","1362096650"

Eliminating that right to certain people jeopardizes those benefits for everyone.

You're right about humans being animals, but the whole point of society is that we don't have to act like animals in precisely the way you're describing. People who hold the opinion that we should go back to leaving each other to die or kill certain classes of people off unilaterally are holding back the progress of society away from being cavemen.

As far as your grammar and spelling, I was just pointing out something ironic; that you couldn't even take the care to check your typing, which is in my opinion an example of how you haven't even checked your thought process.

Just because something has been happening for hundreds of millions of years doesn't make it right.

My dad's dad passed before I was born, but I often hear that I resemble him in many ways from my aunts.

I have very pleasant memories of my grandmother who lived with us when I was young. She stayed home while my parents worked, so we got along really well. She didn't speak any English so at the time I spoke fluent Korean. She would often give me piggyback rides while she went on walks around the neighborhood, and she'd watch me ride my bike around in the driveway.

"Etsy","t5_2qq24","If you include a link to your shop, I can give you a few more specific tips. 

The biggest ones for everyone are - List more. Chances are, if you're new, you don't have enough in your shop. One of your listings may bring someone to you shop to look, but if there isn't enough to look at they have a smaller chance of finding the thing that they can't live without. 

It takes sales to make sales. People are hesitant to trust new shops with little or no feedback. Consider doing a few trades with other sellers to help build your feedback score. You can also advertise your product to your family and friends, people who know and trust you already. If they purchase, let them know that the feedback is important. 

Advertise yourself. Etsy brings you some traffic, but if you're in a highly populated section (jewelry, for example) you're going to have a hard time being seen. Think of your etsy shop as your own independent website - advertise to bring in your own business.","1362096655"

The concern is not about violent crimes, but Europe is pretty notorious about pickpocketing - not Switzerland itself, the worst are apparently Florence, Barcelona, Rome, Paris, etc - but when you are travelling with a full wallet of cash and your passport on you, you tend to err on the side of caution.

The current system does take tank types and tiers into account. I believe it has weights for all these, and tries to balance it between teams. The system can just continue to do the tank type/tier balancing in a match, but also incorporate skill as a weight as well.

To give a personal account: I knew Jesus as a child and experienced Him again and again. When I was older I wanted to find out for myself what life is really about and lived without God: I slept with many girls, followed my own dreams and mostly cared about myself.

Honestly I don't trust my hockey ops department. Flames fans seem to think its a given we will get  a top 5 draft but chances are we won't. This team  just isn't dropping enough points at the moment, and there are a few are other teams are out pacing us any way. Also with the new lottery system the chances of us loosing it if we get it are just as high as us getting in there if we don't finish low enough.

Even if we get top 10 pick I we can't be confident Feaster won't trade it away to pick up a Quebec highschooler and a guy who plays an awful like Dion Phanuef but with no offensive touch later on in the draft. 

I am a fan of the flames rebuilding, but what I see in this move is the centre piece of that rebuild. A centre piece that we may not have been able to select in the draft.

Are Activision and Coke going to change their formula because a few people whine about it? No, because like the stuff that gets voted to the top of /r/atheism the product is actually pretty popular. Coke is still largely the same recipe and taste it was 30 yrs ago and COD is still using the same old Quake engine with the same gameplay.

&gt;The problem with your position is that you assume /r/atheism[3] should be anti-theism.

My position is nothing more than being fine with the way /r/atheism is now sans the persistent complainers.

&gt;r/atheism is a place to discuss atheism

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/onlyatheism) is just atheism, have fun. Or go [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism) if you just want fewer memes. Problem solved.

&gt;so just saying ""stop talking about it"" is dumb

I'm not saying stop talking about it. I'm saying take that stuff somewhere else. There are a couple subreddits dedicated solely to complaining about the content on this sub. After a solid length of time of seeing the same ""so brave"" shit on almost every thread I'm perplexed as to the point of continually visiting a sub just to dump on it.

&gt;If something is wrong

Nothing is wrong though. At least judging by the opinion of the majority of users, the ones who upvote the stuff that the few get cranky about.

&gt;If something is wrong, then it should be talked about and changed

How do think anything is going to change? I don't think the moderators remove content or try to shape the discussion like other subreddits. And again like coke cola, the stuff that is on here is quite popular and the few people incessantly complaining for years hasn't changed that. Maybe saying a few more DAE SAGANs will get you guys there.","1362096680"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Critics of Dr. Kanin's report include Dr.
David Lisak, an associate professor of
psychology and director of the Men's
Sexual Trauma Research Project at the
University of Massachusetts Boston. He
states, ""Kanin’s 1994 article on false
allegations is a provocative opinion piece,
but it is not a scientific study of the issue of
false reporting of rape. It certainly should
never be used to assert a scientific
foundation for the frequency of false
allegations.""
[11]

&gt;According to Lisak, Kanin's study lacked
any kind of systematic methodology and
did not independently define a false report,
instead recording as false any report which
the police department classified as false.
The department classified reports as false
which the complainant later said were false,
but Lisak points out that Kanin's study did
not scrutinize the police's processes or
employ independent checkers to protect
results from bias.
[12]

&gt;Kanin, Lisak writes, took his data from a
police department whose investigation
procedures are condemned by the U.S.
Justice Department and the International
Association of Chiefs of Police. These
procedures include the almost universal
[11]

&gt;threat, in this department, of polygraph
testing of complainants, which is viewed as
a tactic of intimidation that leads victims to
avoid the justice process
[12]
and which,
Lisak says, is ""based on the misperception
that a significant percentage of sexual
assault reports are false.""
[11]
The police
department's ""biases...were then echoed in
Kanin’s unchallenged reporting of their
findings.""
[11]

&gt;Bruce Gross writes in the Forensic
Examiner that Kanin's study is an example
of the limitations of existing studies on
false rape accusations. ""Small sample
sizes and non-representative samples
preclude generalizability.""
[4]
Philip N.S.
Rumney questions the reliability of Kanin's
study stating that it ""must be approached
with caution"". He argues that the study's
most significant problem is Kanin's
assumption ""that police officers abided by
departmental policy in only labeling as
false those cases where the complainant
admitted to fabrication. He does not
consider that actual police practice, as
other studies have shown, might have
departed from guidelines.""

1. Go to an initial consultation to meet your doctor, discuss her plan for you, etc.

2. Get some preliminary tests to help her figure out the best protocol to make you make lots of eggs.

3. Go on birth control pills to shut down your hormones so your doctor will be in complete control of your ovaries when the time comes.

4. Start injections to stimulate egg production. This is a multi step process that will include a lot of monitoring (blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds) so your doctor will know exactly what your ovaries are doing. Each time you go in, she'll adjust your meds based on your test results.

5. Trigger ovulation (this is just another injection).

6. Go in for egg retrieval. This is a very scary sounding procedure that you'll be asleep for, so try not to stress over it. You'll be in a sterile operating room, in stirrups. They'll knock you out and while you're asleep the doctor will use a transvaginal ultrasound to visualize your ovaries. Then she will insert a needle through the wall of your vagina and suck up the fluid from each of your follicles. Yes, this sounds horrible, but it's not.

7. The embryologist will then examine the fluid from all of the follicles and count your eggs. You should find out how many you have right away.

8. They freeze the eggs and you're good to go.

Recovery from retrieval varies from person to person. I had mine on Monday and was in a huge amount of pain for the rest of the day. I did, however, get really great drugs to handle it. By Tuesday I didn't need any drugs, but I'm still sore and bloated. At no point, however, did I reach a point where I wouldn't do it again if necessary.

The weeks after Christmas, Valentines Day and key school graduation dates are living hell for shelter employees. The number of abandoned animals jumps by a *minimum* of 100% the norm, and of course, the number of ""found stray kittens"" and the like goes up just as suddenly. I get calls from all over the city from cops and other people that pick up young dogs and cats that are wandering outdoor, tossed out like trash. So advertising adoptions as good gifts for the Christmas season, well...it's fucking stupid. If the adoptions were done responsibly, I'd be a-ok for it, but they rarely are (AKA: let's adopt kitty without asking the waifu). We try to screen people come the holiday season and make sure they've really thought things through, but even then...there's nothing sadder than seeing a dog that got adopted get returned a few days later. Some of them are OK with it and even happy to see us, if they're the stupid-happy-go-lucky type of dog, but you can see and feel the sadness radiate off of others.

I've driven a couple of Cadillacs here, they get imported with an improved suspension for Autobahn speeds, and they tend to be a good bit cheaper than the high-end Mercedeses. And those fat Chryslers go for roughly similar amounts to ordinary Volkswagens.

American cars are imports here, but the Dollar has lost in value relative to the Euro. In the past decade or so we're seeing an age of comfortably well-off Europeans easily outspending an embattled American middle class. On my last vacation in the US I felt like I had money to burn.

Also, except for Cadillacs, American cars can't compare in quality to Mercedes, Audi and Lexus. GM has to cut corners to make their cars cheap for the US market, and that hurts their image in Europe.

The other girl suggests we play, so we're sitting around asking each other dumb questions to get the ball rolling. I mean, it's stuff like ""what color is your toothbrush"" and ""who was your secret crush in 7th grade""... harmless stuff. All of a sudden, the other girl, who it should be noted was pretty close friends with my GF, turns to her and asks ""have you ever been afraid of your dad?""

My girlfriend says ""I don't want to talk about that"" very sternly, but her friend, who already knew the story, pushes her until she admits that her dad had molested her. I was horrified at the lack of tact and sensitivity. As they began to argue, the other girl says ""Well I just think he should know about it!"", pointing at me.

I remind you at this point that we'd been dating for two weeks... hardly enough time for an incestual rape victim to feel comfortable enough with me to share such a horrible thing.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","**Here's Mine:**


I spend a lot of time thinking about unified aesthetics (with fashion as a subset of that set) and how the image relates to the interior person and whether others can ever understand the language of an individual aesthetic. If I design my house with the intent of having it reflect myself as best as I can, will it? And will a guest see my design and understand anything about me at all? Can some people understand some categories (music, painting, etc) but not others (clothing, poetry, etc)? 


This kind of shit actually really plagues me, which may or may not be stupid. Regardless, the point is this: I have spent most of two years messing around with and slowly refining what I would consider to be 'my style' (though in honesty I would consider at least three separate styles 'my style') not only in clothing but in how i write, how i design my room; essentially how I present myself as a person to the world. For me, not for anyone else, sort of just to be satisfied that I'm doing the best I can to not lose too much in translation.


So when people say 'I thought that tattoo looked like something Milky would get before I saw the username' I am genuinely encouraged. Or better yet, when a close friend, reading a short story draft, mentions that I write like I dress. Or best of all, when a girlfriend once told me that ""there's nothing to you that isn't necessary"" and when I asked her she meant she said ""just in everything.""


Those moments are why the whole thing is important to me.

Pick something that you know you'll enjoy. Everyone comes into it all motarded and thinking they're gonna be Billy Badass and go kill some shit... But think about what you really want to achieve longterm in life. Would being infantry or something REALLY help you? Or are you just looking for 4 years of supposed thrills?

If your plan is college, I'd advise against infantry or something similar. Hell, I'd even advise against the Marine Corps... You may want to go into a more technical field that relates to waht you want to study in if possible. It'd give you a headstart on your education and will make college easier, as well as seeing if it's a field you actually want to spend the GI bill on...

Just food for thought.

Edit: Don't ever let anyone in this subreddit get on your ass for being/wanting to be a PoG. There's absolutely nothing wrong with having a different career interest than someone who goes infantry.

They referred to the network as being ""domestic,"" likely meaning the packaging will be for US cable providers. Plus, there's Vince saying that shows like Raw and Smackdown will stay where they are as a means of drawing interest to the Network. Also, the PPVs will still available ""a la carte"" for those not subscribed to the network. All in all, a pretty good plan as far as not shutting out the casual fans by taking away Raw and SD from traditional broadcast outlets and offering something for the hardcore audience.

My question is if they are willing to look at bringing in Main Event since it isn't on a universally distributed channel (my Charter Comm package in Asheville, NC doesn't carry Ion), possibly in second run programming? Maybe have a block on Saturday nights that replay the week's Raw, SD, and Main Event.

There is no social stigma against atheism in this country, nor in many many others. Our Prime Minister is an unmarried female atheist who was not born in Australia. We don't care about any of that.

3. Rescale level destribution, so we will need 4 books for 2 levels instead of 3. And reduce iteration - every 2 books will add 1 level. So Bookshelf with 8 books will give old 4 levels, but 9th book won't work.

4. Change GUI layout to table with 4 columns and 2 rows, so it will look like 2 shelves and people won't complain about useless 9th slot. http://i.imgur.com/OtORXow.png

That way you lower the amount of testing to those most likely to use.

But the to play devils advocate, whay if they do test positive, do we deny them money they need to survive? How will they eat, will they become homeless, which becomes a differet problem altogether?

I'm not sure what kind of filter you added in post but it is a little overdone. Of course, you as a photographer can push the effect any way you want, but since you are on a photography critique subreddit you probably want more fundamentals: I'm not sure how the original image was exposed, but whatever you did after clipped both the shadows and the highlights. Not good! Let's crop a bit and show you how the tones look in black and white. Ideally we would want more detail both on the shadows of the uniforms and the highlights of the skin. Good luck!

"datamining","t5_2r25o","It's probably some antispam mechanism or one of my detractors from /r/buildapc who downvotes all my posts.

I think my question was aimed toward stat vs CS/ML. My background is in engineering and stat, so I have most the stat/math side covered. While I can script (R, Matlab, Python), I can't code since I don't have formal CS education. Data science is a field that I'm dead set on breaking into.

From what I have read...It is just so frustrating because this field is a interdisciplinary field between CS and stat. You got to have both but you can't just go to school and learn both in X number of years. You have to validate your skills and positions either through a crap load of experience in the industry (time consuming and something a new college graduate like me can't do) or have done a top flight cs/stat phd program. Without a CS degree, it feels to me that a masters in stat is just the first step. It is confusing on whether I can even land a machine learning, data mining, data science position after graduation. I feel that a phd is probably gonna have to follow the masters.

Therefore if you don't believe in patriarchy theory then you aren't actually a feminist. And if you believe in a theory that holds it to be an absolute truth that when men are in positions of power that they will discriminate against women, then you absolutely believe that men are sociopaths.

You can freely rev up to the speed as if you were in neutral, and heavy throttle would be required to do any accelerating as the converter only starts to transmit power at the stall speed. 

In a standard auto, say you are on a highway at 1900 rpm, when you give it a bit of throttle, the rpms shoot up to the stall speed where the engine has more power. Most stall speeds are a little over 2k so it is usually not noticeable. Your idea would work well with a CVT though.","1362096724"

The thing about GnP is that it tends to be repeated blows to the same spot, whereas Condit hit him in many places for 3 rounds, GSP would (hypothetically in this scenario) take him down and GnP him for 5 rounds. 

But like I said I'm just thinking of that particular possibility. I don't see GSP finishing him any other way. ","1362096730"

First of all, it has a 0.5x multiplier vs armor, compared to the 2x multiplier vs shields and barriers.

Then each ""projectile"" only has a base damage of 66 (each ammo = 8 projectiles) at lvl X, so it will suffer a lot from the 50 point DR of armored units.","1362096730"

It will eventually turn in to some kind of mad science experiment to improve the original console design. I sold two 360s that I had repaired for 15 bucks a piece. Its been over a year for both, over a year of hours of game play per day, and they are still going strong. These were the last two I fixed. The last thing I tried is what I think fixed it. I do the heat gun fix with flux and re-attach the heatsinks with shims and use screws instead of the x-clamps. I cut the case up a little and add a small fan to the gpu heatsink with the heatpipe. I do some ducting for the air flow, and the one repair that has kept them going is a 12 volt fan modification on all fans. It makes the console loud as hell, but the only ones still working are the only ones that I have done this with. Heat is what does these things in. Your mileage may vary. Best of luck.

&gt; The average film technician &amp; teamster contributes almost $25,000 into provincial income taxes now multiply that by 15,000 film employees = $375 MILLION going into the provincial economy.

You may want to double-check this.  To pay $25,000 in provincial income tax, you would have to be making over $220,000 a year.  (Not to mention $50,000 in federal taxes.)  You're saying this is for the average film tech/teamster....are you sure?  That would imply that the industry pays better than Fort McMurray work.

&gt; If not $25,000 in income taxes...

Ah, okay.  $25,000 in provincial income tax.  That comes from a $120,000 annual income.  More believable, but still not realistic and not true either.  BC Hydro has about 1,600 people making more than $120,000.  Are you saying the film industry is nearly an order of magnitude more economically important than an electric utility for 4.5 million people?

&gt; then take $10,000 x 15,000 employees = $150 MILLION into the economy.

Let's give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant this last figure -- a more realistic figure of $10k that includes federal and province.  You get to this with an income of **~$57,500***.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you.  I'm just saying you're hurting your cause with these massive, pulled-out-of-your-ass numbers that are off by a factor of 4.

&gt; I made $1,760 gross pay last week

So you gross ~$91,000 a year then.  But early you said...

&gt; I went from making $45,000 year working 80hour weeks in 2011 to $14,500 in 2012. 1/4 of that $45,000 went to income taxes.

Btw, income taxes payable on $45,000 of employment is an effective 16%, not 25% like you state.

You've got to clarify your story.","1362096739"

Maybe that's the fault of coaching and people around him, I won't forget how dominant he was before he went to Philly.

One way it could happen is if they all decide to just cut out the publishers and go to the consumers themselves. With all the big indie hits happening, crowd sourcing and digital platforms, new studios could very well succeed by themselves. 

The big publishers are necessary if you want to go mainstream globally quickly BUT small indie studios don't need to reach that big of an audience if they cut out the publisher. They could make the same amount or more by getting a sizable audience digitally as they wouldn't have to pay for physical materials and they only have to give processing fees.

I always prefer stupefied and stunted potential.

&gt; Nor do I think it can be used to roundly condemn the institution given that the only alternative that we know of is a return to out and out warlordism.

I agree with much of what was said, and that sentence pretty much shows where we differ, slightly. I don't believe we ever left that state of warlordism, the ""green zone"" might have expanded and I think violence was either exported or became obfuscated. The ultimate decision to go to war isn't made by parliament, we have various goose-stepping or fly-over militants on special occasions, etc. Current western prosperity has come at the degradation of various peoples, the collapse of Russia, atrocious Chinese social policy, and rapacious spread through the third world. What happens when that can't happen anyone? I feel that violence would turn inwards and America is where it is most explicit—NDAA, total surveillance, militarised police, and so on.

I think the problem is covered extensively and can be agreed upon by all, even those glued to the TV believe cronyism is endemic but they are too comfortable watching the football (perhaps you wonder where tribalism is cultivated most, no?) or Dancing on Thin Ice to care really.

I believe that open-source intelligence is the only alternative. Say, Iran is a real existential threat, I should know who is being watched by whatever state acronym, it's negligence otherwise especially if someone gets injured. The same with the petty criminal class. I should know which ""officers"" have been assigned to which investigation so justice can be seen to have been done with no conflict of interest, know every author of every ""official"" document, and so on. I should be able to contribute as well. I quite like the Swedish model where even tax payments are public knowledge. Every social construct should be an open platform, otherwise it's designed to be anti-social, and I know what happens in dark places.","1362096753"

The trachea is made up of these thick ""C""-shaped rings of cartilage, and you don't want to cause additional trauma/collapse on of those ""rings"" by having to force a tube through a now-closed hole. Those rings give the trachea its shape, and obviously there is already some significant damage to the persons throat if they can't get an ET tube in (or the person is just very anterior, but judging from the clip I'm thinking there is some injury/swelling involved). And of course, it would just waste time that could be better spent doing other things, not to mention it's simply bad form.

Same thing with IVs and ET Tubes. If you worked hard to get an IV on a person with small or collapsed veins, either due to multiple surgeries, cardiac arrest, or just anatomy, you don't want to lose that because the patients arm suddenly moved in a way you weren't expecting.

So a typical day i usually stay over my 8 hours some and when i come in the next night i have to cut it. im scheduled from 10pm to 7 am. there are times i have got an hour and half ""overtime"" that i have to cut before friday. so i cant clock in til 1130. as i see it, its unpaid overtime. if we dont cut it, we get coached and possibly fired. its one of the many things walmart fails at and screws their employees with.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; Basic Design Configuration

What do you think the basic design configuration of an aircraft includes?  

You can't change the wing angle, shape, leading edge, volume, surface area, surface materials and ratio to the fuselage volume and still say you have the same wing when you're done.  You can't gut the structural hardpoints and completely redesign them to introduce commonality and shared load to drastically reduce that part count and still say you have the same internal structure.  You can't extend that fuselage 25% and change every freaking angle on it and still say you have the same fuselage at the end.  You can't change all the ratios and angles on every control surface the plane has and still have the same handling when you're done.  You can't swap out engines and fuel systems and intakes and comms and targeting and radar and every other internal the plane has and still say you have the same plane.

Virtually every design element and measurable you can name changed on that plane, so what do you have left that is shared?  The fact they both have two engines and twin angled tails?  Good lord, you're telling me to eyeball these planes and use my eyes to see the commonality.  I work as a civil engineer and live in CAD all day ... don't talk to me about eyeballing stuff.  The Ford GT looks a heck of a lot like the 1970s GT40, but if you think they are the same car, you're nuts.

&gt; They reworked an existing successful design and made a good interim aircraft, but not one that will be competitive in two decades.

In two decades the Rafale will have been in the air 47 years.  In two decades the Typhoon will have been in the air 39 years.  The F-22 will have been in the air 35 years.  Good lord, man, wake up.  NONE OF THEM will be viable.

Unless one of them turns out to be the super fighter that the F-15 turned out to be, where they are still planning variants and pumping out new airframes 41 years after the first one took flight, they will all be obsolete.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I very much appreciate your feedback -- this was our first time trying something like this on RaidCall, and to be honest we had no idea the response would be so enthusiastic our first time out and were a little overwhelmed.

I can promise that all of your suggestions will be taken to heart the next time we organize something like this -- just a couple of things, though:

&gt; Know your program. Using the ""top name"" or ""10th from the bottom"" doesn't work when the names are listed in order of joining the room. Being in the middle of the list, I had zero chance to win those.

And:

&gt;  Back to the trivia questions. I rather liked them, they were topical and relevant, and only those who were big fans of your and Draskyll's stood to win. That's fine. But please, please, please don't advertise your prizes by saying ""show up to win!"" and expect us to answer trivia to win. If I'd have known trivia would have been involved, I wouldn't have shown up, to be honest. I just don't know you or Draskyll that well.

I tried to mix it up as much as I could -- I wanted people trying to actually chat to see that it gave them a chance; wanted people who'd been following us a while to feel like they had a good chance; wanted people who were quiet to see random names being picked from the user list (3-4 were), then I tried to reward people who'd been there a while, like 10th from the bottom. Absolutely everyone, no matter what, had a chance to win something -- now in the future it might be best that I just go with a pure random approach, but I just want everyone to be sure that making sure EVERYONE had a chance to win something was a priority.

&gt; And again on the topic of prizes -- you should be more clear about what kind of ""participant thresholds"" you have for the giveaway. There were 1100 people in your chat room when you started the giveaways, that should have qualified us for the first listed motherboard.

2,000 was the first motherboard, not 1,000 =P

aches: even though I hate the guy sometimes, He is such a quick thinker. He is the peyton manning of the sport.

The ""thing"" sticking out is the periscope through which air travels at highspeeds, stalling the wing. The trick aspect of this whole system is that it almost has to undergo an entire redesign from track to track in order to get it working properly. Otherwise, you'll be off balance, possibly getting air stalling the rear wing during high speed turns, which will send you spinning. It's incredibly complex to set up, and they're currently scrambling for solutions but it's tough because you can't use active system initiation or any moveable parts of course. It could serve as a great one-off solution for tracks like Monza, but after that no one's sure if it's worth keeping.

The ""learning to ignore your hunger"" issue though is not the point at all. Hunger is and will be an issue for certain people and diet strategy that is easy to follow without hunger issues is useful in helping people to achieve the weight and body composition they want. The attitude of ""I did it this way, and so it's the only way"" is neither scientific nor helpful.

"infertility","t5_2saej","If you look up IVF, I think (assume) the procedure would be the same - except that your eggs would go on ice instead of being fertilized. 

It will depend on your doctor what protocol they would want to use, but most likely you'd take the BCP for a month or two beforehand, and then you'd do injection meds for 10 days to 2 weeks, with monitoring blood tests and ultrasounds every other day. 

Once your follicles are ready, you would do a trigger shot and then your egg retrieval would be the following day.

The egg retrieval can be done with general anesthetic or just light sedation. You will likely have some cramping or pain for a few hours after the retrieval. Mine was done with light sedation and I found it painful, but it was only for a few minutes and I felt okay by the next day.

Sorry, I don't know much about endo and whether that would change the protocol. [This link has a much better explanation](http://eggfreeze.blogspot.ca/2008/10/day-21-progesterone-63.html)","1362096778"

It's not a flagrant abuse of the language, it's not even an abuse. And I apologise for the ad-hominem I prefer to debate using intellect and research, though I am human. 

Common language is different from jargon, such as is used in the field of medicine, or in linguistics. Cardiac inducing is perfectly clear and if you'd ask anyone to guess what it means they'd parse it right 9 times out of 10 because that's how the human brain works.

"kpop","t5_2r1ox","I have so many thoughts on this song/video:

1) The forced dissonance during the chorus is just painful to listen for me. I cringe every time they start doing it.

2) Why are Qri's eyes a different color every time they zoom on her? She looks so strange with a light blue-ish color. I really think she looks a lot better with her normal eye color.

3) Did they really just emulate laying an egg in their dance routine?

4) I like Areum's parts, especially the part at 2:21. It seems like they're trying to give her an actual presence in the group, which makes me happy.

5) I'm pretty torn on the overall feel of the song. I'm really not a fan of the chorus, but I tend to dislike ""happy"" and ""bright"" sounding songs, so that's not too surprising. I like the general tone outside of the chorus, but I feel they rely a bit too heavily on one general backing track. The instrumental break after Areum's break only drives it into the ground more. The song feels like it could use more variety as a whole. Still, its really different from a lot of T-ara's other songs, which is a nice change of pace.

6) The ""bunny style"" dance is pretty cool. The moves give them a little bit of attitude, which is nice.

I guess I'm glad that I'm not too crazy about this song, as I probably won't even be remotely tempted to pick up the 8 different versions they're going to release, which I guess I can count as a success. Still, I really hope they come out with something a little better in the future.","1362096779"

Also, I don't *really* see how double-bruiser comp would *consistently* beat AD+support lane. This kind of lanes from what I've seen tend to be *very* reliant on getting early lead from kill or two and then zoning the AD+support.

Delusion: The Character suffers from Hallucinations, any other character will have an incredibly difficult time convincing them that they are not real.

Suspicion: The character distrusts everyone, there is no one they can trust anyone may be betray them at any given moment

Panic: The character is fully convinced that they are in mortal danger and attempts to flee, if they cannot flee they will desperately attack anything that may perceived as a threat.

Withdrawal: The character becomes depressed, argumentative and refuses to interact with the world. (Think moody teenager)

Fury: The character will fly into a rage at anything around them.  This results in the character acting out of anger in a situation where someone else may simply become stressed.

Every single one of these effects is designed to be more or less up to the players interpretation of what this means for there characters.  So really there's a wide avenue for how the player wants to incorporate it into their character when it happens.","1362096786"

I probably shouldn't have put that in the title of this post. Definitely wasn't influenced by those god-awful books in any way. It's more about the experience of having to live with and take care of a werewolf during her transformations than about the actual ""love factor"" of the narrator.  

When the song gets fleshed out more, I plan to add a lot more instruments, specifically violin and cymbal-rolls. I agree that some dissonance in the violin lines could really do it good. My girlfriend is also probably going to be the one singing the ridiculously high part at the end, since she's a soprano. It also makes a ton more since, since it's basically supposed to resemble wolf howling and the wolf is female.

So he dares a gay kid in my class to kiss a straight boy. So, he ran over there to try to kiss him. The straight kid left the classroom and the teacher was really pissed.

Then, he asked me a truth (i was basically the only blonde, white girl at the school) : would you have sex with Ryan (basically the only white blonde guy at school)? When i said no, he kept telling everyone that i was a liar and a hussy and that it was unbelievable that i was blatantly lying to him.

Then, he started asking/daring people if they'd make out with me. This bi girl who sits in front of me started saying how she's always wanted to do it, but knew i was straight so itd never happen. So, my teacher basically said that whatever happens in class stays in class. Luckily, the bell rang and we left.
A few years after i graduated he added me on facebook and would tell me really inappropriate things. Like who in class wanted to sleep with me, etc.

He's a creepy weirdo who is obsessed with sex and people doing homosexual acts. I wish i would've reported him.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Sorry if this sounds like a cop-out, but I think it really DOES come down to whether or not ""I feel it is/isn't a full game."" This is part of game design, and I think both developers and consumers need to recognize that the handling of DLC is an important part of modern game design. Many terms we use in video games are unquantifiable - ""visceral combat,"" ""immersive atmosphere,"" ""involving story,"" ""fun gameplay"" - and how playing with or without the DLC also now shapes the experience of the game. 

Essentially what I'm saying is, if your game has DLC, the way players feel about it will largely be determined by your skills as a game designer. The sooner the importance of this is recognized, the better. I think you are correct about Mass Effect 2 - the DLC felt like it added to the game, but I don't know anyone who felt that they were getting anything less than a full game. Compare that to Mass Effect 3, where the story felt really strange and disjointed if you didn't play the DLC that took place between the two games, and many people felt that the Protean character was essential to get the full experience.

Then there's the *Tagebuch* label on the cover, so our unknown artist probably either bought it in Germany or worked with German occupation forces in France who then provided him with it.

It signifies that the infamous ""hockey sticks"" have been declared unpublishable by the establishment, that warmists can no longer get away with the gross fraud and statistical games that the skeptics exposed (and such exposure was not done through the alleged ""scientific"" peer-review process).

&gt;Not only did you fail to mention reasons,

I mentioned the dozens of government regulators at every level that must be appeased before trying to build anything (except for maybe a Muslim victory mosque) in places like New York City. Thus, the World Trade Center still hasn't been completed, over ten years later.

&gt;Well, since scientists tend to be on the far other end of the IQ bell curve, I guess I shouldn't blame you too much for that bit of stupidity. You also seem to have no idea what state-of-the-art means,

Scientists generally don't advance technology. Technology advances science. There was plenty of science in the USSR, but of course, their level of technology was almost Third World.

&gt;Wow, you're quite the idiot when it comes to economics, too. No, see, there was this little oil embargo thing, which resulted in drastically decreased supply. This in turn drove prices up. It had nothing to do with price controls, dipshit.

Service stations were shutting down due to lack of gasoline well prior to the embargo, again, due to price controls on oil. Production cutbacks were trivial, and lasted only a month and a half. The oil embargo had no effect on oil imports into the United States; oil that was imported to Europe was simply resold.

&gt;Car, idiot, I said car.

You mean like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_%28automobile%29)? That doesn't look like much of a car to me. No doubt everyone would be driving one if you had your way.

&gt;Why would there be any use for either of those?

People want to go places faster.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt;Second, they are also looking to ban the Islamic party. Why?

Because out of the dozen or so Islamic parties in Bangladesh, THAT one (Jamaat-e-Islami) was a key ally and collaborator with the Pakistani forces that wreaked havoc during 71. They did not (and some of their leadership STILL do not) want the creation of Bangladesh. That's why its easy to see why they should not be given a place in the parliament. No one is after the 11 other Islamic parties, so clearly this isn't about being against Islam.

&gt;As for that one individual, I have yet to see the other side, so I won't make sweeping conclusions. It boggles my mind that there is direct evidence of him actually doing anything. And it boggles my mind, that students (young adults) who were hired by the Pakistani govt to oppose the independence, are somehow representative of the group today.

Why? 42 years isn't that long of a time. I have family members alive who remember VERY well everything that went on, then. If you look at the court's verdict, out of 20 charges brought against him, 8 were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I did not understand what you meant by the student bit, so I'll leave that alone.

&gt;And what further frustrates me, is that in a country where there is virtually no anti-Islam media propaganda made by the West/ anti-Islam people (until recently, obviously) and no Muslim extremists, there is this huge event going on that seems to focus on the ""badness of Muslims"" (as always), but the more pressing issues are ignored!

No Muslim extremists? Are you sure? 

And this event is not focused on the ""badness of Muslims"" - who the fuck told you that? There are imaams and other religious leaders in the movement, too ... you're not drinking the jamaat-e-islam koolaid that's painting this movement as being led by atheists, are you?

&gt;Why would a country so poor and corrupt, be in a collected uproar over this, today?

Because how can you have accountability anywhere if those who committed the most heinous of crimes can not only walk free - but have a role in the GOVERNMENT? Why would people care about respecting the law when just looking at these party leaders is enough to see how much they piss on the constitution?

&gt;Who from half a century ago, is alive and cognizant of the situation now?

I don't know why you keep repeating that. 42 years is not that long ago. There are MANY, MANY people alive and well who remember everything that went on. I suggest you read up on the history of 71.

&gt;It seems that generations of Bangladeshies who haven't even seen the war, wasn't even old enough to comprehend, is rallying behind something with an inappropriate sense of energy/ nationalism.

inappropriate sense of nationalism? Wtf does that mean? So does that mean if a 15 year old Palestinian riots in the streets its inappropriate? After all, he wasn't alive to see the 1948 partition, right?

&gt;Where is their outcry for their situation, now?!

That's coming. The movement for the war criminal trial was just the tip of the iceberg. This movement is becoming bigger than that - and the political parties realize that. They are scampering to be on the right side of this so that when they are held accountable, they have a semblance of a defense.

&gt;Yes, justice is incredibly important. But after a half a century, is it possible to charge someone beyond a reasonable doubt?

Yes. Because, as I mentioned, many of the victims'/families are still here, demanding justice.

OK So here is what I have so far, and has made for some very interesting games with my friends. Please let me know what you guys think. I have a feeling if you copy/paste this into word, it might be easier to read. The number ""7"" seems to be a theme throughout the book, so I kind of ran with it as you will see...

**DISCLAIMER: This is an interpretation, it has been thoroughly play-tested, and a lot of canon had to be discarded to make it enjoyably playable**

I was going for a kind of chess vibe, but in more directions. Please pick it apart and let me know what you think. Here we go...

**Cyvasse Rules:**

**Objective:** Capture the opponent’s fortress and kill the opposing King while having a living King yourself.

&gt;Board: Hexagonal board with 7 hexes per side. Each corner is a seaport. Pieces:

&gt;Mountain - Does not move, impassible to almost all pieces

&gt;&gt;*Edit: Orthogonal movement is onto a different color, moving across the edge of one hex into another. Diagonal movement stays on the same color always, moving from one corner along the line between the spaces of 2 other colors, and onto the next space of the same color.*

&gt;Rabble (rake piece)- Strength = 1, may move 1 space orthogonally, the only piece which may move onto Mountains

&gt;Light Horse (sword piece)- Strength = 2, may move any distance diagonally in 1 direction.*

&gt;Spearmen - Strength = 2, may move any distance orthogonally in 1 direction.

&gt;Archer (bow piece)- Strength = 2, may move 4 spaces orthogonally in any direction (can zig zag or turn). Cannot capture on the same turn it moves. Can capture from 1 or 2 spaces away orthogonally. Can capture over any non mountain/fortress piece.

&gt;Heavy Horse (shield piece)- Strength = 3, may move up to 2 spaces diagonally in one direction.*

&gt;Elephant (kukri-looking piece)- Strength = 3, may move 3 spaces orthogonally in one direction.

&gt;Trebuchet (3 flying stones piece)- Strength = 3, may move 2 spaces orthogonally in any direction (can zig zag or turn). Cannot capture on the same turn it moves. Can capture from 3 or 4 spaces away orthogonally, or 2 spaces away diagonally. Can capture over any piece, including Mountains and Fortresses.

&gt;Dragon - Strength = 4, may move any distance orthogonally or diagonally. Can fly over Mountains and Fortresses but not other unit pieces.

&gt;King (crown piece)- Strength = Variable. When attacking alone Strength = 1. When flanking Strength = Strength of highest attacking piece. This ""Rally"" effect causes units to fight more effectively when they see the king engaged in combat. Direct combat units fight more ferociously and ranged units strike more accurately to protect their leige lord. Kings may move 1 square orthogonally.

&gt;Fortress - Does not move, can be occupied by all pieces but Dragon. Occupying piece recieves a +1 bonus to strength.

*Diagonal movement may not move between two mountains set next to each other creating a mountain range.

**Setup:** Determine which player will play first. Players place the board between them with a corner facing both players. The board is then divided into two sides, with the middle line of the board acting as a neutral zone during setup. No pieces may be placed here during setup.
Whichever player is going first will place his Fortress on his side of the board. The other player will then place his fortress on his side of the board. Both kings begin each game occupying their respective fortresses. For the duration of the setup the first player will place a single piece followed by the second player. They will alternate placing the pieces until all pieces have been laid on the board. The pieces will be placed in the following order:

* Fortress and King. 
* 7 Mountains. ** 
* 7 Rabble. 
* 7 Pieces with Strength 2 (Light Horse, Spearmen, Archer). *** 
* 7 Pieces with Strength 3 (Heavy Horse, Elephant, Trebuchet). *** 
* Dragon.

** Mountains may not be placed on seaports, nor may they completely surround a fortress or enclose a fortress so that it is only open to a seaport.

*** Maximum 3 of any individual piece Play will then begin with the player who first placed his fortress taking the first turn of the game.

**Turns:** A player’s turn will consist of him moving, flanking, or attacking with up to 7 individual pieces he possesses. No piece may perform more than one action (move, attack, flank) per turn. 

**Seaports:** A piece occupying a seaport on the corner of the board may move to an adjacent corner on the next turn in place of its standard move. If an opposing piece occupies an adjacent seaport, it can only be captured from the sea if the attacking piece has a greater (not equal) strength than the target piece.

**Capturing:** Excepting Archers and Trebuchets, pieces capture by moving onto the hex occupied by an opposing piece of equal or lesser strength. Archer and Trebuchet pieces capture opponent pieces by declaring them captured and removing them from the board. They do not move to the space occupied by the captured piece.

**Flanking:** Having another piece with at least the same strength as the attacking piece be also able to target the target piece gives the attacking piece a +1 bonus to strength. The unit not involved in the capture of the target piece but which provides the bonus to the attacking piece is known as the ""flanking piece"". This bonus may stack in the following manner: A flanking group consists of multiple attacking pieces. The lowest strength attacking piece will be used to determine the base strength of the flanking attack. Every additional flanking piece provides a +1 bonus to the attack. This rule is intended to prevent lesser strength pieces from providing a bonus to higher strength pieces. Flanking may not be used to boost the strength of a defending piece. If a piece provides a flanking bonus to an attacking piece, it is considered to have “moved” for that turn. E.g. 2 rabble (strength 1) and a spearman (strength 2) occupy spaces adjacent to an enemy elephant (strength 3). The rabble will be used to determine the base strength of the attack due to it having the lowest strength. The second rabble and the spearman will both add a +1 bonus to the attacking rabble’s attack because they may both target the elephant resulting in an attack strength of 3, defeating the elephant. Note: The spearman may not be the attacking piece in this scenario because rabble, being of less strength than the spearman, may not provide flanking bonuses for the spearman.

**Ranged Flanking:** If an Archer or Trebuchet can target a piece which can also be targeted by a unit which is required to move into a captured space (any piece which is neither Archer nor Trebuchet), the Archer or Trebuchet is the flanking piece and the direct combat piece is the attacking piece with the +1 bonus to strength due to flanking. E.g. An Archer is directly behind a Light Horse which is attacking an adjacent Heavy Horse. The Light Horse must move into the space formerly occupied by the captured Heavy Horse. The Heavy Horse cannot be simply removed as if the Archer were the attacking piece. If two ranged units target the same space, one gains the +1 bonus to strength and captures the target piece as it normally would, by declaring it captured and removing it from the board.

**Rallying to the King:** This is a special type of flanking where units gain an attack bonus to protect their king. When the King is a flanking piece, it takes upon the strength of the attacking piece for the purpose of providing the +1 flanking bonus to the attacking piece. When a ranged piece would normally flank for the King, the King may act as the flanking piece, boosting the attack of the ranged unit, and the ranged unit and may act as the attacking piece and simply remove the target piece without moving the king into the captured unit's space.

**Taking to the Hills:** A Rabble piece which is currently on a Mountain piece is immune to capture by any piece other than an enemy Rabble piece. Direct combat pieces may not move onto the Mountain to capture the Rabble and ranged units may not target an alpine Rabble.

**Regicide:** Upon the death of a player's king, that player loses all Rabble pieces he owns. In addition, the player who has just captured the king recieves one of his opponents pieces with a strength of 2 or 3 of his choosing. He will replace this turncloak piece with one of his own and continue play as if that piece has always been in his possession. Upon the capture of any subsequent king, the opponent will receive another piece of strength 2 or 3 of his choosing in the same turncloak manner. Note: A player may possess more than 3 of any individual piece with strength 2 or 3 in this manner.

**Coronation:** If a player loses a king, he may crown a new king by moving a piece of strength 2 or 3 into his fortress. The player immediately replaces this piece with his king piece and this unit becomes a king forgoing all characteristics, such as strength and movement, it possessed before the coronation. Upon a coronation the player does not gain back any rabble lost upon the death of his first king, nor does the turncloak piece chosen by the opponent at the death of the previous king revert back to the original player.

**Checks:** A player must declare when his actions during a turn could result in the capture of an opponents king on the subsequent turn. This is done by giving the verbal warning ""Check"".

**Victory:** A player wins when three conditions are satisfied: 1. The player has a living king. 2. The player is occupying the opponents fortress with any unit piece. 3. The opponent does not have a living king.

**Draw:** A draw must be declared when neither player has a living king and no pieces able to enter the players fortress with strength 2 or 3 remain to either player.","1362096803"

Of the handful of the homeless I know personally, maybe 2 are on and off users, and they don't get high on anything beyond pot. I know that for a fact. 

So while your intentions in telling me off, like a cunt, may have been good, you still came across as just that, a cunt. 

And despite the fact you feel the need to talk about your experience as a nurse manager (despite the fact you also claim to be an engineer), you don't know me nor do you know these people. Once again, you've assumed too much.

We all have addictions and yours is obviously being a cunt. 

For the good of society please STOP being a cunt and please STOP trying to guilt people out of giving alms by being a cunt.

As previously stated, and if you have bothered to read the thread, you'd note that I will take any new homeless I see to a fry shop or cafe if they look like a serious meth head, heroin addict or general pharma junkie.

I don't blindly hand money to strangers, while you seem perfectly fine with handing out strong doses of cuntishness to strangers online.

It is mostly a religious practice, anyway. So are YOU going to tell me that alms giving is sinful? ","1362096804"

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","Get thee to your local small business administration office.  They have mentors that can help you.  They are really helpful.

1.  If you're looking for free money, there isn't any.  You can find Women In Business groups in your area which are good for networking.  It's amazing the opportunities that you stumble into just talking to people.  It's not a waste of time.

2.  A business plan is literally your plan for starting and running a business.  Think about every single aspect of running your business.  How much will everything cost?  How many employees will you need?  What is the demographic of your customers?  What is  your floor plan?  What are your hours?  What kind of shelving will you need?  What kind of advertising will you need?  Are you going to offer knitting classes?  Are you going to card your own wool from your in-house sheep?  What are your needs in terms of city services?  Do you need a phone, credit card machine, internet services?  What kind of equipment do you need?
Ask yourself EVERYTHING that might happen in a day, a week, a month, and a year.  Make a five year plan.  You will have to revise it as  you go.  Business plans are not static documents.  They're used to show that you're actually thinking about how everything works.  You can use examples of a business plan as a structure, but fill it full of the details that pertain to you.

3.  Save capital yourself.  Don't think of approaching people for money until you know what you're doing.  You'll have to pay that money back, with interest.  You need to know how much money you'll need, so it's back to step 2.

4.  Don't bother looking for locations until you've figured out at least 90 percent of your business plan.

5.  Before you sign a lease, get a loan, or do anything, go talk to an accountant.  They can steer you toward what your state needs.

6.  Quickbooks, Peachtree, they're all good.  Do you know much about accounting?  Go to step 5 and see what they recommend.

7.  Generally, you buy your inventory through some sort of distributor.  I'm not sure what that would be in the yarn industry.  You should go talk to someone who owns a yarn store.  Preferably someone not in your immediate area who would be your competition.  (Competitors give really lousy advice.)  Are you active in your local knitting community?  Do you go to fiber fairs, know shepherds, attend llama-ramas?  

If you want to open a business, you should know as much about it as possible before you ever think about what your store will be called.  Read everything you can about running a yarn store.  Talk to every yarn store worker/owner you can find.  Some people will give you terrible, terrible, terrible, (and one more) terrible advice.  If you do enough research you'll be able to decide what is useful and what is bullshit. 

Don't be deterred by the amount of stuff you have to do.  It might seem overwhelming, but it's a lot better to prepare before hand.  You do not want to be the person that risked all her savings and used up every favor she had before you've done your due diligence.

Good luck!  You can do it!","1362096806"

performed, Young Wolf has one +1/+1 counter and three -1/-1 counters on it. After statebased actions are performed, Young Wolf is in the graveyard. When it was last on the

On a side note, I would try and see about a project to correct the orbit of the comet to ensure that it hit Mars in 2014 (probably too late at this point)  It would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness a devastating impact (and not on Earth, so humans don't get to go extinct).","1362096812"

Your justification is really that a ""multi-media billion dollar ad campaign"" may benefit from someone who was enrolled in this course. Really? Do you realize how stupid that is?  You think a multi-billion dollar ad campaign is reliant on a 2nd year communications course from Mcgill for its success?

IMO the true problem lies when games are designed so that you are forced to use microtransactions to have a fair chance in winning the game, or to have the full experience in a game that you payed to play to begin with.

That being said, what I am about to say may be interpreted as ignorant, or prudish, or sexist, or transphobic.  I try very hard not to be these things, and this is not my intent.  

Reading the article, all I could think about was, ""TRANSGENDER SIX YEAR OLD?""  Really?  Isn't six awful young to be considered as having a definitive gender identity?  Especially one that (as sad as it may be to say) is not generally considered normative and could lead to harassment and bullying and a lifetime of difficulty?  Really, this biologically male six-year-old is a girl, and we've all decided on that at this young age?  Isn't six kind of a confusing age to be bringing these issues to the fore?  

Again, I stress that I see nothing wrong with the kid's identity.  I don't necessarily agree or disagree with what the school has done.  And if this child truly is gendered female, then everyone should acceptr it.  Sorry if I offend anyone in this post.

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","&gt;For what model would you like to obtain the source code? Anything in the US is trivial to acquire; it's a tad harder for, say, the European or Canadian models, but not impossible by any means.

I could *not* possibly care less about source code, because quite frankly, I'm really *not* interested (at all) in whatever data munging (or torturing) shenanigans (and even LESS about the ""modeling"" nonsense) that others have been up to -- if someone else wants to waste their time with that malarkey they are welcome to it; I've seen and had to dig through more than my fair share of crap-code in my life, I have no desire to do it any more frequently than necessary.

&gt;What raw data would you like to obtain?

I'll bite. Since you claim to have access to such large volumes of raw data...

Get me (or point me to in some useable data format\*) the **daily** (unaltered, unadjusted) air temperature records -- as recorded -- for as many **lighthouse stations** as you have and as far back as you have them (preferably worldwide, but most critically any/all between Arctic/Antarctic Circles and the Cancer/Capricorn Tropic circles, Tropical and Equatorial zone stuff would be a plus, but is of less importance -- oh, and Lat &amp; Long of each station **must** accompany).

Note that I am NOT interested in **any** ""adjusted"" data, nor am I interested in ""averages"", neither daily, nor monthly, nor any aggregates.

From what samples I have tried to obtain in the past... the actually record is abysmal in this regard.

\* I will be able to both ""trust"" and verify the accuracy of any typed data (at least on a random spot check basis sufficient to satisfy my own concerns &amp; purposes).

&gt;Apparently you've never been to the NCDC in Asheville. Take a tour of their basement archive some time.

Nor have I traveled to Timbuktu to examine the clay tablet &amp; papyri trade records of the Mali, Songhay and various Pashalik empire eras -- but that is not necessary for me to know that a lot of data has been ""lost"" over the years (much less the amount that was never recorded).

As to NCDC, AFAIK, it isn't anything even approaching a ""global"" archive (at least as far as historical records useful for long term ""climate"" calculations).

And if what I have looked at and retrieved data from NCDC's online database is any indication the record retention is ""spotty"" at best (with LOTS of gaps even in the mid to late 20th century; and with records heavily tilted -- *for rather obvious, and entirely non-nefarious reasons*\* -- towards urban areas; yet that still has problematic implications, regardless).  

The claims of 150 years of data on hand are ""cute"" things to claim for PR purposes, but are significantly misleading the way the claims are phrased -- there is after all a significant difference between ""having 150 years of data"" and ""having *some* data that goes back 150 years"" -- the former is pretentious, the latter the much more humble reality.

\*I fully comprehend that when the data was collected, it was for the *National Weather Records Center*, so total comprehensiveness was less of a priority; and that it is just a ""given"" that data is more likely to be complete for areas where people live, and to be rather spotty as you get more remote -- but of course that is one of the whole problems with attempting to mine and use such weather records for purposes which it was never intended.

&gt;I'm being crystal clear. Now, if you instead wish to change the argument that the adjustments are invalid, then you'd have a (flimsy) argument

Oh, I absolutely *challenge* the veracity and validity of the ""adjustments"" (and no, that isn't ""changing the argument"" because adjustments ARE ""manipulation"" -- and if the adjustment is done incorrectly {no matter how convinced the manipulator is of the ""correctness""} then it amounts to a form of ""falsification"" as well -- manipulation/falsification can be, like a tumor, either malignant or benign but tumors can be dangerous &amp; problematic regardless).

And it is hardly a ""flimsy argument"" at all, in fact it goes to the core of the matter (if the records were solid and valid, then no ""adjustment"" would be necessary -- or restated, the very existence of the ""adjustments"" means the records are of dubious accuracy).

&gt;(it's not exactly a juvenile science).

This is a much bigger lie than that he had a kid. Breaking up is a bit better, but then come the issue of why the kid was his responsibility? He'd have to fake an engagement first.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","You're right, if anything you would expect poverty : crime correlations to have a relation much lower than 1:1

If your poverty rates are twice as high, you would only expect crime rates to be twice as high if people in poverty are the only people committing crimes. You would need people in poverty to be infinitely more likely to commit crime than people who are out of poverty, which obviously isn't true. 

For example, if people in poverty were say, twice as likely to commit crime as people out of poverty you would still only expect your crime rate to increase about 18% if your poverty rate doubled from 10% to 20%. 

(80 * 1x + 20 * 2x)/(90 * 1x + 10 * 2x) =~ 1.18

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","I quit my day job in July of last year to become a ""full time"" musician.  Up until then, I had worked on a number of commercial projects composing - skate shoe ads, tire commercials, clothing commercials, etc, so when I got picked up to do a web documentary series for a pretty big chanel, I decided to dedicate all of my time doing it.  I had previously worked in a tech support, but the documentary series paid me enough per episode that I was actually making more money than my day job - so I did what every red blooded musician would do and put in my two weeks at work.  Up until then all of my music work had been suplimental income, so I took this as a sign to try something different for awhile.

Now, the next 6 months consisted of me working at the least 3 hours a week and at the most, maybe 12?  It was pretty sweet.  I was bringing in a regular paycheck, had TONS of free time (both good and bad) and made some better connections in the process.  In my opinion, networking is the most important part of the business.  Obviously your music is important as well, but that doesn't matter if no one ever hears it / knows your particular talents.  I did manage to pick up another job as well doing a score for a clothing commercial, but since then things have run dry.  The series just ended, so no more steady paycheck, and although I have another series interested in hiring me - I had to go back to work full time because the checks stopped coming and I have bills to pay.

I'll be honest in that I could do a better job networking and putting myself out there if I really wanted to keep it going, but I'll also be honest in saying that even though I only worked on average 6-8 hours a *week* - it can be exteremely stressful and completely changed my perspective on writing music.  I've always known that you have to do what the producers need you to do, so that's understood, but pushing out music on tight deadlines (think creating atmospheres and full pieces for up to 15 minutes of music in sometimes as little as 24 hours) - rewrites, etc - it can be taxing.

However, that was just in my line of work.  I'm sure a session musician has a completely different take on it.  Currently, I picked up a contract job and my last check from the series was just deposited so no more music money for the time being.  I do have another series lined up, but I'm not willing to go back to the uncertainty of not knowing how long I'll have steady income coming in.  The business can be tricky like that, and unless you're working with an established sound house, running solo can be a big gamble.  I did make a lot of good connections, learned A LOT about my particular field and the industry and wouldn't trade the experience for anything.  However, after working so hard doing something I've always loved - and seeing how it really does turn into a job and takes away a lot of the romantical aspects of creating, I'm not really trying to jump right back in full force for now.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A friend of mine and I were sitting in High School Chemistry class (Sophmores) when an extremely attractive Junior came up to us and asked if she could copy our test. We told her we both got C's, she said she didn't care and took the test, sat down next to us and began copying it. Midway through her scantron she's leaned over bubbling answers and I look over to see her thong sticking out of the back of her pants. I poke my friend in the arm and point, he smiles and whispers, ""I'll give you 10 bucks if you give her a thong wedgie right now."" I didn't have a job at the time and assumed I'd get in minor trouble for it, so I leaned over and said, ""Sorry *girl's name*"" grabbed her thong and lifted her straight out of the chair about a foot in the air, looked over at my buddy who's hysterically laughing already and ask ""Good enough?""

He manages to stop laughing long enough to say ""yes"" and I let go. I apologize to the girl again and she smirks and goes ""Don't worry, happens all the time.""

My friend and I burst out laughing again, our teacher was less than pleased.

Horrific part was, when she got her test back she had an ""A"" turns out we weren't the only ones that found her attractive...","1362096837"

If you feel entitled to sex, or feel that you deserve sex from women and are pissed off that you're not getting any, others pick up on that. It's not attractive. If you're wanting sex but not having it, that is not the fault of any woman, and certainly not their responsibility. Instead of focusing on making women want to have sex with you, focus on making yourself the kind of person people find charismatic, charming, interesting, and respectful. It's possible that women you meet are simply unimpressed by how you look at sex and women, and that your'e coming across as a guy who is only interested in speaking to women because you want sex.

Basically, you're going to go into the dealership, and tell them your situation.  They're going to point you to something that has BIG rebates - like around $3000 to $4000.  I just looked on Edmunds.com, and the 2012 Nissan Maxima has a $4000 rebate, and the 2013 Maxima has $3000 for customer cash.  That will pretty much offset your negative equity - that means your payments stay exactly the same.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I'm not saying it's right, but perhaps they had the initial consent with regards to their own bodies in distributing it to say, their boyfriend. Then they break up and he shares it with his friends. Obviously the scenario I describe the second distribution is more problematic. But really, if we're going to charge anyone, it should be everyone.  Frankly I think we should be more sensible about it, because the only real problem with child porn is because it involves *victims* who were *exploited* by people in a position of trust and dominance.  I guess maybe the law considers that an angry party has ""exploited"" the person in the image by distributing it without permission, but I sense that there should be a better law dealing with minors to handle that kind of thing. Where I am, kids are allowed to have sex at 16 (used to be 14) so why can't we allow them to share pictures amongst themselves if there is consent?

Just talking out my ass here, but I can see how this is a very complicated subject legally speaking. I just hope for those boys' sake that they don't get an overblown punishment just because the letter of the law says they're dangerous sex offenders. They're not. ","1362096842"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This is more interesting to me than discussions on the Catholic Church's position on their own doctrines. I disagree and believe you should attend mass or visit their website on occasion - they still have all of the infrastructure and belief's in place. Passover, lent, Christmas, Easter, Lord's Prayer (forgiveness for Sins), Sin; original sin; on and on they have these belief's and you must abide by them in order to get into heaven. 

At the core religion is just that - a promise to people that death is not real and we continue, for eternity, in either Heaven or Hell. Our 'soul' is on the line and the Devil / Satan / Lucifer is tempting us to sin to get our souls. What is a soul? Some ectoplasmic / intangable / never-to-be-discovered-by-science metaphysical thing that each of us has? It lifts of our body to go to this other-worldly plane and takes either a left or a right depending on a space-time-morally-aware thing based on if we were good or evil? These are absolute things? 

Why don't I kill myself / what is the meaning of life / why live at all? Personally and even objectively I would say to ensure the survival of my genetic code is partly a reason to survive in order to pass along my genes. Philosophically I live to discover truth - there are millions of humans and I believe collectively we can unite to ensure the survival of our species and those around us outside of the limitations of our planet (colonize space; colonize the oceans; feed the world; etc). 

We are always at both the end and the beginning of knowledge. Before the Wright Brother's we 'would never fly'; with quantum computing on the brink; celestial awareness and exploration; cracking our genetic codes; stem cells; nanotechnology; all of the things we have *yet* to discover. 

Religion was our first attempt at understanding or explaining a lot of the mysteries around our lives; so by default it is also going to be the worst explaination. Science itself has made so much of Genesis (and many other parts of the Bible) so utterly defunct and disproved the whole rest of the works also need to be considered just as unreliable. Read the creation story and even if you, like I, are not experts in biology or astronomy or metaphysics can see that Water cannot exist without Oxygen so how does God create the oceans before an atmosphere? Why doesn't the Bible accurately describe very basic things LIKE oxygen or germ theory if it is from God?","1362096853"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I have had 2 experiences with piss tests.  #1, applying for a warehouse selector job.  They interview and train in groups, so we all know each other by the time testing day comes.  One kid has a smile on his face, and shows me the condom full of his mother's urine that he has tucked into the inside of his boxer's waistband.

He passed.

Next, now I run a small lab.  I had a fantastic employee who temped for me for months.  His temp contract was up.  Aside from coming in ""questionable"" once causing me to have a talk with him, he was good.  So I said ""fuck it"" and figured I'll hire him pending a piss test that he had  in 30 minutes that was a 20 minute drive away.  His results were the first I've had that had to be sent out for further analysis for weeks, but he passed.  Then he started coming in fucked up.  I talk with him, send him home.  He's questionable a few more times.  Then one Saturday he's completely gone.  I was going to let him sober up, go home, then let him know.  Too bad.  All of the other employees told me they were scared of him.  I confront him, he runs off thrashing the place.  Later it turns out he offered to buy urine off one employee, offered to buy painkillers off another, and offered to sell pills to yet another.  Plus later multiple stories of him popping pills in his car before work surface.

Keep in mind, he still passed and he was a dealer/user with 10 minutes to figure out how to cheat the test.  Saying 2.9% failed in Florida doesn't say what percent really do drugs.  It's useful in that it shows we're not going to catch enough to fund the program, which is important.  But it does NOT say that welfare recipients are less likely to use drugs.

Lol what? Does this guy really think people are playing old school runescape for nostalgia?

No. Absolutely not. If people wanted nostalgia, they'd play on a private server. Old school runescape is a serious thing; we play because it's actually fun, NOT for a little nostalgia...

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","I specifically located my business and home within 10 miles of each other so I could ride a bicycle to work. The notion of commuting from the suburbs to the city and back is an outdated one from the 1950s post war era. The price of gas is going to fluctuate continually, and will only go up in the long run. My bicycle keeps me fit, and saves me both gas and gym money.

There is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to live in a suburb, but you should work out there too.  

House prices in my area are more stable in the urban core because demand is high. Suburbs are a dime a dozen, and prices have been all over the place (not to mention foreclosures) b/c they are characterless and interchangeable. I know of IT people who live in the city, but commute to the suburbs b/c they didn't want to take the chance to lose money on a house out there. Their concern was that the job might change and they would have to sell at a loss on short notice. For them, the city was a more secure investment, and offered a more community feel with walk-able neighborhoods you don't get out in the burbs.","1362096858"

There are a few things you can do that might have some impact on their ability to steal public money in the guise of ""helping"" people back to work.

1. You could write a letter to the DWP asking for the money that Igneus are allegedly entitled to for helping you find a job - after all you found it yourself and the money would help keep you in work. For added kudos make sure your local paper, local councillors and MP are also aware of your letter.

2. Find out how many of your new co-workers are there getting ""work experience"" under the threat of benefit sanctions and surreptitiously let them know that they're victims of a forced labour scam.

3. Let everyone know about http://www.servitudecomplaint.org.uk and write some letters. Convince other people to write letters too.

4. Sign some petitions against the attacks on welfare and help force the government to look at helping people find work instead of taking away their support in the vain hope they'll somehow get a job instead of being tortured by JCP/DWP etc. http://wowpetition.com/

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt;Do I sound like a complete beginner? I've been here for a while, read that 5 times and no it does not answer my questions. I appreciate the thought but that copypasta does not solve everything on /fitness

Your OP:

&gt;Been lifting 4 months ish 

So yes, you are pretty much a complete novice/beginner.

Your OP question:

&gt;Can someone recommend me some more exercises that I can add, ideally good compound ones (I appreciate there probably aren't many I'm missing). Also, if someone could suggest a suitable routine for getting stronger and putting on size - is it time for a full split!?

Which the FAQ answers with:

&gt;As a beginner, the most important thing you can do is leverage someone else's knowledge to learn how to exercise properly. To do this, use a plan that a professional has created for beginners, not one you created yourself. You wouldn't work on your own car, why try to work on your own body in the same manner?

And then it points you to a good program picker (note there is a link to picker in the FAQ, but I can't be bother to link it right now):

&gt;If you still need help selecting an exercise program, try the program picker website. It has collected all the standard information we have in this FAQ, reduced the number of questions to a bare minimum, and recommends the best program for you to meet your fitness goals.

But for whatever reason that wasn't good enough for you.  So ok, even though the answer is right there in the FAQ, you want to know more.  Fine.  Whatever.  The FAQ shows you how to ask a question here:

&gt;If, after reading this FAQ all the way through, you find that your question is not answered, you will need to ask for help on the fittit subreddit. Contrary to popular belief, simply saying ""help me"" is not enough. We need lots of information about you in order to give you advice. Everyone is different and not everything works for everyone.

&gt;Things which should be included in your post for help:

&gt; * **Weight, Height, Sex, and Age**
&gt; * Your Goals (weight loss, muscle, etc)
&gt; * Any injuries or disorders that we should know about? (Diabetes, broken ankle, etc)
&gt; * Do you smoke? (If yes, stop. Stop now.)
&gt; * **History of diet or exercise (What have you tried? What worked? What didn't?)**
&gt; * Do you have access to a gym?

All you did was list a collection of exercises.  You didn't list a routine, you didn't list your progression strategy, you didn't list age, sex, height, weight.  You really didn't give us all that much to work off of.  That is why I pointed you to the FAQ.

I don't really believe you read the FAQ twice, let alone five times, because you should have come across this information at least once.  But instead you decide to become a wise ass instead of helping us help you.

So fuck it.  **Add Power Cleans.**  You don't want any real advice, you just want an idiotic answer in isolation to an idiotic question in isolation.  There you go.","1362096861"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I went to a Catholic high school and knew several people who went through the Confirmation process.  Some of them were very devout, others not so much.  It really depends on what's important to you regarding whether or not you stand up for atheism.

If you feel that Catholicism is no threat to you, you could just go ahead and get it over with.  Atheism is a personal choice and belief system - you don't need anyone to know you're an atheist to be proud of it.  My future in-laws think I'm a good old Christian boy because my fiancee and I hide my true beliefs behind ""I was educated at a Catholic school and I'm not practicing now.""

But if you feel the need to make a statement about who you are, I think you should do just that.  Just be careful in how you bring it up.  If your parents are understanding enough and appreciate independent thought, bring it up to them calmly.  My high school even said it was absolutely normal to question your faith - and that you should, even - so I'd start with ""Mom, Dad, I've been wondering about Catholicism... I'm not sure it's the right fit for me.""

Of course, this is ill-advised if your parents will over-react.  Eventually you'll end up telling everyone, it just depends on when.

As for your friends - if they are atheists, they shouldn't give you any grief about becoming an atheist... or at least, not for very long.  I've known quite a few converts, and I don't harass them - if anything, I like them even more now.","1362096871"

"spikes","t5_2utkz","I like the deck that it's based off. Naya Blitz is probably as fast as a list is ever going to get in the current standard. However, I feel that the GP winning list is just worse in some areas, though better in others.

First off, I like the inclusion of the Ghor-Clan Rampager. I think it's a strong include, and presents something else for your oppnonent to play around, in addition to your spears and growths. Excellent choice. I'm not sure I like cutting a Giant Growth for it - I'd rather cut a Spear (though I can see the argument both ways, and I do think it's a very close call) - but the Rampager include was great.

However, the deck also does some things wrong. Shaving a land from the maindeck is ambitious at best, and stupid at worst. I mean, yes, your curve is low, you can operate at 2 mana and it won't really affect you, but Frontline Medic is very powerful, and he's upped the count by 1 (to run the full 4). Cutting a land, AND adding a 3-drop? Seems a little weird to me.

I also don't think the Nearheath Pilgrim is where you want to be in this matchup. I think +2 Fiend Hunter is just better, since it acts as removal, and a relevant body to block. It just seems better than the Pilgrim in most situations when you're post-board, though I do accept that this could be a concession to the fact he's only running 20 lands. Taking that into consideration, trying to keep your curve as low as possible post-board is a good, solid plan. 

But again, I don't really think you want a lifegain guy. He's a win-more card. He's not really gunna get you back in the game, and if you win with him, you were probably already winning on the board anyway. I understand the desire to break a race, but I don't think this deck needs a way to do so. You break the race by breaking their teeth, not gaining some life here and there.

All in all, I like the deck, and would probably play the exact 75 if I had no time to test and refine the list. But, given time, I'm sure some of the numbers on certain things would change, though that usually is what happens anyway, so... Yeah. My two cents.","1362096872"

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","I'm pretty new to War Thunder, and I play the British and German lines for now, and here are my impressions [all arcade]:

The Blenheim is one of my favorite aircraft, it climbs well, has a high top speed and is easy to unlock things for. Also, it is well armed with regards to self defence - most arcade fighter pilots will climb up to your height and try to sit on your tail, and then unless they have cannons (which is very rare for aircraft under tier 5-6), your aim will be better and you can down them with ease.

Didn't play the Beaufort much because I zoomed through its tier quickly to get into the Beaufighter. Now the Beaufighter isn't exactly a bomber, but it is great fun. Watch some [jingles](http://www.youtube.com/user/BohemianEagle) videos to see what a Beaufighter is capable of.

The He-111 (and Ju-88) is armed with lots and lots of very small bombs, which is bad if you are going after hard targets (heavy tanks, pillboxes etc.) but really good if you can get into position to bomb an entire armored car convoy (like in African Canyon) - I've had runs with 10+ ground kills.

The Ju-87 is a flying target, don't expect much of it, although you can use its twin MGs in front to shoot down slow unarmored targets. The line does get better, with the D-3 having a better bomb load, the D-5 having twin 20mm cannons pointing forward and the G-1, G-2 with their one-shot-one-kill 37mm troll cannons.

A note about crew skills: you will notice that when upgrading gunners you will receive penalties unless you have as many *trained gunners* as there are gunners on the aircraft.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","The switch to Jaguar in and of itself doesn't necessarily enable anything. I expect total system power to be around 20 to 30 watts lower than the launch PS3 at most (170W or lower vs 200W), so that would likely mean a smaller box. A big determining factor will be if they do an internal PSU like their previous consoles (PS1, PS2, PS3), or they do a power brick like the xbox 360.

Noise will completely depend on their cooling solution. At one extreme, they could throw a huge copper heatsink in there and not need much fan power. They'll probably balance it out to where you can't necessarily hear it over the HDD or ODD.

The thing that will allow a slimmer form factor is the fact that the APU replaces both the CPU, GPU and many other things in legacy consoles. Since so much is in the APU, the motherboard can be a lot simpler, and hence, smaller. 

For size, I'm guessing something around the PS3 Slim (not super slim) or the launch 360.","1362096876"

And if that's true about the adopt pets from shelters, then I apologize for that. I have been told repeatedly by self-proclaimed PETA members that I'm cruel for wanting to have a pet dog, and that they should not be subjugated to humans.

You're acting like I want to take your AR-15 away.  I know what a fucking assault rifle is, and I'm also not saying they should be banned. I never said anything about banning guns.  I can come up with hypothetical and real situations to support banning extended magazines all day as well, this accomplishes nothing. 

&gt;I also see that you don't want the first amendment to apply to the internet, as the first amendment says nothing about it.

Major straw man. The first amendment is nowhere near as ambiguous as the second amendment. Its pretty clear freedom of speech should extend to all mediums even if not explicitly stated.  It is not clear that we should be able to own whatever weapon we feel like.  That's why I'm confused that you are drawing the line at extended magazines.  Why don't you use your exact same argument to make machine guns legal? I see that you don't want the second amendment to apply to machine guns.

&gt;You mention ""Assault Rifles"" when railing against them

I mean that's just a lie.  I never ""railed"" against assault rifles. I am against banning assault rifles.  I know why militias are necessary don't try and give me a political science 101 lecture.

The constitution says the militia should be well regulated. There is nothing seditious about regulating it by banning outrageous size clips.  Note that I never said what size clip should be banned either that is why we discuss these things and we decide what the best course of action is. Limiting the size of clip you can use does not infringe upon your right to own a firearm.

Secondly, you have no fucking proof that Woodward lied.  I read the book and think that Woodward made a mistake, but is not a liar.

&gt; and at no point during the whole situation did he come forward and say it wasn't a threat.

That is so stupid.  The media and redditors like you perpetuate the myth that Woodward said he was ""threatened ""and it is up to him to come out and diffuse it?  No.   

&gt; Omission of a lie is still a lie

LOL.  You don't know what the fuck you are talking about.  Let me inform you.  In ""The Price of Politics,"" during the debt ceiling debate, Obama and Boehner were engaged in efforts to make a Grand Bargain.  It wasn't going well because the Tea Party was so resistant to tax increases that Boehner didn't think he had the votes.  During the process, the Gang of Six released their deficit reduction plan which had more tax increases than Obama.  Seeing this, Obama went to Boehner and said he'd like to get more revenue.  Boehner used this request to completely bail on the Grand Bargain, saying that Obama ""moved the goalpost.""  So that is where the goalpost quote came from.  

Where Woodward gets confused, sadly by his own fucking book, is on the sequester.  Obama had been almost completely cut out of the loop at this point and Congress was negotiating the details.  The White House introduced the sequester as ""a trigger"" to make cuts so undesirable that the Supercommittee would have to take action.  Woodward then said and I quote (yes, an actual quote):

&gt; In fact, the final deal reached between Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in 2011 included an agreement that there would be no tax increases in the sequester in exchange for what the president was insisting on: an agreement that the nation’s debt ceiling would be increased for 18 months, so Obama would not have to go through another such negotiation in 2012, when he was running for reelection.

And

&gt; So when the president asks that a substitute for the sequester include not just spending cuts but also new revenue, he is moving the goal posts.

My understanding was that Obama was referring to the sequester replacement.  Woodward is clearly getting confused between the sequester and the sequester replacement but that doesn't make him a liar, maybe just senile...

You'll never see Hartley out Bowled slog-sweeping when the team's in trouble (a la Wade the bloody gen Y airhead) or running at the bowler and swinging his arms off when we're 5-down for 20 (a la Haddin).

Now, what is the Son of Man's kingdom? We find our answer in Matthew 13:38, which says that His kingdom is ""...the world."" However, the kingdom of the Son of Man is distinguished between that of the Father in Matthew 13:41 (cf. Daniel 12:3 and 1 Corinthians 15:24-25). The Father's kingdom existed during the time of the Jews and their various covenant relationships with Him, while the Son's kingdom is the world after His own Resurrection and it will continue to be so until his Second Coming, after which he will hand the kingdom back to the Father, at least according to the Bible. So, as can be seen, there indeed were ""...some who did did not taste death until"" they saw the Son of Man coming in his kingdom, that is to say, some, but not all (Judas) saw the Resurrected Christ enter into His kingdom.

If I let him outside, which I don't because I live in the city, writing ""needs meds"" on his collar may alert people that, ""Oh shit this cat might just roll over and die unless I get him on the right meds..."" which requires spending money taking him to a vet and figuring out what's wrong, spending money on the meds, and even then the vet would scan the microchip and find that I was the rightful owner anyway.

* One Pair of Size **9B Allen Edmonds Byrons in what looks like Walnut/brown**. They're a bit worn, but no damage, just could use some cleaning. A spot on the inside of the left ankle, and a tiny one on the right. I've had them on shoe trees since i got them. **Asking 90**

* One Pair of Size **8.5D Black Allen Edmonds Tassle Loafers**, not sure what exact model they are. In amazing condition, it looks like someone painted the sole black though, but it is a leather sole. Shown in the picture. **Asking 90**

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I think Complexity lost this game in champ select. Dignitas had absolute control of the game from the moment bans/picks began. Complexity read the bait from Dignitas (first-picking Xin with Taric/J4 up), but they revealed their top laner for no reason. After that it was a simple story of Dig picking strong lanes  and Complexity picking weak lanes (Kassadin and Shen both have no ability to push lane up and Kog'Maw needs levels and items to get rolling). Consequently, Xin was free to walk into enemy jungle and do whatever he wanted, knowing that his teammates would be able to back him up just as quickly as the enemy laners (the enemy laners would also be losing experience and gold to towers). Particularly with a jungler like Maokai who is a fairly weak duelist (he's a strong ganker, but he relies on laners help him convert kills), there was just nothing Complexity could do against Dignitas.

I look forward to Dignitas versus Marn; I am interested to see how Marn fairs after they managed to topple CLG and TSM in a single week (particularly given how momentum-driven they seem to be).","1362096913"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Ask yourself if you can identify the following items, and what sports they are associated with:  Scull, Club, Bat, Stick, Pitch

Answers on the Bottom.

If you are familiar with various types of sports you may notice that some of these terms could have multiple meanings among various contexts.  For example, take the word ""Pitch"".  Fairly straightforward, right?  Baseball is America's past time so everyone knows that the pitcher ""pitches"" the ball to the batter.  But did you know that pitch also is a field in which Rugby, Soccer/Football, and cricket are played on? There is a bias to both the racial minorities and lower class populations who may have never been educated in more sophisticated sports.  A scull is an oar used in crew and rowing sports.  These are traditionally upper class sports because they are incredibly expensive to maintain or even get into.  If you could never afford to be a part of either of these sports you might have no idea what a scull was.  Generally, more expensive sports are geared to a more upper class society which is disproportionately ""white"".  A ""white"" society contains less minority and lower class/impoverished groups, so by asking the population via standardized test what a ""scull"" is, you are not taking into account that many minority groups could not possibly know the reference to answer the question. Therefore, the question is racially biased in ""white"" people's favor because they are more likely to get the correct answer, having known the context, than a minority group member that might not.

There is a lot of substance here which only touches one aspect out of many that could explain why standardized tests are racially biased. I could go on for hours using other sorts of examples and justify the same stance though.  Feel free to PM me if you want me to explain it like you're 4!

Answers to above:
Scull- Type of Oar used for Rowing/Crew
Club- Golf Club
Bat- Cricket Bat, Baseball Bat
Stick- Hockey Stick
Pitch- The act of ""pitching"" a ball in Baseball/Cricket, Field for Rugby, Soccer, Cricket

If your deduction that a god exists is based on the rule that nothing can exist unless it was created by something else, that means god was either created by something else or he does not exist.

&gt;How many school years are compulsory

If I recall correctly you must complete to the end whichever year of schooling you are in when you turn 16 (which for most people is S4) but we have 6 years of secondary schooling if you wish to continue that long. So... that would mean 7 years of primary school (you start at about 5 years old) and 4-6 years of secondary school.

&gt;and what do most people do after graduating?

I assume by graduating you mean finishing secondary school (it's not thought of as anything as grand as graduating here 'cause you have no choice and complete it even if you fail every single class). Most go into the oil industry in some way or another but many go to university as well. With there being two universities and one college here there's a lot of choice for education. A lot of that education will be put towards the oil industry once it's completed though.

&gt;Are there any really popular hobbies or pastimes?

I live on Reddit so apart from consuming copious amounts of alcohol I don't really know. Oh, I suppose there is the thing that we're the cocaine capital of Scotland...

&gt;What are the popular tourist spots or generally cool places in Aberdeen?

* Duthie Park
* Maritime Museum
* The Tolbooth

* Marischal College
* Union Square for the shopaholics

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","One of the cheapest and easiest ways to get great tasting coffee is the french press method. You can buy a press for about $20-$25 (Bodum is the most well-known brand, but a no-name press would work as well).

Now you need your coffee. You want beans that have been roasted very recently. While most posters in /r/coffee would recommend that you get your own grinder and grind whole beans yourself, if you're just starting out, there's nothing wrong with getting a week's worth of beans and having them grind it for you at the shop (french press requires coarsely ground beans. Tell them it's for a press and they'll know what to do).

Scope out your neighbourhood; is there a coffee roaster nearby? If not, is there a coffeeshop that sells locally roasted beans? If not, is there a grocery store that sells micro-roasted (ie. not Folgers or Nabob) beans? Worst case, you can order beans online.

tl;dr: a french press costs about $25, and when combined with freshly roasted beans will give you great tasting coffee.","1362096925"

I just don't know what the best route is, affording a second bachelors is very difficult because its so many credits. A masters offers potential assistantships to partially waive tuition and a masters degree. I feel like my best option may be to take around 40 CS hours over the summer, fall and spring and then move into the masters program next fall.

I'm assuming you are talking about an ACH debit (meaning a payment directly from your checking account) because payments via credit card shouldn't take this long.  With ACH debits, it takes so long because the person pulling the debit has to request the funds from your bank, who has to verify that you have funds, then send the funds, then the receiving account has to process the funds, deposit them, and then sometimes they will even wait a little longer to make sure you aren't going to pull the funds back (which you can do relatively easily through your bank).  Even after all this, an ACH debit shouldn't take 4 business days, but it really depends on your bank and the receiving account's bank.  Every bank has its own timeframes.","1362096939"

My guess is that a professional welder could get it to work, but you and I would have trouble.

I have in my garage an old series of popular mechanics books that describe how to make your own anything.  I'm searching for a digital version of it right now.

Be certain that you build some local circuit protection into your device.  Everytime you touch the stick to the metal, you're going to blow a fuse/trip a breaker.

- Innocent: She is your bride who has ""saved"" herself for marriage and it's your wedding night. Or you are a seductive playboy and she is an innocent virgin who you want to seduce and corrupt. Or you are an aggressive predator who targets her and ""force"" yourself upon her, she plays the ""unwilling"" victim who eventually gives into your domination (""rape"" play).

- Adventurous: Anything really goes with this one - could range from choosing something you haven't explored before (i.e. if you haven't done anal play or bondage or impact play or whatever but have been waiting to try) to making a sex tape to having sex in public to having a threesome - really it is completely dependent on what your boundaries and what you consider ""adventurous"".

- Elegant: I'm thinking romantic scenes with this one? Maybe you'll set up a nice bubblebath for the both of you and share some wine. Give each other sensual massages. Prepare some snacks (i.e. chocolate, small pieces of fruit), blindfold her and feed her bits of food (you can also share food by feeding her the food through your mouth or engaging in kissing when she's been fed).

NJT could either have several thousand commuters impacted by potential pedestrian accidents (investigations can delay trains for hours), not to mention the bad press...

or they could just cover their asses and put up a fence which impacts a few dozen people, all of whom are disobeying NJT rules and state law, and many of whom were crossing recklessly and endangering others. What are they losing in ticket sales? Maybe $500 a day? That's chump change.

We don't live in Nebraska, there are two other stations within a mile (OK 1.2 miles) and both have adequate parking space. Woodridge and Essex St are so close already I'm surprised Teterboro even exists at this point. Then again, the article states that they may shut it down, which for once actually seems like a sensible decision on NJT's part.


*And by the way, NJT could run their trains for years with little to no ridership. Just look at Amtrak, 2012 was their best year in 38 years, they only recorded a loss of $381 million. ","1362096941"

Ever since him, it has been really hard to make friends (i.e. I have none)...I try.  I call or text people to hang out. Either they ignore me or blatantly say no.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I'm not going to try to eviscerate your comment completely because I feel there is some truth to what you are saying, yet I have to say something because I feel you are more misinformed and your view of certain concepts is skewed.

&gt;Before you say ""it's cause of poverty!"", blacks are only 2.7 times as likely to be in poverty[2] . If you were to create some sort of crime/poverty index, in which crime rates are adjusted for poverty, blacks would still be way more likely to commit crime.

You can't simply take two number and attempt to completely explain correlation vs causation with such a complex issue. When it comes to stats you can create any story you want and this is exactly what you did in this instance. What about over representation? Accumulation of wealth through the years? Social policy and funding? Historical context? Etc.

In this instance, you are trying to fill in the blanks with the story and are missing the big picture. 

The over representation of blacks within the criminal justice system is far more complex than simply saying they commit more crimes. The fact that they are 2.7 more likely to be in poverty plays into the context, but you leave out much of the complicated social dynamics attached to it. The reality is that in North America, when a black person commits a crime, people are much more likely to notice and report it. Once a police comes along, they are more likely to get charged and when they go to court, they are likelier to receive a stronger sentence. (I can source this if asked, no time now. It's in a number of journals I have read through)

The system is stacked against them at every turn. In this instance, their ""culture"" is actually a counter culture that emerged against the rest of society that had ostracized and alienated them for years. 

The thing I completely disagree with, is that you say it is part of THEIR culture. It's is not about the fact that they are black, but more so about the fact that they are a MINORITY within society. 

As a contrast - the same crime/poverty/overrepresentation scenario plays out the same way for aboriginals in Canada, and they are not black. Yet, they face the same historical socio-economic realities as black people in America, and are much more likely to commit a crime, go to court, and go to prison that white people. 

So basically, when you have a group of people who are visibly different than another group, the one who holds less social power on the micro level of day to day living as well as the macro dynamics of social super structures, the minority are far more likely to be accused, tried, and sentenced than those in power. It's part of the social dynamic and happens in increments throughout the socials structure. 

I'm not saying black people don't commit more crimes in the united states, but it is far too easy for you to jump to the conclusions why. It's not that simple, and the fact that you find your conclusion and fill in the facts to fit your view is deceptive. 

Don't get me started on your completely subjective generalization of only being a victim of crime from black people. I'm sick to my stomach reading you using stats to validate your argument, and then throw a subjective narrative to the mix. Not only that, human memory is fallible at best. Also, one point of data is worthless. 

Again, my intention is not to insult or insinuate, only to point out that it's just not that simple. And considering the historical and social context, it is a cop out to simply point the finger at their ""culture"". This negative ""black culture"" does not propagate itself through all black cultures around the world - in many ways it is a response that has risen through years of oppression. It is a social construct. So should we further alienate a group which has a number of issues to overcome, or do we work together to remove racially charged social policies, with the aim of making everyone more equal?

Also, your final line of text is quite ironic considering the context; 

""If you can't see the situation for what it is, we're never going to create the right solutions to fix it."" 

That is exactly my point, and the reason I replied.


Source - worked in data analysis in the Criminal justice field for years, and a sociology major. Also, for contextual purposes I feel I should point out that I am white.

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","I can only speak for myself, but when was at my worst I insisted on working (as a salesman ) while the anxiety was there and confronted people like normal. I did that because i would not let it stand in way of things that i would normally do, its just a feeling right? Sometimes when i did certain tasks or did something fun that gradually consumed more and more of my conentration (organizing files?), i would find myself after a couple of hours noticing that the anxiety was gone and i was a lot less stressed. Point is: i see your point :p

What i used to do was when the anxiety was going on and all the negative thoughts and feelings etc would occure, i would write them all down. Every bit, just small words or sentences. Then when I was in a state where the anxiety was gone or similar, i would go over those notes and argument against them. It was interesting to reflect over, because every single time i would proove those notes wrong and ""stupid"", altough i knew how real they would feel when they were going on.

So i guess i would try to find the comfort you find in organizing files other places to. Try to modify your work so that it will take so much effort of your head it wont allow any other thoughts to occure. Set goals like: ""This task usually takes two hours, i am going to make it in one."" 

I dont think you should do the old method and fight it for hours, but always strive to expand the method that works. Maybe try to multitask while organizing files?

Hope that helps, this is just from my own experience! :)

A couple of suggestions:

- Feedback when at least 1 item is placed on the shelf. I feel like it is inconsistent to not show anything when items are there; this shouldn't be some kind of secret chest. CATCH: Perhaps if there is a single map item, it could look invisible as if it were lying flat on the shelf in the dark, and no one can see it.) Also, stacks of paper should probably be allowed on the shelf. It's useless except for making books, but relevant.
- In addition to the boost given to the Enchantment Table when books are on the shelf, Enchanted books bias nearby enchanting tables towards higher point values for the corresponding enchantment. A full shelf of all books with the same enchantment increases odds that the enchantment is offered by the table.

And if you really want to go crazy with this:

- Craft 4 of these bookcases together in a small square (like how you make a workbench with wood) and get a 4-sided bookshelf, and have each side behave as storage! Not sure how to best balance this with the enchantment table enhancements - perhaps only the face pointing towards an enchantment table would affect it and the others are for storage only?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Im a very long story teller

I went to the lake with my cousin in the summer of 2010 with my cousin ""Tyler"" and his dad, stepmom, stepsister ""Anna"", her friend ""Heather"" my cousin's friend ""Jim"". We started drinking and were pretty wasted. Tyler and Jim had struck a deal with each other wherein Tyler would try to get with Heather and Jim would try the same with Anna. All good, except for Anna was 14 and Jim was 20. I seemed to be the only one with the issue with that fact, but I was drunk and didn't want to cause a problem.

We get into a tent and start playing Truth or Dare. It starts with Tyler daring Anna to kiss Jim. They do, and then Jim dares Heather to do the same to Tyler. It escalates throughout where I get dared bullshit things like walking around the campground naked and shit, while everyone else is getting ""dared"" to get a handjob. Eventually, I get asked by Anna truth or dare, but I knew where the whole night was ending so I dared myself to go out and smoke a cigarette.

As I was smoking it, Jim and Heather went into another tent and what happened next is pretty clear. I end up keeping watch because we're all under 18 except for Jim. I spend 2 hours sitting around a campfire drinking a 12 pack of six point and chain smoking a pack. I end up half-passing out and I hear a zipper, and then my cousin say ""shit.""  I get slapped in the face a couple times. I open my ears and say ""Hey! What does this smell like?"" And breathes into my face. Yeah, teenage girl vagina.

TL;DR
Got wasted. Pretty sure statutory from my ""friend"" to my cousins stepsister. Passed out. ","1362096959"

"NaturalBeauty","t5_2s4dv","Everything! Just about every fruit and vegetable is good for your skin somehow - if you have specific concerns you can Google to figure out what will work best. Anytime I'm cooking and I feel like a face mask, I just squish up whatever produce I'm using, sometimes with a little oil or yogurt or honey, and slather it on. 

Clay masks are a big hit with just about everyone... The best type of clay depends on what kind of skin you have, but you can use any kind of clay - just go easy if you have sensitive or dry skin. Mix the clay with a little water, a touch of apple cider vinegar, oil, honey, yogurt, whatever you want!

As already mentioned, pure honey maks (raw, unfiltered honey is best) are great! Add a few drops of water to change the texture from sticky and messy to slippery and silky. I also love masks with ground oatmeal. You can use herbs and spices in your masks as well (fresh is best). For instance, thyme is great if you're acne-prone. I lovelovelove turmeric... To avoid the skin-staining, always mix turmeric with a fat, like plain full-fat yogurt. Also, a caution on the nutmeg - you may love it, but if you have sensitive skin like mine, beware!

Basically, you can mix and match whatever ingredients you want. Always remember to moisturize following a mask, unless there was plenty of oil in it already!

It's a little involved, but here's the mask I'm wearing right now... Take a small handful of oats and saturate them with water, then mash and squish them to get a bit of milky, slippery oaty water. Throw the oats away and use the oat-water to make a thick paste with white clay (less harsh than other clays, plus the white is a great background for the yellow). Add a dollop of raw honey, a glob of full-fat Greek yogurt, a couple of pinches of turmeric, and mix it all into a gorgeous yellow paste.

Cocoa powder is also awesome. A little honey, a little cocoa powder and a crushed strawberry makes another delicious mask. And coffee is great for firming and tightening and giving a little glow... just keep in mind that the caffeine will absorb through your skin!

Here is [a recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/17cv9w/hey_rnaturalbeauty_what_is_your_favorite_facial/) on facial masks, and [here's one](http://www.reddit.com/r/NaturalBeauty/comments/1570et/list_of_things_to_put_in_a_facial_mask/) that's a little older.

*The second post mentions glycerin. It can be great, but I just want to point out that if you use it, it's important to mix it with a little water before putting it on your skin. If glycerin isn't already hydrated, it can pull water from your skin instead of helping to moisturize.","1362096964"

I'm going to clarify this if you dont mind.

What actually happened, the auxiliary feedwater system valves were manually left shut. The pumps weren't disassembled....the pumps worked fine...but there was no way for them to get water out. This was against the technical specifications of the station, as both aux feed pumps being inoperable requires a shutdown within 13 hours. The maintenance workers mis-interpreted the valve positions and did not realize they were closed after maintenance.

There were a LOT of other failures....trying to pin it just on the aux feed system is ignoring the fact that there was a maintenance fuckup that caused the loss of normal feedwater. Then there was a broken PORV valve (which another plant already had an issue on....and they should have fixed). Then there was the operators manually shutting off the emergency core cooling system because they misinterpreted the data.

Sex is very intimate for a lot of people, and people spend years in therapy for things like this. It's much more rare that someone seeks therapy because a salesperson was manipulative. The other reason I think it's different is that unless someone has an agenda (like a salesperson who is intentionally shady for a reason - to sell you a car, a person can be intentionally shady just to get sex) it is just so easy to avoid! All you have to do is communicate. If more people realized this and fewer people saw a stigma around sex and talking about it, I think we'd see a drastic drop in rape and sexual assault.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;No, it isn't. I think you're as confused about rhetorical questions as you are about gender. I specifically told you self-identification is a part of this, and then you asked ""but what if they had all the outward characteristics, but don't actually have all the outward characteristics because the thing we just established as a component is missing"" as though that made any sense whatsoever. That's not a rhetorical question, that's just you not following the conversation.

When you state that gender is the outward appearance and mannerisms of a person and I present a case where that is not the point, then yes I would say I am following the conversation.  Gender isn't about outward appearances, it's not about how you dress, how you act, or whether you do ""manly"" or ""girly"" things (which is the textbook definition of gender).  That is the point I am making.  Gender is something more abstract, to the point where I am not really sure anymore that we have a definitive outline for what is gender male, and what is gender female.  so since there is no real external devices for determining gender the only visible reference is biology, it is that point where I ask does it matter anymore?

&gt;It's 100% about sexuality, do you seriously not know the difference between ""sexuality"" and ""biology?"" I can't believe I'm having to explain this but sexual orientation is not biological sex.

No shit, if you understand words as well as you previously claimed then this should be simple, but let me rephrase.  If sexual orientation determines gender, that would imply that homosexuals are transgender, which they are not.  So gender is not biological sex, not sexual orientation, and not the social association applied to the biological sex.  Then what is gender?  Gender used to be defined by the social and cultural actions of a person as related to the roles of males and females within that culture, but we have gotten to the point where there are very few inherently ""male"" and ""female"" attributes within our society.  As we move closer to gender equality we lose gender identity.

You assume I can't separate biological sex and gender, I can, I understand it I really do.  This was never even about that, it's about the implication that when someone says he/she they can only be meaning gender, and if the pronoun used doesn't match the gender association the person must be a sexist or bigot.  That is just not true.  I have problems with the association because I don't see the gender issue the same way that you do.  I am more than willing to identify a transgender person in the manner they want to be identified as, however when talking to another person I may choose to use the pronoun matching their biological sex as to ensure that the other person understands the situation, you seem hell bent on assuming he/she means gender only, and in all cases. 

&gt;""Heterosexual white male doesn't understand why labels are important, wouldn't be bothered by them, can't figure out why anyone else would. Film at 11.""

Well done you managed to prove you don't understand since I clearly stated I am not white, and while it does irritate me to be seen as white, I don't feel I have to correct everyone that calls me such.  I understand I have a skin color that can be seen as white, I understand that it has probably allowed me to avoid issues about my race in the past, but that by no means suddenly makes me the privileged child of society.  As for the delve into our collective past you have no idea how hard my past was, and I have no idea how hard yours was neither of us know how hard this kids will be it is all subjective.  This isn't the 50s being gay, or transgender, or anything isn't the crippling stigma that it once was.  We all face hardships, we either work through them and use them to change our outlook on life, or we allow them to fester within us and create distorted views on reality.  

&gt;You are not privy to her biological sex

The article tells you the biological sex so yes I am.  The discussion about the proper identification is the crux of this argument.  As I have repeatedly stated I have no issue with identifying a transgender person with their desired gender, complete non issue.  When I am talking impersonally about them I reserve the right to use the nomenclature that I feel best meets the needs of the conversation, it is not an attack on theirs or any other transgender persons views about gender, it is about the fact, and it is a fact, that the pronouns he/she can be used to describe both a persons biological sex and/or their gender and still be correct.

&gt;That respect is entirely one sided at this point.

Be that as it may I will still not attack you personally, or insult your intelligence.  You have proven my point in your final paragraph so I can leave this conversation knowing that I am justified in how I feel and that even someone who is staunchly opposed to my beliefs does in fact agree that the impersonal discussion of such matters does not matter as long as the person in question is secure in their knowledge of themselves.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; In order for voter to discrimination to occur, there has to be a failure of ethics in multiple places of government

No. In order for voter discrimination to occur there has to be failure in _one_ place in government. 

The legislature can (and has) gerrymanded districts, they can (and have) passed voter id laws that amount to very illegal poll taxes, they can (and have) passed laws barring felons but, not surprisingly, only in states where a majority of felons are black.

The executive can (and has) placed voting machines in majority white districts making it take about 5 mins to vote there, while doing the exact opposite in black districts, making the voting take hours. The executive can (and has) produced blatantly fraudulent ineligible voter lists (usually of felons that aren't really felons) but, again, only in states where the majority of felons are black.

So I hope this demonstrates that state legislatures and executives have and have tried multiple means of voter discrimination. Now you can start to argue that things like voter ID, or banning felons aren't _really_ discriminatory because they don't single out a race but please don't. Save your breath and my time, because we both know exactly what's going on.

Now why would the executives or legislatures do such a thing? I could tell you RACISM!!!, but I won't. It's so much simpler: Blacks vote monolithically Democrat, southern state legislatures and governors are Republican. Even if we discount racism altogether (which would be silly, but let's) Republicans would still have the motive of power to suppress the black vote.

They have means. They have motive. It's only the sometimes watchful eye of the Feds that keep the opportunity away from them, and even that is sporadic at best, as you can see by all the attempts of places like Florida.

Also, let me posit something for you:

&gt; I think the VRA becoming more unanimous over time would suggest that it's not needed.

"SimCity","t5_2ryr3","This is a challenge from a planning perspective. The tools don't lend themselves well to it and thus you'll bulldoze a ton to get a perfect spiral that is high density zoned for each rung. I was able to use condensed S curves to much better effect due to the constraints of some of the road tools. You really need to know shortcuts and appropriate means to achieve desired results. When the game comes out it will be easier to exchange these tips with others. It'll take time to learn the ins and outs.

If you want to engage in this for a neighborhood design I think it is effective as it increases the length of commute, encouraging mass transit options, should you provide them. My suggestion though is to have rail at the center, because buses take a very long time to navigate to the core of said spiral. I've done condensed S roads, but I recommend incorporating rail into its design as an outflow that doesn't rely on roads to move people. A tip when doing this is to use high-density roads for the template, but for the most part use low density the further you are from the juncture to the main aterial road. 

Make the first S form in high-density, downgrade to low density, then continue the curve form from the original high-density, increasing each rung 1 road density. Low, low-medium, medium-high, high. Having a train intersecting your S curves at a mid-point provides a great pooling point for passengers engaging in mass transit options. Try to incorporate mass-transit hubs, it'll help you peel traffic easier. By the time your high density roads engage the avenues, you can eventually upgrade these to high-density with street cars, which your high-density residential can utilize very effectively, without engaging the road with a vehicle.

Loretta's a great character. I can't recall many witty, strongly-written teenage girls on TV. But I think the actress is working with another show for now. Hopefully they'll get her back, since they've managed to work Winona in despite Natalie being busy with other shows. According to an interview by Graham Yost they would consider adding Jackie Nevada in again depending on fan reaction. She's in the book ***Raylan*** if you're interested. Personally I'd prefer to see Lindsey again. And what's going on with Cassie St. Cyr? She just gave up her grudge with Boyd and left? I'd be sad if none of the ladies made a comeback.

Yeah, Tim's plot is kicking into high gear starting next episode, according to [this interview](http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2013/02/talking-to-jacob-pitts-about-justified-tk-and-eurotrip/). Hooray, finally. And as if

Sometimes I think Wynn isn't so bad, like when Quarles is doing his freaky thing and both me and Wynn are looking [like so](http://i.imgur.com/NQp09qQ.gif).

* Yield: the point at which elastic deformation ends, and plastic (permanent) deformation begins^1
like if you bend a paper clip far enough, and let go, the bend stays there.

* Tensile strength: maximum tension stress that a material can take without fracturing^1

* Annealing is a heat treating process that allows for internal stresses from casting or manipulation to be relieved from the material body. I seem to recall its at about 800C for mild steels

* elongation is stretching, basically.

So, in effect, this laser printing process allows for part creation with better crystal bonding (both actual and resistant to deformation given similar loads/stresses) and less internal stress.

All 12 steppers (the ones who aren't repeatedly relapsing because they've never developed proper coping skills) refuse to move on with their lives clinging to [12 step mythology](http://www.salmonriver.com/articles/drug.html), because they're too afraid to face reality on their own.

From your first paragraph where you feel you must warn the OP that [there just isn't any other way to get and stay sober without working a program and genuflecting to the false god of AA](http://www.morerevealed.com/library/coc/chapter5.htm), you succeed in nothing more than showing why the program doesn't work. Then you use one of the [favorite baseless AA aphorisms](http://12stepsource.com/Pages/AA_Quotes.aspx): ""You might not be an alcoholic."" Because if anyone knows that no ""real alcoholic"" can make it on their own it's you.

The OP clearly states that they're three months sober, however, 12 step automaton that you are you just totally ignore that information for more meaningless [step talk.](http://peele.net/faq/harass.php)

I remain somewhat amazed at how the ill-informed can even begin to think that people who have chosen a life of personal powerless, and devotion at a pathological level to their own worst base instincts can be viewed by any one with a room temperature IQ as being capable of helping someone when they refuse to help themselves. 

You and your fellow cult participants have reduced life down to the language of non-thought, where even the most complex or the least trivial of life's problems are reduced to tired cliches, trite aphorisms, and circular logic of a clearly pernicious nature. 

Your religion is Alcohol-ism, and it's practiced with the same fact free fervor and false certainty of absolute ideas that fundamentalist factions of every major religion continue to delude themselves with; secure in the false knowledge that they alone have the real answers.

The saddest thing is how all 12 step programs remain a closed feedback loop of bad, often harmful, information. AA and all other 12 step groups stress alleged immutable doctrine and dogma over self-efficacy, group direction over self-direction, personal powerlessness over self-empowerment, never ending recovery over recovery and moving on with your life. In doing this they create a false world for their members to hide in.

Is there really any mystery as to why so many people prefer to not waste their personal time in a perpetual state of victim hood. Most times AA doesn't work, no matter how hard you work it.

I was horrified.

My friend was a nice person from a nice family and had absolutely *no idea* what he was getting himself into.

I tried to tell him that they were both of age and could do what they like but he was my friend and that he was making a terrible, terrible mistake.

(2)The Gerstein Center - another great mental health resource - it is a place to go if you are in mental health crisis and need a place to stay for the night. They have counselors on staff.
Now for the less urgent issues: 
(3) Covenant House is specifically geared toward youth and have drop-in counseling services - they are open 1PM-7PM M-T and 9-5PM F. 
(4) Again, I can't help but mention the Evergreen Youth program (which I spoke about in my previous message) at the Yonge St Mission. They also offer drop in counseling services, hot meals, tons of support. 

Also, do have a look at 211toronto.ca. They have more resources listed there that I have not mentioned because I do not know much about their programs. If you have any other questions let me know.

I don't use many processed foods now, and that's what populates most coupons, so I don't use many coupons.

I'm also particular about personal care items (only liking one kind of toothpaste or deodorant) so those coupons aren't useful either.

You don't often see coupons for brown basmati rice, coconut oil, or apples! And if you did, there'd still be a store or bulk brand that was cheaper, even after the coupon.

&gt;""Mrs. Joe,"" said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been **all but** choked, and had that moment come to, ""I have brought you as the compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.""

&gt;In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after dinner; that he **all but** realized Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o'clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.

&gt;The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, ""Here they come!"" ""Here they are!"" and we were **all but** cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.

The U.S. could roll out a starting rotation of Verlander, Kershaw, Price, and Strasburg/CC/Greinke/Cliff Lee, etc. (you only need 4 for the WBC). That right there would almost be enough to win with a bunch of minor league hitters (only half kidding). 

Their lineup would be something like Trout, Pedroia, Braun, Fielder, Tulowitzki, Posey, David Wright/Longoria, McCutchen, and say Josh Hamilton or Joe Mauer at DH.  That's not getting matched by anyone.

The bullpen would be Kimbrel and then a bunch of hard throwing starters who didn't make the rotation.

Over a large sample size, the DR and maybe Venezuela could put up a fight. That's about it.

Once you have your ereader of choice, go download calibre software, and use that to manage and convert any and all files you may come across as you build your library.    
Say you got a shitwad of books for your (insert ereader here), but decided you wanted a (differently formatted ereader) instead? Plug that bitch in and use calibre to convert all of your files to your new device.     
Calibre is free.    
There's no need to buy a new device when used ones are just as good.

3. Therefore 100% of false reports are reported. Considerably fewer than 100% of actual rapes are reported. 

You need to adjust your statistics for selection bias. You can't figure out what percentage false reports are of rapes without knowing the total number of rapes, both reported and not reported.

As for the DOJ/FBI report--if they could exclude the primary suspect through DNA testing, that means that *somebody* left some DNA around.

As for the rest: I think most people have been there. Early 20's is hard because you're entering true adulthood and no one really knows which way is up. I'm 21 and, right now, I have no friends. I'm breaking away from my family because I'm tired of a lot of the bullshit I get handed while no one bothers to listen to me. The last good friend I had took advantage of me, too. It's rough. 

But I mean, all you have to do is look at every story out there to know that you have to swim through the bowels of hell before you ascend into a greater reality. Right now, you're in the belly of the beast. But that's the best place to relax and think. You're never going to get out of there if you just repeat to yourself ""well, I'm stuck in this shit hole"". No one is going to bother you in there. They probably don't know how consumed you are in the first place. So, how are you going to escape? 

""If there is anything unhealthy in your reactions, just bear in mind that sickness is the means by which an organism frees itself from what is alien; so one must simply help it to be sick, to have its whole sickness and to break out with it, since that is the way it gets better.”--Rainer Maria Rilke

“It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me.” --Stephen Fry

"editors","t5_2qpkc","I'm coming from the colorist perspective here.

I'm assuming you'll be on DaVinci (like everyone these days) or Speedgrade (since it's in your suite).

First, you'll want a control panel. You can try coloring without one, but you'll be slow and inaccurate compared to working with one. It's the same as editing with a mouse vs editing with keyboard shortcuts vs editing with a wacom (more Smoke-y than the Adobe suite, but still). As you progress down the line, you get way faster and better. The Tangent Wave is the budget entry model, skip the MC Color. Next step up is the Tangent Element or a JL Cooper Eclipse CX (and they're both a big step up). You shouldn't need more than this for a _long_ time.

From there, you'll want to go ahead and jump to 32GB of ram. It's cheap (relatively). You'll really benefit from it in AE anyway. Max out your video card (NVIDIA for CUDA in Resolve or the Adobe suite). Opt for a better single card over two worse ones (SLI is useless, you use them as discrete processors). 

RAID 0 is fast, but unstable. You're better off with some kind of RAID 5, 10 etc solution connected through thunderbolt, fibre, SAN, etc. This is _much_ safer and more than fast enough, especially for the XH/DSLR stuff you'll be working with. Redundancy &gt; speed.

[Scopebox](http://www.divergentmedia.com/scopebox) is the defacto scope software. A dedicated scope is better, but scopebox is awesome.

More monitors is better. Typical setup is three. 24 inch (at least 1920x1080) for timeline and controls. 22-24 for scopes. 17-24 for critical video check. The third monitor really needs to be a high end one. The cheapest monitor that's ""qualified"" for color correction (10-bit panel, 3D Luts, etc) is probably the HP Dreamcolor. The cheapest monitor that's actually intended for color correction is the Flander's Scientific 17"" (which is miles better than the HP). The cheapest 24"" is the FSi model lm-2461w (only the 17"" and 24"" are 10-bit panels which you need for color critical work).

This is probably way out of your budget but what I would consider the minimum to do color correction the right way. Of course, you can run DaVinci Resolve Lite on a macbook and call yourself a colorist, but that's like mixing sound with a set of ipod earbuds. At the very least, buy a color probe (something by x-rite) and calibrate your monitor every couple of weeks. This will at least get you kind of sort of close.","1362097012"

In addition, it improved typing skills and all that, since I was forced to type quickly to avoid being killed and all that jazz.

The other thing I can think of is that it serves as a stress relief thing. While there are certainly some games which can increase stress (Dark Souls, I'm looking at you), a lot of them are great at relieving it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 4 years ago when I was in college I vowed that never again would I play this game. I had only played it since I was living so far away from my parents house, knowing the crazy shit that my friends would put me through with that game, they'd probably kill me if they found out I played it.z. Really was too bad, considering this game can be great fun as long as there are boundaries that can't be crossed. 
Anyway, here's the story:

I was playing truth or dare with myself and just four people. My Girlfriend, my best friend, and my secret crush. The very first person to go was my best friend, and worthy to say it got into really intense dares really fast. My crush said ""Hold out your hand"". In it, she put a used tampon she had just taken out. It only went downhill from here.

The second turn went to my Girlfriend, and she chose dare. He asked my Girlfriend if she would stand outside of our dorm room, completely naked waring nothing but a cowboy hat. Believe it or not, she really did it. I think there were only two people who saw, both females, so it's lucky we didn't get evicted.  It wasn't nearly as catastrophic as I thought it would be, but the next dare went really deep.

My Girlfriend was the next to ask. So she asked my crush, and she chose truth. My Girlfriend, who wasn't very experienced in this game (and slightly drunk) simply asked her if there was anyone she wanted to date at this moment. Almost, with no hesitation, she said she wanted to date me. Here's where it all went to shit:

I said I wanted to date her too. As I stated, she was my secret crush, and I wanted to dump my girlfriend for her. The opportunity arose, so I took it. As soon as I said yes, it seemed like everything went in slow motion. I knew someday that I'd like to be with her, but I never knew it would come this soon. There was a huge fight between me and my girlfriend in our bedroom, but I was feelin way too damn good to care. Eventually, I left with my crush back to her place.

That all sounds wonderful, right? Not really. The next day my girlfriend was found in her apartment, flat on the floor, dead. She had committed suicide two hours after I had dumped her. She wasn't old enough to have many people broken up with her in the past, so she took this incredibly hard and I guess she just didn't want to live anymore. We all felt like animals. We had caused this, and we learned the hard way that this game needed boundaries. 

It wasn't too long after that, maybe a week or so, before my crush (or current gf) and myself went on a date. We went to this beautiful cafe, and ordered some coffee and biscuits, which came to $4.95. As we sit down with this aromatic food, the waitress comes up to me and says ""Sir, you forgot your change. Here's a Nickleback.""

Guns would destroy PvP, but then again, who cares about PvP? But.. what about the gun types? So far in Wasted, with the current guns, adding them would make MineZ a spawnkilling heaven.

His father was an Imperial from Kvatch named Martin Aurelius after the last Septim and his mother an Altmer immigrant named Nariwen from the Isles to Rifften originally but they both ended up meeting in the Imperial city They both came from powerful families but liked to travel and explore. Their son was named Ellrond after a mix of her father and his. After many years and so many adventures together they both passed away. First Martin then Nariwen. (You may ask yourself why woud they both have died so close together when Altmer live longer then men? Well we'll call that poetic license that she couldn't go on without him and died of a broken heart.) With his family gone Ellrond sold the family home and started walking towards his mother's home town thinking to look up an old friend of her's named Mallory when just as he was crossing into Skyrim a foreboding man in a fur coat rode by and a battalion of soldiers sprang from the trees.....Well you know the rest","1362097046"

"JusticePorn","t5_2sokh","the banning of certain items on the chance of hurting someone would snowball out of control; guns, then knives, then anything sharp like pencils and forks. you'll have to draw the line somewhere, it with it comes a lot of responsibility to those that choose to carry or use that item. The laws to purchase a firearm is already very strict, but those who choose to use it in ways just to harm others acquire and use them in less than legal means. 

and the innocent until proven guilty does apply here, since assuming someone might use it to hurt someone is already marking that person as a criminal before anything has happened.

too much of this is ignorance of gun control and responsibility. it may sound crazy to some that open carry is legal, but that's the law (which isn't legal in all states). making more laws such as arbitrary magazine caps or banning guns based on their appearance don't make any sense either (california). what's important is making sure people who choose to carry understand the responsibility of carrying, and i think that part is a lacking in many aspects. just like how doctors need to be retested every few years, so should gun owners, if not more often.","1362097047"

Prop 30 - Has nothing to do with property tax.  It raised income tax on high income individuals only and sales tax for everyone. But most importantly this was a proposition, not an initiative, its not subject to super majority.

Assembly Bill 340 - passed 48-8.  It would have passed supermajority because the democrats have it locked but it didnt need to since it happened in 2012, 2 years AFTER the need for supermajority died.  It only passed after that retarded rule was lifted.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","RE2 is the best game to me for sure. I thought 4 was going to be a good step for the evolution of the series. After Code Veronica and RE0 it was getting pretty evident that there's only so many pendants and jewels we can put into sockets before we get bored. But they decided to keep dumbing down the gameplay and making the plots and enemies weirder. 

I would love to see RE4 gameplay back in a Raccoon city type setting. Bring back low ammo, dark sewers, multiple character perspectives, ambiance and dogs jumping through windows.

I also thought as an action game RE5 was pretty bad. Any action game should allow you to move and aim at the same time. It definitely had some cool looking environments and characters but overall I didn't enjoy it as a RE game or an action game.","1362097062"

When our friends in /r/philosophy repeatedly recommend drug experiences because they will 'open your mind,' they seem to me to be saying that these experiences will reveal things to you that would be otherwise inaccessible.

To some extent it isn't even really bribery.  You can have a pro-oil candidate because he thinks it makes the most economic sense.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","I think many of her issues were spot on. Issues like transphobia or racism are completely legitimate, as well as plenty of others.

She improved both my understanding and acceptance of many issues, but at the same time helped me draw my line in the sand as far as what is a legitimate example of these things and what is not.

I think our biggest point of disagreement was on rape culture. Keep in mind that where we lived is an area that is reasonably progressive, and isn't exactly known for victim blaming, slut shaming, etc. She argued that jokes involving rape were an instance of rape culture. I disagreed, stating that most jokes about rape require the recognition of it being an awful thing for people to find them humorous.

Legitimate examples would include things like cultural appropriation. Being a liberal college town in an area with many american Indians, there were plenty of college girls with faux Indian religious or tribal garb who wore it because it seemed neat. I understood how it could feel shitty for someone of that ancestry to see a bunch of white people who had benefited from their historical mistreatment turning around and wearing items of religious significance because they were fashionable.

This also includes things like Chinese character or tribal tattoos.

I agreed with many of her examples, but observed her own bigotry and that soured me quite a bit. She fucking hated skinny women. Hated them. Hard core.

Pansexuality is a tricky one for me, but my feelings cover most self-identified sexualities. Ones that people come up with so they can have their own special category. Most people I know of who identify as heterosexual have lots of variance as far as what that means. For some it means the only things they enjoy is missionary sex with members of the opposite sex. Others are more open or fluid. I know a lesbian who is in a monogamous relationship with a man. Sexuality is weird, and complex, and shifting.

To a certain extent, everyone's sexual preference is unquantifiable and ever changing. So it seems silly to identify as ""queer"" ""pansexual"" ""Demiromantic"" or whatever else when most of them boil down to one of the standard ""Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual"" with caveats. Because everyone's sexuality is like that.

I was especially annoyed because she objectified men all the fucking time, but never did so with women. She also never showed any strong interest in women as a whole, other than the attraction she formed after someone had given her attention. This lead me to believe she was, essentially, straight, but kept the pan identification for the sake of uniqueness.","1362097064"

That's why we are allowed to burn American flags and speak our minds on the internet or in front of the White House.  Groups like Westboro even exist because of it.  I think it's amazing that a president has authorized the use of deadly force to silence someone that (no matter how extreme) speaks against our country without giving a fair trial.  It seems strange that less people are outraged by such an act carried out by our commander and chief.  Not to mention Obama has set and put in place some of the most strict drug policies that have increased our prison population more than any other president.  Reddit seems to give the guy a pass because he smoked in college (imagine if he was caught smoking under his current policies, would he even have a chance at being the president??) and because he did some shitty Reddit AMA.  If a republican pres did half of what he has done, and didn't do, they would be ostracized here.  ","1362097068"

It was a sunny day of july 

when I was walking to the beach

I was walking and not driving

For I'm not very rich



My head glanced to both sides

to watch the ladies do their spins

but I was not expecting

a lady quite like this

Big blue eyes and big round breasts

this lady was the best

I walked right up to her

""I'll put your pussy to the test""

Surprised she gasped

but quickly cought her breath

her big blue eyes gave me that look

*she wants to bang me to the death*

So we went to my home

and that house, it was a mess

lucky me, she didn't care

she just wanted to have sex

clothes went off and lube went on

we were ready, we began

oh my friend it was the night

when I truly was a man.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm not saying they should be anti-mage, but I think they clearly need more damage than they do right now, because they need a good 35-40 minutes to actually out scale others in damage

A decent team isn't enough to keep an AD safe vs certain comps/champions

Mid lane jarvan is a good example. With a E+Q+Passive+R+Ignite combo he can kill any AD carry in that combo and nothing more until they build a warmogs. They won't even have time to flash, and the only thing that stops it is either

1. Avoiding Jarvan completely so he can't chain is combo together, which is hard but not impossible due to his incredible mobility

2. Someone throwing exhaust on Jarvan mid flight

So, an AD needs to get an IE+PD+LW+Warmogs before they'd be ""ok"" against Jarvan, unless it's vayne, kog and trist they would not be able to 1 on 1 him at this point

It will take a good 35-40 minutes for an AD to reach these items, now my issue with this is that most games are simply already decided at this point

AD's have 2 strong points that is hard to replace

1. They have superior tower sieging/pushing, it's really hard to push down turrets vs certain champions as melee

2. They are superior in taking down baron/dragons since they are allowed to put on that constant DPS over a long time where they truly shine

The best examples of AD's struggling was CLG.EU vs WE (or was it Azubu?)

Yellowpete had late game kog'maw, he didn't have 6 items but he was fairly close, the enemy team had a fat Olaf.

Olaf didn't have a single offensive item, he ran in and 1 vs 2 Kog+Support and popped Kog's guardian angel before dying. He simply shouldn't be able to shrug off a late game kog'maw that easily.","1362097069"

On the plus side, you get to see lots of different places, and you will have literally endless airmiles, upgrades, lounge access (free drinks and snacks!), priority loading and all that good stuff.  Make sure you get a rewards visa of some sort so you can bank all kinds of freebies.  Also hotel upgrades.  

On the down side:

It's not easy to stay fit as you'll eat in a lot of restaurants.  Get used to packing some workout gear and make use of the Hotel facilities or go running or something.

There's a good chance that your relationship with your SO will fall apart.  Try and keep things interesting by flying her out for weekends or something using all those air miles.  Relationships take work and you can only do so much.

You may forget what city you're in at some point.  Don't panic, just call the front desk and they'll tell you where you are.

I've maintained a calorie/protein tracking diet over the last 6 years. It's not a crash diet, it's a regulated diet that keeps my protein intake high, and my calorie intake lower (but not radically lower) than my calorie expenditure. This diet has helped me lose fat without losing muscle mass.

After 6 years, I'm still hungry.

Whenever I stop tracking what I eat, it takes only a few weeks before I start seriously underestimating the calorie content of foods, and eating more than I require. Over the course of a few months, I gain weight. The effort of a year of careful eating is easily undone.

My wife doesn't have hunger such as mine. She doesn't have to spend any effort to maintain her figure. She's attracted to salt; I'm attracted to sugar. One of those doesn't have calories; the other does. For me, it never gets easy. Remaining in good shape is contrary to my biological desires, so doing that is a daily challenge.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Now I'll explain my issue: libertarians are the ones who have their inalterable list of commandments written on a 200 year old piece of paper. Libertarians have a fervently ideological world view - freedom is the only way and any other way is evil. Liberals, by contrast, have a very fluid world view. Liberals are largely about taking the next step, and adapting to specific situations.

That is a strawman to say that everything libertarians believe is based on the constitution. the constitution is the last beacon of hope for libertarians. the last tool we have to defend our freedom. Liberals are not about the next step. They don't think about the fact that most of the previous steps haven't worked or reached a point of diminishing returns and nothing actually changes. It is based on a false pretext that the government can provide solutions.

I will grant you that the hole in my argument is that I didn't say deistic dogma. It would have been more accurate to say that liberal atheists like to replace one deity with another. A dogma as defined by webster dictionary is just a point of view defined as authoritative. I feel that pretty well describes the left.","1362097077"

About not always worrying about 'Where is the study?

"Epic40k","t5_2tq8b","I've only used the Armageddon rules, seeing as It was my first entry into the game, it was the one I learned in the hopes of playing against someone. I believe the NetEpic rules are widely considered to be the best as they combine the details of the early versions with the streamlining of the latter. From what I remember from when I looked a few years ago, I think that probably is the case, but I stuck to what I thought would be most popular (Also I do remember the NetEpic Titan rules being *very* complex).

Personally I don't see much problem with Armageddon, as IMHO Epic should be a game of strategy, not character special rule gimmickery. It works just fine, I don't think I'll switch unless I've compelling reason to do so.

I just checked the stats for my army; my force was made from the basic detachments that you can get in the Codex Astartes Army List within the Armageddon rulebook, and is 1500pts, but it says in the book that Tournament rules are for armies between 2000pts and 5000pts (and mine stands unfinished to his day). But that could very well be flexible depending on where/who you play, I spose.

All I know is that you have to take detachments rather than getting to pick individual units as you like (e.g. the tactical detachment is fixed at 6 tactical bases). But that's SM, the Orks army list is different, for example. I've not learned all the rules for all the armies lol, but I'm sure that all the detachments have minimum unit requirements and maximum limits.

I suppose you should look at how the army lists for each ruleset work and compare them to see if there's anything that doesn't stand in common ground. And of course, check to see which is being used around in events and such.

I'm sorry if my lengthy comments are unhelpful.. :$

And you're assuming that I agree with those Americans complaining that nobody in Paris speaks English, which I don't. And, just like being raised differently doesn't make it wrong, being raise a certain way doesn't make it right either. 
Let's take something else that was a longstanding tradition: owning slaves.  Throughout every period of history that we have records of, people owned slaves. If you were the son of a slave owner, you were raised believing that it was totally cool to own slaves, and if you were born a slave, you were raised believing that that's just how it is, you are a slave and that's the end of the story.  Does that make it right to own slaves? No, it does not.

In the same way, having countless generations of masters holding a sexist view doesn't make it alright for him to hold and act on a sexist world view.  Sure he eventually trained Katarra, but he made her jump through hoops that the Aang and the other male students didn't have too, just because she was a girl, because he had made and assumption about her and her abilities to fight based on her being female. It was unnecessary, and it was insulting.

To further prove my point, let's look at how I was personally raised.  I was raised by a pretty damn racist family, and as a result for most of my life held some racist views and acted on them. I assumed things about people and called them insulting names based on their race. I was raised this way, people in my family have been raised this way for a very long time. Would you argue that it was alright for me to be a racist asshole because my family had believed all that stuff for a long time? I doubt it.","1362097081"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I just bought the Topeak Journey Trailer this Christmas. Till now I just rode 200 km test ride with it, so my experience with it is not very extensive. But I've liked what I've seen till now. I have no experience with other means of bike touring so the comparison is also hard to make. Also I have no experience with other trailers.

I chose the Topeak Trailer because it was a lot cheaper than the 'market leader' the Bob Yak, could get an extra discount at my LBS and the reviews I read it didn't came up with negative points that could be deal brakers.

The 'attaching mechanism' is practical, you just have to replace the quick release thing (sry English term lacks a tiny bit) for one you screw in place with an Allen key. I am going to order this part extra as back up. If the quick release is replaced with the topeak device, attaching the trailer to your bike is a simple twist-turn-twist back movement. Easy does it!

I had the wheel inspected by my LBS and it was fine. The standard tire is actually ok and I bought an extra tube as a spare.

I was really happy with the way it handled. For the test ride I loaded it with what I expected to bring with me on my big tour this summer (holland, belgium, france and back). It was stable, I could ride no-hands if I wanted to and the speed is what I would have guessed (but that is personal).

Obviously there are some downsides, but these are all related to using a trailer, not specifically the Topeak one. Making U turns required quite a bit of room, it is not practical in handling when you are not on the bike, need a solution for a decent stand.

I am very happy with it. I really want to take it on the road more!! Long post... Hopes it makes sense!","1362097082"

He's just not a friendly person or a good teammate.  He thought he was the center of the world at BU, and he continued that same line of thinking after being drafted 1st overall and getting that ludicrous contract.  He's a naturally gifted athlete who has never tried very hard.  I'm not going to spend the time to find articles and links to back all of this up, but if you don't believe me then do the research.  Rick DiPietro is not a classy guy and hasn't been an NHL caliber goalie for awhile.

I understand it must have been hard for him to be waived.  And I think that the fans should lay off him for being injury-prone.  But I can name 10 NHLers that are injury-prone, yet work their asses off and are loved by teammates.  I'm shocked that so many people here are suddenly feeling so deeply for him.

The reason they were called concentration camps is that their whole purpose was to help the Jews learn such huge levels of concentration that they would be able to develop mental powers such as telekinesis, being able to become invisible, and being able to self destruct. 

The reason the jews were picked for this is due to their already high levels of concentration developed from centuries of being accountants, bankers and vampires. 

Anyway the reason most of the people in the pictures had no hair was that the ability to stop hair growth was the first stage of gaining super powers. In fact having facial/body/head hair was seen as a sign of failure and most people who couldn't stop hair growth were shipped of to camps like Auschwitz so they wouldn't be able to corrupt the genes of those with super powers.

Pero lo que no entiendo es porque ese afan de insistir en ""vamos a poner el nombre de nuestro pais en alto"". No creo que el que ganes o pierdas tenga que ver en nada con Mexico. Tu diseño tiene algo de mexicano? Algun estilo, material, color o algo que lo distinga como mexicano respecto a los demas? No me lo parece.

Given that most moutains are shaped like a cone, although we can allow for some dispersal of heat out of the directly vertical, you can easily see that the heat which rises does not contact the top of the mountain, resulting in the cold conditions, as the heat just floats on by.

You cant.

You need electricity to activate the automatic depressurization system to depressurize the reactor so non-ECCS pumps can inject water to the core in the first place. No portable pump is capable of injecting into a pressurized reactor core because the pressures are so high. ECCS pumps are three-phase 4160 volt 2000+ horsepower pumps.

Additionally, you need decay heat removal (Venting), to remove boiling. You also need a cold suppression pool to be capable of accepting the entire energy content of the reactor vessel during the emergency blowdown.

The accident required a LOT more than seawater to prevent. Putting seawater in would not have fixed anything. Especially when you consider unit 2 had coolant injection for 70 hours, and unit 3 for ~32 hours. ","1362097099"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","In adding to other excellent answers here there is something neat to be aware of. Not necessarily at the level of representing trees, but at being able to ""control"" activation in certain areas of the brain....

A researcher, at Duke I believe, has been placing patients in a persistant vegetative state into a scanner and asking them simple yes or no questions. If yes, they are asked to imagine performing a motor task. Like swinging a tennis racket. They are asked to pay particular attention to how their arms are moving and where their legs are placed etc. If no, they are asked to imagine walking through a particular place. They are asked to pay particular attention to the location of objects and where they are in relation to them as the move through this place.

The idea is that two very distinct areas of the brain become active during these processes. The motor area and the visual/spatial representation area of the brain. He's found some success in communicating with a small number of PVS patients. But the point is if you stuck a healthy person in an FMRI and asked them to think about broad concepts like a piece of music, a motor movement or a visual picture I think you would get better results more in line with what you're thinking of.


Also, if anyone knows the Duke researcher I'm talking about I'd love to know. A quick google search yielded nothing....","1362097103"

Also, took out Sands of Delirium to throw in 2x Cyclonic Rift, as the overload can a) dispatch blockers against your Aberration, b) Combo with said Aberration and c) Save you mid-late game. 

It's not an easy deck to optimize. Sideboard is your friend - longer game, go with the Rifts. Turbomill, go with Sands.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well, let's start with some facts, shall we?

1. The default rate on DOE projects is around 3.6%. The WH predicted around 12.85%...so bankruptcies and defaults are well below prediction. 
2. About 90% of the loans went to companies that were centered around clean-renewable power production. 

So far so good.

Further analysis of the programs that failed showed despite large initial losses (still inside the 3.6% figure) a good portion of the funds were recouped due to buyout from private equity after the fact.

So that means for our investment we get a few, wonderful things:

1. Jobs.
2. Industrial investments
3. Clean energy
4. Research
5. minimal losses - far outpaced by gains, especially compared to the private market
6. International competitiveness (for example - China radically subsidized and overplayed the solar market).

I'd call those payoffs. But sure, let's stick with fracking and 'clean coal'.","1362097106"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","While I love law school and the practice of law, it is unarguable that the legal market is terrible right now. The recession really hit the industry hard and law schools have not reduced enrollment to compensate. Unless you go to a top 6 school, it is extremely risky to accumulate 6-figure non-dischargeable debt with limited prospects at getting a job that won't make you a debt slave for the rest of your life. Before you or anyone you know thinks about going to law school, you should read this blog.
http://thirdtierreality.blogspot.com/

That being said. Law is an immensely fascinating subject. In a lot of ways, it's similar to computer programming, where specific syntax, order and placement of signifying terms of art mean everything. You also have the added bonus of having some very ridiculous things expressed in incredibly formalistic terms. I would refer you to Leonard v. Pepsico (case about a guy trying to get a Harrier jet from Pepsi in exchange for 7,000,000 pepsi points) and Mussivand v. David (Negligence by way of transmitting STDs through a chain of people).

I wanted to go because I loved the message of OWS, but hated all the shiftless hippie pseudo-anarchists who came to represent the movement in the public eye. I believe that their approach to diminishing wealth inequality was unpersuasive to the group of people they actually needed to convince. So, I decided to get a suit and some credentials so I could take on OWS dissenters on their own terms.","1362097109"

Shares in a company bear a strong resemblance to a currency. Like a currency, these could be represented in ripple and be bought and sold. At the moment the 5 users to support rule for currencies still applies, so would only be large companies which could consider this.

To issue shares, you need a unique currency code and a company account. This account is only used to issue and repurchase shares, not for regular use. All shareholders trust this account, and only this account. Decide how many shares will be issued, and ""pay"" each shareholder their proportion.

Shareholders can now transfer shares to others. The recipient trusts the company account, then the sender ""pays"" them the shares.

To use any voting rights, the voters could add up how many shares the company account ""owes"" them directly. This is divided by the total number of shares issued to get the proportion.","1362097114"

&gt;Sex with children is rape because the child is under the age of consent

Correct.

&gt;Fantasies about sex with children are fantasies about rape.

Incorrect.

Again, like I said;

&gt;The thoughts about children that these people have aren't necessarily about rape. I know what you're saying is true, that children will always be non-consensual, but in the fantasies of paedophiles that isn't always the case. I've read that romantic interest is just a big a part of the paedophillic wiring as it is a normal one.

In other words, in the fantasies of these people, it isn't necessarily rape, it can be consensual. Now I'm well aware, as I've said said multiple times, that this can only exist in fantasies, because like you've said, children cannot be consensual (though I guess it depends on the age at which you class as paedophillic - though its still rape by law), but my point is that these people aren't necessarily thinking about rape any more than a straight person thinking about a man/woman is thinking about raping them. Fantasies are exactly that, fantasies, and when a person is born to look at *whoever* romantically, be it children, men, women, pots and pans, that is how they will look at them, no matter how unrealistic or warped it is. 

&gt;Something missing from this whole thread is evidence - it so happens studies have been done showing castration actually works

Yes, of course castration works. Destroying the sexual organs of mammals generally does have that effect, but the question here is whether that is the right thing to do, and personally, I disagree. Especially when as you say the approach should be to de-stigmatise and help people. That's akin to telling a man you're going to help with his leg pain by amputating him.

Castrating people who want help is not right, and like I said CBT, counselling and drugs are effective tools to deal with mental problems. Helping people to cope and live *without* acting on these thoughts is the right thing to do in my opinion. Of course, like I said, if someone is to go out and offend and harm a child then of course, punishment is due, but its important to separate rapists who have acted out on urges from people who are sexually attracted to children. They are not the same people. Nobody comes out and says ""I am a paedophile"", so the people who do commit these crimes are very often the only view people have of paedophiles, so its easy to think like this, but castrating people because they are born a certain way is barbaric, no matter the stigma that society has put on them.","1362097114"

[S. 54 (Leahy - VT)](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:s.00054:) **Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act of 2013** - *To increase public safety by punishing and deterring firearms trafficking.* **Impact**: Sets up max 20 year penalty for straw purchase of firearm; straw purchase defined as buying firearm with intent to transfer to another person if that firearm has moved or been involved in interstate or foreign commerce; **Exempts** bonafide gifts (as long as nothing tangible was received in return) as well as firearms as contest prizes provided transferee can own firearm under the law;  Establishes 30 year penalty if there is reasonable cause to believe the straw purchase will be used in crime; Outlines Fines and Forfeitures for a violation, includes forfeiture of proceeds and personal items used to traffic the firearms; Includes provisions to make trafficking ammunition illegal as well (basically cant buy ammunition: for someone who can't buy it themselves, to be used for furtherance of drug crime, or for illegal exportation); Sets up additional penalties for trafficking that will aid crime (max 30 years in addition to 30 years penalty defined earlier; not eligible for concurrent sentencing);  Sets up 10 year penalty for trafficking to outside of the US. 

**Status**: Referred to Committee on the Judiciary

**Personal Opinion**: *Open to the law* - The definitions provided do not forbid gift giving or future private sale of a firearms as long as making private sales was not the original intent of the purchase.  Seems to be focused on doing what it says.  I do not personally see any potentially negative side effects for law abiding citizens.

"HuntsvilleAlabama","t5_2qq6o","The point is the entire economy of the town is based around the federal government deciding (for a few somewhat practical reasons 60-70 years ago that could have easily gone differently) to build a base here and establish Marshal Space Flight Center.  All of the defense contractors here chose the area almost entirely due to the proximity to the Arsenal and MSFC.  They could have set all of that up a dozen or more different places instead, and if they had done so then that place would enjoy all the success that Huntsville has.  

A lot of Huntsvillians tend to forget this and get caught up in the mindset of ""we are special because we are in Huntsville"" while neglecting to remember that ""Huntsville is special because the feds thought some land adjoining the TVA controlled Tennessee River would be a good place for a base and only has a strong economy due to all of the federal money pouring in that follows from that decision"".","1362097116"

Is it entirely ran by corporations?  I'd look at the banks and the BS they pulled a few years and the fact they got bailed out and are doing better than ever now, and I'd agree with that, honestly.

I know if I want to talk to my congressperson, I better be holding a check in my hand to hand to him/her for the honor.

Do I like it?  No.  Is it the reality?  Yep.  And thinking anything less is just unrealistic.  I'd like to think if I contacted my representative that they would listen to me, but I know the truth.

And the same thing WILL happen here if they decide they want it to.  They have the money and the lobbying power.  You know it and I know it.  I don't foolishly sit here and think screaming about it on reddit and signing some online ""petition"" is going to have some sway.

If it did, this 6 strikes rule wouldn't be in effect for the ISPs in the first place.  They would have fought it a lot harder.  

But like my small business and taxes, I could sit here, scream, yell, and fight city hall to save a few bucks, but in the end all I wind up doing is spending more because the only way my voice is going to be heard is if I hire someone to go lobby for me.

About the only thing we have around here is the EFF, I suppose.  But since they already probably yelled BEFORE this took effect and it has now, I would say their screams were drowned out by the screams of one thing.  Money.

&gt;But the trouble is that this kind of burglary - the kind most likely to go ""wrong"" - is now the norm in Britain. In America, it's called a ""hot"" burglary - a burglary that takes place when the homeowners are present - or a ""home invasion"", which is a much more accurate term. Just over 10 per cent of US burglaries are ""hot"" burglaries, and in my part of the world it's statistically insignificant: there is virtually zero chance of a New Hampshire home being broken into while the family are present. But in England and Wales it's more than 50 per cent and climbing. Which is hardly surprising given the police's petty, well-publicised pursuit of those citizens who have the impertinence to resist criminals.

Is is legal to convert the CCU back to the original pistol?

Yes. The BATFE recently published a ruling which clarifies this - here is the link: http://www.atf.gov/regulations-rulings/rulings/atf-rulings/atf-ruling-2011-4.pdf

There has been a lot of missinformation circulating to the effect that once the pistol lower has been asembled to a rifle configuration then converting back to the pistol constitutes 'making a pistol from a rifle' and thereby placing the pistol into the SBR (short barrelled rifle) class. Not so. Please see our Forum for even further clarification. It is the first post on the Forum so you don't have to spend time trying to find it.

This is from the forum at Mech Tech:

There has been considerable discussion out in cyberspace relative to the legalities of the CCU. We have here a definitive ruling from the BATF - when you assemble a pistol lower to the CCU upper you create a legal rifle and when you remove the pistol lower and reassemble the pistol you are NOT creating an SBR (short barreled rifle). All the assembling/disassembling is totally legal from the view of the BATF. The ruling is dated 25 July 2011 - here is the link to the 4 page ruling: http://www.atf.gov/regulations-rulings/ ... 2011-4.pdf
As usual the first 3+ pages are legal obfuscation rather than just stating things in plain English. The real meat of the ruling relative to the CCU is at the bottom of the last page in the first 2 paragraphs beginning with the words 'held further'. Also, in the NRA publication 'American Rifleman' Nov 2011 issue, page 90 (ILA Report column) the following excerpt appears:
""The ruling also states that a pistol can be made into a rifle (for example by adding a long barrel and a shoulder stock), and then turned back into a pistol, without making an NFA 'firearm' ""
FYI , I have attached a PDF's which explain the details.
(Just for drill I have added the Stephen Halbrook/TC Arms decision.)

However, the people of the DPRK are very proud and think highly of their country in some respects. They also largely attribute the failing economy to sanctions imposed on them. Most tourists who make the decision to visit understand that there is good to be seen even in poor countries so the issue does not come up all too often.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","**TLDR: [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/19c4zn/what_do_you_mean_by_evidence/c8mo7dm/)**

1. Yes.
2. Would you mind linking me some of that evidence? The evidence that supports the bible is often flawed or biased, especially if it doesn't follow the scientific method.
3. The reason I use science is because it is simply the study of the natural world. For other schools of thought to make a claim on what they think is true, that thought doesn't have to go through much. For a scientific idea to even be entertained enough to even become a hypothesis, it has to go through some very strict rules and standards (the scientific method). Yes science is open to human flaw, and every scientist will probably admit that. That's the scientific method exists and why science cross references everything in the scientific community with experiments and data. That's why their lab reports and abstracts must be written a certain way. That's why so many scientists disagree with each other. That's why if it's an isolated incident, they will say ""We don't have enough data to study that."" I don't think science can explain everything **YET**. So when you ask ""Does science explain everything?"" Eventually it will, but until then I'm content with saying I don't know. I've heard the argument a lot about how can you really *know* something. I guess you can't but science comes as close to knowing as a human can possibly come and leaves the least amount of room for debate. As for things that science can't explain, there was a time when science couldn't explain fire and we all thought it was magic. Now any typical five year old knows how fire works. There have been many things in history that were explained through supernatural means before science came along. Not a single one of those things turned out to actually be magic so far. People often say ignorant things like ""evolution is just a theory."" That's because they have no idea what a theory is. It is the pinnacle of human knowledge. It will never graduate to a law. It is how we explain something or what is explained by something. For something to be a theory, it must go through more scrutiny than any religious text or claim.","1362097124"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Sure have! I taped up the barrels and Plasti-Dipped without even removing my wheels. The material was still in perfect condition when I peeled it off four months later.

The process:

• If you want it to last long, buy eight cans (two per wheel). I used only four and in direct sunlight, the silver of my wheels shone through the Plasti-Dip. Buy eight, it'll give you more than enough for plenty of layers and extra in case of mistakes.

• Remove your wheels. You can leave them on if you wish, but you must protect the surrounding areas form overspray. It will be easier to simply remove them though.

• Clean your wheels and apply painting tape to areas you don't want to be dipped (WARNING: If your coats aren't thick enough, the Plasti-Dip will stick to the tape and removal will mean a respray).

• Spray each wheel from 6"" away in a sweeping motion. When the wheel is completely covered, move on to the next. By the time you get back, that layer will be dry. Continue until you run out of spray or until you have a satisfactory finish.

• Peel any overspray off the tire walls. It's so easy all you have to do is rub the walls with a cloth and it'll come right off. The wheel lip will keep the rest of the product from following suit.

• Wait about 30 minutes for the wheels to fully dry, then examine your work. If all is well, remount to your car. Since the product is light and is applied uniformly, balancing is not required.

If done right and is well taken care of, it can last well over a year. I know some people on different car forums have had their cars dipped for over two years now.

Plasti-Dip can also be used to customize badges, door handles, and trim pieces as well. For giggles I Plasti-Dipped the back of my iPad in their Blaze Blue.

Here's my wheel right after I finished: http://i532.photobucket.com/albums/ee323/Neonspinnazz/null_zpsa9722fd1.jpg

Why did I remove the dip? A car wash ripped the side skirt off my car. The dealer agreed to replace it under warranty. I was afraid of what the dealer might say about the dip, so I removed it.

Am I going to do it again? Nope. I'm buying new wheels entirely!

I'd say go for it. Buy a cool color off the site (Home Depot and Lowes carry matte black) and have at it. If you don't like it, you can always remove it!","1362097127"

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","Your submission did not meet our posting guidelines and has been automatically removed.

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","My dad is actually a PhD I/O (Industrial/Organizational) Psychologist &amp; he absolutely loves what he does. As far as I understand there are a few directions you can go with the degree, but as stated by a few other comments, graduate school generally recommended to work in the field (as a higher degree or certification is with required with pretty much any undergrad degree in psyc.. I'm currently studying psychology, as well). My dad works in the Organizational Development side of I/O. So he basically does Leadership Development and Organizational Effectiveness for companies. He has worked for a few large companies, like Autotrader.com and Home Depot, helping employees and teams within the business work effectively. In his positions he's been able to create Leadership Development programs and teach people how to be as effective as possible, as well as making sure employees are getting most of their needs met in their positions. He's also done things like work with change management, so if a company is going through a shift in the way they operate, he'll help ease people into the process. He's currently working for a consulting firm called RightManagement that works with org development &amp; he's doing executive coaching, so his work days consist of traveling to different companies and holding retreats and workshops with their executives to ensure that they're doing the best they can be. He gets to go to awesome places like the Biltmore Hotel &amp; just facilitate leadership retreats... He claims that he's living the life &amp; that he couldn't be happier. You can tell he loves it &amp; he always loves to talk about it if you'd like to ask him more questions! He's super passionate about his job - Once you get him going, he can talk about it for hours. 

Like I said, you can do a lot with the degree and there are multiple facets to I/O Psyc, but that's just an example of one direction you can go in! Hope this helps! ","1362097129"

They didn't fight in front of us, and didn't badmouth each other or compete for our love afterwards either. They just acted like adults, which seems to be rare in divorces. 

I think what's kept us close no matter what has been his consistent interest in my life. He always had time to talk or just hang out together. Even now when I live on the other side of the world, we skype or facebook chat almost daily. Make sure to send your daughter letters as well. It's nice to have something physical from a person. My dad has always given me those ""love is..."" cartoons from the paper. He cuts out ones he thinks might be appropriate to my life and then turns them into magnets and sends them to me at the right time. It's a silly little thing but I love it.

 I'm not sure how old she is but I'd imagine her life could really be enriched by a father in another country. That's not an experience many children get to have. It might be hard at the beginning but if you put in the effort to keep involved in her life it will be worth it. 

I married a man in the military so I'm pretty well versed in living far away from my family. It sucks sometimes, and I can't imagine how hard it would be to be away from my child but it's so much easier nowadays and when I do get to see them we cherish every minute.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Assuming you were on the pill before this pack, it's all but impossible for you to be pregnant. The pill protects you throughout the inactive week if taken correctly. 

If you just started the pill this week, it's still vanishingly unlikely that you're pregnant. Your partner didn't come inside of you, and on an unmedicated cycle, you generally won't ovulate on cycle day 3 or 5 (guessing at the number based on the fact that you were still on your period). If you take the pill correctly, you don't ovulate at all. 

Even if you had somehow gotten an egg fertilized, you wouldn't have pregnancy symptoms this soon after. Fertilization takes some time, and it takes several days for a fertilized egg to implant. With the timeline you  gave, you wouldn't even be pregnant yet. 

With all that said, pregnancy tests are dirt cheap and fast. If taking one will put your mind at ease, it's &lt;$1 well spent. ","1362097135"

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","We're a different culture. We're a big city with a lot to do. WTF else is there to do in Lawrence, KS? You might as well go to the football games. I don't think it's a big deal. Some games are bigger than others. I don't think we're self-conscious about our ability to draw fans. That's always going to happen, granted the team doesn't suck like ours does this year.

And I just told you why the student section sucks. It's because DeLoss keeps it so small and so quarantined that a true basketball-loving student section culture hasn't been able to arise. If I was AD (or anyone else who wasn't old, conservative, ageist, and incompetent), things would be totally different. 

Even UT football, as intense as it is, suffers from this ""cheese and wine/social gala"" sports culture. It's not young and populist enough. Last time I went to DKR, I sat in the dreaded ""bluehairs"" section. Even the people I was with (my sister's husband and his father) were stoic, quiet, and reserved like this. I don't get it. It's weird. It's like they're too civilized and cultured to act like sports-crazed hooligans for a few short hours. The appeal of that is lost on them. 

Both the Erwin Center and DKR can be very tough places to play for opponents, but it's only in certain situations or certain games. You're right.

Either way, I still love UT basketball and football. And I'm not going to just let people insult it.","1362097135"

In my very humble opinion the authors did not establish that their method is reliable.
(The original paper appears to be paywalled so I can’t know whether they did.)
Thus my request that they first test it on a corpus with indisputable date.
If the method turns out to calculate sufficiently accurate dates for say 1000 works (can it figure out the correct chronology of Balzac’s novels?) then I might trust it enough to accept those figures it produced for Homer.

You shouldn't judge yourself based on my pictures. I would bet money you are much better looking than I am day to day.

&gt;To be fairly honest, it looks like you could still get in better shape, but you're a good looking guy.

&gt;You lost weight but you're still not in shape. My only advice would be to work harder and keep losing for real. And go to the gym like its your job. I promise things will get better if you work on your shoulders/upper body. That's the only thing that attracted women to me.

I don't deny I still have a some work still to be done. I honestly think that if you lose 90 lbs like I have, there's going to be some fat that sticks. I'm not saying it's impossible to get rid of, but it's 100x harder than the 90 before. I honestly go to the gym more often than my job, at least in quantity of visits (I doubt 9 hrs a day at the gym would be healthy mentally or physically, heh). 

I've been trying IF and yohimbine to get rid of the rest of it off lately; hopefully I'll notice a difference in a month or two. Bear in mind though that I'm 6'1 and am around 175, it's not a huge quantity that I need to lose. I also lift regularly, so the muscles are getting there. Again I'm not saying I'm where I want to be, but I'm beginning to taste it. (Plus the creatine I've started taking has jacked me up quite a bit, so I'm looking a bit bigger muscle-wise.)

&gt;Also, get a little riskier of a haircut, like a fade ala Adam Levine

I'm not sure I could do that style, as my hair is a bit too curly, but I'll ask my stylist what she thinks.

&gt;and grow a beard, get a tan.

Beard was a no go. Doesn't grow in right for me and looks weird, even after trimming it. I do plan on getting a tan, but I have to wait a month for my new tattoo on my arm to completely heal.

I really do appreciate you trying to help. This is really what I want from people: advice trying to help. I really do hope this helps as I've been kicking my ass far too much lately just for it to be moot due to my genetics. ","1362097141"

Morning after a night of winter weather, I knew the roads were slick. Driving slow, breaking light and early. Still slid towards a stop sign onto major road. About a block to the left (driver's side) is the bottom of a bridge over railroad tracks, somewhat steep. Im sliding about 50ft, approaching the sign. Wasn't worried. See an 18-wheeler/semi truck barreling down the bridge. 10ft to sign, still sliding. Worried. Turn the wheels toward curb, controlling my breaking, nothing changes. 5ft to sign. Still sliding. I AM GOING TO DIE. The trucker looks at me a face of 0 fucks, im looking at him thru my life-movie. I finally stop at the edge of the lane, so close snow/moisture is on my drivers door window/hood/windshield from the spray of his tires. Must have been inches.

TL;DR iceroad trucker watches me shit my pants.


The other one, traveling on edges of town, the speed limits increas to 55mph. The road im on intersects and stops at another outskirt road, 55mph. I know the stop is coming, I used the road frequently. I notice my lips are kind of dry, and think if there is anyplace to stop before I leave town for 30min. I then realize in my moment of concern for dry lips, I sailed right trhu the stop sign. I slam the breaks, maybe 30ft past the road im stopped, and look back as a car goes by, maybe 3 seconds after I blasted thru it.

Hmmm... some dark chocolate might have soy lecithin. 

When you think about it, most carby foods are just filler anyway. It's like deciding to stop eating sawdust, or cement (not by accident that they use wheatpaste for glue). You can still have everything else you would eat.

Remember, having the majority of your calories come from fat doesn't mean you have to actually eat large quantites of fat. This is because fat is more calorie dense (9 kcal/g, compared to 4 kcal/g for the other macronutrients).","1362097157"

""But I do truly believe you should rethink your comment about saying saying [sic] that [Obama] asking for revenues is moving the goal post. **I know you may not believe this, but as a friend, I think you will regret staking out that claim.**""

That's from the email.  So I can only assume the conversation contained similar content.  That is a threat over revealing information to a person in the media.  Woodward is simply pointing out the fact that the WH started the sequester that he is now saying isn't the answer and he now wants to start over again on taxing the rich...moving the goal post as he put it.  It's a fact, and they're trying to hide it because it doesn't match the story he's telling the American people.

There is no acceptable case of our government trying to silence the media that I will ever accept.

Then Politico becomes the point person to receive the email, which is insanely partisan and would print whatever he asked them to.

I expect that the revenge they spoke of would be the annihilation of his creditbility, which seems to be happening all over right now.  You can jump onboard with the sheep because you're a partsan tool, or sit back and observe it unfold objectively.  Right now the WH isn't looking like the good guys in this exchange.","1362097157"

That's more of my main problem with this; though fun, it's not a 100% guarantee of attention (or losing it). But then again, what is when you're teaching kids?

You're right that I didn't see the rest of the lecture. However, the 3 minutes does affect my perception of the person teaching for the remainder of the time I have with them. And it also affects how the rest of the students react the rest of the lesson.

It's worth noting I'm partially reacting this way because the situation is more personal to my career choices and opinions. It's nice to hear an opinion from someone who *does* think this sort of thing is helpful to them. Differing opinions are always good to hear from a professional point of view (once in a while).

"Games","t5_2qhwp","**Outcast.** Although it was critically lauded, I have yet to to find anyone to reminisce about this game with.

Released in 1999, it is an open world sci-fi adventure in the vein of Stargate that really sold me on the benefits of 3D adventure games over 2D point-and-click, and introduced (what I recall being) fun shooter elements.

I loved how you had to equip a musical instrument to save the game, but doing so would attract enemies and wildlife to your location if you did it in populated areas, so  you'd have to deal with that when you resumed. Just a nice little bit of immersion.


The graphics were really impressive too, namely in its scale; the world was so expansive and the colours so vivid. It was a fascinating universe that, unfortunately, I never got to revisit after the developers went under while working on the sequel.

IIRC someone was actually making a Crysis mod of this game. Not sure what ever eventuated from that.

You're a conscientious eater.  And I applaud that.  If more people ate like you're planning on eating there would be far less suffering in the world.  But the fact remains:  You're still willing to have animals killed on your behalf because you like the way they taste.  That's not a vegetarian.

I can't even imagine how good it would be if we doubled the amount we spent on it. 

I get frustrated because I truly think the US would have the best healthcare in the world if you went single payer, and spent the same amount. It would be light years ahead of everywhere else. I also think the freedom of not worrying about keeping a job with good insurance would produce unbelievable gains in your entire economy, you guys are pretty driven and innovative and I think a lot of people would have the freedom to leave their jobs and start up new enterprises knowing that your health is covered.

It's been a tough mental exercise to try and package this new ""future bass"" music in an appealing way here in Orlando. I'd say a good soundsystem with big subwoofers is wholly necessary, and I'm still trying to figure out how to grow the night. I'm really hoping Disclosure does a collaboration with a few hip American artists, and that kickstarts everything.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Probably my best, most relevant story to an askreddit ever, but prepared to be buried.

About a year ago I went out with my ex girlfriend (who I was still kind of seeing) and all her college friends, them all being in college.  They all went clubbing, got way too wasted (especially my ex), I took care of them, and I felt pretty great about that.  Really cared about that girl and was happy I kept her safe when she was pretty much blacked out.  When we get back I think - hey, I deserve some fun, I just took care of everyone.  

Let's (ex's girlfriends and I) play truth or dare with some liquor.

Wake up the next morning **naked on the floor in a fur coat**.  

Say hi and everyone's angry, starts yelling at me.

Apparently we got so drunk playing T or D I ended up:
1) pissing in a closet, thinking it was the bathroom
2) puking everywhere
3) casually getting naked
4) being hostile, my inner insecurities over her friends not liking me manifested

Went from so much positive real life karma to so much negative real life karma in one five-hour blackout. baddd times

It's important whether she was a victim of sexual assault or not. And it's important for the records of the Honor Court to be known for this to stop being a matter of her word against theirs. Neither of which will be known without a criminal investigation, which she has (so far) refused to engage in.

I'm not implying any of this is ""evidence"" against her, I'm just saying she is now attempting to ""prosecute"" numerous people - the students of the Honor Court, the Board of Governors, Chancellor Thorp, etc - by naming, shaming, and demanding their withdrawal and/or resignation.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","So I've bought a short sale, and had an offer on another one before I purchased the one i did.  A couple of questions you should ask to prepare yourself:

&gt;How many loans are there?

If the house has a 1st and 2nd loan, it will probably take the longest to go through the process.  Both banks have to negotiate with each other as to how much each gets.  This can take a while.  The sale can't happen if both banks don't agree.

&gt;Has owner paid Mortgage Insurance?

If yes, there is less incentive for the bank to approve the sale.  If it goes to foreclosure, the bank gets paid by the insurance company.  If there is a 2nd loan, generally that bank gets nothing in foreclosure, which is why they are willing to take peanuts on a short sale offer.

&gt;Has owner stopped paying their mortgage?

Generally short sales are not granted unless the owner has stopped paying.  If they are still paying the bank has no incentive to grant the owner a short sale.

&gt;Have there been any previous offers that have gone to the bank?  If so, how much were they?

If this has happened already, this is better news for you.  The bank is aware that the owner wants to short sale, and if they have rejected an offer, you have a idea of what they won't accept.

&gt;How many short sales has the listing agent closed?

This can be a big factor in determining the success of the short sale.  The listing agent has to stay on top of the bank to make sure it moves along in the process and you are getting feedback.

The first short sale I had an offer on, there were two loans.  It took about 5 months for the two banks to agree on how much each other was going to get.  The first bank approved the short sale, and gave a 1 month time frame that their approval was good for.  The 2nd dragged their heels until about a week before the 1st bank's approval was about to expire, which obviously was no way for me to secure financing and close in a week.  If I was a cash buyer, maybe.  So we backed out of that one.

Our home we finally bought, the seller's realtor told me there was only 1 bank, and they were under a special program.  The bank had to net 84% of the appraisal that they had done when they started the short sale process.  Every month that the house was on the market, the amount the bank would accept dropped.  They had previously had an offer that the bank rejected as too low.  The house was scheduled to go to foreclosure in a month.  They told me the appraisal amount, so I knew what I needed to offer, which to me was a fair deal.  It took about a month and a half for the bank to approve our offer, and within the next month we had closed.","1362097206"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","Basically, since *web browsers* don't inheritly know how to read a PDF file, just embedding a file inside an `&lt;object&gt;` tag like youv'e done may do nothing at all. In order for a user to see the contents of that PDF, the browsers needs an interface to read and display PDFs files. Historically, this was done via *plugins*, most famously Adobe Reader, though there are other plugin vendors out there.

Recently (when the past few years or so), a few browsers ship with the ability to read and display PDF files natively; Chrome did this, and Firefox just shipped with a native implementation (based on a formally Javascript based add-on).

Since you can't yet rely on browsers having this support, and asking users to install *yet another plugin* just to view your CV is stupid, what's considered a better practice is to make an HTML document with the content of the PDF while supplying a link to a PDF for people who need/want to download it.

Off the top of my head, I don't know of a way to automate exporting PDF content to HTML, but there might be solutions out there.","1362097209"

If the ship is very long (i.e. Federation Cruiser) the defense drone has a very long path around the ship and can end up getting stuck on one side while a missile comes in on the other.

On the opposite end of this, if you use the Engi ship (very small circular path) the defense drones will almost never miss (like literally almost never).

However bonuses are payed based on performance, and are mainly paid to keep a banker working in a country. Because banking is a global game if you're getting paid less in one place you can go do the same job elsewhere for higher pay. 

If bankers didn't have bonuses they would still get pretty much the same as they do now, give or take, but they would be paid a fixed sum opposed to a dynamic bonus system. And because this bonus system is influenced by performance, a dynamic system of pay allows the bank to pay based on profit. Also the bonuses they get paid get taxed so they do actually generate money, it's all about how the government uses that money which is the bigger question.","1362097215"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","ok. This is pretty much what I thought you would say. 

I would encourage you to recognize that any anger you have toward her for ""leaving"" you for 11 weeks is irrational. In fact, if she had chosen to forgo a study-abroad program at the age of 21 to stay home for her boyfriend of two months, *that* would be a red flag for this relationship. She was perfectly within her rights to go. 

That doesn't stop it from sucking that she's gone, I know. You're allowed to feel anger and frustration and loneliness. These things are all totally normal. You dig her and you're going through some shit and you'd like her to be here for you dammit. You want some hugs and kisses and maybe a conversation in person. But you really have got to recognize that a) this isn't the end of the world - she'll be home in three weeks, which is nothing - and b) your feelings are not her responsibility. It's not her ""fault"" that you feel this way. You gotta deal with your feelings without punishing her for them.

I would suggest finding some more activities to occupy your mind and keep yourself from thinking about her so much while she's gone. She's obviously busy studying abroad; you be busy here, and you'll be happier and more fulfilled. ","1362097220"

The TCU game will likely be very close with the Longhorns missing on a FG or something similar as time runs down and the Mississippi loss would be a surprise.

I might wind up being really wrong on this, but I don't see Texas having a really dominant season. 11-1 seems pretty optimistic, but admittedly I'm not too familiar with the number or type of players returning. I also don't think they'll do any worse than 7-5. 9-3 seems like a pretty good estimate as well.

[Here's](http://blog.triblive.com/dejan-kovacevic/2012/06/28/sidney-crosby-penguin-for-life/) the one about Crosby taking less money in this contract, because lets be honest Crosby could get pretty much whatever he wanted somewhere, regardless of his concussion history.

[Here's](http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/penguins/crosby-penguins-agree-to-12-year-1044-million-contract-642475/) the one talking about the fact that the Pens have implied they won't pay anyone more than Crosby.  Also this is Malkin's 1st concussion and it doesn't even seem that serious (he's already back on the ice without symptoms).  Specifically this part (which has Shero quotes and touches on my first point too):

&gt;Not just because it holds down the team's expenses but because, as Shero confirmed, it sets the ceiling on the average annual value of contracts for all players in the organization.

&gt;That means nobody -- not big-ticket free agents such as Zach Parise and Ryan Suter that the Penguins are expected to pursue Sunday, and not homegrown talents such as Evgeni Malkin -- will draw an average salary higher than Crosby's.

&gt;Malkin, who has two years remaining on his contract, stands a pretty good chance of being offered one that's the equal of Crosby's. His present one is worth exactly what Crosby's is.

&gt;""It's almost like having two kids you're equally fond of,"" Shero said.

&gt;The maximum a player who signs as a free agent Sunday or later this year can be paid is about $14 million. Precisely what Crosby could have gotten if he didn't re-sign until next summer is impossible to say, but he obviously left millions of dollars on the table.

&gt;That translates to cap space Shero will have available to try to lure free agents. Cap space Shero can use in coming years possibly to avoid breaking up the franchise's core for financial reasons.

&gt;""He's never been reluctant to help the team,"" Shero said. ""I appreciate that, and ownership appreciates that. It's very beneficial and it says a lot about Crosby.""

    SELECT product_name as 'Description'

That will let you select Product Name, but call it ""Description"" for the exported csv file.

Or does the data exist in separate tables?  In that case, just do a join.

    SELECT product.thing1, product.thing2, other_table.product_name AS 'Description'
    FROM product
    LEFT JOIN other_table
    ON product.id = other_table.product_id

Or is the data from your old table static, and all you want to do is update your new table.  You can do an update statement to bring the old data into the new table:

    UDPATE new_table, old_table
    SET new_table.description = old_table.product_name

You are canceling his Hacker combo into up back guns, which lets you do his angel dash super low off the ground. The second circle is to cancel the angel dash with his parry, putting him back on the ground to recover. The third hit of Hacker causes a crumple (is this the right term?

Put a about 1/2 foundation inside a well-cleaned eyeshadow pot, and add a small dab of lotion, if you like. Melt the chap-stick with the spoon and the lighter and as soon as the chap-stick is liquid, put it in the pot with the foundation. Quickly mix them together, until they are almost mixed completely. It might help to be in a warm room, or have warmed up the foundation somehow, so you don't get a gritty texture. Finally, stick it it in the freezer for a bit and viola, a primer pot :)

"law","t5_2qh9k","&gt; The spirit of the rules is to keep laypersons from being ambulance chases in exchange for fees.

Exactly! Leave that to the experts!

Seriously though, you're not wrong here. You're not allowed to give them the referral fee, or a percentage of it. You'd lose your license. You're not going to do it.

The sort of hard fact is, your stepdad did ""man-on-the-street"" style referral-ing (referring to you). You interviewed the person, identified the potential liability, and recommended a licensed/competent attorney who then took the case, carried it forward, and won a large settlement. That is what finders fees are for. 

Sounds like there's some backstory here too. Like stepdad would rather resent you for holding out on him than resent you for your success. Maybe he sees this as an economy in which simply having credentials can get you a huge leg up on others. That's legit, and it's stuff you could talk to him about, but not in an adversarial way while there's still a bunch of money on the table (""on the table"" &lt;- in his mind).

So give him the $5k now. You can't do more and you won't. You're not going to break the law and jeopardize your license. Make it clear to him that it's illegal for you to do otherwise, and then show a little extra generosity to your him or your mom. Say sorry at least once, but don't over-do it. Don't forget to say thanks even if he's not ready to say you're welcome.  

Then, wait. You're going to be family for a while, right?

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt; Irrelevant

You just differentiated between people ""doing math"" and those ""only applying it"", I'm interested in what the distinction is between these two things. Also, it seems to me as though you believe those ""only applying"" math as inferior to those ""doing math"", which makes me even more curious (the reason for this is the use of the word ""only"").

Okay, trying to summarize your answer: is ""doing math"" deriving things from axioms using proofs?

If so could you elaborate on which of these professions/cases people are really ""doing math"" and which case only applying it?

A statistician (typically only applies known statistical tests/models)
An applied mathematician (typically applies known mathematics to different situations)
A theoretical physicist (uses natural laws as axioms, but otherwise uses proofs)

Do the proofs you do need to be ""new"" for it to count, or can you just redo proofs by other people? 

Is it ""doing math"" when you are simply applying a known methods for constructing proofs on a different situations (you didn't prove the method, so you're ""only"" applying it, even if the result is previously unknown).","1362097243"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt; For male casting for comic book roles, physical appearance doesn't tend to matter much to people. Never have I seen a breakdown of face, pecs, abs and ass for Andrew Garfield or Robert Downey Jr. Sure there's all manner of nitpicking over perceived character attributes, like whether or not Heath Ledger would make a good joker, there was a lot of manic stressing over whether he could play psychotic well enough, etc etc. But almost none worrying about how didn't look enough like the joker.

I don't know if this is a fair comparison. None of those characters have a truly identifiable physical trait that were incongruous with the actors playing them. 

If a particular aesthetic is not adapted, you're damn right people are going to bitch and moan. Most famously, look at the huge backlash Daniel Craig got when he was cast. All sorts of complaints putting down his looks and age. 

We don't see it in male casting for the simple fact that most male fictional characters don't place too much emphasis on appearance, per se. That's why it's a bit of a tricky situation here. I won't defend the vitriol coming out of the community towards her, but at the same time, there is validity in wanting a particular beauty from a character who is most famously known to be the ""IT"" girl and supermodel.

Volume 5, Book 58, Number 188
Narrated by 'Amr bin Maimun
During the pre-lslamic period of ignorance I saw a she-monkey surrounded by a number of monkeys. They were all stoning it, because it had committed illegal sexual intercourse. I too, stoned it along with them.

just some muslim monkey business XD. 

.

Volume 5, Book 58, Number 199 :
Narrated by 'Abdur-Rahman
""I asked Masruq, 'Who informed the Prophet about the Jinns at the night when they heard the Qur'an?' He said, 'Your father 'Abdullah informed me that a tree informed the Prophet about them.' ""

too many imaginary friends XD.

.

Volume 5, Book 58, Number 209 :
Narrated by 'Abdullah
The moon was split ( into two pieces ) while we were with the Prophet in Mina. He said, ""Be witnesses."" Then a Piece of the moon went towards the mountain.

.

XD. in case if you didn't notice. ALL of these three are from just one book(chapter), and I didn't read all of it. I read like 10% or so. ok how about the quran?

7:166 So when they took pride in that which they had been forbidden, We said unto them: Be ye apes despised and loathed!

allah turned humans into apes XD. I guess he wanted to prove that Darwin is wrong XD. 

.

27:17 And there were gathered together unto Solomon his armies of the jinn and humankind, and of the birds, and they were set in battle order;

birds, humans and jinn fighting side by side in battle. and they believe it. better to believe that a cats can fly.  

.


that is not even a fracture of islamic books. that is almost like 0%. since there are thousands of stuff like this in islam.

as you can see. there is no reason for anyone to remain a muslim. the only thing that is holding apostates from expressing themselves is that apostasy in islam means death but that is another story. in fact I read islamic books and quran from time to time to laugh. nothing more.","1362097244"

I know this one all too much.  When going to the movies, I rush my friends because they want to get there right as the movie starts (after the previews end), which results in shitty seats.

They try to do this every time, and I rush them every time.

This happened last year when we tried to see The Avengers on opening weekend.

ME: *I'm telling you, it's going to be sold out if we don't get their early enough.*

THEM: *Naw dawg it's cool, there's like 5 different movie theaters we could see it at anyways.*

[We show up at the 1st movie theater 5 minutes after the previews start]

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","FWIW, this is what they did at my current job and it was  a disaster. ""75 degrees"" is meaningless without active cooling. So they put in an exhaust fan and called it a day. Well in the summer its 80+ degrees in there then the building shuts off its hvac after 5, so a summer night means 90 degree server room. I guess the $300 an hour engineer never fucking thought about what happens when the building turns down its cooling at 5pm.

Lots of failed drives. Short lifespan on equipment, etc.  

I say fight for an air conditioner, even if it is a $2,500 spot cooler/portable unit with its exhaust pipe sticking into the plenum or out the window.  Or if they're really cheap and stupid shove a window unit in there if you have a window.  You can't go wrong with an AC unit. You can go wrong with an exhaust fan.

Ideally, you should caclulate a rough BTU rating, think about how how it gets when the building cuts its AC, and deal with the condensate and humidity.","1362097252"

Those, as I have stated, I have no problem in helping, mainly because their numbers are so low in comparison to those of us who can support ourselves. Say a person, who has a criminal record, is on welfare, and has their livelihood subsidized. Firstly... should we subsidize them? I say no.Countries that have ending periods on social programs show that towards the end of the program, as if my a miracle, the people either find work, stabilize, quit their habits, or comply.

Weight and diet are very personal things. If YOU specifically eat healthily and have no problem with your weight - good for you! Gratz!

But don't be so judging when it comes to other people. Other peoples insulin goes batshit crazy after eating carbs and a few hours later they have a binge, because they are REALLY hungry. Some other people have a problem with moderation, because just eating ""a little less"" is harder than changing your diet. For some.

For these kinds of people, keto is a real alternative. It probably is a good decision for everyone, but let's focus first on the fatties amongst us.

You lose your weight fast. It is easy to follow - here are your macros, try to hit them and stay under your calorie-limit for today. And it IS easy, because eating a lot of fat and protein fills you up and satiates you for a long time.

That is personal experience and often reported here in this subreddit. I can often skip meals, because I simpy don't feel hungry. I could have NEVER skipped a meal before on my ""normal"" diet. No way.

Another big factor, which many people like to forget, it keeps you away from drinking sugary stuff and especially beer. Beer is a big one for me, because it's pretty calorie-heavy and I liked to have some...well a lot of them at the weekend. Cut that out and I am already down a few thousand calories a week.","1362097261"

While I doubt we'll ever get something like Throne of Bhaal again, we'll be getting our moneys morth. One thing I don't like however, is stuff packs such as the weapon packs for ME2. Day one dlc can be annoying, but in ME3's case, I think the day one dlc was worth it. 

The argument that you want a complete game is perfectly valid, however I think in many cases it's used to ban all dlc's. When people complained about ME3's From Ashes Day 1 dlc, I think in the Anti-EA circlejerk everyone forgot it was meant to be a limited edition only item, which went public.

There's also talk of integrating Leap with [Fleksy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fleksy-happy-typing/id520337246?mt=8), a predictive typing software, so that you could fluidly type in midair.

There are many applications for Leap (and other motion-control devices) that probably haven't even been thought of yet. With most new technology, hardware innovations often serve as a catalyst for countless innovations built on that technology. For example, who could have imagined all possible applications for a smart phone? I think the best thing to do with something like Leap is to wait for the second generation of the hardware. By then, they will have 1) Worked out any glitches in the hardware from their first production run, and 2) developed a more extensive app store with all sorts of cool things to do.

I think the Leap will revolutionize the way we interact with our computers, although I'm not sure exactly how.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; As soon as someone starts refering to black people (or insert other ethnicity/skin color) you can clearly see that they are racist.

""Racist"" is a meaningless word, as you are demonstrating.

&gt; While it is clear that black people are overpresented in crime statistics, the reason is much, much more complicated than ""they are black"".

There could easily be justification for saying that it is ""because they are black"". Black people are different from white people in more ways than just their melanin levels. I think it's funny that people like you are willing to accept that DNA causes them to have darker skin but would dismiss the notion that DNA may cause they to be more aggressive, less empathetic, less respectful of authority, less intelligent, and so on. 

It's also more complicated than ""the system is racist"".

It's almost impossible to arrest someone simply for possessing or even doing drugs. The way people are caught for doing drugs is in the course of committing some other crime. Biggest example would be getting pulled over for speeding or having expired plates, bonus points if you have a warrant out for your arrest for some other reason.

Also, the fact is that if you live in a city, you're much more exposed to the police. The police don't really heavily patrol rural or suburban areas. Why? Because there's not much crime there. They are concentrated in the urban areas where crime is highest and easiest to enforce. You can speed around country roads for hours and never see a cop. Good luck doing that in an urban area.

On racism: [20.9% of hate crimes in 2011 were committed by blacks](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2011). There are also more non-hate black on white than white on black crimes.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;pulling content from full releases and selling it as DLC.

That's virtually *never* the case. But even if it was, that doesn't mean anything as to whether or not you got ripped off. Any amount of content removed from a game before release doesn't inherently mean *anything* about the amount of content that you *do* get. 


&gt;Mass Effect 3 - (Ending aside) Launched with day one DLC which was not only content that should have been in the game...

That's not a thing. ""What should have been in the game"" is whatever the creator decides what's in the game. They are the only ones who get to make that call, not you. 

ME3, without From Ashes, was nothing even close to a 'rip off' by a mile. It's a fine quality game that contains an unarguably reasonable and acceptable amount of content for it's price. That's all you're owed when you buy a game. It doesn't matter what *else* might exist, or where it's stored, or when it might have been made, the only thing that matters is that the product was reasonably worth it's price. And ME3 is that in spades.

If From Ashes had not been created with the mandate to sell it as an optional add-on, it would simply not exist.

&gt;but also impacted the actual story of the game

Yes. And? Aren't meaningful, worthy additions to our games precisely what DLC should strive to be?

&gt;Street Fighter X Tekken (and many others) - Launched with content on the disc that was locked out of the game so it could then be released as DLC later.

Again, it does not matter to anything *when* content was created, or where it might happen to rest. SFxT included an entirely adequate roster in the core game. And again, if it wasn't for the added income they stood to gain from selling them seperately, there's every liklihood that those characters would simply not have been included at all.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","A variety in tastes and preferences is hardly a refutation of my argument.

You already agree with me that men have a variety of tastes and preferences. Yet it's still possible to sexualize a female character in a video game, despite the fact that no matter what you made her appearance, there would be some men who didn't find her appealing. (The gay one's come to mind, but even beyond that, some guys only like chubby chicks, some only find redheads appealing, some guys probably only find Asian chicks desirable.)

This is because the majority of men share a preference. My point is twofold. First, female sexual preferences are based on power. This accounts for a variation is preferences in physical features because power is a multifaceted concept. Some girls like guys who look super jacked, others prefer a more nerdy, intellectual look, but usually for a man to be attractive, he's got to look like he excels at something. What that something is determines which girls are attracted to him. My second point is that even with that accounted for, certain physical features are indicators of good health and are objectively preferred. Strong jaw lines, facial symmetry, etc. The *vast* majority of male video game characters exhibit these traits.","1362097274"

I agree entirely. In Prime the Chozo didn't just practice and learn from science and technology; the Tallon IV Chozo were more in tune with the natural universe. My wild guess says its something to do with an ascension-type dealie, and them learning about a way the universe operates through something which science can't/might not yet be able to explain and quantify. I always liked how it was left at least a little ambiguous, too.

I always figured that Samus' suit operated based on a energy&lt;-&gt;matter principle. When she went into the Morph Ball, she was transformed into energy, with her consciousness still able to control it and perceive her surrounding using the suits inbuilt sensors.

Likewise with the missiles. In Prime, they appeared as balls of light, so maybe they were a load of highly energised particles kept contained in a field until they detonated. And with the more traditional missiles in Prime 3, they could just be contained as a baser form in her suit, like as raw materials, until her arm cannon constructs them for firing. When she gets Rundas' ice missiles, she just picks up the blueprints and know-how to give them some extra flavouring. And with the Seeker Missiles, that orb which forms might just be the suit constructing them to fire all at once.

Hey, if her suit can produce an infinite stream of highly charged, energised, and heated particles, then it doesn't seem so far fetched.","1362097276"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; It already knew that a healthy share had streamed the work of Mr. Fincher, the director of “The Social Network,” from beginning to end. And films featuring Mr. Spacey had always done well, as had the British version of “House of Cards.”

Uh, every other studio knows revenue for the same things, which is a roughly equivalent metric to streaming numbers as an indicator. This is not new at all. None of these ""insights"" were unique to Netflix. This analysis is retarded.

Knowing that House of Cards, Kevin Spacey and David Fincher are successful is not ""using big data"" to make decisions. It is exactly what everyone else does. Streaming numbers are no different from standard TV ratings really.","1362097277"
"gamernews","t5_2sc3f","The ""it's just a video game!"" is not an effective defense against potential critique. It like saying ""it's not supposed to Citizen Cain"" when defending the Transformers movies. All that says is any inadequacy of its handling is made acceptable by just being a flashy distraction.

 As to the non-religious themes in Bioshock...yes, they have been there, certainly. But more as a part the Objectivitivist philosophy that was central to Rapture, Andrew Ryan and the city's downfall. It was never hammered in as ""Religion is evil/unsavory/incorrect"". It was a more general rebellion against any kind of authority, whether in this life, or potentially, the next. It's part of the presentation of the world, but its hardly the biggest point.

Secondly, I also doubt that Bioshock Infinite is going to be religiously offensive along the lines of ""magic sky fairy"" or ""magic underwear lolz"" or ""FUNDIES AMIRITE?"" since the Bioshock games have done a pretty good job of framing the philosophies that their characters believe in as close to neutral light as they can be. However, there's a difference between a thoughtful critique of a subject (this antagonist firmly believes X, but X is not  inherently evil because of it, but because of how this person applies it) and offensive strawman burning (this character believes X and X is evil and anyone who believes X is evil) and its a very easy line to cross. A critique of religious conservatism as it pertains to early 20th century America could be a very powerful idea and done right can lead to introspection on the part of the gamer. If it's simply ""religion is bad"" then its not hard to see why people might find that offensive or at least annoying. 

Now, as to the developer quitting, we don't know when this was, or if the moment that caused it to happen still exists in the game. It probably wasn't recent, so we can imagine that the devs have done what they felt was right to address the issue.  Seeing as Comstock's character , as least from advertising we've seen, is still centered around his nationalism and religion, the devs haven't abandoned their exploration of religion..

As a side note, religion is not the sole focus of the game, as race relations in the time period is also one of the central themes of the game. Seeing how both are handled will certainly be interesting.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Buddy, Every one of the EP's I have out there I made from my bedroom for less than $60.

Biggest tip, learn to use the resources you have. You have a great brain and a great set of ears, use them! Learn a DAW (Ableton is what I use. It's a GREAT stepping stone). All my guitars up until now have been DI or recorded with one mic (acoustic guitars). Sure, you won't get PRO sound, but to just get out there, it's great. My EP's don't sound the best, but they serve the purpose I need to get to the next stage.

Second tip: In canada, we have two stores called Tom Lee and Long &amp; Mcquade. Hurting for good equipment and desperately need it? Rental is DIRT cheap. Right now I'm renting a C600 (to mic a guitar amp) for $15 a month! To record drums in a friends basement, two 8ch pre's + 13 mics (with stands and cables) came to $50 for the weekend. We recorded 3 EP's worth of material.

For the stage me and you are at right now, there are a TON of ways to get great sound. Learn to Mix, Learn to master, learn to use the resources you have. You'll do great!

"funny","t5_2qh33","The air filter simply does what it says... it filters the air entering the engine's intake manifold. 

Then the air mixes with the fuel spray in the throttle-body, if it's a TBI vehicle, or in the cylinder, if it's fuel-injected (or in the carburetor if you're stuck in the 70s/80s). 

Then once the fuel/air mixture is burned on the ignition stroke, the piston acts like a pump and pushes it out of the cylinder on the exhaust stroke. 

It's a bit more complicated than this, but not much. The majority of what you see on an engine nowadays are the computer sensors for the onboard computer system, so it can keep the engine tuned, and emissions controls. 

The basic workings of an engine haven't changed much in over 100 years. ","1362097279"

"ChemicalEngineering","t5_2qwn7","I am a BS/MS ChemE who graduated 2 years ago - now I work in industry for a chemical company.  I do experiments in a 1 L flask on occasion, but most of the time I spend in a plant.

*You can find opportunitues where you work in a lab with a BS.  You might get more opportunities as an MS and probably more research opportunities with a PhD.  
* can you fund your own private research lab?  probably not.  it would be a very expensive hobby.  analytical instruments are very expensive.
* If you did more computer simulation things you could do some of your own research.  Can you confirm calculations?  Yes.  although I'm not sure how much help that would be.

My advice would be to go to college under ChemE and also take chem courses.  If you like it you can switch into chem probably pretty easily.  Its usually harder the other way around.  While in college ask to do research under a professor who is doing work in an area you are interested in.  after college look for a job doing the research you are interested in.  You may find it the private sector - large companies have R&amp;D centers.  If research is really your thing, consider the PhD to professor route- (in ChemE, chem, or any other field).  You have a lot more freedom in acadamia to research whatever you want when you become a professor.  If you have a PhD and then want to make boatloads of money, you can still do it.  You get a job in industry.  Plenty of executives at companies like ExxonMobil or Dupont are PhDs in ChemE or Chem.","1362097281"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Sure!

To a libertarian, there is a distinction between power wielded by businesses and power wielded by governments, because you can ""choose"" to not participate with a particular business but you are coerced into participating with the government.  The ability to ""vote with your dollars"" is a de jure freedom.

Similarly, if you are employed at an exploitative workplace, your ability to quit and find a different job more to your liking is technically present as well.  A de jure freedom.

The problem is that this overlooks many de facto infringements on these freedoms.  If you work a low income job and live paycheck to paycheck for instance, it strikes me as silly to say you are ""free"" to find a job that doesn't exploit you.  Just because it is legal to do something does not mean you are free to do it, if you include ""de facto"" in your definition of free.

This, to my understanding, is a source of major differences between libertarianism and anarchy.  Libertarianism is content with few laws prohibiting, whereas anarchy recognizes that freedom can be diminished by things other than laws, such as economic conditions or social conditions.

I hope that helps!  I highly recommend www.anarchistfaq.org for a quality source on anarchy.","1362097291"

1. We usually have compacts, but if we don't, depending on your attitude, we may give you an upgrade. Or tell you ""tough shit, try tomorrow.""
2. The insurance is great if you get the full wrap. You crashed it? Bring us the keys and that's it. If you elect to use your own insurance and you get into an accident, your fault or not, we take your deductible. The managers and assistant managers will try to sell you the insurance telling you they don't make any money off of it. That's a lie, they make commission. On the other hand, if you did have the insurance and you get into an accident, they have to pay for the repairs, depending on how severe they are. 
3. The company I work for doesn't allow after-hours drops, nor do the dealership locations close early. You didn't show up in time? Extra day charge to the bill. It's called time management, learn it.
4. Don't ignore the no smoking stickers. WE WILL CHARGE YOUR ASS a detailing fee. We'll spray some pina colada air freshener and hope you don't notice the smell. Not only that, but it's inconsiderate as hell. It is not YOUR car. It is OUR car. We're just letting you borrow it. It is a convenience to you, don't be a dick.
5. Don't let someone that isn't an authorized driver operate the vehicle. We can and will call it a breach of contract, take the vehicle from you, and still make you pay. You signed the contract, don't screw around.
6. If you have a dog, keep it out of the f'ing car. Animal hair is a pain in the ass to get out, and customers will whine about it. When they whine, we gotta hear their shit and have to try to find them another car. Again, it's inconsiderate. It is NOT YOUR CAR!
7. The brakes on Toyotas and especially the Dodge Avenger are squeaky for some reason. We know this, and we will not switch you out of those vehicles, especially since I drive them all and know which ones have the problems. If its a car that doesn't normally have a squeaky brakes, yes, we'll switch you out. If there are any legitimate problems with the vehicle, we'll switch you out and fix that vehicle. ","1362097293"

"Aberdeen","t5_2s70u","I can really only tell you about the student life in Aberdeen. Aberdeen has two major universities: the University of Aberdeen and Robert Gordon University. They also have several colleges, so Aberdeen has a substantial student population.    
    
Pubs are a big thing -- that's probably more like the U.K. in general though. There's a golf ~~court~~ course just by the beach, and the beach itself is massive and a place I always take people who are visiting (Google Aberdeen beach for pics). Aberdeen is a major oil city, and the quality of life is very high compared to the rest of the U.K. The University of Aberdeen was founded in 1495 so there's a lot of history there you can read about (check Wikipedia for starters).    
    
As far as traditions go, I wouldn't say that Aberdeen is particularly unique, at least not anything that's very noticeable. There are a bunch of ceilidhs which are hosted quite frequently (these are basically events where you have a band playing traditional music and the crowd is dancing according to some specifications). Ceilidhs (pronounced kay-lees) are very much a Scottish thing in general. There's a lot of stuff around Aberdeen which have some historical content. Slain's Castle is like 40 miles (?) north of Aberdeen and is a ruined castle which is very interesting; Stonehaven is a town nearby which is a substantial tourist area.. It allegedly invented the deep-fried Mars bar. It also has Dunnottar Castle just outside town which is a pretty cool place to visit. St. Andrews is also a big tourist attraction, which is a town a bit further away.    
    
There's a myth that one of William Wallace's (from Braveheart) body ""quarters"" reside within a cathedral in Old Aberdeen, but according to one of the nuns in the cathedral, that's hogwash.    

The east side of Scotland is certainly not the prettiest or the most interesting. Aberdeen itself is mostly an oil city. Unemployment is low and it is consistently rated as one of the best places to live in the U.K. (despite it being fairly sad looking, and the weather always being shit).    
    
Handball is not a big thing at all (actually entirely unheard of), football and rugby is fairly big, and there's also a hockey stadium by the beach (in-door of course).

"alcoholism","t5_2rgl1","If I understand you correctly, those ""blowout"" events are only 2 or 3 times a year, and the rest of the time you drink 1 or 2 beers a day, 3 or 4 on weekend days. Right?

All I can think is that those drunken blowouts must be staggeringly bad for your friends to see. You say you black out during these events, so can't be completely sure that you don't get into trouble, vomit, or hurt yourself. (I'm not saying ""black out"" as in ""passing out""; I mean a portion of the evening that you can't remember at all.) I'm not calling you a liar; just think about it. If you don't remember these evenings past a certain point, then you can't know for sure what is happening during that black out. Maybe your friends are fighting desperately to keep you out of trouble during those events.

It does concern me that you seem so nonchalant about blacking out. I was a heavy drinker when I drank, and could hold my drink pretty well. (Most of the time, at least.) I rarely had blackouts even in my worst drinking days, but they always terrified me when they did happen. I can't imagine being so casual about missing memories. That's just me, of course, everyone is different. 

I say don't worry about the label ""alcoholic"", at least not right now. It's a big scary word. Maybe instead, you should talk to those friends, ask them why they are so worried. Try not to be defensive, or reactive. Just try to find out what is going on when you drink to the level where you black out. If the next morning you wake up with no memory after a certain point, and friends in tears, then something must be going on. Try to find out what it is. Maybe learning that will help you decide how worried you need to be.

I can assure you it was a playful ""bullshit"". I get where you're coming from. I really do. All of the guys in this thread do. You know why? We've all asked out lots and lots and lots of people. It's what we're expected to do. When you ask people out, and get rejected a lot, it's way easier to handle if you have a reason why you got turned down. It makes the pill easier to swallow. But, personally I think you've got the wrong reason. The real reason why you get turned down by most of the people you ask out is that's just the way things work. The amount of people out there that are right for you is a very small fraction of the population, and the fraction of those people that don't already have someone or some other reason they can't date at the moment is even smaller. Every one of those people that turns you down has a reason for doing so. Whether it's you, or them, or something else entirely. However, and this is the important part, NOT A SINGLE DAMN ONE OF THEM will ever give you the real reason. People are pussies, guys just as much as women, and to save a little bit of awkwardness everyone always lies about why they said no. ""I just enjoy the chase"" sounds exactly like one of these lies. The fact is that even if you've asked out 30 guys, and every single one of those guys honestly said no to you only because he didn't like you being the one asking him out, you STILL have at least 100 guys here, right now, telling you that's not the case. So you can keep saying ""most guys"" this and ""many men"" that, but we're men (most of us) and we're telling you that's not the case for us. And that's all we can say. People are all very different, and for the time and place you live in, your theory could be 100% correct, who am I to say you're wrong. But you're wrong about us, and we're telling you that. There's no reason to get angry about it. Let's just have a discussion.","1362097296"

Also the US has Trident subs with cruise missiles for tactical usage and SLBMs. And both the US and Japan have better aircraft and likely better pilots. 

The Chinese regime is evil, but it is probably more Brezhnev era Soviet Union than 1930's Japan. I think the people running China care about making money from corruption - they have fortunes 10x even those of plutocratic American politicians - and getting their kids into Universities in the US and their fortunes outside the PRC.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Just one point, science is a process. It is a method by which we can test the validity of something. It's not a bunch of guys just making stuff up, and it's not a description word for the body of knowledge that humans have accumulated (some of which is certainly incorrect or incomplete).

It's a respected process because it has been shown to work, often in the form of the technology we can create using principles we have learnt through scientific study. It can explain the physical world very well indeed, and those things it can't yet explain can be with more data.

It is less useful in explaining philosophical questions, because they are untestable. Morality, ethical behaviour and so on can be studied only in terms of what humans and animals *do* not on what is right (as if that has any real meaning).

The point is, if something is unexplained, we should allow it to remain so until such a time that we can explain it. Accept that gap in our knowledge. I accept certain unexplained things, because I can see evidence for them. That doesn't mean I should accept *any* unexplained thing (like religious assertions) especially when there is not only no evidence for them being true, but substantial evidence that they are not true.","1362097298"

There have been a few situations that I've come across where individuals displayed Munchhausen By-proxy; 

One was a nurse. Beloved by all, of course. She would puncture elderly patients throats with tiny needles, injecting oxygen into their blood stream.  If you're unfamiliar, this is called 'air embolism' and can cause blockages in the artery that lead to strokes or heart attacks. Being that her patients where elderly, them dying of a stroke wasn't out of the ordinary. 

Another instance was when a young boy began showing strange and nonassignable symptoms that where serious and life-threatening. It came to light that his mother, who was divorced from her son's father, was poisoning him (with what I can't recall) so he would be admitted into the hospital where his father would come to stand vigil. She was purposefully making him ill to be around his father again, hoping they'd somehow magically reconnect and everything would the way she wanted it. ","1362097300"

These increases, however, are not keeping up with the cost of living.  An article by the EOI (Economic Opportunity Institute) states: ""Is A Minimum Wage Enough To Live On? 
While some of Washington’s largest industries rely on low-wage workers for growth, minimum wage employees must rely on near-poverty earnings to pay for living expenses. In Washington, a full-time minimum wage worker will earn just over $18,000 in 2011. 
Although this is enough income to keep a family of three above the poverty threshold, it is not enough to cover the basic expenses of daily living. Moreover, many individuals in low-wage sectors work fewer than 40 hours per week. In retail, the average work week was 31.3 hours in 2011, providing only $14,000 in annual income for the typical minimum wage worker. In leisure and hospitality, the average work week was 25.9 hours in 2011.
In order to afford regular necessities such as transportation, child care and housing, one must earn a living wage. In some parts of the state the minimum wage meets the standard of a living wage for a household of one; however, this is not the case for urban areas. Furthermore, the minimum wage is far below the wage needed to reasonably support a household of two or more across the state.""

The most common and easiest to decoded is Caesar's Cipher. Shifting the characters 3 to the left. 

Example:

    Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
    Plaintext:  the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

That is using Key 3 ( A shift to the right of 3)

This code we have here uses Symbols as well as numbers and letters, so I can almost guarantee that it is not a older method of a cipher but more likely nothing at all.


**However**... The numbers could be a IP adress, phone number,area code, a date or latitude/longitude. I will look into these posibilities later and post them here.

Oh, sure, it makes *you* feel better, because you can tell yourself that you're being sensitive to their feelings or whatever, but all you're really doing for *them* is implying that they can't handle anything short of sugar-coated idiocy.

That is the least-likely outcome I can think of from funding under performing schools! You could argue it, but I find it extremely unconvincing.

Administrators wouldn't personally get paid more for having badly performing schools - they'd just get more money to allocate to building better schools. They, personally, benefit in no way financially. The 'incentive' you claim doesn't exist.

However, paying personal 'bonuses' to administrators and teachers for raising grades has been known to bring out all sorts of sick, twisted shit like asking kids not to attend tests, teaching test-prep over actual knowledge, stripping back broad educational goals for 'teaching to the test'.

None of them have as much utility/CC as Zyra, that's why Zyra got nerfed: because when she could match them in damage, she was blatantly OP. I very clearly said ""I'm sure she's fine"". I've played with Zyras mid after the nerfs, and I think it's totally viable, but talking about strength of picks, I think Zyra is a stronger pick for support and Lux, Orianna, or Anivia are stronger picks for mid.

"whitecollar","t5_2s1ur","A few other thoughts about this ep...

- New boss...wow. They made it really easy for everyone to hate her. When she was telling Peter she was glad to see he was still at NY White Collar, the ""you haven't been promoted yet"" vibe made me want to slap the crap outta her. 

- Glad to see the whole Neal/art thing back. Picking out forgeries, creating ones of his own. He's back in his element. Feels like old times.

- Chicken sexers. I immediately cracked up at this because I distinctly remember learning about chicken sexers from *Dirty Jobs*. Anyone else?

- It was nice to see Treat Williams back again. Loved the lost dog bit. I'm still not sure how genuine James is being with regard to Neal, though. Was he serious about all of the talented artist/proud of Neal stuff, or is he just stringing Neal along with warm fuzzies until they get the box? 

- Haversham Gallery in Portland. Heh.

- 500 pounds of marble in Neal's apartment? How did they get it up the stairs and through the door? 

- In the scene with the Windows 8 product placement, is there seriously a framed photo of clouds on Callaway's desk, in what looks like a baby photo frame (little teddy bear in the corner)? Plus, there's the lorem ipsum text in her word processor window when they're doing surveillance in the van. 

- For those who don't follow the WC folks on Twitter, writer Mark Goffman offered an interesting bit of trivia for this episode. This is Goffman's last episode writing for *White Collar* (NBC picked up his pilot, ""I Am Victor""), so he threw in something fun. Via his Twitter:

""in tonight's WC episode Bellmiere's real name was Jeff Blatenick. Jeff was a fictitious student some friends and I made up in high school. 
the yearbook mentioned him in photos, the paper put him in articles. we'd turn in papers in his name. this went on for years after we left""

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","**Summer**

I buy a CSA share and plan meals around what I get. If I have too much of something, I freeze it. This year I hope to start canning. I go to the grocery for non-produce, infrequently, a couple times a month due to all the awesome veggies.

**Other times**

I browse the weekly ads for the nearby stores and add the things that are on sale, that I would use, that are a good deal, to my list. I use GroceryIQ. This way I can see what prices used to be so I know what a good deal is.

I attempt to build some meals for the week around these items and items I already have. I usually cook something each night and cascade my leftovers throughout the week for lunch. Often on Sunday I make a large breakfast item that will sustain breakfast for the week, so some planning goes into that. Sunday mornings are also a big breakfast day, either in or out.

I usually do the listing and planning and shopping on Sunday since Saturdays I am usually snowboarding. I circulate to each store to get what I need in each place because some stores are better for some things than others. (I usually do 2-3 stores because I just can't handle any more at once.)

I sometimes plan to cook/have leftovers every day of a week. Sometimes, I leave a day open for dinner or lunch so I can buy out.","1362097345"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It wasn't really horrific, but rather unfortunate. 
During winter break, a group of friends and I rented out a  beach house for a few days and spent our New Years there. The ammenties in and of the house it self were very nice. And some of the features outside included a play structure, fire pit, and hot tub. Unfortunately it was cold as balls outside considering it was wintertime in the already cold, rainy, and windy state of Oregon so we didn't spend much time outside. 
Though a lot of us did enjoy chilling and drinking in the hot tub in the evenings. 

One night, the few of us hot tubbing decided to play truth or dare. We did the usual like sharing dark secrets, daring ladies to make out with each other etc., Basically what one would hope a good and even sexy game of truth or dare would be like. Along with that, we decided to make this one rule that if it were your turn and you decided to pass on both truth or dare bestowed upon you, you HAD to get it out of the hot tub, run through the yard in the freezing and icy cold and go down the slide of the play structure across the yard.

Most everybody did their truth or dare, but we had one an awesome friend who got out of the hot tub and ran across the yard in a skimpy speedo and went down the slide just for the hell of it. It was awesome to see. But unfortunate for him because of him deliberately running almost naked in freezing temperatures. Unfortunate for me because I'll never get the sight of his almost bare ass cheeks out of mind. I feel close to him like as if he were my brother. But now it's a little awkward for me because I'm always reminded of him in a teeny speedo and bare ass whenever I see him. ","1362097349"

The only thing i'd be concerned about would be overhandling... that brings up another point: forming patties.  guessing you follow the school of loosely formed, total minimal handling/compression and just enough to get it into the right shape?  I heard about that but haven't tried it yet.

Also you make a good point of flipping frequently.  Like I said i'm no expert so I enjoy hearing from other people, and I will give that another go.  I've done it in the past, but after hearing many views on it I had switched to not playing with my meat so much as a general rule.  Burgers may be an exception to that and I may be mis-remembering or mis-interpreting what I thought I learnt.

Though you have to admit, there really are two schools of thought on the whole flipping thing.  Even your linked article mentions it.  It also states it only applies to THICK burgers.  The pictures in there are a teeny bit thick for my likes.  Wether or not it applies to the burgers I like to consume is up for debate.  I may very well be on the line.

But hey i'm all for even-ness and the flip frequently appeals as it makes more sense that it might cook a tiny bit more evenly that way.

What do you do about the melty cheese though?  That takes like a minute, not the 15s increments previously mentioned and you can't flip when you got cheese on there.

Also since you really seem to know your stuff or at least have good opinions on the matter, is resting necessary or not?  I haven't been able to form a proper opinion on that.","1362097355"

It was silly at first, but soon it became a game of, ""who can be the most devastatingly honest about how you perceive the other people in the room?"" Things most friends don't say to each other out of respect for the other's feelings were said that night.  Deep-cutting remarks about poor life decisions were made, point-blank. Many more drinks were consumed. We made one friend draw a picture of his ex-wife while holding the marker in his teeth. It was squiggly and looked like she had a penis. Or very long roast beef.

We are all still best friends today.","1362097356"

I got a couple other things that day, and they were all there. I have a weird address and live in a house behind another, and I know some of my mail goes to the front house because I get some of theirs (and two days ago, another package was delivered to them instead of me, but I went to them immediately and they gave me my stuff). Anyway, we checked with them last week and they ""didn't have it"". Per the help on Amazon's site, I waited a couple days, then called the carrier (UPS). They weren't helpful and told me to call Amazon. So I did. They weren't super helpful (which surprised me) and didn't seem to believe me. They also contacted UPS and had me on hold for about 20 mins. Eventually, they did refund my money, but I actually wanted the item, so I will have to recorder it, I've just been procrastinating about that part. Lol  

Let me just say, as annoying as the notifications from the Amazon shopping app are (sometimes I get up to 3 notifications for the same delivery), I'm glad I get told when something is delivered so I know to look for something when I get home. ","1362097360"

* Rumpelstiltskin is a dwarf, so the names that are guessed to be his in the original are important since they have to do with disease and dwarves were considered carriers of disease. 
* Frau Holle is a pagan witch/helper figure.
* In Sleeping Beauty, the fairies are more Nordic--and one did have to pay tribute to them and sacrifice to them in Nordic countries.

The objection here, I think, is that it doesn't feel like everyone's at the same starting line. Everyone had 0 Fractal Relics and access to difficulty 1 on November 15, but guilds ranged from having a million+ influence banked to nothing. Merits are almost a common starting line, but you can't start earning merits without the influence buy-in. And of course, there are the ""no more new currencies!"" complaints every time they add a new currency.

(I also think I personally prefer goals that I can point to and say ""I did this thing"" rather than ""I did a ton of different things and/or spent gold."" Laurels and karma are a weird middle there.)

Buffing the working together bonus is a good idea, but it'd have the side effect of cheapening everything else.

When I was 16, my best friend (a girl) was raped by one of the ""popular"" boys in school. He was a senior. In our state, 16 was the age of consent so no statutory rape situation here. He raped her by telling her he'd bring her back home from a party she was attending (she was drunk), driving her to an empty lot and pulling a knife on her. 

She went to the police the next day and filed a report. The police took it seriously and investigated. During that time the whole town (stereotypical small town) turned on her. They kept telling her what a ""whore"" she was and ""how could she do this to such a good boy?"" Nobody except me would talk to her at school. A lot of people who were at the party told her ""you were drunk, you wanted it"". 

What I remember most vividly is her balled up on my couch crying, asking why they were punishing her for being raped. 

The police arrested him. They found the knife in the lot with his fingerprints on it. He was sentenced to 20 years.  At least the police took it seriously.

This is why any fucking idiot who first believes the rape victim is making it up deserves a kick in the face. There are examples of this happening, but legitimate claims far outnumber false claims.","1362097366"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","The theory of evolution, a perfectly respectable theory, doesn't tell you why humans must have two legs and not six. We can give a rough story about bipedalism in humans that tells you why it is the way it is, and why it didn't go another way, but only given the whole history of humans and the environment can you even get close to a necessity claim - you would have to account for every relevant genetic and environmental factor over the whole course of evolution to explain why it couldn't have gone differently. Importantly, it's not the laws which have to change to give you a different result. If you get a necessity claim at all, it's one full of buts and howevers and ceteris paribus clauses. 

In a theory of consciousness, qualia are going to function much like phenotypes (bipedalism, stereo vision) rather than nomic relations (the speed of light; in evolution, perhaps Hamilton's law). The same laws could give you different qualia. That's why inverted spectrum arguments are generally plausible in the first place - we don't have to imagine that some laws of nature have changed to imagine our colour spectra were inverted. That by itself should be enough to do away with the necessity idea. It should also make you slightly uncomfortable about the status of qualia.

What are we looking to prove? The necessity of your red-experience or mine? We don't have any way to compare them. Qualia are *essentially* private and subjective. In the idiom of qualia, the whole necessity thing is impossible to prove by any scientific standard, because we can't even get at what the qualitative properties *are* by any scientific standard. Maybe that was your point. 

We're assuming that qualia are proper explananda for a theory of consciousness, which is a much larger argument and I don't want to go there. 

Also, qualia are not the only observable phenomena of consciousness. For one, there's behaviour, verbal and otherwise, which seems like a pretty big one. There's also brain activity. Maybe you meant that qualia are all you find when you introspect. This is a view I don't necessarily hold, but is there *something it is like to believe* that 2 + 2 = 4? The intuition is often no, there's no qualitative feel to holding that or many other beliefs. On some views, it would be difficult to hold beliefs if they all had associated qualitative properties, given that you hold innumerably many at a time. Your inner life would be a mess of qualia, all the time. Yet you can introspect beliefs. You can also introspect memories, which might have associated qualia when you are remembering, but not when they are dormant. Even pure introspective investigation very quickly leads to the postulation of non-qualitative phenomena, so it's disingenuous to say that qualia are what needs to be explained just because they are all that is observable by introspection. A plausible view is that introspection is a form of access to a phenomenon with many qualities (consciousness), rather than the only access to a unique and personal realm of mental properties - as soon as you accept that, you have to let go of introspective priority.

Also also, not all forms of behaviourism deny the existence of qualia. At worst they do, but at least they demand that the explanatory work be done by publicly observable phenomena, which is a standard way of doing science. Qualia, standardly construed as private and subjective, must be given behaviourist explanations to some extent if they're going to be explained by science at all.

To speak off the record as it were, we don't give explanatory priority of madness to the mad, so that we just wait for some insane person to come along who is sufficiently systematic to draw us a picture of their internal experience. It's only because we're all mad that we do this with consciousness.","1362097379"

&gt;Yes, the negation of the antonym is much better...

You seemed to think that rejection was more than just lack of accepting.

&gt;the number of 'atheists' is artificially and quite misleadingly inflated.

It's only inflation if we discard the definition in question.  Also, irrelevant.

&gt;If a given label is inherently self-applied

Which I disagreed with.

&gt;they're peddling nonsense

No, they're making the point that atheism is the default position.

&gt;See how easy it is to not-assign a probability yet use probabilistic reasoning anyway?

No.  I didn't mention numbers.  You can't say that there probably aren't gnomes in your garden because there's no evidence.  I mean, I assume said gnomes are capable of hiding themselves, so you don't have any reason to suspect that you would find evidence.  Otherwise, you have ***knowns*** on which to base your probability assignment.

&gt;but you may not claim that I suggested that we cannot label persons in general.

No, I'm saying it's a problem that you arbitrarily assigned ""atheist"" as a self-applied label but then allowed that non-theist could work without being self-applied.

&gt;**The label 'atheist'** (or 'theist') **is one which is self-assigned** or not assigned at all. (Premise)

&gt;**If you reject this, then you run into the problem** of identifying just who qualifies to decree who is or is not a theist, **atheist, or any other self-applicable label.**

If I reject premise 2, then I run into a problem with premise 2.  That is what you said.  That is what I took issue with.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I haven't seen anyone else mention how useful it can be to watch high level streams.

Seeing people who are the top 1% of the game in skill level teaches you some really useful tricks (like the most efficient way to clear minion waves, for example).

Granted, you can't 100% rely on those games as a template for the games you will be playing (as meta changes drastically as you go up in the ladder). However, you will see the importance of CS/last hitting, warding, objectives (dragon/baron), and passive gameplay mixed with smart poking.

Eventually you can learn your strengths and weaknesses to the point that you will be consistently walking out of fights with &lt;100 hp (meaning you knew how long you could stay in the fight and when to retreat).

Until then just keep playing games. Sometimes when my team starts bitching I start talking to the enemy team. Not like, ""Oh man my Fiddle is so mad"" or ""This team sucks!"", but just jovially. Like, ""Oh LOL! Nice play!"" after getting ganked, etc. This kind of lets you ride on the coattails of the *enemy team's* success, which strangely can put you in a better mood and actually improve your gameplay.

I had a game recently where every single other lane lost, and I was zoned pretty heavily early game as an ADC. While other team members were complaining and trying to /ff (surrender), I just kept on farming, kept on farming, and playing it safe. Eventually as they were pushing into our nexus, I had reached massive farm and was starting to carry during the last few team fights (even with the rest of the team in pretty bad shape).

I ended up getting Honorable Opponent just because I played smart and kept trying all the way to the end... and I felt good about it! Surrendering early is like saying, ""I only want to play games where there's a clear ending."" I don't think LoL should be played that way. In five minutes one can go from losing terribly to winning.

Stay positive, keep playing, and watch high level streams to find some 'role models'. Guardsman Bob is great for mannered, calm, and positive gameplay, and Voyboy or TheOddOne are great for analytical comments during gameplay.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Sorry, I was a bit terse; I quickly wrote a reply more aimed at Servaphetic than you, skipping over some maybe-not-so-obvious things. So let's go over that a bit more slowly!

To recap for the viewers at home, we are trying to prove T, i.e. that if n is an even natural number such that n &gt; 2 then 2^n -1 is not prime. 

If n is even, then there is another natural number m so that n = 2m. If n &gt; 2, then surely n &gt;= 4 (since the next even number after 2 is 4), so m &gt;= 4/2 = 2. So far, we have only used the assumption that n is even and n &gt; 2. 

As I've shown in my previous comment, 2^n - 1 = (2^(m)-1)(2^(m)+1) - and that holds for any m.  

But when m is a natural number &gt;= 2, 2^m is also a natural number, and larger than or equal to 4. [ This is because the function 2^x is always increasing, it would *not* work for (1/2)^(x); I don't know if you learned this property under another name! ] Anyway, if m &gt;= 2, 2^m &gt;= 4, and so 2^m - 1 &gt;= 3 and 2^m + 1 &gt;= 5. 

So, we've factored 2^n - 1 into two numbers (2^m - 1 and 2^m + 1) that are both definitely larger than 1. That means 2^n -1 can't be prime, because a product of two numbers larger than one is not prime!

If you want to be explicit about how you used the assumption that n &gt; 2, write something like ""let m = n/2; m is natural because is even; m &gt; 2/2 = 1; so m &gt;= 2 because m is natural"" maybe? I really don't know what level of formality you need! I'm not from the US, so I had my ""Intro to Proofs"" class when I was 13 :-) 

In any case, if you need more help, just ask!

******

As for your second question: Yes, that's correct! 9 is in fact the smallest odd number n &gt; 1 such that 2^n -1 is prime; 7, 31 and 127 are prime (corresponding to 3, 5 and 7).","1362097397"

"perth","t5_2r78m","There's a few different stores and trainers that offer your open water dive ticket.

It entirely depends on which training organisation you'd like to come under. The main 2 options in Perth are SSI and PADI. PADI is probably slightly more internationally recognised however. In general, the training is all the same though. There are a few others such as NAUI and BSAC but I don't know of anywhere in Perth that teaches these.

If you were to go with PADI there's [Dolphin Dive Fremantle](http://www.dolphindiveshop.com/), [Dolphin Scuba in Welshpool](http://www.dolphinscuba.com.au/), Perth Scuba in Canning Vale, Fantasy Scuba in Joondalup and a few independents such as the UWA Underwater Club and some others in Rockingham.

Don't decide on the trainer by their websites, btw. The SCUBA industry in Australia does not as a whole make huge amounts of money, so websites aren't a big concern. Call them up, get an idea of how long the training is for (over how many days), how many dives it includes (confined and open), what dive gear and course resources are included - you should get all dive gear, air fills and course resources including RDP tables or eRDPml computer in the package.

Overall they're all pretty same-same for training, just don't try to cram it all into 2 days as you're more likely to forget important stuff. Ring around, find the best quality.","1362097399"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; decomposing the problem in his head and those are the layers he came up with 

This method works great for business logic type code or any straightforward but large piece of code, because it's easy enough to make it up as you go, but I find that for mathematical code the following method works much better:

1. Think hard about the problem and its solution.
2. Write down the algorithm in 4 lines of math.
3. Translate the 4 lines of math into 15 lines of Python+Numpy or equivalent.

The method where you immediately start writing code before you've fully understood the problem and its solution doesn't work very well for mathematical code (or any algorithmic code for that matter). You're probably just going to introduce ultimately useless abstractions until you've done step 1 above. Good mathematical code doesn't need any more abstractions than one or two functions with a couple of loops. If you don't do step 1 at some point then you might never escape the ""introduce useless abstractions"" phase.

I think what Inyouraeroplane is saying is that when people use the term, ""homophobia"" they're generally using it as a catch all term for any and every form of discrimination, resistance to, or disdain for homosexuality. Problem is that the word has a specific meaning and few really do fall beneath it.

That's not to say someones not a bigot just because they aren't afraid of homosexuals, it just means they aren't afraid of them. So calling it heterosexism or heteronormative behaviour which means to basically discriminate based on your standards surrounding what you view as the proper form of sex(read: heterosexuality) would be more accurate.

I generally agree to this myself because I feel saying someone is *afraid* of something, no matter how stupid their fear, is almost like giving them some degree of an excuse for their actions, I mean if it weren't for that term you wouldn't have the ""gay panic"" defense, regardless of how effective that ploy is in court.","1362097409"

After all, if you're poor enough to shoplift, incidence would not just stop there - you'd probably expect more crimes to follow, right? I'd expect poverty to increase likelihood of a crime occurring MUCH more than twofold. The discrepancy you point to only exist because you have the expectation that poverty will increase chances of a crime occurring by only two.

If you look at crime incidence maps you should probably expect that crime in poor areas is much higher than twofold, as well.

My point is without knowing the actual correlation between poverty and crime (and that's all it is - correlation), not to mention breaking it town between types of crime, all this is 100% uneducated speculation. but 7-8x increases sound about right to me - I'd expect someone below the poverty line (which is REALLY low) is probably 7-8x more likely to mug me than someone above the poverty line.","1362097411"

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","I came here four years ago when my husband got a job at a Hong Kong University.

I'd never been anywhere in Asia before.

The decision was easy because holy shit - Hong Kong!

I'm a freelance writer and blogger, so I don't really have to be at an office anytime, so my days are pretty unstructured.  I usually get up early, go for a walk around my village (I live in the New Territories, outside the city center) and check out the fishermen, feed the feral cats, visit the vegetable markets.  Then I come back and put in a few hours on whatever project I'm working on at the time.  Then into the city - I'm helping a friend who's a local filmmaker produce a video tour guide to Hong Kong, so we'd do some filming/brainstorming over dim sum.  Then back home, cook dinner or go out, drink a bunch of beer and watch Archer or Walking Dead or whatever's on Netflix, then bed.

Sounds a bit boring, but Hong Kong's always got something going on so on weekends I'm often hiking, going to see music, taking short trips, etc.  It's a fun life.

At that, it was a pretty good article about a pretty neat thing done concerning the state which your sub/r's focused on, and it seems that at least 4 other people agreed....before you removed it that is.

As far as my I've posted a '*shitload*' of them recently (again, mostly to sub/r's that I am moderator for) is because I finally got around to catching up on my emails from them that've built up over the past few months... ie, since I'd last gone through the folder I have them automatically moved to so I don't have to think about them until I choose to.

That's why there was such a large focused wave of them in the past 24 hours and... that's why I came across the article about the solar potential of your state. Even if I *did* post a lot of them, I only posted the one to your sub/r and... at that, people seemed to enjoy it.

It wasn't done with negative intentions.... and definitely not done with intentions of spamming for the site, despite it looking that way. Trust me, I went through a lot of filtering of those emails to getting to the articles that I posted, and then I posted them (after reading them of course) to the sub/r's that they seemed appropriate... and, that I believed they would be found of interest.... again, before it was removed from your sub/r's list of links... 4 other people apparently thought so too.

edit: scratch that. it was *5* other people... it received *1* downvote, though I'm guessing that could've been from you?

I'm a mod over nearly 20 sub/r's... and I can tell you, we (myself as well the other mods I/we share the sub/r's with) get many many more compliments on our moderating methods than complains.... and we all tend to pretty much agree that, when it comes to moderating posts, a philosophy of 'less is more' seems to work best... a healthy community will tend to keep itself clean... by downvoting anything its members don't like out of view... as appears to be the *opposite* of what happened with this post.... this post seems to have been removed due to more dictatorial moderating practices than community interests... which, to be fair, is kind of how reddit is set up... though, if it were up to me, I'd make it's structure more democratic... with 'votes' among subscribers over whom said subscribers feel should moderate it... but... then again, who really cares that much, right?

"IAmAFiction","t5_2su77","I can empathize with how difficult to understand the write ups on the company website are. In fairness to the PR team, it's a lot like asking ""How 'intelligent' are humans?"". They act and feel and learn incredibly similar to humans. There's some casual debate in the lab as to whether they turned out so similar because our own model for intelligence is the human mind, or because all intelligence are destined to be vaguely similar.

But to be specific; Most AIs will be upper end of above average in intelligence. Their memory capacity is much larger than a humans, and they have far less difficulty in recollection, so they tend to know more 'facts' than your average person. 

Emotionally they are very... passionate. It's hard to tell if this is natural to the design, or if they are all colored by a need to represent their new species. There's a machoness to it. Almost like a new country or civilization, there's a, um, need to prove themselves. Remember, the oldest AI, Atticus, is only 4 years old. And he didn't graduate our educational program until he was one and a half, so there's a naivety to all of them still.

As for your last question, well, they are super machines. Their physical bodies are capable of the feats of a machine, not a man(it wasn't sanctioned, but one of the boys down in tech convinced an AI to bench his truck). As I said earlier, they are very human. And we have made sure that they have total free will. This isn't the 1950s, we didn't start this project with the vision of a robot butler in every house.

That being said, no one knows each of them better than I do, and there isn't one of them that I don't feel we raised properly. 

Nothing is stopping them from turning to a life of crime, going on a murderous rampage in the streets-- and I suppose that's partly what has the government upset with us, at least, that's the reason they are giving you.","1362097418"

Your definition religion is too broad to be used well. Your interpretation of that definition is even MORE broad. It is meaningless. Everything is a religion in that case. Everything.

Believe that washing your jersey will remove the luck? Religion.

Your definition of religion that includes atheism is useless. So have fun with that. I'll be over here at the big boy's table where we understand that atheism is not even a system of belief, none the less a religion.

EDIT: Like the literal definition of the word religion almost NEVER even gets close to atheism. But discussions don't work like that, you don't just fine a dictionary that describes what you think it should mean and go, ""HAHA SEE I WAS RIGHT!""

"InsightfulQuestions","t5_2smsq","This is actually pretty complex due to the infrastructure of the energy industry. 

- First of all, only half of the states in the US have ""deregulated"" energy markets. This means that in half of the country, there is still only a single utility transmitting energy to every single building, and since there's only one, they have a monopoly on the market and are able to set the price. In the other half, utilities compete with each other, allowing for competitive pricing since consumers can choose who they go with and even what kind of energy they consume. 

- Second, your kWh price will vary depending on what time of day you use it, what time of year it is, and how much you use. This is all because utilities *can* do this. That's about it. 

- Third, hooking up your alternative energy source to distribution (distribution is moving electricity from the power generator to the distribution center, eg a coal plant to a substation) can be pretty complicated. But this is already in favor of renewable energy because distributed generation (small scale power generation like solar panels or small turbines as opposed to a nuclear plant or large wind farm) is cheaper due to how the energy gets loaded and the transmission system. 

These are only a couple of reasons why pricing is very complicated in the energy industry. Given none of this mattered anymore and alt energy was just cheaper and we had the infrastructure for distribution and transmission, we would see oil and gas prices go down. Oil and gas isn't priced high because it costs oh so much money to get it out of the ground. The most profitable companies in the world are energy companies, and that's because we are willing to pay whatever price they set because we depend on their energy, Oil and gas companies would lower their prices, making it more competitive and drive alt energy right out of business, because it actually does cost oh so much money to build things like solar panels and turbines. But before they do this, you can sure as hell bet the lobbies will take care of this in Congress - continued energy subsidies targeted at oil and gas instead of renewables and policies aimed at keeping them in power. Theres a lot of money and jobs at stake when we talk about energy, and these companies would not take that lying down.

And yes, I know women are treated more than men, but scientists have also discovered that women have more nerve and inflammatory diseases, which, I believe accounts for the 2-1 thing for women. Don't believe me? Look at fibromyalgia, lupus, MS, chronic fatigue, osteoporosis, etc...women are three times as likely to get one of these diseases.

When I talk about women doing most of the chores, I am talking about young women, with little babies and children, who no, can't fend for themselves. I taught my children how to do their own laundry young, the same with cooking, etc...however, I still had to drive them everywhere until they got their license. I had to take them to the doctor, play practice, shopping, etc...it's a whole load, and it's every day. Men have different roles, but even my husband said I do far more than he does.

But, not everyone knows enough about small-party candidates to list them in a preference-ordering, which may lead to some weird results if I'm not mistaken in a PR system. For example, a third-party they have nothing in common with and know nothing about may get representation due to their uninformed preference ordering. Also, I believe counting would be tedious on such a large scale for Condorcet. Approval is much simpler, only requiring voters to say which candidates they ""approve"" of. If they don't know they candidate, they can simply say they don't approve. This also reduces counting time.

In all likelihood, at this point you can give them a copy of your resume (which you brought with you) and you can hope for the best, knowing that you've done all that you reasonably can without bugging anyone.

In my opinion, while many stores will require some sort of electronic application (as this assists them in bookkeeping and standardized information gathering) I think many front line managers would be more interested in someone that took the time to come in and express their interest, rather than likely sitting at home in pajamas copy-pasting your resume into the applications of a dozen different online job applications.","1362097432"

We need to instill the desire to want to learn.  To challenge preconceived notions so people understand why things are the way they are.

Who is to say that the parts of life we find important - Money, material objects, even family, friends, and personal betterment could be seen as trivial and strange upon death and proceeding into the after life.  That is my personal take on it anyway.  I believe that we would see the universe in it's true form, and have our eyes completely opened to the currently unfathomable amazement of the universe and it's function.

As for the physical substrate of soul?  Well I watched an interesting documentary on how our brains and the power of thought is so much more mysterious and powerful than we thought (for example the altering of RNG's due to mass events like 911 or Obama's election even).  I declare that the fact that we can be sentient and conscious means that our physical ability to think is much more that for making decision, but perhaps the body is just the way in which we can project our thoughts from a higher consciousness into the physical universe.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","This is one of those products where it's hard to go wrong with any good brand if you get a good price.  I've had (or have, or gotten for others) patagonia, MH, marmot, rab, montbell, backcountry (they made their own, think they still do), REI, etc.  Before you think me obsessed with down jackets, some have been given to me, some lost or damaged, and I am a bit of a gear whore and I have friends that work in the outdoor industry so everything is cheap and plentiful.  My current fave that fits your bill is the Patagonia down sweater, it fits great, perfectly warm for the cool temps, and is pretty durable.  I haven't had to try out any warranties, ever, I just use duct tape if/when things start to fall apart.  I have a hand-me down big poofy patagonia jacket that's 10+ years old which I traded for, and with a little duct tape it's still good and got me to the top of Kilimanjaro.

I should have mentioned earlier that she used bone-dry slabs in her glaze firing. The reason for this is that the unfired clay will shrink much more during the firing than the already bisqued work. It is really easy to separate the slab from the glazed piece ff any of her glazes ran onto the slabs during the firing since the shrinkage of the unfired clay creates significant amounts of tension. All it needs is a little tap and it should pop right off, leaving a minimal amount of grinding to clean up the bottom.","1362097439"

Also, everyone knows what superior headphones sound like and Beats are inferior. I said this before, Sennheisers are to give a flat response for people who desire that. Beats color and boost the bass because they're essentially deigned for hip-hop and bass music. Both do their job just fine. I'd never use a pair of Beats to produce because it gives you a false indication of the low end and muds up the mids BUT bass music sounds pretty good on them.

I'm not denying that your headphones are superior and that they show all the detail; I OWN  a pair and know that. All I'm saying is they're not **as** bad as people make them out to be.

"explainlikeIAmA","t5_2t5iz","Well John, have you ever tried playing Search and Destroy?  Yeah, it's pretty intense, only one life per round so you have to play really conservatively if you don't want to sit out the round.  Well, in real war, it's  kind of like that, except you're afraid of never having a chance to kiss your daughter goodnight again.  You're afraid of never being able to play a game of cards with your father or share a beer with your best friend.  You're afraid of sitting out for the rest of time after dying a horrible, painful death with shrapnel in your gut.  You're afraid your childhood friend is going to walk into an IED and you're going to have to go home without him.  When the stakes are that high, you play *a lot* more conservatively.  That noob tube is a lot scarier.  Those campers are a much, much bigger threat.  There is no end to the round, it goes on until you get sent home, and that could be years.

War is thousands of these people on both sides of the conflict line trying to kill each other over some political dispute created by men in suits who have probably never so much as held a pistol; men who may just be manufacturing this conflict so that they can move merchandise and get rich.  It could be politicians with calculating intelligence and callous hearts moving pawns on a board, or it could be a burning heart who believes they're doing the right thing by throwing other men's lives into a meat grinder.

Real war is no game of search and destroy, it's a desperate game of survival, and these days there really doesn't seem to be any winner.","1362097444"

Without the odd-even trick if the two databases lose network connectivity for a minute or two, and records get inserted into both, they're both going to increment to the same number.  Then when network connectivity is restored and they try to sync, uh oh.. Duplicate key.  It's simple to set up. It's 2 lines in your mysql config file:

Server A gets:

    auto-increment-increment=2
    auto-increment-offset=1

Server B gets:

    auto-increment-increment=2
    auto-increment-offset=2

As far as promoting goes, I'd actually keep the slaves as is and just put a new master in place.  Load up a backup sql file and let replication sync back up since your last backup was done.  I'm in a virtual environment, so I just deploy a new mysql VM template, change the configs, load my latest backup and let it sync.

Without being virtual, you should have an image ready to deploy, or even just a backup hard drive ready.  I guess worst case scenario is that you can build a new mysql server real quick, but I'd be ready to go with backups.","1362097445"

The beach itself is not bad though. The area east of the beach is very trendy and a lot of internet/tech companies are moving in (its being called ""Silicon beach""). Eventually the boardwalk will probably also become gentrified like the rest of Venice.

I really don't get where this argument comes from.  Yes he's a playmaker first, but he was also a versatile and very good player.

No.  But he was probably a top ten or fifteen DB in the country in his Heismann year.  Couple that with his return talents and his ability to rip the ball from a receiver's hands, he'll be a steal for whoever decides to ""take the risk"" in the second or third round.","1362097447"

You pull over and pop the hood. The Smoke is what color? Grey? White? Black? Purple?

Grey - might be okay, might be bad.
White - Depends on how much of it you see. Little = okay to get to a garage. A lot = don't move the damn thing.
Black - You're fucked.
Purple - WTF?

No where is said smoke coming from? Are we looking at power steering fluid leaking from a rack and pinion? Are we looking at a crack in the block that's leading to oil coming out? Are we looking at a water cooling hose without the clamp tightened down? Let's say that it's been ages since you've checked the power-steering fluid level, and it ran low. The pump shaved itself and metal slivers got into the system, tearing up the rack and pinion. Now, the remaining fluid is leaking onto the exhaust manifold, and Y pipe. Fuck. This is a ~$1000 fix.The good news is that you can drive it to the garage with some power steering fluid you can pick up at any gas station.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Oh, absolutely. I tutor a lot of kids, which is basically teaching them to pass a test. Some of them are smart, ambitious kids, who are basically not getting an A because they don't realise they have to write what their teacher expects (there aren't standardised exams in Germany). Others are D students. I typically get the former group up to an A by convincing them to write what their teachers expect (no, your teachers don't value your own thoughts—they want to hear you regurgitate their won); I usually get the latter group up to a C, sometimes a B, by teaching them how to sit an exam.

None of it has anything to do with real-world performance. It's all teaching to the test. That's what they pay me for, and I don't get the time to teach the kids in the sense of developing them as people.

The PISA study is enormously interesting in this regard. The press only ever focus on the test results. They ignore the fact that good scores are negatively correlated with interest in the subject: systems that teach to the test do very well, whereas the really important stuff, like teaching a kid to think, be creative, collaborate and work alone is completely ignored.","1362097453"

IIRC, there wasn't much left of the wall in other areas, with specific parts left up becuase of the gorgeous vandalism, but the pieces left up were worth leaving up. ","1362097453"
