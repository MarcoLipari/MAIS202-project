"QAnonCasualties","t5_1g87gi","&gt; Im a leftist, and an atheist and they know this. 

Be careful. By itself those do not make you immune from finding pleasure in believing one or more of these things:

* That you are better than other people because they are an out-group

* That people in power are lying to you

* That a 'day of reckoning' will come (and the winner will be you!)

These are the kinds of teachings that cults entice people with. And leftist atheists can fall for them too -- 9/11 trutherism affected people who were critical-thinking atheists. Just think about angry atheists: they believe they're better than the out-group of religious people, don't trust those national governments that push religion and believe that, eventually, religion will die because it is so abhorrent to reason. That ticks off all those points above. I'm not lying when I say that I could definitely see a charismatic individual convincing some percentage of such believers into becoming True Believers of some constructed ideology.

Ideology has benefits (most often ones imagined within the mind of the person who adopts the ideology) and costs (most often when the ideology is used to shape the world and a lack of nuance does damage). Ideology is found in right-wing and left-wing beliefs. Ideology is found in religion and in atheism. Be careful.",1596240000

If you are non compliant, making attempts to flee, and police think you are a threat (which was reasonable assumption given a witness report provided to dispatcher of an armed hostage taker) then they have a right to use force to stop you. Had he complied with officers immediately he would have walked away without so much as a ticket.

Never attempt to flee from police. They will assume you are dangerous and will do everything they can to catch you. And this is the right way to do it, because if you're dangerous, and desperately trying to escape, you may hurt/kill someone else.

This video is also not very objective and seeks to stoke racial tensions. Clearly the officers did not want to kill him, and gave him multiple opportunities to surrender before he chose to felony evade resulting in his shooting.

Because, you know, it's such an issue to you. Which is fine! Because you feel strongly about it and always have, which is why you've never played a match with any gender locked characters without quitting out of a sense of duty and why you've never played as any gender locked characters yourself.

Believe me I give all the props to any Dev that has anything to do with these apks because I'm sure a lot of work has to go into it and 99% of the time it's on your own dime unless you're charging for your app which only a couple people and if an APK came out that was good enough for me to pay monthly I would definitely do it but I won't do it for any of the ones that are out now because they have tons and tons of TV shows and movies on their apps but a lot of them don't get any links so you can't watch them. I wish I knew how to make an APK or app because the way I would do it if it's possible that is and I also know it would probably take a lot of time to do and I might even charge a dollar or $2 per month depending how good it was. I would either make a  click and play with no links click on the movie or TV show and there you go or I would make sure that any TV show or movie that was on my app every one of those would be able to be watched because there would be links to all the TV shows and movies, if I couldn't find links then the shows won't be on there no one has come out with one like that it's probably not possible or just too much work but then again that's why someone could get away with charging 1- $2 per month and people would have no problem with it. If you've heard of cyberflix that's a clone of an older app called terrarium several years ago it was the best thing out It got shut down but cyberflix is said to be used by 20 million users that's a lot of  1- $2 LOL keep up the good work stay safe.",1596240002

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","Every class can solo this game.

If you and your three pals all want to play mages, thats completely fine.

Your tactics will be different than a traditional F/C/T/W group, your thinking when leveling up to pick ability points and feats will be different.

Such as Ambush and Quadra Fireball tactics, or Flyby Quadra Fireball, or Quadra Storm of Vengeance, or Quadra Gate.



A pure mix of Stealth and Magic, such as in your case, could merit from this type of Ambush/Trap combat. 

Your Rogues should get buffed with greater invisibility and haste, to dish out sneak attack damage and your enemies should be CC'd with Webs/Grease, AOE etc, while you all summon conjured creatures at them. In a pinch, Polymorph someone into a tank. 

With Animate Objects spell you can animate 10 individual objects to act independently of each other and attack your enemies. Thats 10 enemy attacks tanked, unless theyre ignored in which case thats 10 attacks with +6 to hit 1d8 + 2 damage damage every turn.

I think play what you want to play, figuring out solution to obstacle is best part of game. 

Having a tank means sometimes AOE or Stealth tactics are useless due to Dude-In-The-Way-Wearing-Clanging-Metal.

Worst (best?) case scenario just go Awaken/Helm of Intelligence a tanky animal (Gorilla?), get it barding (Gorilla sword? Gorilla SHIELD!?), and bring your new DMpet along as meatshield.",1596240002

&gt;A Party Committee is formed by a group of senior CCP members who are given a leadership position inside the halls of public and private companies operating in China[...]Within private enterprises, however, it implements Party‚Äôs policies and operates through the Trade Union and the Communist Youth League Organization



&gt;. In 2017, Party Committees existed in around 70 percent of 1.86 million private owned companies in China, with a presence that is destined to grow



&gt;The members of the Party Committees could also become part of the board of directors or the executive team.

&gt;The Party unit must oversee the system of appointment of the executives.

PTO is an internal accounting function that isn't required by federal law (some states do require it but not federally), and doesn't have to be 'paid out' at the end of your employment if stipulated in your handbook and explained at hire. 

Now, the question is what happens when you run out of PTO? Well the company can allow you to 'go negative'. But a lot of companies have limits to how far they'll let you go negative. If it goes too much, usually there's disciplinary action or  write ups, warnings, even termination. But note, all through that time, as long as you work 1 hour that week, your paycheck is still $1152, no matter what happening with PTO.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","&gt; what kind of ""proof"" do you want?

Photographic, ideally.

&gt; color theory is a descriptive body of work and what it describes is that black (and white) tend to pair well with nearly any other color. this isn't new, niche or obscure information- this is something that designers of all kinds working in all mediums have been aware of for centuries.

I've heard of color theory. I've read a lot about it. I've seen a very small number of applications in fashion that actually made sense when moved from paper to practice.

&gt; black ... [is] used to create contrast

but it creates *intense* contrast. Grays are infinitely more versatile since they are tonally neutral *without* being an infinite void of despair from which no color can return.

&gt; even within fashion itself black has been widely acknowledged as ""easy to match"" for ages-

No, it hasn't, and you won't be able to provide me a source for that, because it's not true. I doubt you could even find a GQ article raving about black as ""easy to match.""

&gt; the only place where i've EVER seen this weird ass attitude towards the color is this subreddit.

Have you tried checking:

* Styleforum; or
* any decent youtube channel; or
* any other fucking fashion community?

&gt; If I had to attribute it to something it would be this subs roots in #menswear and traditional ivy prep, which are styles that favor earth tones and pastels over other colors.

Lol, this is so many different kinds of ridiculous. The sub predates #menswear, and has never been focused on classic menswear. Ivy prep was big here at different points in time...

But neither of these styles favors earth tones or pastels in any sense. Classic menswear is focused on navy and charcoal, with white and blue shirting, and *usually* reserves brown for shoes, where black is pretty much an equal competitor. Greens are very rare. Brown tailoring is classically disfavored and only gained an edge over black relatively recently, and even then, mostly only in casual tailoring. Black is still important in eveningwear, of course. Pastel shirting is sometimes acceptable.

Ivy prep still focuses on navy, with perhaps some gold hardware on your navy blazer. Black pennies and tassels are a big part of ivy prep. Grey is still big. Burgundies play a role. Browns come into play now and then. Greens are still not common. Shirting is mostly the same -- light blues and whites, with maybe some more pink in the oxfords, but also more of everything -- a red, orange, or yellow stripe oxford is absolutely fair game in ivy prep. So again, making it about earth tones or pastels means you either don't understand what ivy prep is, or don't understand what those color pallates even are.

&gt; if you want the science behind it- black isn't even a color really, it's the absence of light and you can turn any color into black by decreasing its value or subtractively combining it with enough other colors.

If you combine it with other colors, it's *not black*.

&gt; By definition it's neutral.

Tone. A neutral tone.

Olive and blue, despite being colors, are more neutral in practice, because they don't create intense, jarring contrast.",1596240004

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","I suggest that you talk to your parents and tell them how you‚Äôre feeling.  Tell them you know how important college is to them and that you also are taking it seriously. Compliment their parenting.  Then  I encourage you to work out a no college zone or time.  With my family it was the dining room table ‚Äî my kids knew they could eat their Cheerios in the morning and have family dinners without my interrogating them.  It helped us all to have some barriers.  Some families only allow college talk one day or night a week or only in a certain room/space.  Other families make sure the car is a no college talk zone. Try to reach an agreement with your parents. I think they‚Äôll be open if they know you are taking the process seriously and if you explain how stressed out the constant college chatter is making you. Good luck!",1596240004

They can‚Äôt even count their votes in Iowa, they can‚Äôt even count. No they can‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt count their votes.

One of my people came up to me and said, ‚ÄòMr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia. That didn‚Äôt work out too well. They couldn‚Äôt do it. They tried the impeachment hoax.

I guess I'm just getting sick of games advertising exciting co-op only to find out that you can't co-op the main story, or one person has to complete the area or quest first then they can go back and co-op with the friend, or everyone has to watch the cutscene separately.

"Irrigation","t5_2s3gr","Hi: I implemented the system as shown above, with the ""drip hose"" above a black poly irrigation tubing (1/2"" to 3/4""?) as the main line, with plugs branching off to individual drip lines and emitters at every pot.  It's powered with a fountain pump from Harbor Freight that has 264 gph and 5.5 ft of head ([https://www.harborfreight.com/plumbing/pumps/fountain-pumps/264-gph-submersible-pond-pump-63313.html](https://www.harborfreight.com/plumbing/pumps/fountain-pumps/264-gph-submersible-pond-pump-63313.html))

It would work beautifully for about 5-10 minutes, and the water flow will slow to a stop with intervention. I can reset everything by unhooking the main line from the pump and plugging it back in again, then it's back to being beautiful for 5-10 mins, etc.

I should mention that at the end of the main line I have an adjustable valve for purging any air in the system. I've tried operating with it opened all the way, and closed all the way, and different position in between, in an effort to adjust the flow rate to the drip branches but to no avail.

Is it some sort of airlock in the system that slowly degrade performance to nothing? The overall rise from the pump elevation to the bucket is about 2 - 2.5 ft, though the main line and the drip lines do rise and fall over the length due to kinks and physical constraints .

Would appreciate if anyone can help me understand why the dynamic nature of the water flow?  Thanks.",1596240005

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","They are worth 30 BILLION low ball. They are milking the JW Hindenburg before it bursts into (somewhat) eternal flames. (Zech3:2) LDS was worth 30 billion in 2013. WTBTS is possibly double their networth. True, they have been skimming for years but there is still an easy 10 billion ""nailed to the ground"", but most is ported to the real ""King North"" bank at double those ""brick and mortar"" numbers. (Dan11:32a) If people think these GB-Pied-Piper guys are evil, then we may as well take it to the max as 333% PURE evil, total fakes, time to ""go to heaven"" soon (WT10/2019), evil. They have even laid out there ""we gotta go to heaven"" as the ""the end"" ""exit plan"" manifests shortly with the proper but misperceived ""global events"" which they will sell for as long as it lasts as ""doomsday brothers! help us loot the now unneeded whoreld wide organization!"".

From 2012 this thing has been set up like clockwork.

1. For example, 2012 ""change in KH ownership policy"" blah blah, by 2016 ""let us mass liquidate the KHs now.
2. 2012 JW website as the ""keep looking at the left hand"" distraction for the 2014 JW ""Broadcasting"" TOTAL distraction just as all the real news was really going volcanic.
3. 2013 ""obey the org as crazy as it sounds"" ""attack coming"" hyped to today as ""Gog"", Russia is King North, ""all the kings of the earth"", the ""Assyrian"", ""attack locusts"", and on and on, all super-hyped in this same window of the op.
4. They have what is called a ""self fulfilling prophecy"" where ""JWorg"" is what ""ends"", not the world, that hype is just the cover for the planned liquidation.

CLEAR AS DAY, this is a hoax with a probably 50 BILLION DOLLAR total score. All that is needed is the proper global events, that is all.

When the ""smoke"" clears abandoned JW Lemmings at the cliff bottom will be 1. clueless, 2. a final prophecy fail GLOBAL LAUGHING STOCK, with a little eventual sympathy on the side.

"bikewrench","t5_2sje0","It would be a big improvement in stiffness and ability of the forks to absorb big hits for sure, but there would be a major weight penalty, the Mach only weighs 3.5lb similar to a modern Reba or Fox 32, the Silver TK weighs over 5lbs (biggest reason is because of the steel stanchions). With a bigger wheel, tire and discs you'd be adding 3-4lb to the front end of the bike. I think the XCM32 are even heavier.

Also not sure how the damping would compare, the TK damping is basic and might not be better than that on a high end fork even from 20 years ago. The XCM damping is probably worse

One other thing I'd say, if you are looking to run a 27.5+ front wheel that will lift the front end of the bike as much or more than 40mm longer travel forks will, I would think the geometry would be thrown way off with both things combined.

That's different.

Imagine what happens when you start opening your home for other kids, even if they're friends of your kid: if they hurt themselves in your care, it opens you to legal liability for any injury. 

If they were just visiting for a playdate, then your homeowners' insurance may very well pay for the medical bills out of a plethora of accidental coverages for guests and/or dwellers in the home. 

But if they can prove you're running what amounts to a school out of your home? Then your homeowners' insurance won't pay for the bills, leaving the only recourse for the other parents to sue the pants off of you. 

I mean, we almost agreed to a pod back in March with one of my daughter's classmates, but the parents had second thoughts for that very reason, and the more we thought about it, my spouse and I were like ""yeeesh, their decision to go back on it kinda dodged a legal bullet for us too.",1596240008

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;Since the lows of 2018, the ratio has gone up by ~10%. so yes, it has gone up.

12% If we look at the end of 2018 low (0.02348) and current ratio (0.02651). But on June 26 of 2020 (this year) the rate was 0.0231, even lower then the 2018 low. 

This is just Cherry picking datapoints, wouldn't you agree? I can see with my own eyes the ratio is closer to 0.023 (prior ATL from 2018) then it is to 1.0 (starting point). I can see multiple times the ratio got higher and closer to 0.067 first, then declined back down to 0.025) and again went up to 0.048 (and declined back to 0.023) in the timeframe between those two data points you picked.

Instead, try this:

Using a 100 or 200 day moving average shows the declining ratio trend. It smooths out all the noise and shows the trend.

&gt;- Price manipulation by Tether, who has failed to show proof of their funds for more than 2 years

Tether is used for more then just bitcoin. It is not ONLY used for exchanging into bitcoin. 

If you prefer to ignore tether, look at coinbase, which is KYC and forces actual dollars to become bitcoin or bitcoin cash or whatever altcoins they offer.


&gt;- Market manipulation by exchanges to try and keep Bitcoin #1

This. How to reason against a conspiracy theory? I really can't just convince you otherwise if you want to believe in that. I really doubt the whole market is manipulated by independently operated exchanges located in various jurisdictions, all competing for a slice of the crypto market share. 

Does that sound reasonable and logical or does it sound more like a conspiracy theory?

So they all decided that they would do this btc/bch collusion thing because they hate bch? yes? .. Then the only reasonable response option is **‚ÄúThat which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence""** 

What if it isn't a conspiracy. What if individual people, chasing after their own best interests, the sum of which has collectively resulted in the price actions we have seen over the past few years?

&gt;- Misinformation spread about Bitcoin Cash that harms its overall perception by those in and outside of the crypto community

One bullet point above is misinformation, presented as a supporting fact.

Bitcoin had misinformation about it spread by lots of people, not just a rival coin group. By governments, by banks, by people and yet it has survived and thrived.",1596240009

No they fall into social groups in prison, change expectations of their life, control the things they can. There's people who seemingly want to go back inside. If prison was the horror it seems like to us not incarcerated, there'd be a lot less fucking recidivism. 

Think about the human condition, and the history of our evolution. We're talking hundreds of thousands of years of having little to no freedom, and well zero if you're a woman, but suddenly, only bring able to watch television for four hours a day is gonna break us?


The death penalty should be reserved for cases where there's no question of guilt. An absolute avalanche of irrefutable evidence. And everybody on death row should die within twelve months of their conviction. If there's any more doubt or confusion than that they shouldn't be there. But there's thousands of people on death row we are absolutely certain committed heinous acts against their victims and society, and can never be rehabilitated, that we seem to want to keep alive for forty years before we finally give them the needle in the middle of night.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The Postal Service wasn't a problem until Republicans forced them to **pay out pensions in advance**.

Geeze, can't even get the talking points right.  You're referring to the PAEA, which required the USPS to fund its unfunded retiree health benefits.  It didn't have anything to do with pensions, and nothing was ""paid out in advance"".  It had to do with funding what would have been nearly $80 billion in RHB liabilities by 2007 had the bill not passed.

As for them being a-ok without the bill, the USPS has over $100 billion in unfunded liabilities after 2001.  The PAEA wasn't enacted until 2006.  Of the RHBF payments they made, about $12 billion of which was done with loans from the federal government, one payment was reduced by $4 billion from $5.5 billion to $1.5 billion, and the 2011 payment was deferred to 2012, which they didn't make, and haven't made a payment since.  They've been paying out their retirement health benefit obligations straight from the fund, which will be completely depleted in less than ten years.  They lost nearly $9 billion this year without those large payments, which were only set to run until 2017, and only put $900 million into their RHB fund.  The rest was operating losses and annual benefit expenses. 

But yeah, it was the PAEA that caused all their problems.  And it was *totally* the Republicans who passed the bill, while it was staunchly opposed by the NALC, the USPS, and the Democrats in congress, right?",1596240009

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","My friend, i know how hard it can be to resist the temptation, I really do. That being said this is how this story always goes:

- You take more of the drug than is prescribed to you

- You feel "" good"" or ""well"" moreso than you would normally as a result

- You remember the experience the next day or so and how it felt

- You get hit with a craving to do some more again and since you still have X amount of pills left you make the justification  of ""I have plenty of pills left to do it again"" etc. etc. and so you decide on going for it and doing it again.

- a few days go by, and now you are feeling not so well- maybe you even feel like shit, even though you took your prescribed dose it just doesn't last throughout the entire day anymore- and you notice that it seems as though your  symptoms that caused this to be Rx'd to you are quite prevalent and causing you issues as far as meeting your responsibilities and try taking care of yourself in general.

- So you decide you're just going to have to wing it and take more than you're supposed to every day in order to get back to that ""normal"" feeling.

- You know full well that all of this means you are going to run out of pills well before you can get a refill.

- You put these thoughts on the backburner since it seems those few weeks in the future seem so far away until that happens and that you'll just ""take less towards the end if the month"" or ""go a few days without it and everything will work out fine."" Yeah, not so much.

- Eventually you run out, and now have to suffer the consequences. Your performance at school/work takes a dive, you look like shit and feel even worse. 

- Your mind is completely controlled by the thoughts of these pills and getting your fix again when you get a refill which takes priority over everything else. Anything can happen during this time and you'll have to deal with it all the while going through these withdrawls, which is a completely miserable time on it's own, not to mention life happening all around you.

- eventually you get your refill. Take a bunch to ""catch up"" with all if the doses you missed, start telling yourself the same things as before and boom a week later your out again.

- This continues and gets worse and worse until something in your head clicks and you realize you have a problem. 

Good luck and stay safe.",1596240013

On the other hand, (x,y)^(mn) = ((x^(m))^(n),(y^(n))^(m)) = (1,1), so mn &gt;= k. Hence k = mn.

Edit: Note that you can adapt my proof here to show that the order of any element (a,b) is just the least common multiple of the orders of a and b. Since m and n are relatively prime, the lcm is mn.",1596240013

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","Yes. They're still conservative now in general but there is a slow and steady improvement. Many tv shows that would've been considered shameful in the 90's are now being streamed, if you look at opinion polling people are generally becoming more tolerant of other religions due to exposure to western culture in tv and the internet, even if its a slow process. Several countries are making secular adjustments. Tunisia slashed the Islamic rule that made men take double inheritance a woman gets, and now inheritances are equal, and in democracies like Tunisia and Lebanon people are much more tolerant now of female politicians than before. People seem to care about the quality of life and the affordability of living as much and sometimes more than they do religion. Even thougu those are good indicators, it's still a process in the making. And the middle east is still nowhere as secular as the west

I think it all ties strongly to the arab spring in 2011. When a lot of young arabs were fed up with their governments. Their demands were solving corruption and more affordable living rather than a goal based on religion. In fact it offered a small sense of unity between arabs of all religions whether Christian or Muslim againdt their governments. I still remember when Egyptian muslim protestors were praying and Christian protestors formed a ring around them to protect them from the policd, and muslims doing the same to protect a church during a military crackdown",1596240015

Take some time after doing some practice, and then come back and review just for content. Nearly everyone says that C/P material on UGloob is harder than the real thing.

As for Anki, been there too! We have to memorize a ton of stuff so if you have to hit |Again| a ton of times, it's alright!

Gaia is good because she's necessary for life itself; the Weaver is evil because it is brutally authoritarian by nature (yes, even compared to the worst of the Garou) and seeks to advance the human species *at the cost of everyone else*. Spirits, the animal Kinfolk of the Fera, and ultimately the Fera themselves. *Her* utopia is one where millions of spirits are eternally imprisoned within a spider's web, unable to move.

Indeed, attitudes like your's are exactly why so many of the Fera, especially the one's who get fucked over the most by the Weaver's activities, fucking *hate* humans. Even though you know that those things exist in the setting, you don't think about them.

It's actually a little ironic, because the only ones who are actually genocidal, the Red Talons, have *exactly the same opinion* as you, except instead of ""Fuck Gaia and fuck the lupus, humanity matters more,"" they think ""Fuck the Weaver and fuck humanity, the lupus matters more.""",1596240016

"Virology","t5_2usj4","&gt;Why is the paper called a predatory publisher, and how much of the blame rests with those seeking publication?

A lot of people simply don't understand the difference between a commercial publishing company and a vanity publisher.  All they see is something in print and that somehow validates the authors' work.  

The ""preditory"" part comes out of the authors' ignorance of the publishing business.  It's really pretty simple but people believe what they want to believe.

Commercial publisher buys a manuscript from the author and assumes both the cost of publishing and the distribution (sales) of the finished product.  If the book sells, the commercial publisher pockets the profit. 

Vanity publisher gets paid by the author to publish the manuscript.  The author is responsible for selling the book and pockets the profit.  If authors refused to pay them to publish their papers, the vanity publishers would go out of business.",1596240017

Absolutely not. It's 2 ms per hop just for propagation delay across to the satellite. Latency is measured bidrectionally. That means just the satellite hops alone are 8ms (up and down forward, up and down reverse). Also, you will need to wait for a transmission slot on the upstream direction which could easily be a couple of milliseconds each direction. Most of the ""latency"" in cable and wireless networks are due to waiting for an upstream transmission slot. Also, just because you are at the earth station doesn't mean you have reached your destination on the internet.

Anyone expecting better latency than fiber or cable is ignorant or delusional.",1596240017

AM 
Rinse with cold water/
Illyoon probiotics skin barrier cica balm/
Neutrogena clear face liquid lotion sunscreen SPF 55
//
PM
If I‚Äôve worn makeup, 
/La Roche Posay Micellar Water
/Vanicream gentle facial cleanser
/Tret .1 gel
/Isle of paradise medium self-tanning drops
/CeraVe facial moisturizing lotion
/Illiyoon probiotics skin barrier cica balm
/La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume 
/Vaseline around eyebrow bone, nose crease &amp; corners of mouth

The moisturizers might seem excessive, but it seems like the more I moisturize the better I respond to tret. Hoping to switch to every night in the next few weeks. Sorry for formatting on mobile!",1596240017

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history.

&gt; that fear of being laughed at or messing up some random easy shit that everyone knows paralysises me into moving forward

Archery is hard. I've been doing it a year now, which isn't long at all, I still consider myself a newbie. And between you and me I still shoot like shit, very often.

No one at the range has ever, EVER made me feel bad for missing shots. I have encountered a grand total of zero snide comments. Everyone is too busy focusing on their own shooting, because they're doing the same thing we are - trying to get better. The only thing I've ever heard from other archers is encouragement.

&gt; Any tips or information you'd give

DO IT. Dive in. Buy yourself a bow, and some arrows, and go do it. You're gonna sink it most times, but sometimes you're gonna nail it. And then as you practice you're gonna nail it more and more.",1596240018

Yes no ilicic, but Imo mbappe, icardi, and di maria as a whole are more important to psg. Another example is Manchester United vs psg, when Neymar was absent, psg lost to United. I think psg rely on their forwards very heavily, (Neymar, icardi, di maria, mbappe) more than most teams rely on their forwards.

&gt;You've misunderstood my point. Of course I believe there are people that say that to vets or active soldiers.

Then why ask for three sources as proof it happens?

&gt;I asked for cited examples specifically because that's the best proxy I could think of to delineate between an activity engaged in by the extreme fringe vs a more mainstream thing. 

Ok Mr Arbiter, you sound very objective so far. 

&gt;If it's mainstream, then there should be citable examples. If we're limited to anecdote, that sounds much less common.

Literally the sentence after you requested anecdotal evidence to change your opinion. Lmao. 

&gt;And if it's that uncommon, then it puts the lie to the idea that liberals only like troops when they support liberal causes.

Quit begging the question. This all relies on me not providing you 3 examples of it happening, which you have been provided in this thread and consequently agreed that you don‚Äôt doubt that it happens. 

I said it happened to me, another user said it happened to them, and another user said they did not serve but they have seen it happen in this thread alone. Literally this thread confirmed it for him and you still refuse to accept that you don‚Äôt know what 100 million people say online. 

It‚Äôs pure confirmation bias at play because even when provided three examples in 40 years you then refused to believe it happened when I claimed it happened to me three times. You could say ‚ÄúI would like evidence that it happened three times to you because that would mean it really is an issue, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I do not believe the original claim that it does happen.‚Äù But you decided to dismiss someone‚Äôs claim that doesn‚Äôt challenge you in any way and then move the goal posts because it doesn‚Äôt fit your opinion.",1596240020

Watch how fast your ass gets ended. But, people understand that. They have full respect of those situations and know better than to test it.

ANYWAY

My recommendation for you is [Rebecca](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0380730405/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_L9kjFbNS5EG47). This is, in my opinion, the best romance ever written. Take that with a grain of salt because I don't read romance. But I do read A LOT and I promise this book is absolutely beautifully written. It's a gothic that follows a young woman as she's haunted by the ghost of her husband's first wife. It's thrilling and I loved it.

For me, I've been dying to read [Monster She Wrote](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1683691385/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_pbljFbTEDAT6E). It's about the women who pioneered horror and speculative fiction. I'm a huge horror nerd and it's been on my list forever.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","&gt; How do I drink responsibly? 

Be aware of your limits. If you've never had alcohol before, you'll get drunk a lot quicker than someone who's more experienced. So take it slow, start off with something light like beer or cider. Stay away from spirits unless you haven't drunk in a while.

&gt; How does getting drunk work? How much does the average person need to drink to get ""drunk""? 

It differs from person to person depending on their alcohol tolerance. For you, I'm guessing a single shot would be enough to get you drunk, or 1-2 beers.

&gt; What does being drunk feel like? 

To start off, you'll feel ""buzzed"". Basically, you might feel a slight tingling or numbness in your face. From there, you'll feel a little more relaxed and a lot less in control of your body. You may pick something up with way more force than needed, or move faster than you think you're moving. Usually at this point you'll want to slow down, drink some water, take a break. If you keep going though, you'll find it harder and harder to maintain control of your body, you'll probably want to vomit and in extreme cases you may pass out.

&gt; How do I avoid hangovers? 

Don't drink. If you get drunk, you'll have a hangover. Maybe not a bad one, but you will have one. All the techniques to prevent hangovers just stop you from getting drunk as fast. But so long as you don't drink too heavily, you'll be fine. If not, eat something nice and greasy with a lot of fat, that'll help a lot.

&gt; What are the best alcoholic drinks/how are they different from each other? 

Since you're new to this, there are three main types of things you'll want to be drinking.

1. Beer. Very low alcohol percentage compared to other drinks, you can have a few of these without too much issue. For now, you'll want to stick with ""light beers"" since they're less bitter are more drinkable than other beers, but if you like the taste there's a lot of varieties to try. Personally, I like pale ales, which are smoother and less strong in flavour, but try whatever you like the sound of.
2. Spirits. Whiskey, Vodka, Gin, Rum, whatever you're drinking you'll want it in shot form. They are very high in alcohol content, so they will taste disgusting to you. However, they will get you drunk very fast, so just tip them into your mouth and swallow as fast as you can, no matter how unpleasant it may be. In terms of taste, whiskey will taste more woody, vodka will taste like asshole, gin will be a little more floral, and rum will be sweeter.
3. Cocktails. A middle ground between the two that might help you better appreciate the taste of some spirits. For now, stick with just a spirit and a ""mixer"". So whiskey and coke, gin and lemonade, vodka and fruit juice. You'll want a lot more mixer than spirit, but enough spirit for you to know the drink is alcoholic. You can just experiment with that if you're the one making the drink.",1596240025

"GhostAdventures","t5_2s9x1","First, YOU GO ZAK! Yes Zak touched the doll we all know that, It‚Äôs sad that people have to talk shit about others, unfortunately that is life. But Tony‚Äôs vibe was negative from start to finish of the episode and what he said about Zak after the fact was just YUCK, especially when Zak was clearly being effected by something and Tony didn‚Äôt care whatsoever and Zak told tony right away even before Annabelle was out of suitcase that he was being effected! Zak made an excellent point about the kid on the motorcycle who died after see Annabelle...he never touched or provoked the doll ever, but he still died and whats weird is that doll and its case get cleansed constantly, but again the kid still died. Yet Zak was inches away from it and touched it, but nothing extremely dangerous or critical happened to Zak. 

Ed and Lorraine would‚Äôve never let Annabelle leave Connecticut ever, and Zak would‚Äôve complied especially since he wanted to investigate Annabelle so badly. 

Yes, Tony is Ed and Lorraine‚Äôs son-in-law so no actual blood ties what so ever, he was a police officer and a complete and utter skeptic before he met Judy the warrens daughter, they TAUGHT HIM! 

Good point projekt25 and Zak did question if that was the real doll or not I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it wasn‚Äôt since well Tony just wanted his 5 minutes and the money. 

Audio from what tony said during the convention will most likely be released, but what Tony said about Zak was inappropriate period. Tony was  making jokes about him and then Tony apparently brought up how much Zak makes in FRONT OF COMPLETE STRANGERS at the convention! You NEVER EVER talk about anyone‚Äôs finances EVER. 

Zak has worked his ass off to get where he is in paranormal wither the community likes it or not. Everyone needs to take a seat and leave their egos at the door üö™


It‚Äôs hilarious that Tony DEMANDED first class plane tickets for him and a DEMONIC DOLL, and exactly if the doll is soo evil why do that,
I‚Äôm soo thankful I wasn‚Äôt on that flight!  or why bring Annabelle to Zak, especially if He knew what GA is all about, but oh yeah that‚Äôs right again it was all about a quick money grab.

*‚òïÔ∏è.

Apparently, Tony made a similar statement on ED AND LORRAINE‚ÄôS OFFICIAL YOUTUBE PAGE today, what‚Äôs ridiculous is that Tony said yesterday he was ‚Äúdone‚Äù with the drama on Facebook well he clearly wasn‚Äôt. He was ranting about a lot of things, especially about how the filming process was ‚Äútaking too long‚Äù, and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúuh, HELLO ITS A TV SHOW‚Äù of course it‚Äôs a long process and because the guys (mainly aiming his all his jealousy towards Zak) are  filmmakers and he assumed that they‚Äôre actors to uh no. (which GAC are filmmakers on top of being investigators) Meanwhile, Ed and Lorraine were SELF-PROCLAIMED/ self-taught investigators/demonologist and self-proclaimed light trance medium &amp; clairvoyant. Complete difference. 

Tony also complained about his introduction on show being poor, since they didn‚Äôt talk about his years of experience...it isn‚Äôt about him in the first place it was about the the doll. 

Tony,  just because he worked under the Warren‚Äôs it makes him believe he‚Äôs the expert of all experts when it comes to the paranormal, when that is not how it works...like I said in my last post not everyone in para community or just fans in general are going to like what GAC do and that‚Äôs fine...that‚Äôs life, but Zak and the crew HAVE NEVER EVER CLAIMED to be top experts in the field. Does Zak know his shit? Absolutely! 

Then Tony brought up how much Zak makes AGAIN! ITS NO ONES BUSINESS to know that information, especially since Zak works INCREDIBLY HARD FOR HIS MONEY, Tony needs to take a seat, he talks about Zak being money hungry while Tony is living off his in-laws money, especially from the movie deals.

He also explained why he took off his rosary...but at the end of day he didn‚Äôt help Zak at all during the episode and couldn‚Äôt take a minute to say, ‚Äúhey, let me help you out since I know Annabelle‚Äôs power could be dangerous so here I‚Äôm giving you my blessed rosary.‚Äù Simple.

By nah Tony made it clear where his priorities were that night...the money. Again clearly karma was and is already happening since after Lorraine‚Äôs death they had to close the museum permanently and they have to find a new location and honestly if Tony keeps running his mouth Zak could and sue him for slander.*


* Again I‚Äôm not mad about Tony being upset over Zak touching the doll...I‚Äôm mad because he carried on and brought up Zak‚Äôs PERSONAL finances and Tony basically calling himself the expert of all experts when it comes to the paranormal just because he worked alongside E&amp;L...*",1596240026

College use to be a place for intellectuals to explore and share knowledge, but it's quickly turned into an administrative cash cow and indoctrination. 
The later, I largely suspect, is due to not only professors but students and social media as well.

The only thing colleges can provide that the internet and books can not provide, outside of hands on training for healthcare work and such, is accreditation. I fully believe in 50 years businesses won't be asking for degrees and will simply ask for a test/portfolio/mentor references, as anyone can pay for a piece of paper but it doesn't mean you understand the ideas nor have a sturdy foundation of the material.

However, your son behaved very wrong, you aren't doing much better by suggesting he shouldn't have to pay back the full amount that he stole (which is exactly what he did).

"halo","t5_2qixk","It‚Äôs usually an optional $10 purchase that grants you additional cosmetics that you earn by grinding through the tiers. So if a battlepass has 100 unlockable cosmetic items then there will be 100 tiers, and as you gain experience through playing the game you unlock more and more items as you progress through the tiers, with usually the flashiest and coolest looking cosmetics being in the higher tiers, which encourages players to keep grinding to unlock it. After a few months or so, that battlepass was close and a new battlepass with 100 new cosmetics will appear, so you start from the beginning and work your way up again because everything in this battlepass is completely new. It‚Äôs rewarding to the players because they‚Äôre constantly unlocking more and more stuff, but it‚Äôs main purpose is to encourage players to grind and continually come back to the game so that they get everything.

There have been a LOT of discussion on this matter, I'm surprised you don't know about it.

"criticalrole","t5_385bw","Vax was great but **Liam** is incredible as a full caster. His new spells, his re-flavored spells, the way he always mentions the somatic and material components = 10/10 D&amp;D. So for Liam, a college of whispers bard would be incredible and still allow him to do sneaky rogue stuff like wear people's shadows. **Travis** needs to go full paladin, which will let him be strong like Grog again. It'll give him the martial beef he needs plus more spell slots than Fjord. **Sam** could be a sorcerer, so we can see his great creative spellcasting, like all of Scanlan's big counter spell moments but now with metamagic. He should play a big race like a dragonborn or goliath. Also the sorcerer gets magic from his bloodline so he could be cocky about his superiority, for those Taryon Darington vibes. **Laura** should get to be a warlock like she wanted to. Something edgy for that Vex sexiness. **Ashley** needs something with a deity guiding her. Pike and Sarenrae, Yasha and Kord,  Ashley and Matt. Ya know what I mean. She needs Matt to kind of proxy control her plot development. She's already been a cleric and a zealot barb, so I think paladin would be playing it too safe. But another d8 full caster like a druid could be good. **Marisha** is a tough pick. After Beau she would be bored by a fighter, but maybe a ranger for some martial/caster balance. Get a little back into the druid vibe but still not full Keyleth. **Taliesin** should play an Echo Knight. He loves Matt's homebrews, it lets him get real weird, and brings back some Percy aggression.",1596240028

"FortniteBRuniversity","t5_3pr0y","I switched to kbm in ch2s2 and have spent a lot of time researching and trying different things, so I think I can be helpful here.

You need a mouse with buttons. Put wall and stairs on them. It makes a HUGE difference. Sub to /r/buildapcsales (or your own regional variant) and you will get a deal on a decent mouse within days. I got a Steelseries for 40 quid (half price) pretty much immediately on the UK version but you could go a lot cheaper and it'd be fine. Just get at least 2 mouse buttons for wall and stairs, it transformed my building.

Second thing that you pretty much need to do is scroll wheel reset. Put mouse wheel up or down as a secondary edit bind, and as the bind for edit reset. Then you can simply scroll in the direction hard and it will reset and confirm. It's pretty difficult to boxfight effectively without the ability to quickly reset.

Then put the other mouse wheel direction as something important, too. It's such an easy thing to hit that it has to be used on something important and quick. Lots of people use it for interact button. I use it for axe (maybe suboptimal as it's usually not as urgent but you do need to take it out fast in boxfights). You could maybe put shotgun on it, but I think having sniper on it is a waste as you can afford to take that half second longer to get sniper out. 

Then I have:

E- interact

Q- edit

Caps- shotgun

Shift- cone

F- floor

C- slot 2 (AR) 

X- slot 3 (sniper)

Tab- slot 4 (heals or grenades) 

3rd mouse button- slot 5 (heals) 

4th- launchpad

Tab- slot 4 (heals or grenades) 

Ctrl- crouch

Middle mouse- reload


A lot of people prefer C or V for floor so that they can jump and hit floor in one motion with their thumb, and most people have edit to the right of movement (eg E or F), but otherwise I think the above is generally considered close to optimal. Those buttons are some of the easiest to hit, anyway, and so important stuff should generally be on them, in whatever order suits you. The only other thing specifically to note is that shift for cone and f/c/v for floor is good because they are on either side of the movement keys, so they have a finger each on your left hand which allows for more fluidity. 

I hope that's helpful! It took me a while to settle on good binds and I spent a lot of time looking around, asking different people, etc., so hopefully I can save you some of that effort.",1596240028

I‚Äôve gotten a metric butt-ton of overtime that isn‚Äôt usually available and it might give me enough money to be able to finally afford to go to nursing school‚Äîor at least to start earlier.

It‚Äôs also allowed me to really see which departments and which hospitals actually give a shit about their employees and were more prepared for something like this, which is really important for the future when I start looking for a longterm employment as a nurse. For example, one hospital system here has been able to provide n100 half-face respirators for hundreds of staff-members with high-risk roles, whereas another hospital system has actually posted notices stating that even n95 masks are not allowed to be worn except by certain staff members and that the n100 respirators are banned entirely, much less being provided to the employers. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, but this issue in particular really stood out to me.

I‚Äôve also noticed that people are becoming more connected across our systems. EMS is communicating more with hospital staff, and vice versa, as we‚Äôre working together more in a different way than before. We‚Äôre sharing resources across departments when it comes to PPE, deconning after COVID patients, and even just talking more in our downtime. There used to be more of a divide based on a hierarchy of jobs (EMS vs private ambulance services, ambulance service vs ambulance service, EMS vs hospital, fire vs EMS) and that‚Äôs really nice.

Also, this is really an odd ‚Äúplus,‚Äù but I feel like I‚Äôve gotten to learn a lot of things outside of the typical EMT scope that I wouldn‚Äôt normally get to learn. I‚Äôve gotten to work shifts on the ICU and talk with doctors and work with the cath lab teams in a way different capacity. I feel like I‚Äôm getting to learn a lot more than I typically would.",1596240030

... on.... the... head!

Can't these hypocrites fuck off to the caves and practice their black majik, voodoo, who do, ancient stone rubbing barbaric medicine for once? 

So to, and forgive my limited understanding and loud mouth outsider opinion on the matter, but those braindead 'Defund and Disarm' the Po-leace' window lickers. Lead by example you dumb fuck, loud mouth imbeciles and show everyone this ethereal not of this world mysterious ancient technique of Po-leacing when you've got a totally broken individual at wits end, rich only in the number of untreated mental health issues they carry, that's armed with fkn military powered firearms and hell bent on taking some percieved wrongdoer or other innocent party down in their misery. Or  a serious career criminal facing nothing but a life sentence upon their capture.

What fairyland are these people living in?! FFS, you couldn't pay me a million dollars a year to be a cop in the US. Granted, I no doubt see a highly concentrated version of events on the ootube channel's but when a simple speeding infringement turns into a volley of bullets, fired at a rate of knots and with the velocity to send my skull back to next week, who can blame the cops for being on edge and strung out after being on what equates to near deployment for literally years on end and dealing with cunts that will just not listen.

No boot licker. I've had my interactions with the boy's in blue in my younger day's, nothing ever deadly serious during my mid-youth crises whilst full of cum, fueled on a diet of punk rock, illicit joys, youthful wreckleas enthusiasm and the adult toys and mateship that come with it, along with thinking I was Dale Earnhardt behind the wheel when first getting my licence and being lucky enough to own a car that's so not the smart idea for a young bloke, but fucking hell awesome for pretty much leaving all but very few behind in a cloud of smoke at the lights and having other young dumb chicks follow you... a 6 month old '97 Holden VS II SS sent to WGR racing for the kit, momo wheels bla bla incase any aussies of my vintage are around...But it's a simple equation really.  You're in the wrong or perceived to be, this cunt deals with liars literally ALL DAY EVERYDAY, you sure as fuck haven't just come from scraping the brains off the road of a totally innocent and loved by many individual, that's been beheaded by a drunk driver or worse yet, dealt with an infanticide case that morning. But they just may well have. Yes, don't send a boy to do a mans job but we're fucking humans and life doesn't work that way. 
.
I've been a stupid cunt, reacted in the stupid cunt way and then wasted a few good night's doing the old 4-6 hour stint for going over board on the fun and festivities, looking at the walls, bored as fuck and instantly sobered up. Ive also gone the other total opposite route and surprise surprise....so has the end result. Only a few months ago I was facing a $1600 fine on top of the $400 for speeding for breaking the covid stage whatever lockdown rules whilst going to get my dick wet. Played it a bit dumb by explaining the rules as I knew them and that gatherings of no more than 3 in a room or whatever. I assured him with a touch of disappointment that my end destination was definitely not a 3sum or group sex scenario and I apologized for my naivety on the matter. Further explained ive been burnt out after following covid issues since Jan 1 basically, and all know now is what I hear from the blokes working on my block of land or friends. 

He had laugh and basically said stick to 110km in a 100km zone and you'll be fine 99% of the time. His gotta write me up for doing 124kmph, take it as a warning on the $1600 fine but just be aware that cops are out and about and it's only workers and essentials that are excused. Half your luck and enjoy your evening. Thanks mate, again it wasn't intentional but I appreciate the heads up. Take care and see ya.

lPiss ant fucking anecdote from a white cunt that lives in a different world and all, but we all know what it's like in dealing with others be it as customer or business issue or whatever. You give as good as you get and there's ways to go about things. 

Good luck to the Voxday pink tutu wearing crusaders in defunded and unarmed utopia! No dumb cunt is going to sign up to that police force anyway so it's basically 'decommission' when you get past the buzz words.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Considering the low dosage even with the high frequency he's taking them, and the fact he's got ADHD, I don't want to insist on the ""addict"" bandwagon that's running through the thread. Instead, I'm wondering if it's either having a bad reaction with him, or he's lost the effectiveness of it, and has been taking out his disappointment/anxiety on you and the child?

As someone with ADHD, I've had really bad reactions to Ritalin (normally a daily panic attack when it would run out of my system). Adding to that, a lot of medications are hit and miss, with either having some gnarly-ass side effects or not having any intended effect at all. If he's constantly having massive mood swings, and finds he needs to take two or three pills a day, he might be trying to tape off the adverse reactions or feels like the medication is not working as it used to. 

Mind you, this is _definitely_ not the way to be going about this. If he's still losing concentration or having emotional dysregulation after a certain point with the Adderall, he should be talking to his doctor and either tweaking the dosage and times taken in tandem with Doctor's orders, or trying a new variety of ADHD medication entirely. And if he's got anxiety and having massive emotional and mental fluctuations, he needs to talk to his doctor now and try something with a more gradual effect like Strattera or Vyvanse. 

Ultimately though, these are things that he would need to do. And unfortunately, he's made it clear either he doesn't care enough to fix this massive problem or he's in the midst of a breakdown and _can't_ see he's having a massive problem. Between the lack of eating/massive weight loss, loss of interest in his prior activities and how he's treating you and your family, he's not in the right state of mind. Do you have a place where you and your son can stay for a while? You may want to leave, and if not pull the ""actually, if you're that miserable, let's get a divorce"" card, at least keep the two of you safe while he bottoms out and hopefully realizes he's being abusive and manic, and treating his medication incredibly callously.",1596240031

"anime","t5_2qh22","**Rewatcher** (S1&amp;S2)

A bit later than usual today but I still want to share my few points. As it was already quite clear from two episodes ago and also hinted in the last episode the whole operation seems to fall apart. Although all civilians were evacuated, the troops are left behind, everyone is exhausted and the resupply-team seems to have abandoned them. With this it comes as no surprise that the headquarters get overrun by titans, they (somehow) know where to find people and with all civilians gone the troops are the only people left.

Of course the troops outside decide to storm the building and try to kill the titans, but although they manage to kill at least a few they still face heavy losses on their end. Even Mikasa gets cornered because of her reckless behavior which also results from getting to know that Eren was killed in combat. And just as she gives up upon her own life a titan appears and kills the one trying to kill Mikasa, something which is a first time in history.

QOTD:

1. The titans design is something I think is really interesting. They have a humanoid appearance, with everyone looking different, giving them some kind of identity. But just from a short glimpse it is clear that they lack real intelligence and only react on instincts - however they work. With them having a humanoid appearance come also two other interesting points: They look somewhat like a human but are simply much larger, making them frighting from just that. In addition to that they also embody the urge to kill people, something that can't be found that much in nature. Overall quite interesting and probably way more effective than just a monster of whatever kind you regularly see in other movies or shows.

2. To be honest someone I haven't paid that much attention to in this rewatch. So no thoughts on him so far.",1596240031

"byu","t5_2qncw","So I personally thought the programming exam wasn't too bad. Assuming it's still the same as or similar to when I took it, you'll spend the first three weeks doing three labs to get familiar with Java. Then in the exam, they assign you one of those labs to redo (The first one is too easy so they give you one of the other two).

To prepare, I just coded each of those labs again and made sure I knew what types of issues I had trouble with and where I was going to end up spending my time troubleshooting. I met one guy who just memorized each of his codes, but really as long as you remember your overall structure and are familiar with the issues you run into when implementing, you'll be fine.

The main project for the rest of the semester is what killed me. I felt like they didn't cover enough material to really do anything until two weeks before it was due, and each portion of the project (the server and the client) takes about 40 hours or more.

To be fair, I much prefer classes like 236 and 312 because they were very mathematical and I studied physics, but I know other people who hated 236 and 312 but loved 240 because there was essentially no math. So what type of coder you are will determine how well you do overall, but the exam you can prepare for and you'll do fine. For the rest of the class, find a friend or two to work on it with so when one of you is ready to die, the others can help you figure out what you're struggling with.",1596240031

- Kyoto Protocols

- ABM Treaty

- No regime change in Libya 

- INF Treaty

- Iran Deal

- Paris Agreement

Possibly the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the future (kinda doubt it though).

in North Carolina do you have to be separated for a year but it's all based on the honor system. You don't even really need papers you can go in there with a friend and as long as the other person is okay with it and just say you been divorced for that year and some change get your court date and you get divorced. 

I think honestly one of the things that you scared of is whether I backdate papers or we get separated now is she had a boyfriend they had sex that's adultery. You can casually date while separated but I have proof that they had sex she knows this. Backdated papers current papers of separation doesn't matter if you're still married. She's afraid that I'm going to use the evidence I have somehow and get her I don't know she was going to get alimony anyway and damn sure not now. at first it was probably for health insurance but I've already told my company that were separated so she's off the insurance so I really don't know what's keeping her from getting separated or backdated divorce or whatever other than the evidence of adultery that I have.",1596240032

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA for wanting a paternity test. Apparently the son and gf conceived a child on the FIRST 2 MONTHS of their relationship. She was ""4 MONTHS pregnant with his baby"" YIKES! That is way too fast for a relationship; not even half a year and they are having a baby. Just because OP'S son had known her since high school doesn't mean that the baby isn't a result of infidelity on her part. Not only this child might not even be the son's, but him and the gf suck at social distancing. 

It is absolutely necessary to get a paternity test, but here is where OP is an Asshole: ""she's not someone I hoped to be the mother of my grandchild"". Other than that, OP is NTA. I just see OP as a parent trying to make sure that their son doesn't get babytrapped with a baby that's not their's. There are a lot of stories on the internet when a man is forced to pay child support for a baby that's not their's. I understand the son's reaction, but I think he's an idiot.

If you have the time, play through all the campaigns first.  That's The Red War, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken (if you bought it), and Shadowkeep (if you bought it) in that order.  Over the course of those campaigns you'll get your Power Level up pretty high.

If you want to take a break, you can play PvP in Crucible, but you'd want to have a variety of weapons available to you before you start so you can customize your loadout.  There are no Power Level advantages here so it's technically an even playing field.  Although high-stat armor will make a difference.

Check out the YouTube channels of Aztecross Gaming and Fallout Plays for some tips.  I think their content is pretty good and to the point.  Most Destiny videos made before the release of Forsaken in 2018 are probably irrelevant and outdated now since the game has changed a lot since then, so watch out for those.",1596240032

All Ninjutsu are chakra based, it's even explained with Ishshiki in the latest chapters of Boruto that only natural attacks(like real fire or real lightning) work on him because he can absorb all other Ninjutsu attacks because they are chakra based.

They are real creatures but their attacks are Nature energy chakra based Senjutsu attacks. Which at the end of the day is regular chakra, just gathered from the surrounding nature. (as shown by how Pain was able to absorb sage mode and Madara's rinnegan absorbed Naruto's sage mode attacks) Gamakichis attack worked on the Ten tails because it was Sage mode chakra. His spit is the same as Katsuyus acid spit because both are sage creatures.

A first-generation university student in Calgary, well known for its top quality cardiovascular health programs, should clearly go to the university of Phoenix. 

A student in a poor suburb of Toronto, who babysits his 3 siblings should refuse his entry to a local college with low tuition and instead move to U of Pennsylvania. 

The graduate biologist who was accepted into the University of Saskatchewan, which iis ranked first in Canada and 20th in the world for water resources research, should instead go to Ohio to pursue his endeavours of environmental sustainability.

Free of what? The memes or the groupthink phenomenon? The former entirely depends on if and how the subreddit is moderated. I can tell you that compwow is generally free of meme-posts without this just being an implication but rather a fact.             
The latter is something every subreddit has, every social media website even. However, this is not exclusive to a specific subreddit and thus bringing it up in this context isn't all that helpful, because it's implied by it being a part of reddit that this is indeed something that happens there, just as it does here.

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","If I were you, I would write my essay from the point of view of the ‚Äúimagined communities‚Äù thesis. This thesis, which is propagated by Israeli academics around the world and helps them get very popular, says that nationalism and sectarianism are an ‚Äúimagined‚Äù construct that‚Äôs used in forming sustainable political structures like states or terrorist organizations. Israelis have consciously developed a new national identity to replace the identity of exile Jews. In other words, israeli identity is to some extent an artificial construct, whereby Jewishness is transformed into israeliness to unite the different diasporas that came into Israel in the aftermath of the Holocaust and the expulsion of Jews from Muslim countries. Palestinians‚Äô national identity is based on total propaganda. It‚Äôs completely artificial and it‚Äôs based on lies. I can get into this more, but suffice is to say that Palestinians (as well as other Arab states) are a completely imagined community whose identity been developed by such political forces as the British foreign service, Lawrence of Arabia, islamist, jihadi ideology and inter fighting among Arab nationalists (Nasser, Saddam, Husseini, Assad) who couldn‚Äôt get over their lust for power, barbaric mentality and greed.",1596240036

"WoT","t5_2rdg1","I do like Moiraine, but I think just seeing her from the pov of Perrin and the other kids is limiting. It's hard to really appreciate her when she's just kind of there to be dismissive of them so far. I'd like to actually get in her head more to see what she thinks and believes. We had a little of that at the beginning of the second book but she's very distant since then. Narratively I mean. Obviously she was very distant towards the kids at the beginning of that book too, manipulating them kind of openly with the clothes and the banner. But we got a bit with her POV so we got to appreciate her more. 

Ditto with Lan. Lan, conspicuously, is the only character of the original party that left Emond's Field who hasn't had any POV at all. Even Thom and Moiraine have. And Mat who, until recently in this book, had none. Lan actually annoyed me far more than she did just because of him being a bootlicker to everything she says. That might be the point of warders, though, to have no mind of their own and obey everything the Aes Sedai says without question.

This isn't the case with Verin. For some reason I love her a lot. She doesn't really dismiss things the kids say at all. She's actually very interested because she always evaluates everything she hears. You never know what might be important. I couldn't see her, for example, hearing what Perrin said about seeing the meeting with Ba'alzamon and Lanfear and then just dismissing it as unimportant like Moiraine did. Unless, as I suspect, she wouldn't want Perrin to know anything in case he gets possessed or interrogated or something inside the dream world. That was my speculation on why Moiraine acted the way she did.",1596240036

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I think there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here, but I‚Äôll just start off by asking:

Where is your proof of the creator? 

Not only that, where is your proof that said creator is *actively* watching and listening to your thoughts and prayers?

And not only that, but where is your proof that this specific creator is the one described in the Bible, and all of the Biblical myths are true?

Looking through history, our Gods have become less specific the more we know about the natural world.

We didn‚Äôt know what the Sun was, so we called it a God. We assumed there was a God of Thunder, a God of the Sea. Humans have always attributed unknown phenomena to Gods. 

Now that we have those specifics hashed out, we say, ‚ÄúWell, it must have been a God who put us here in the first place!‚Äù If we‚Äôve thus disproven those other Gods and no longer believe in them, why should the Abrahamic God be any different?

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hypocritical to acknowledge that pattern, and assume the popular Gods of today should be no different than the discredited ones of the past.

I also disagree that any of this is making a knowledge claim, or that the burden of proof falls upon atheists either.

I don‚Äôt say Mary wasn‚Äôt a virgin. Christians claim she was, and I ask, ‚Äúhow likely is that? How do you know? Where‚Äôs your proof of this?‚Äù

If Harry Potter were written 2,000 years ago, I would not be surprised if we prayed to the Wizards who breathed magic into our lives as humble muggles. Considering how not only are many stories in the New Testament known to be unoriginal, and how long the timespan was between these supposed events and the moment they were written, and the obvious contradictions...why should I believe it holds any truth?

You tell me. Christians are the ones claiming these old stories are the Word of God.",1596240036

Generally what happens is the the extrusion is not a perfect tube as displayed by the slicer and the filament will spread to occupy the space as near as damn it. So I would not worry about a zoomed in view of the slicer in this instance.

"climateskeptics","t5_2qk5q","Interesting paper, thanks for sharing. I had never come across it before.

&gt; So no, no physical demonstration of any of the phenomena you claim exists.

Not sure why you would say that. I just listed two physical phenomena that cause thermal trapping, low thermal conductance and IR absorption of CO2. If you can clarify your complaint I can try to help. If you don't trust modern scientists, look far back, before the modern concept of climate change. The data tells the same story. Here are Berkeley measurements from 1958: https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4303238

&gt; Is that a joke? Lol... you don't honestly think an IR lamp and some sealed containers is an actual experiment do you? Clearly you've never done this anyway, so you don't know what you are talking about.

&gt; In point of fact, experiments using glazings and CO2 have been done, I guess you weren't aware.

You're right, I wasn't aware. This is awesome. Thank you! I do find it interesting that you derided my experimental proposal without stating which procedural or methodological error you contest and then you stated the exact same experiment (which isn't even an experiment) as support of your claims! Haha, that is amazing. Do you see the dissonance? You said my experiment isn't a real experiment and then quoted a paper that RAN SIMULATIONS of the setup I described as somehow being counter-evidence. In fact, you presented evidence in support of climate change! While no where in the paper does it state

&gt; temperatures didn't change at all, and it was deemed a failure

and frankly, I don't know where that came from. The study clearly talks about changing temperatures. However, what the study did say is ""Low-emittance coatings are much more effective at reducing infrared radiation heat transfer than IR absorbing gasses. Gasses for gas-filling should be chosen for their low conductivity and high kinematic viscosity in order to effectively reduce conductive/convective heat transfer. The effective use of infrared absorbing gasses is thus limited to horizontal windows heated from above, or to thin gaps where low-emittance coatings cannot be used."" (pg. 11)

This is literally what I am saying, haha, so thank you! Of course, a mirror reflects more electromagnetic radiation than IR absorbing gases and doesn't suffer from the heat trapping, so yes, better for insulation, no doubt. However, the paper clearly says that trapping IR radiation is optimal (without access to reflective coatings) if using IR absorbing gases with low thermal conductance. 

So, to be clear, the paper you are referencing is open-access. You can view it here: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6sn232sk

Now, note that nowhere in the paper do any of the following quotes appear:

&gt; the effect of the infrared radiation properties of CO2 is unnoticeable.

&gt; incredible heating abilities

&gt; the existing heat transfer model of multipane windows filled with gasses to include the effects of infrared absorption within the gasses

In fact, their simulations showed that CO2 does absorb IR radiation, I mean they programmed that in, so that's not unexpected.

I didn't read the secondary source you linked, I used it to find the primary source and read that. In the future I suggest you do the same. Science journalism is largely toxic, rife with sensationalism and misinterpreted facts. Here, it seems like it is worse. I believe that website deliberately lied to you if your claims come from that secondary source. Don't believe me. Read the paper yourself.

EDIT: 

&gt;  No need to try and dazzle with BS. 

This is just rude. All I stated were physical facts. I am not dazzling or lying. In fact, at almost every step I've encouraged you to seek the truth yourself.",1596240037

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/tits/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of yourself, from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/tits written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or nude, but please show as much of you as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your unclothed/clothed body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

"MDMA","t5_2qwvg","It's just the comeup anxiety. I like to call comeup anxiety ""synthetic anxiety"". I think a lot of it comes from MDMA hitting the various receptors in your stomach (second largest concentration of serotonin receptors after the brain), which kind of triggers the ""butterflies/pit"" in the stomach feeling that people associate with being anxious. Then your brain tries to find something that could be causing the physical anxiety symptoms it is feeling and makes you generally terrified. As soon as the MDMA hits your brain it will overwhelm the anxiety.",1596240038

She also mentions that since you will be going to tartarus alot that you will get used to it which in the gameplay mechanics is that the more you visit tartarus the longer you can go each time. Im guessing there is a hidden timer that goes off after every fight for each character before they get tired and it resets every time you leave and come back but also the timer increases with each boss you defeat(unsure about that though). It ties directly into the gameplay since by the end of the game tired and sick just don't happen.

This had precisely zero effect on his polling, including polling from fox, it has remained rock steady and has steadily climbed. The  media will try to make something of it but it would be rather hypocritical considering donald and his wifes history with copying speeches. The media losses interest in a few days, the public forgets it happened in even less time as the next donald scandal that is an order of magnitude worse takes its place.

We live in a political era with a much higher scandal baseload. What would have sunk a persons campaign decades ago- a weird laugh, having a photo of them taken sitting in a tank, etc would not sink a campaign in todays field.

Messages from the brain will not reach anything below the top of the injury site. At the ***very least***, he is paralyzed for life unless he is given an *insane* amount of cybernetics. Also, the damage would mean the muscles in his ribs would not receive the signals to push the ribs away for the lungs, so breathing and coughing could be difficult, meaning not only will getting oxygen be harder, but so will expelling pathogens from his lungs, making him more susceptible to infection. This info was gathered by a simple Google search, so you don‚Äôt need to dig too deeply to see how devastating a wound like that really is. Even without looking it up, it still looks like a pretty grievous wound, one that would be debilitating at best, lethal at worst. 

Also, I find it hard to believe that Phasma would not be able to escape her situation in TFA. Can‚Äôt she call for reinforcements while pretending to lower the shields or even lowering the shields legitimately? Then, after pretending to comply, she turns around, disarming and restraining Finn and holding Han at blaster-point or shooting him on the spot. Surely a warrior of her caliber and with her equipment can manage to fend off or at least delay the three intruders until reinforcements arrive and overwhelm them.

"witcher","t5_2sebi","&gt;It sounds pretty obvious to me that it was getting there from the way it was presented in the books. 

How was it presented if you take Triss' dramatic reaction out of the equation? Triss notices Ciri's bruises. Ciri tells her about the sort of exercises she's performing and asks if Triss can turn her into a boy because that'd make things easier. When Triss says no, she can't, Ciri confides in her that she's having a period and would rather not perform the grueling physical exercises. Where's the part that it was 'getting to that point' in any of this?

&gt;It was specifically mentioned that Ciri has her period ""exceptionally badly""

And that's, once again, Triss huffing and puffing at the witchers, being a drama queen. She also adds that they 'want her to tear her lungs out on the Killer and some bloody windmills'. What on earth do the lungs have to do with a period and any kind of period-related pain? Unnecessary drama, that's what.

&gt;I just find it funny that you call it drama

I call the way Sapkowski wrote the situation drama. An adolescent girl is having a period. A grown woman finds out and acts as if the sky is falling. A bunch of men react to her overreaction with even more overreaction. And it's supposed to be somehow believable, if not admirable.

If Ciri really did have it as bad as you describe - vomiting, passing out, severe pain, unable to move - and the witchers ignored it then sure, I could understand. But that's nowhere near what's happening in the story.",1596240040

 But you might wanna know, why there's always a new meta keeps coming back everytime? Was it because brawl stars don't test their brawlers? Because they like to ruin the meta purposely?

Well it's because for the $$$, obviously. This is a marketing strategy that is happening on every FPS game, LoL, Mobile Legend, etc.. Unfortunately, this mean surge and gale is probably not going to be nerfed any sooner no matter how many complaints for the balance changes were made. We'll have to go thru the meta until bs make a new balance changes and finally you can play in peace without gale and surge interrupting your gameplay....

"civ","t5_2rk3b","I had poundmaker as my immediate neighbor and friended that boy up right away. His passive on increased alliances is actually very underrated and I created a research alliance with him.

I stole 1 early settler from Gandhi but peaced out after 10 turns and didnt go to war for the rest of the game. By the medieval era i had friended or allianced everyone. 

My production came mostly from burning rainforests and woods and couple of times. But more than 2 times slows down your cities growth too much imo. I grabbed sacred path too so that i had greater incentive to settle around the rainforest. Work ethic helped in the early eras alongside 100% production from holy sites card. 

Monumentality helped with settlers and builders so production could be focused on districts. I rushed 3 strategic industrial zones as second districts after holy sites in important cities including my ruhr valley city. 
I find that you dont actually have to rush campuses in the science games as long as you can grab newton no other scientits matters early on. Not even hypatia. 

Key wonders were oracle, oxford, and chichen itza. Chichen very important so you dont have to waste production on lots of theater squares. And Ruhr of course. Around turn 150 make sure to bring all your trade routes to your ruhr city.

I had wilfred in the game too and he was constantly buying diplo favor for 12 or 13 gold each all game so whenever i needed some cash i went to willy. 

Went audience chamber and went tall this game. Only 10 cities which is crazy, i usually go 12-16. I think being tall synchs very well with voidsingers and holy sites.

Also I made 4 spaceports so i could crank those laser projects at the end. 

Also! Always get the great merchants that give governor promotions. Govenors are very strong right now. Reyna 2 and 3 is very powerful in a tall city with lots of woods/rainforest you can burn",1596240041

It could also not be stress, but remember that your age can be pretty confusing and difficult, and it's alright to feel negative things and talk about it with someone you feel comfortable with.

I remember when someone smart (I forget who) predicted that due to fiber optic cables, long-distance domestic calls would be free in a few years. I thought they were crazy.

But, most importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For, my fans, who are defending my actions, please don't, they do not deserve to be defended. The goal of my content is always to entertain, to push the boundaries, to be all inclusive and in the world I live in I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said, I made a huge mistake, I don't expect to be forgiven, I'm just here to apologize. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm disappointed in myself, and I promise to be better. I will be better, thank you.",1596240044

I know the breed very well. They tend to have a high prey drive but they are totally fine with cats and other animals as long as they are socialized with them since very young. The breeder has cats as well!

I totally get you. It's really a risk to bring a puppy to a kitty household but I need to take this risk, otherwise I'm afraid I won't ever get a dog. I live in a 3 bedroom apartment. So... Many rooms, but they're small rooms. My cats have many places to hide - two cat trees and protected windows! Still, I'm afraid as any responsible pet owner should be so I totally appreciate your advise. My parents have many GS and a Pug. The oldest GS and the Pug come to my apartment frequently. One of my cats is totally OK with them. Rubs against them lmao. Runs away only if they chase him, but then again, I think I can teach a puppy to leave the cats alone. Even if it's the most stubborn puppy ever I will get a trainer or whatever is needed lol. The other cat, she's more suspicious. She hides on the first day when they come and hisses at them, but on the second day she walks around the house completely relaxed as long as they don't mess with her.",1596240045

"ToolBand","t5_2rfjf","I completely agree and I want to add a few things. 

First, some Maynard quotes that I believe are relevant to this topic. 

&gt;Asked if he could pinpoint the hurdle, he replied: ‚ÄúSuccess! When you get successful, you think you‚Äôre right about everything. You‚Äôre pretty sure as that individual, ‚ÄòI am right and you are wrong.‚Äô I‚Äôm successful and we‚Äôre successful because of me, not because of you!‚Äù More seriously, Keenan continued: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that bad with us. ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a dynamic of, ‚ÄòI want this and I‚Äôve always gotten my way and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre successful, because I don‚Äôt compromise.‚Äô‚Äù


&gt;Keenan explained to Loudwire, it can also be viewed as an advancement of self, ‚Äúwhen you are presented the opportunity to transform from whatever your hangups were before to let the light of knowledge and experience lighten your load ‚Ä¶ let go of old patterns and embrace a new life.‚Äù


&gt;Last year Maynard also likened himself to Jack Nicholson‚Äôs bad-tempered character in As Good As It Gets. ‚ÄúI open my mouth in the wrong way, but I want to be a better man. I just can‚Äôt help myself sometimes ‚Äì it‚Äôs like Tourette‚Äôs‚Äù


&gt;‚ÄúI feel like we're at an age now that some of the things that used to rub us wrong ‚Äî whether it's with the band or life in general ‚Äî we've kind of jumped ahead to remember, ""OK, when I reacted this way to this thing when I was 25, it was a waste of energy. So I guess I just won't bother reacting that way."" You skip some steps because you've seen the steps. Make sense?‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúThere's an army of people out there who absolutely appreciate what we're doing and I feel like it's part of the multiple dimensions and facets of their world. We're just one thing in their day, and they appreciate it deeply. When you get the people who are a little more fanatical, those are the ones who make you pause and go, ""Did I do something wrong?"" [Laughs] I don't understand that. But you're always gonna have people who misinterpret and go too far. But for the most part, I feel like we've nurtured a fan base with Tool, with A Perfect Circle, with Puscifer ... who appreciate the process and appreciate the art. And we're extremely grateful.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúIf you're just gonna write the same songs on every album, that's not gonna really help you move forward.‚Äù

&gt;‚ÄúI think a lot of it just that age where you want it to be right and we‚Äôve had some success in the past and the fear of this thing coming out and not being accepted‚Äîthe fear that it‚Äôs not as good as it can be‚Äîthat can be detrimentally crippling.
Probably in if I had to ‚Äòpsychology 101‚Äô [it], I would have to say ‚ÄòWell yeah, that‚Äôs why it would take 13 years to write something, because you‚Äôre paranoid that it‚Äôs not gonna be the best that it can be and then you second guess every single step that you make‚Äô; when it was probably good enough‚ÄîI shouldn‚Äôt say good enough‚Äîit was fantastic 8 years ago.
But then the crippling second guessing of yourself sets in and that psychology and that spiral you get in, it can be extremely daunting. And you can actually not even feel it happening.
All of a sudden you wake up and it‚Äôs 13 years later. The hard part is accepting the fact that maybe you‚Äôre not as important as you think you are and you should probably just get on with it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not hard to see why Maynard had those doubts he talks about in that last big quote. The music industry and entire world had changed *so* much in those 13 years. It‚Äôs rare for any band to consistently perform physically and financially at the highest level, and Maynard was prepared for the fact that between them being 48-58 years old, the time since the last album, them ‚Äòalienating‚Äô fans in certain ways, streaming music was barely a thing in 2006. 

All that being said, I think Culling Voices is probably the closest thing to the three songs from prior albums you mentioned, although it‚Äôs less directed specifically at Tool fans and more at social media in general.",1596240045

- vegetable oil
-1 onion, diced 
- similar amount of celery, diced
- garlic, like 3-6 cloves. 
- head of cauliflower (broken into small florets)
- 1 small winter squash like acorn or buttercup
- 2 cans of tomatoes
- 2 cans of beans (I like 1 kidney, 1 black)
- chili powder 
- cumin
- salt and pepper

Optional, but recommended: 
- hot pepper of your choosing: jalape√±o, habenero, chipotle, scotch bonnets, or a couple dashes of hot sauce
- frozen corn
-  cilantro for garnish
- avocado for garnish
(Also add whatever veggies are a little past prime in your fridge or pantry. Leftover zucchini is great, as are
Lentils

1 Saute onions and celery with veggie oil until onions are translucent
2 add garlic and spices and saut√© another minute
3. Literally dump everything else in (including peppers, but excluding corn) and simmer on medium until everything is soft and squash has melted (it thickens the sauce)
4. Taste and adjust seasoning
2. Add garnish and enjoy.",1596240045

ctrl + m - toggles moduation

From the main page it requires turning the virtual knobs up top to a specific level and if you go into the relevant pages (i.e. the tab marker booster, the tab marked mod, ect.) then wouldn't I have to be open in that tab for the hotkey to work and simulate the clicking of the power button above the settings for the specific effect?

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","There have been a number of _bad_ trans folks in activism in the last few years and it‚Äôs given us hella bad publicity.  Trans folks, as a group, act poorly online. This gives everyone a negative impression of us and we do nothing to combat it. 

Andi Dier is a trans woman who confronted Rose McGowan at an event where she was talking out against male violence in entertainment. Andi Dier shouted for trans acceptance at the same event. At the time it was easy to find that Andi Dier was also accused of sexual violence and maintained a tumblr which housed a number of sexual fetishes the world does not accept. (Scat, etc)

Cherno Biko is an HIV+ black trans woman who spoke at the women‚Äôs marches against Donald Trump. She‚Äôs also a self admitted rapist who posted an article to medium about how guilty she felt when her victim  (a trans man that she stealthed in order to get him pregnant with ‚Äòbeautiful non-binary children‚Äô) asked for help buying post exposure prophylactics (PEP) to combat the HIV risk.  She did not help him. (And claimed she couldn‚Äôt.) 

Stephonknee, parent of multiple children and LARPing as a 6 year old got her story picked up by the media and leaned into it. She‚Äôs described herself on SM as a 52 year old sissyboi.

Then there‚Äôs Jessica Yaniv. Gods, where to start with Yaniv. Certainly she‚Äôs gotten a lot of publicity for being trans and trying to make it everyone else‚Äôs obligation to cater to her needs. There‚Äôs dozens of messages with her asking inappropriate questions of girls, especially in regards to her behavior in the bathroom. Not women, girls. At this point I‚Äôm convinced she‚Äôs a GC false flag that the GCs never asked for. 

Transgender people are _rare_, and a lot of us are doing our damnedest to be invisible. Often times media is the only way that folks know of trans people, so when the media is out there covering the negative stories of JY, stephonknee, Cherno Biko, and Andi Dier, we‚Äôre going to have to deal with the negative wave of folks. 

Then there‚Äôs also the way that trans folks act on the net. The decision to prioritize resistance to TERFs over resistance to regressive men is something I question, but the way we as trans people individually go about it is also not helping our image. When folks tweet #killallterfs or #diecisscum, do they really think that‚Äôs going to improve the life of the trans person a town over who‚Äôs living their life offline? 

You didn‚Äôt ask how to fix it, but I‚Äôll throw that in as a freebie. Positive change. Bring the opportunity to the people. Right now we‚Äôre focusing on our death rate and the coffins of trans folks we knew before they lost their battle with dysphoria/depression. Right now we‚Äôre vilifying women who are traumatized by male violence and toxic masculinity who don‚Äôt want trans women in their spaces. Maybe we could focus on how society created gender and how trying to live our lives within its terms is hurting everyone?",1596240046

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","Thanks for your comments.

From what I see in the data, the situation in SD county is stable, but at a pretty high plateau. As you say, around 500 cases a day, with a positivity rate close to 5%. Daily hospitalizations also at around 500, and daily ICU declining a bit from around 160 to 135. Daily fatalities, however, have been slowly climbing, from 4 a day at the beginning of the month to 9 yesterday. (All the daily figures are 7 day moving averages).

I think the community public health leaders, esp. Dr. Wooten, are VERY concerned about the community outbreaks. The problem is, they're also dealing with a Republican dominated county board of supervisors. Trumpers like Kristin Gaspar don't want to be too hard on the anti-maskers, the business owners who flout the rules, and the religious ""leaders"" who hold big in-person events.

"PERSoNA","t5_2rg0t","I present my handy dandy copypasta for this exact question:

The PSX release of Innocent Sin is not localized, but has a fan translation patch. Emulate the ROM on any emulator that runs PSX games, and patch in the translation (or download the ROM pre-patched). I recommend Mednafen, but any other PSX emulator works just fine.

The PSP release of Innocent Sin is localized. You can buy a used physical copy for around $100 - $150 USD on average, or a use physical copy of the Limited Edition for $120 - $200 USD on average. You can also buy it on the PS VITA digital store for $20 USD in NTSC-NA and PAL regions. You can also easily emulate it on a PSP emulator. I recommend PPSSPP, it's the most reliable, widely available, and user-friendly PSP emulator on the market.

The PSX release of Eternal Punishment is localized. You can buy a used physical copy for the incredibly steep price of about $400 - $500 USD on average. It's also available on the PS3 and PS VITA digital stores for $10 USD in NTSC-NA regions, but not in PAL regions. You can also emulate it on any PSX emulator, just the same as Innocent Sin above (minus the need for an english fan translation patch).

The PSP release of Eternal Punishment was not localized, and no complete fan translation patch exists. One is being worked on by @cj_iwakura on Twitter, but it has been in development limbo. The script is finished, but the hacking is in progress, and not much more information than that has been known on its status for the better part of 3 years. CJ has been vocal that it is still being worked on, but I would recommend playing the PSX version rather than wasting time waiting for the fan translation to be finished.",1596240046

Translation of the pertinent phrases in bold:

1. as also in all \[Paul's\] letters
2. as also the remaining writings.

Notice the two words that are also italicized. The word ŒµœÄŒπœÉœÑŒøŒªŒ±ŒπœÇ is translated ""letters"" and is used for Paul's writings. The word Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ±œÇ is translated ""scriptures"" or ""writings"" and is usually used in a technical sense to refer to sacred scripture, and *usually* to refer to the Old Testament scriptures. These are two different words, and it is easily argued that they refer to two different sets of writings.

However, if you're willing to agree with modern scholarship which dates 2 Peter much later (around 140 AD) as a pseudepigrapha, your position is much stronger. By this time many of the books which are now in our New Testament had been widely circulated and nearly as widely recognized as inspired by the Holy Spirit. In that circumstance, it makes much more sense to include Paul's letters in the technical term ""scripture.""

If you're willing to concede the date of the letter, I'm willing to concede that the author believes Paul's letters to be inspired.

At that point I'm curious to hear your argument for your other claim, viz. that Paul's request to circulate his letters means that the imperatives in said letters should be applied universally. I assume you are referring to Colossians 4:16, where he tells the Colossians to send that letter to the Laodiceans, and for the Colossians to read the letter Paul wrote to the Laodiceans?",1596240047

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines in the ""Rules"" section of the sidebar.

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, W, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"okbuddyretard","t5_74is2","The Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) or Sunda colugo, also known as the Malayan flying lemur or Malayan colugo, is a species of colugo. Until recently, it was thought to be one of only two species of flying lemurs, the other being the Philippine flying lemur, which is found only in the Philippines. This species can be found throughout Southeast Asia ranging from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, southern Vietnam, southern Burma, and Singapore.[3]

Sunda flying lemur[1] Kaguaani 02.jpg Galeopterus variegatus Conservation status

Least Concern (IUCN 3.1)[2] Scientific classification edit Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Dermoptera Family: Cynocephalidae Genus: Galeopterus Thomas, 1908 Species: G. variegatus Binomial name Galeopterus variegatus (Audebert, 1799) Sunda Flying Lemur area.png Sunda flying lemur range The Sunda flying lemur is not a lemur and does not fly. Instead, it glides as it leaps among trees. It is strictly arboreal, is active at night, and feeds on soft plant parts such as young leaves, shoots, flowers, and fruits. After a 60-day gestation period, a single offspring is carried on the mother's abdomen held by a large skin membrane.[4] It is a forest-dependent species.

The head-body length of Sunda flying lemur is about 33 to 42 cm (13 to 17 in). Its tail length measures 18 to 27 cm (7.1 to 10.6 in),[5] and its weight is 0.9 to 1.3 kg (2.0 to 2.9 lb).

The Sunda flying lemur is protected by national legislation. The Sunda flying lemurs are often hunted by locals with spears or other lethal equipment for various reasons such as food and fur. Habitat loss is known to occur intermittently, particularly in developing countries such as Malaysia.[3] In addition to deforestation and loss of habitat, local subsistence hunting poses a serious threat to this animal. Competition with the plantain squirrel (Callosciurus notatus) represents another challenge for this species. More information is needed on population declines, but at present, the rate of the decline is not believed to merit listing in any category lower than least concern.[2]


The Sunda flying lemurs' two forms are not morphologically distinct from one another; the large form occurs on the mainland of the Sunda Shelf area and the mainland of Southeast Asia, while the dwarf form occurs in central Laos and some other adjacent islands.[1] The Laos specimen is smaller (about 20%) than the other known mainland population.[6] Despite the large and dwarf forms, four subspecies are known: G. v. variegatus (Java), G. v. temminckii (Sumatra), G. v. borneanus (Borneo), and G. v. peninsulae (Peninsular Malaysia and mainland of Southeast Asia)[1] incorporating on the genetic species concept due to geographic isolation and genetic divergence. Recent molecular and morphological data provide the evidence that the mainland, Javan, and Bornean Sunda flying lemur subspecies may be recognised as three separate species in the genus Galeopterus.[7]

Sunda flying lemurs live either solitary or in small groups that are loosely connected. They can be territorial in foraging and sleeping areas. They are mainly nocturnal. They are strictly arboreal and in the daytime, they sleep high within dense foliage in the treetops or in holes in trees. With all four of their feet, they cling on to the trunk of a tree or the underside of branches. Climbing involves stretching out their two front legs and then bringing up their two back legs, which results in an awkward hopping. They can glide more than 100 m with minimal loss in elevation. When threatened, they either climb higher up or remain motionless. These animals are quite helpless if on the forest floor.

The Sunda flying lemur is a skillful climber, but is helpless when on the ground.[8] Its gliding membrane connects from the neck, extending along the limbs to the tips of the fingers, toes, and nails.[9] This kite-shaped skin is known as a patagium, which is expanded for gliding. It can glide over a distance of 100 m with a loss of fewer than 10 m in elevation.[9] It can maneuver and navigate while gliding, but strong rain and wind can affect its ability to glide. Gliding usually occurs in open areas or high in the canopy, especially in dense tropical rainforest. The Sunda flying lemur needs a certain distance to glide and to land to avoid injury.[10] The highest landing forces are experienced after short glides; longer glides lead to softer landings, due to the colugo's ability to break its glide aerodynamically. The ability to glide increases a colugo's access to scattered food resources in the rainforest, without increasing exposure to terrestrial or arboreal predators.[11]

In general, the diet of the Sunda flying lemur consists mainly of leaves. It usually consumes leaves with less potassium and nitrogen-containing compounds, but with higher tannin.[12] It also feeds on buds,[13] shoots,[14] coconut flowers, durian flowers,[15] fruits, and sap[16] from selected tree species. It also feeds on insects in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.[17] The selected food sources depend on the localities, habitat, vegetation types, and availability.[18]

The Sunda flying lemur mainly forages in tree canopies. It may forage on several different tree species in a single night,[19][20] or on a single species. It can also be seen licking tree bark of selected tree species to obtain water, nutrients, salts, and minerals.[21] Though the Sunda flying lemur has been reported to also occur in gardens and plantations, the species resides in forests primarily.[22]


The Sunda flying lemur is widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, ranging from the Sunda Shelf mainland to other islands ‚Äì Northern Laos,[6] Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak), Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia (Kalimantan, Sumatra, Bali, Java),[1][23] and many adjacent islands.[14] Conversely, the Philippine flying lemur (C. volans) is confined to the southern parts of the Philippines only.[1]

The Sunda flying lemur is adapted to many different vegetation types, including gardens, primary and secondary forest,[24] rubber and coconut plantations,[25] fruit orchards (dusun),[15] mangrove swamps,[13] lowlands and upland forests,[9][26] tree plantations,[14] lowland dipterocarp forests, and mountainous areas,[16] but not all of these habitats can sustain large colugo populations.[22]

You're clearly a man dedicated to his activities. With only 3 weeks off work a year will he even get to see much of you?

Thank you. I wasn't always super adventurous. At one stage of my life I was seriously and deliberately looking to make friends - the platonic type (and especially platonic male friendships). It took me about 3 years of diligently searching for ""my tribe"". I joined charitable/religious/cultural organisations. I did MeetUp.Coms, even did Toastmasters and that wasn't my thing.üòè

Then I decided to join a hiking club. It was something I had never done before (had no equipment, didn't even know how to read a map) and I knew no one in my immediate social  circles then who were into it. (The City I was living in had a hiking club that had existed since the 1950s) And I fell in love with the intense connection to nature, and about how the earth had the ability to give me the most intense (all body) workout I had experienced (despite belonging to a gym for over a decade before). Before long I was going on weekend away trips then joined a mountain backpacking club and begin to build up my cardio levels for high altitudes. More importantly I made friends that really care (they've shown it by risking their lives for me during some nasty hiking experiences) and I know they have my back as I have theirs (It's almost like a very grown up version of the military, with our leave no man behind philosophy). There's no doubt who my grooms men will beü§ó

Now I lead hikes and backpack solo. I normally take 4 weeks a year. One week to actually proper plan, routes, transport, accommodation etc. I do not use porters or guides so I have to do a lot of planning from home. Then it's hop on a plane and go experience!üôÉ I actually proposed to him on the top of Table Mountain in South Africa (one of the 7 natural wonders of the world)üòÅ

I was telling my buddies that Corona restrictions had actually placed me into a state of physical and psychological
withdrawal due to increased regulations, park closures and flight cancellations (I had hoped to trek in the Himalaya mountains this October and that will have to wait).üò™ 

My fiance sees me every day when I'm home. He knows exactly where I am at all times and when I'm not home we video conference daily. We had agreed only to move in together after we got engaged and so I now spend a lot more quality time with him. I am a partner at a multinational management consulting firm so I work long hours and travel (between countries) constantly. I would say my relationship is only about 1/4 of my life and I think it's healthy that way.",1596240049

"MuslimMarriage","t5_39x1d","Your priority should be to be there for her and provide her support. You cannot force her to leave, and it is extremely difficult for people in toxic relationships to get out. What she needs is someone to be there for her so that when she is ready, she has the support she needs. 

I don't think you should directly tell her she should leave. Not because you're wrong, but because that might damage your relationship and lead her to distance herself from you. Instead, tell her there are resources available for her, direct her to them, and make it clear they will be there for her *if she ever wants them.* Make sure she knows she has options but don't put too much pressure on her to go in one direction.  

You need to accept that you cannot solve her problems for her, and you cannot force her to make the decisions you would. You need to give her space to figure out her own issues herself.

ThrowRA for obvious reasons.

And while I wish this was fake, sadly it‚Äôs not.

Backstory: So I danced for a long time. After I quit I met my spouse. I didn‚Äôt really get into depth about stupid shit I did while being a stripper. My best friend who also danced, and I, had a weird customer. Well call him #2.

Well I was talking to my best friend on speaker and she was wasted. She started dying laughing and said:

 ‚ÄúRemember that time we hired security to go shit on that dude‚Äôs chest for 1500 each?!‚Äù 

I said ‚Äúyeahhh I can‚Äôt believe he kept the TP!‚Äù 

At this point I have tears running down my face from laughing so hard....but then I turned around towards the doorway.....

 My husband was dead ass standing there, with this atrociously angry look on his face...like in utter disbelief. I didn‚Äôt even know he was home.

I tried looking at him seriously, but I was still laughing with tears in my eyes as his face was beat red from being irritated with the situation. 

Now he says I can‚Äôt be trusted because I hid shit from him. It‚Äôs not that I was hiding it, it‚Äôs just not something you openly come out and tell people, let alone your man. I explained that and asked him if someone offered him that much, wouldn‚Äôt he do it?! But once again, he stared at me in silence...just walked away.

He‚Äôs still not speaking to me.

So AITA for not being open about giving #2 a Cleveland Steamer?!

"pitbulls","t5_2qjof","Excellent fighting dogs no doubt, as are rots and dobermanns, which is why they were mostly used in the past when they had the stigma crown that pitbulls now unfortunately have, and back then it was the same story with those breeds.

Which breed is actually the best at fighting, thats another story, unless you can provide some data, that's just your opinion. To me that's not true, i could definitely see a rottweiler beat a pitbull, and vice versa, things are not that simple, they might be to you, but unless you have some hard data gathered from dog fights, which you dont, its just an opinion. How do dog fights work? Is there weight classes? Breed restrictions? Do they even fights different breeds with each other or is that seen as unsportsmanlike? Pitbulls have the ""cool"" factor because Karen's fear them over rottweilers etc these days, they are featured in movies and music videos etc as fearsome dogs, that might be a factor, people are influenced by such things.

You might want to see the world as black and white, but reality is more nuanced.

Pitbulls are definitely potentially dangerous as most dogs of a certain size and above are, we agree they arent inherently dangerous which some haters believe, so why we are even having this conversation at this point, I do not know. 
What breed is best at fighting is not something we are going to find out, legally or ethically, so that point is moot.

A human brain isn't completely developed until they're about 25 btw; so I don't really trust anyone under that age to give me a good analysis of anything.But no, kids shouldn't be protesting at an early age. 

They will comprehend it just like the rest of us; over time they'll discover it on their own. If my kid wants to talk about politics then I would. But if my kid is 5, then I could hear him, though I wouldn't trust him; because he most likely doesn't know what he is talking about. I will never show politics to my kids either; they're kids, they don't deserve to know how shitty people are at that age. And theire conclusions are almost always wrong and those ideas they might have most likely will fade out of them; but when your parents indoctrinated you then you will likely always be in that harmful mentality. 

Like when people say kid they don't mean a high schooler or someone at university.... they mean kids, who are 2-10, you know that right? And I already said how they will be exposed to politics; and now with the age of the Internet kids will be getting into politics earlier and earlier. 

You could make an argument for religion; but atleast most people teaching religion to kids aren't people saying ""Fuck the Police"".

As for the previous owners, that's much trickier, as finding the documents to give us a clue as to who this person was, is rather difficult. As the documents are very hard to track down and not all of them are super detailed. 

In our previous digging after the fire we did discover that the house was built by coal miners, and that this wasn't the first time the house had caught fire. 

However the previous fire was poorly documented and didn't mention a cause or any deaths, the only thing that we really gleaned out of it was the date it happened. Which very VERY scarily was the same day our fire happened.

This whole ""Wednesday Night Wars"" does a disservice to NXT and its wrestlers.

We take my wife‚Äôs RAV4 from Niagara Falls to Orlando with only 2 fill ups as it gets better than 600 KMs per tank driving at 70 MPH with the heat or A/C on and it‚Äôs only 5 minutes to fill the tank. My buddy did the same trip with his Model 3 and it required 11 stops at superchargers to do that, and he paid ~ the same amount in electricity as I paid in gasoline. EV owners get hooped for electricity rates on the road, quite often multiple times more than what you pay to charge at home. This is why the RAV4 is the much more desirable road tripping car for us. Now maybe when I‚Äôm retired, I won‚Äôt give a hoot about how many hours I spend at a charging station but for now I have no interest in subjecting myself or my family to that nonsense. My Leaf as my main commuter and weekend getaway car is saving us a boatload of cash on energy costs and why it‚Äôs the only EV I would consider owning right now.

&gt;In mid-November 2016, an unexplained stealth error appeared in Riseup's warrant canary page, and they did not respond to requests to update the canary, leading some to believe the collective was the target of a gag order.[20] On February 16, 2017, the Riseup collective revealed their failure to update the canary was due to two sealed warrants from the FBI, which made it impossible to legally update their canary. The two sealed warrants concerned a public contact of an International distributed denial-of-service attack extortion ring and an account using ransomware to extort people financially. The decision to release user information has been criticized in the hacker community.[21] The canary has since been updated, but no longer states the absence of gag orders.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Hey a chance to use my knowledge from DUI school!

Drinking responsibly means giving your body time to metabolize the alcohol. If you're going to be doing something that requires full coherency like driving, it is recommended not to have more than one drink per hour. One drink being a can of beer, glass of wine or shot of hard liquor.

If you consume more than one drink per hour, that's when you can get drunk. How many drinks this will take will depend on your weight, metabolism etc. Bigger people and males can generally imbibe a little more without getting super drunk.

If it's your first time, remember that you can always drink more, but never less. Also remember that it takes time for your body to absorb the alcohol into your blood - if you just took a drink, but you're not feeling the way you want to yet, keep in mind that it's in the post, and don't binge prematurely.

I would recommend having a sober friend with you that you trust, start out slow and don't have too many drinks at a time. Not overdoing it is probably the easiest thing to do to avoid a hangover. Eating and drinking non alcoholic fluids helps as well.

Being drunk feels like being a more relaxed and less inhibited version of yourself. You'll figure out with time if you're a happy drunk or a combative drunk etc. But generally you're gonna feel pretty good, and if you're normally anxious alcohol tends to take the edge off of that. If you've never done other drugs, the closest feeling I can think of is when you're super sleepy maybe? Your judgment is the first thing to go, and for a lot of people, the more they drink, the more they want to drink. Again the lowered inhibitions coming into play. If you've ever had Xanax or klonopin for anxiety, alcohol hits the same receptors so it is similar to that in a lot of ways.

Make an effort to cap your drinking before you reach memory loss or throwing up territory as you are potentially in physical danger at that point.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I‚Äôve been thinking so much about this this year. I‚Äôm not an expert so just sharing what my focus has been:

1. Instead of buying things, invest in yourself. Work on skills that can help you in the future or that build towards your future. Patience is important. 

2. High yield savings account. APY‚Äôs have dropped this year due to ‚Äòrona unfortunately, but I‚Äôm using Marcus by Goldman Sachs and like it a lot. Put anything you can into it, even if it‚Äôs just a little here and there. 

3. Spend less, save more. How much you can save is definitely dependent on how much you make and what your bills are, but even if you can only put away $5-10 a month, that‚Äôs $60-$120 at the end of the year. Also, we live in a consumer culture‚Äîenjoy life, but also question what is a need vs. a want. Try not buying any ‚Äúwants‚Äù for the whole month and see if your happiness levels fluctuate. Maybe live in a decent apartment with a roommate to save some money. (For me, I found that things don‚Äôt equal happiness). 

3b. Like others have said, working on building an emergency fund that would last ~6 months is important. My goal this year has been to build a $10,000 e-fund. Once I do, I‚Äôm gonna consider that my $0 point and start saving towards my next goal. Sit down with your budget each month (I advise each week tbh) and be strict with yourself. There‚Äôs always going to be something you want to buy and saving money takes discipline, especially if you don‚Äôt have a huge amount of disposable income. 

4. Don‚Äôt spend money you don‚Äôt have, I‚Äôm looking at you credit cards. Yes, building credit is important, so use a credit card to build credit. But if you can‚Äôt buy something in cash, don‚Äôt buy it until you could buy it in cash. This is often advised by programs like YNAB. 

5. Retirement and investment funds. Think towards the future and make your money work for you, instead of working for your money. This is a long-term savings game, so the effects probably won‚Äôt be felt for a few years. I haven‚Äôt jumped into this step yet, so don‚Äôt have a ton of advice here! 

6. Be kind to yourself. I regretted not saving more when I was younger and didn‚Äôt have bills or things to pay for, but wallowing in the past doesn‚Äôt help. Instead, reframe your thought process to: If I start today, imagine where I could be tomorrow or in a year or in 5 years, etc.

"singing","t5_2rlcx","Anyone with a healthy speaking voice can learn to sing.  Of course, some will be better singers than others.  In my 29 years of teaching, I have had many students, especially in my beginning voice classes, that say they cannot sing.  It is just because they have never learned, but once they get the fundamentals, they really enjoy singing and they continue to improve.  

While there is no substitute for having a private teacher, I have lots of videos on my YouTube channel that can give you a solid foundation (and keep you very busy). My videos go into great detail about vocal technique, explained in (fun) everyday language and include exercises. [https://www.youtube.com/user/vrsing](https://www.youtube.com/user/vrsing). I have a video designed to be the FIRST voice lesson: The Beginner's Voice Lesson - Let's Start! [https://youtu.be/WH\_OV7yEDf4](https://youtu.be/WH_OV7yEDf4). I tell you what to do and where to go after that, and offer options for personal feedback. I also post on this forum regularly.

Have fun discovering your voice!

Trust me I felt every bit of this.  My mind was so distorted in the fact I‚Äôm looking in a mirror saying I‚Äôm fat but you really aren‚Äôt.  I learned a very hard way with my eating disorder.  I put very little food in my body and used laxatives for a long time.  One day I got so sick that I thought I was dying, to the point I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for being too weak, I couldn‚Äôt keep anything down, I was slowly killing myself.  The doctor pulled up my sodium levels from blood work and I had no sodium in my system.  When this happens your organs fail.  I wasnt ready to die. I had kids and I wanted to see my grandkids.  I urge you to forget about numbers on the scale or how you feel in clothes.  What you don‚Äôt realize is once you start to eat healthy and you put on a few pounds, this is all water weight.  It feels like your bloated, you feel like your heavier but in time this will disappear.  You put your body into a shock when your changing your eating habits and it‚Äôs very common to bloat up to 5 pounds.

Covid-19 is so far something that forced me to seek mental help and caused everyone to realize how abusive my dad actually is and finally leaving.

Your final transcription will look like this:

*Video Transcription:*

[*Description of scene, kind of music playing, actions happening, etc.*]
[*Tone of dialogue]* Dialogue.

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

I am by no means dissing Sabertrio, they are a fantastic and reputable company who I will eventually buy from, but Electrum, to me, just seemed the most user friendly and the least amount of work once I have it set up to where I want it. I'm just someone who, right now, does not have the patience to go in and code shit on Proffie, although I'd like to learn how soon. 

There's a massive update coming soon (from what I can gather, it's something to do with the app like an overhaul.) and one of the owners (u/danjabus) frequents this sub and frequently answers questions. 

IMHO, Electrum will offer the most user friendly customizations, Korbanth/Pach Store will offer the most amount of customization (not by an obscene amount), and Sabertrio has the best pre-set fonts/profiles to the point where I genuinely don't feel like I'd need to change anything.

Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

Your comment is completely wrong, everything you're saying is wrong. My only, fuck I don't really have an issues here but you opened the fucking can woman. So you sat down...good, let me teach you something. I came from a history of teachers belittling me for my dyslexia, my farther who constantly beat me down if I didn't achieve, if I didn't hit the high grades and show I'm an achiever, which I didn't. Back when I was in school they didn't have the best special needs curriculum so I got placed with all the trash kids who bullied and never wanted to achieve. I did my best, in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, I achieved high scores but English and Mathematics, not so much. In fact when I came home with my (I'm English) my GCSE and showed my dad he scoffed at me, turned away, didn't have much to do with me. My parents only ever interested in material gain or high achievement. Things they could show off to the people around them. Nowadays I know 'grades' don't make you the man you are, nether does the money or fame. But when all you get back at home while you grow up is, 'you're shit, these scores are shit, you must do better, why can't you do better, you're a disappointment' it's does a little something to your mental state. I infact would and am a fantastic friend and accomplished medic. As a Paramedic you better fucking know I'm knowledgeable in my field else people die and you know how I got here, after years of extra classes and starting university much later in my 20s, after years of depression because my supposed 'disability' just got me ripped apart in my younger life. you know how I got here, I didn't let uniformed little fucks like yourself assume shit about me, kept pushing and stepped right over you.

About pricing, that's up to the DM. There are resources to give *standardized* pricing that should be used and if you're traveling on a different plane that uses mystic snakes as currency then again the DM will have to decide whether or not the pouch uses the currency of the creator, gold pieces, or the currency of the plane, mystic snakes. Creating miscellaneous paragraphs to deal with every situation would be a never ending task and ultimately the item would suffer because of it.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I get pretty upset when guys that I invest a lot of emotional energy into tell me to go pound sand. I developed this step by step after a guy rejected me and I couldn't get over him for almost TWO YEARS. I saw him \*just\* enough to keep his ghost in the back of my mind and it ruined my sex and dating life that whole time. Here's my play-by-play that has helped me get over other guys I've fallen for:

1. Before you ask the guy, tell yourself that you are worth more than one potential hottie. Win or lose, you accept it. Take a deep breath. If you don't feel like you'll be able to do step 2, don't ask him out.
2. You got told no. Be professional. Don't cry, curse him out, plead, or heaven forbid, make more advances on him. You aren't going to change his mind. Cut your losses and move on. My (somewhat cheesy) go to is: ""Ok, no worries. Have a good one.""
3. Assess yourself. Are you okay? Did that hurt? It's okay if it did. It's okay if it didn't. If it didn't hurt, keep doing what you were doing before. If you're at a bar, take a minute or two, and go ask out some other guy who's lucky enough to get a shot with you. If you aren't sure if you're okay or not, take a few seconds, take another deep breath or two, and reassess. Don't be ashamed if the answer is yes.
4. If it hurts, excuse yourself. Get yourself someplace private - a dorm room, apartment, etc. Set a timer for no more than 10 minutes. Let yourself mope about him, (ugly) cry over him, listen to sad music. Do whatever you need to do to let all of your pent-up feelings out. Eat some comfort food. Once that timer goes off, you've put him out of mind. He's had his funeral. He has no more place in your heart.
5. Move on to other guys. You will find love. Statistically, most people get married in their life time. Ask someone else out, rinse, and repeat. If 2% of the world's population is gay/bi men, you have about 160,000,000 people to sort through over the next couple decades. Don't get hung up on one guy.
6. If you're still having trouble, minimize all reminders of him. Unfollow him on Instagram or Facebook. Delete any text messages and/or photos of him. Stop hanging out with his friends, if possible. If he frequents a bar, you can try other bars in your city. You'll forget him, as you should, and move on to other guys.

Rinse and repeat. That's what has worked for me. Sending love and good vibes from one hopeless romantic to another.",1596240063

I have a learning disability so it takes me a little bit longer to learn things (though I am capable, I‚Äôm not an idiot). Due to the poor (or better yet: lack of) training they gave me. I‚Äôve worked several cashier jobs, but it was still an adjustment. On my 3rd day working the register, I had absolutely no idea how to process a WIC payment. I had never received one as payment before, and since I was unfamiliar with it I took me 15 minutes to figure it out since no supervisor would show me. The woman who gave me the payment was so kind and patient with me, and so understanding. However, the woman who was waiting in line after her? She was satan in the flesh. I have never encountered a more vile person. She screamed at me for ‚Äúher long wait‚Äù despite me apologizing and explaining the circumstances. Absolutely berated me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If you are a felon, you are denied guns. Stealing $5 is not a felony, unless you use a weapon to steal it in which case maybe you DON'T deserve a gun if you're using weapons to rob people of a couple of bucks. If you can't be responsible with $5 then you sure as hell can't be responsible with a weapon capable of murdering someone.

I never said I was anti gun though? I have a Glock myself, with a concealed carry license, a gun safe under lock and key. I had to go through a background check to get my conceal carry license and another background check to get my gun. I did not complain. Why is it a bad thing to have a background check or a ID to get a deadly weapon??? Don't you wanna know who the hell has a gun? 

If you are under 18 and commit a victimless crime like blowing up a trash can, who cares? But also lets not forget children aren't so innocent, and we have kids that actively kill others. I saw an article on Reddit a few weeks ago about a 13 year old boy who shot his brother because they were playing cops and robbers or something. The dad should be held responsible for not having his firearm properly locked up.

We should prosecute gun crimes harder because they are serious weapons that can seriously injure or kill someone. Guns don't kill people. Not if they're just sitting around. But if you allow an asshole or a child or an idiot have it, then the possible scenarios are endless.

I have been trained professionally through work on how to handle a firearm. The countless times I have seen friends and family alike mishandling, aiming at people, no trigger safety etc is alarming. My uncle is an angry, racist, trigger happy fool and he had a gun. He was willing to shoot people for cutting him off in traffic if given the chance. My other uncle was a convicted felon living with him, and the PO found out and sent uncle back to jail and confiscated the gun. But guess what? My non felon uncle has no record and can have a gun legally. Is that the kind of people we want having guns!? Someone who actively looks for reasons to shoot minorities and has it laying out on a table with a convicted felon in the house?

Family or not he's an asshole and an idiot and has no idea the responsibility or restraint that comes with owning a gun and should not be allowed one. If he went through a mandatory psych analysis he would not be allowed to have a gun. He has something off about him that is undiagnosed and is a danger to society if he had a gun. But he never committed a serious crime so if he wanted to buy another gun tomorrow he could. People like that should not have a gun because they can't handle it.",1596240063

Learn how to use these plugins. You‚Äôll have the most trouble with compression and EQ. Don‚Äôt over compress and don‚Äôt EQ too much. The room is a HUGE factor, make sure your room sounds good. Without a good room you‚Äôll never get a good sound, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you try to tweak.

If my stepmother made a habit of making threats on which she didn't follow through I too would feel exasperated. Even more so if the one time she does follow through is to cancel my planned joint birthday party in a way that now draws attention only to my stepsister.

If my stepmother was so notoriously bad at sticking to her word that my grandparents had to step in to make sure my birthday actually got celebrated even after she said she'd make it right I too would feel exasperated.

If my life had been torn apart (mentally unstable mom, dad fighting a pandemic away from home, new stepmom of 2-3 years that enjoys power trips and for some inexplicable reason thinks of herself as my mom) I too would feel exasperated.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Addendum to explain something that might be invaluable;

I had to move back to MA to my parents, because husband knew I was dying. My parents couldn't even tell because they had seen me worse, (not dying, but worse pain/miserable) and couldn't fight my doctors if they weren't there (I literally had a couple of doctors say I wasn't allergic to things that make me vomit blood, and I didn't have my husband come to doctor visits with me, because he would have been so angry lol, whereas my parents know medical stuff about me I don't/forget in the moment) and we're still in love, bffs, super close, although visiting is a big deal obviously.

His ""ultimatum"" was that I had to take care of myself / fix the vomiting blood such that it never came up again. He would bring me to walk-in and appointments, but I was still in denial about how much I was suffering. So long as I could do ANYTHING for myself (food, shower, work) I was very proud/relieved to finally have ended the long distance part of our relationship (which is now back) and I had wanted to move away from my parents since I was eight.

I would literally have rather died if you'd asked me in November about moving back in with my parents.

Post-coma I'm fighting a lot harder to live. But before that, I was incapable of admitting or even caring that I was literally dying. I desperately wanted to keep things the way they were and not go ""backwards,"" that I couldn't, I was fully incapable of admitting ""failure"" - that I wasn't physically able to maintain what I was doing without internal semi-invisible damage.

I'm not sure what the ""alternatives"" are in your case, but don't let her accidentally kill herself. Please. I was beyond livid with the world the first day I came out of my coma, but ever day after that I've just been really grateful that my soulmate never stopped saving my life even when it hurt him, even when I got mad and told him to back off.",1596240065

I hold that there are levels to this stuff. (I'm self-censoring here.)

I have been honing my views for some time, and it would take more unpacking than seems appropriate for this particular thread, to explain everything, so, know that there is more to it than just what I will state presently.  And I will answer any questions as they come up, and the unpacking will happen gradually, that way.

Yes, I hold it is possible to believe in the same God as another while having disparate views as to the exact nature of that God.  Maybe a better word would be Reality.  If one holds there is a Primary Reality, from which all else we call real stems, that is a starting point that many disparate views might agree on.  Asking about the Nature of That is then a next step.

&gt;And the main problem atheists have with theism/religion is the irrationality

I have found that very often, those who are vocal in their objections to religion attack caricatures rather than the actual teachings.  The word ""rational"" has a connotation that usually means ""derived from reason,"" and almost every religion has elements not so derived.  Otherwise, it probably wouldn't be a religion but rather a school of thought.  Actually, every religion is also a school of thought, and I have become rather fond of that term as denoting not only religions but together with them, philosophies, ways of life, etc.

Anyway, if what is meant by ""rational"" is ""derived from reason,"" and then by ""irrational"" is meant ""not derived from reason,"" then Theism per se is irrational at its core, being based, not on reason, but instead on revelation.  However, if what is meant by ""irrational"" is, instead, ""contrary to reason,"" then I disagree with the assessment of those atheists to whom you refer.  We can use the word ""reasonable"" rather than ""rational"" to describe something that, while not specifically derived from reason alone, is yet not contrary to reason.

I hold that the doctrines of Catholicism at least are one and all reasonable.

&gt;the political problems of them imposing their view on us, which is a separate issue.

It is a separate issue but related.  However, in the free world at least, the Church has no authority to affect legislation, except -- like anyone else -- through persuasion.  It was different under what history calls Christendom, but that no longer exists.  Now, in a republic like the U. S. A. -- at least this is how it is supposed to work -- the people essentially govern themselves, which is why we call our office holders ""public servants.""  I know it doesn't always, and sometimes in scary ways, work like that in practice, but that is WAY another issue.

Anyway, my point is that in a democracy or a republic, the operative principle is majority rules. And if it should come about that the majority favors a law also favored by the Church, some atheists (and even some Christians) might not like it, but it is not the Church ""imposing their view.""  It is in fact the will of the majority of the people.

&gt;Religion is still based on faith, which means no evidence, which is irrational.

First, faith doesn't mean no evidence.  There is often supporting evidence for something accepted on faith.  Faith means taking someone's word for it, whatever ""it"" may be, and we do it all the time.  No one, or almost no one, claims it is irrational to believe in particle physics, even though no one, not even any scientist, has ever seen an ""elementary particle.""  The more the sciences advance, the more arcane they become.  We see it works -- here I am typing on my computer -- but we take it on faith, that someone understands how it works.  Even specialists extend faith to specialists in other disciplines.

Based on the very same criteria, if a religion is demonstrated to work, that is supporting evidence for faith in it.  And I submit that such is the case regarding the Catholic Faith.  The Saints are the scientists who have carried out the experiments and documented their results.",1596240066

The smell they get, the crinkling of ripping them off your underware, etc. so I decided that I wanted to try tampons and my mom didnt buy them for me because ‚Äúthey were bad‚Äù. I have used tampons, pads, cups and period panties, and we have open convos about them at work - even with male friends and sometimes they even ask questions (mostly about cups) and share their experiences with their girlfriends. 

Never once I have people shame me for not wearing a tampon on my last day cause I find it wasteful, nor leaving it sometimes for 12h cause I forget. Or for sending a voice to a colleague cause I panicked and couldn‚Äôt take my cup out the first time ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Yup.  That's why it was the first thing I asked for.

You didn't give me an answer, but chose instead to fear monger.

Let's see where you go from here.

I can't wait.

&gt;  The genetic predisposition that caused the adverse reaction is in a small enough group that it simply wont come out in a huge study.

Funny how you've gone from a hypotetical to now inferring causation...all while saying it's too rare to be shown even in a large study.

Do you not see how that's contradictory?

No, of course not.

&gt; However, autoimmune arthritis is a lifelong condition that would need to be at least mentioned in an informed consent discussion.

And one that would surely be mentioned in any monograph.

Your point?

&gt; You know, empathy?

Like for the people who get lyme or measles?  

Or just the few who are so rare that they can't even be studied, but nevertheless are definitely getting autoimmune arthritis from this vaccine?

&gt; You seem to assume I have problems with all vaccines - which I dont.

Well, you sure have an ""interesting"" take on this one.

Get back to me once you actually have data on the incidence of harmful effects of the vaccine.

No, not a proposed mechanism.

JKA is your priority target. If you manage to kill him you have pretty much won. Only hit the tanks until taunt expires, then hit Anakin with all you've got. If your opponent starts with Hound's Tooth and reinforces another tank, switch targets since HT's taunt will expire soon anyway. Most likely he'll bring in Clone Sergeant, who has taunt as long as he has protection. By the time you've removed his prot, HT has lost taunt &amp; you get a shot at JKA.

ETA: AOEs and concussion mines are your friend. Might allow you to kill JKA without getting around the tanks. I don't know which fleet you're using, but Fives' Umbaran can hit all target-locked ships with his special, which can decide the battle if you time it right.",1596240069

The deck it uses is nothing special, just some low level thrives/deathwish units with a bunch of fat bodies that it plays at the end.  Either one of these, or some combination of them:

Favourite run this month was the 1 mile run I did with our 8 month old puppy after he got cleared to run from the vet. He clocked in his 1st, and current fastest, mile at 6:12. His big sister (German Shorthaired Pointer) has clocked in a 5:12 with me, so he has a way to go yet. Puppy is hopefully going to be my long mileage, ultra dog.

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","Started out with leveling issues. Because of the plastic strain relief piece on the heated bed, that spring had to be compressed like mad in order to be level with the other 3 and the other 3 corners were basically floating, no tension in the springs. There wasn't really a way to get them even. I ended up upgrading the bed springs to the heavy duty ones and doubling up on the springs. It gave me less vertical height but at least I have spring to level with.  

Eventually I switched from the magnetic bed that it came with to the Creality glass aftermarket bed. It worked perfectly for about a week until I relocated the printer down 1 floor and I wasn't able to get it printing right again. I kept having bed adhesion issues. Couldn't get it to stick. I moved it back and leveled the bed a dozen times and finally got it closer to working when I ran into issue #3.  

My last issue is under extrusion and extruder click. I assumed that I had a massive clog so I took the whole thing apart to discover that I had a MASSIVE clog in the nozzle. Replaced the nozzle, cleaned the entire hotend, and leveled the bed again. Now the whole thing seems so fucking temperamental. After the first layer the extruder starts clicking and underextruding. I've monkeyed with the temperature and different filament and have yet to resolve it. I worked on getting decent prints for like 3 months before I gave up. I haven't had the drive to even attempt playing with it again because I've got to start by leveling the god damned bed, etc.  

I saw someone on the Ender forum recently switched to an all-metal extruder setup because of some cracking in their plastic extruder and I'm starting to wonder if maybe it's happening to me to with the crazy inconsistent prints I've had.  

tl;dr  

Too many issues. Tried to get it working for 3 months, gave up. Want to buy a Prusa instead. No money &lt;/3",1596240070

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","But the people who reported the outbreak first believed it to be Sars and China wanted to study the threat first. Wuhan has 11 million people in it and closing that down is no easy decision, this is exactly the same dilemma we saw with many other countries even after the outbreak, lockdown means panic, no freedom of movement, a halt to the economy, a halt to tourism and people coming home for the annual holiday (I agree these shouldn't take precedence over health and safety, however, these are indeed very hefty implications of the decision to lock down and its exactly why countries like Britain and America were hit so hard).

There's also the fact that this is an airborne disease and if you look at the timeline, it had already moved to other provinces before china even properly caught wind of it (infected people can carry the disease without displaying symptoms) so no, even if they'd locked down with the first 7 or so cases (which is an unrealistic goal to say the least) this still would have gotten out. No society in human history has ever been able to get ahead of and contain a virus tantamount to plague like covid.

So, while China's silencing behaviour is reprehensible, the illness was not their fault, it would have gotten out anyway (again, the holiday and influx of Chinese people and tourists on a regular basis) and China worked to contain it as soon as they were able to identify it, and acted better than or equal to many other countries in its response to the virus (at least China has the excuse of being caught off guard by a new virus no-one has ever seen before, where as many of the preceding countries had ample warning and time to prepare, yet failed to act accordingly).

It should also be noted that the conditions that lead to the transmission of covid to humans (the giant animal food markets that many Chinese peoe turn to because it's a cheep source of food and protein) is a condition enabled by every other country. Our economies are entirely dependent on the slavery and exploitation of Chinese workers and resources. China's power, fascist government and our inability to do anything about it is also a result of our dependence on them, so again, China cannot be blamed in a vacuum for material conditions we're causing and enabling.",1596240070

at 18 years old, the only person who could make you do it is... you.

thus the idea that you would get part of your penis amputated at 18 is highly indicative that you would prefer to have a smaller and less sensitive penis.

if somebody put a gun to my head and said i had to choose between being circumcised as an infant and being circumcised at 18, i'd definitely choose at 18.  18 year olds get general anesthesia during the surgery, narcotic pain relievers during recovery, have a smaller percentage of their penis removed, and can tell the doctor to preserve as much as the frenulum as possible.  as an added benefit, i would have been able to experience teenage sexual experiences as nature intended.",1596240070

I got a really bad case of Lyme disease from hiking/hunting. Being into the outdoors, if you gave me a vaccine that was 75% effective at least, like the one that was withdrawn, I‚Äôd get somebody to inject it into my scrotum every time I went into the woods If that‚Äôs what it took.

calculation is 1 and 2 crit fail and the bomb disappears, 3-11 hit for splash, 12-20 hit normally. so .45( 3 ( enemies ) \* 6 ( splash )) + .45( 3 ( enemies ) \* 6 ( splash )) + 4 \* 4.5 ( d8 expectation ) )

&gt;How do they do that?

Modern radar guns can do that. Don't know how it works, but I've been dinged by one out in Camas County, Idaho.

&gt;Is there any good way to contest it?

Show up in court. Otherwise no. And no, they won't move it to a court closer to where you live, it'll be up in Mammoth Hot Springs no matter what.

&gt;Any help? Any advice?

Drive slower bud. At night in Yellowstone I'd strongly recommend driving 5 UNDER the speed limit. Not that it's all that dark at 9pm right now, but even so.

Big pan, add meat and onions with a little oil, brown a bit, add any or all veggies u want (broccoli, cabbage, carrots, celery, mushrooms, kale, bean sprouts etc.) Add seasonings (powder chicken boullion in bulk saves so much time, soy sauce, sriracha, garlic, etc) and add some water, cover and heat on high to steam it all (stir to prevent burning). You can pop out a dish in 15 mins and cook rice in about the same time, Boom, portion it out after it cools. This may not be that popular for ur taste palette but overnight oats are easy to make and have a lot of fiber. Mix oats with a milk, of ur choice, cinnamon, some fruit, tbsp of nuts, even some chocolate chips (if you want), shake it in tupperware and put it in the fridge for the morning.

Hearing their trainee stories made me very emotional. Living with cockroaches and centipedes. Living off of scrambled eggs and strawberry jam. Being a young kid and living away from your parents in such bad conditions while also training and doing your best to succeed and debut must've been so hard for them. Rosie and Lisa coming from foreign countries and not knowing the language all that well must've compounded their own difficulties.

Hearing them cover 'Price Tag' by Jessie J, 'Lonely' by 2NE1 (by far one my favorite song of theirs), and 'You And I' by Park Bom made my heart melt.

Jisoo's and Rosie's pottery turned out really nicely. Them failing to record their unboxing reaction was hilarious. Really interested as to why there was no preview for next week's episode. Maybe they don't want to do a preview as to not spoil the next one since this upcoming Saturday is their 4th anniversary. Maybe we get a special episode? Who knows.

I only get good highs if I vape at high temp, lower temps just don't hit me hard.  I use the green and orange settings or, 392F and 401F.  Mostly vape at 401F.  Start at green temp then quickly jump to orange.

The problem is my throat can't handle the hot temps at those settings for long with the stock short stems.  However, just got in a small water pipe.  I just hit it dry with that and can get high off of one or 1.5 bowl now when I use to vape 3-4 bowls with worse results since have to use lower temps.  What a difference the water pipe and higher temps make.  The big clouds at higher temps hit you way harder.

Dunno if the Argo is the same as the Air buy my Air burns the top of the bowl off first.  So when I notice the vape clouds decreasing, I turn off, and scoop out the top charred herb, then keep going, the clouds grow bigger again.

Season 3/4 are transition seasons filling in the gaps between the two games, Abby and her crew are introduced, and season 4/5 deal with the second game.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Ok, you haven't really shown what your metric for the merit's ""goodness"" should be.

If the argument is that the metric of merit is subjective... then how is goodness measured, to begin with? What I think is 'goodness' compared to you is going to be completely different? Besides the point, the metric I **would** use for merit is simply collectivism over individualism.

The example of the runner is overly simplified. Merit has its pros we understand that. We can't ignore the cons of having 50 100m runners who run nearly the same times. What use is this in a real-world scenario aka the team? We don't need 50 of the slightly similar but different runners!

&gt;In the case of college admission the deal is this.

I agree with most of what you said in this part, which is why it's not a good idea that merit should only matter. etc.

&gt;I'm sorry but I'm not following. What is the negative effect of merit? Are you saying that Harvard students would get better education if they threw in with the top students a bunch of high school dropouts?

The negative effects... you'll have 50 similar runners... in this case students. At no point is Harvard or any other colleges accepting students who aren't already academically inclined. This is a common but ridiculous talking point, there are no high school dropouts being accepted to Harvard... it's an absurd take.

Let's throw out the hyperbole, 99 Asian students are accepted to Harvard and a black student. 90% of these Asian students are international students, 10% domestic, including the black student. They're all given a project on what they would do to lessen poverty and crime rates in big inner cities.

The Asian students believe stricter laws and more policing would lessen poverty issues, leading to fewer crimes. The black student believes higher wages and more funding for schools would solve the poverty issues, leading to fewer crimes.

So I'm saying is there is value in diversity, not just academic abilities.

Anyways, it seems like we're arguing 2 different points here. I believe colleges value diversity b/c they believe that experience leads to overall better graduates for society. My assumption is you believe colleges should select students based solely on academic merit because by not doing so, an academically inclined student who may not be a POC is missing out on opportunities.

Therefore, diversity policies bad but then certainly by that logic merit only policies can be bad too... and these are getting too long... maybe we should just call it an agree to disagree and what discussion we had as good meaningful exchange of talk/perspectives.",1596240081

"slp","t5_2sjju","You‚Äôre never wasting your time if you‚Äôre dedicated and taking the journey seriously. You‚Äôre starting fresh right now. High school will not matter. It‚Äôs a clean slate!

I worked full time during my first degree. It all depends on your situation. Once I returned to college to pursue a new career, I worked full time only until I began my prerequisite Speech courses‚Äîmeaning I completed my English, Science, History requirements (foundational bachelor degree courses) unrelated to Speech (or my a Linguistics degree); you don‚Äôt want to compromise the grades that‚Äôll truly matter. Collectively, all of the grades do matter because they comprise your overall GPA, but you will be asked to specify grades related to Speech on graduate forms. Stay focused in required undergraduate coursework for Speech such as Biology, Statistics, and Physics; some programs even specification require U.S. History (NOT just any History). As previously, mentioned unique Education courses and Intro to Linguistics are helpful and look good on applications.

For the first real semester of Speech courses, I shifted to high part time hours and then judged how much time I needed to study and get work done. Eventually, in my last two semesters, I worked only about 20 hrs/week so I could focus on my remaining courses, extracurriculars (SLP shadowing; research assistant; volunteerism) and GRE preparation (the GRE is the General Records Exam you need to take prior to applying to graduate programs‚Äîthis required months of preparation with maybe even a review course plus independent studying). The last thing you want to do is compromise grades. If you need to work and work high part time to full time hours then don‚Äôt load up your semesters. Sure your education will take longer but you need to achieve great grades. I cannot emphasize this enough... you need GREAT grades! You will need to achieve at least a 3.5 GPA to be considered for Speech. Many undergraduate programs usually will have their own criteria for remaining in a Speech program as well, e.g., 3.2 GPA and no grades lower than B- (only 1 variation of grade C in the program); or you could be excused from the program or possibly be placed on probation meaning you cannot get another grade below B- or you‚Äôre out.

Your GED will not matter. You will need to pass your college‚Äôs placement exams and/or take and pass a remedial course depending on scores. You have a lot of ground to cover in terms of coursework. You could probably have a good 3 semesters before anything Speech-related. A typical undergraduate degree is about 125 credits. A typical required course is worth 3 credits. Sometimes there can be variations that add up to 3 credits (2 credit coursework plus 1 credit lab). At the end of the day, once enrolled in college, your high school life will not matter! Make your grades count now! This is the start of your life. Your performance now can dictate where you go moving forward. And remember, it‚Äôs OK to change your mind about the intended major if it happens. Keep an open mind, don‚Äôt have tunnel vision. Speech can remain the end goal but still be aware of other things around you. A diverse application to graduate school can mean the difference between competing with others just like you OR standing out! Don‚Äôt rush anything, try to experience as much as possible and the decisions will come to you. You don‚Äôt get this time back! Create your strong foundation now.

Remove yourself from distractions, establish good study habits, and time management skills. If you have distractions then don‚Äôt stockpile your semesters!",1596240081

Second, I think the number of problems is not as important as the severity of the problem, for example I only hate Treant more ONLY for his stupid dash that can kill you in 2 seconds if you‚Äôre behind cover and he bounces off the wall and the cover multiple times, also Snow Ape can just combo you to death if you get frozen. 

I feel he is overrated, but you seem to debunk the severity of his attacks by saying ‚Äújust dodge or block it‚Äù which is the reason people complain because in the event you get slowed by a meteor you can‚Äôt block with melee weapons as fast, and his spastic attacks may overwhelm some people and may make the fight seem unfair for them.

    execute as @a[tag=updated, nbt=!{RootVehicle:{Entity:{id:""minecraft:horse""}}}] run tag @s remove updated

These commands ensures that the function ""main:mountedhorse"" is only ran once by the player when they mount a horse. Than in the function ""main:mountedhorse"" or whatever the name of your function is, make sure that this command is in there ""/tag '@s add updated"". It doesn't matter where its placed, but it would look more organized if it was the last command ran.

Than for the type of horse you want to detect, you would need to have multuple of these  commands inside the ""main:mountedhorse"" function:

    execute if data entity @s {RootVehicle:{Entity:{id:""minecraft:horse"", Varient:1}}} run ...

The only problem with this is that there are 35 different variants of horses ([link](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/horse_variant_list_pc.php) to see the different variants). Which would require you to detect for each type of horse. This could be avoided though by having the horse detection be by color rather than actual variant, since the different variants are broken up into 5 groups (seen on the website), each of them have similar colored horses in each horse list. I could create predicates for you that could more easily do this if you want (since you said you want to cause the least amount of lag as possible), unless your fine with detecting all the 35 horse variants, let me know though. If you have any other questions or problems feel free to reply.",1596240081

Of course, we hardcore fans get the easter egg lines like ""Your ancestors rode the mighty mythosaur"", but that to casual fans is just filler banter as they don't get it, and that's not entertaining for the viewer (most of the viewers probably didn't even know what a mandalorian was). 
The thing about mando is that it's very enjoyable either if you know nothing or everything about Star Wars lore. By itself it's pretty much a western, but in space (gunslinger wanderer gets jobs done after a widespread civil war ended, ends up getting into personal problems that drive the plot), and you don't watch a western to learn history (""lore"").

Ahora, claro, si trabajas contratado, y por ende en blanco (relaci√≥n dependiente) el aporte tiene muchos beneficios empezando por salud, donde autom√°ticamente pod√©s elegir tu hospital (mutualista/salud privada) adem√°s aportas al bps que te genera ganancia y antig√ºedad para jubilarte. Por ejemplo mi madre trabaj√≥ en negro 30 a√±os aprox y luego en blanco casi casi 15 a√±os. Al cumplir 70 ya est√° en edad de jubilarse y de hecho se jubila en octubre de este a√±o, pero solo le contabilizan los 15 a√±os de trabajo en blanco. 

La jubilaci√≥n m√≠nima ronda por los 12mil o 14mil pesos, no estoy muy seguro. No te da para mucho, pero ta, es mi vieja y me la banco. Es m√°s plata que su sueldo, eso sin duda. Cansada ya de trabajar ella trabaja como empleada dom√©stica pero muy poquitas horas. Teje en los √≥mnibus mientras viaja aburrida y le habla a las plantas mientras las riega en mi jardin.

Esto de venir a trabajar en blanco no se si influye que sean argentinos o no. Si te contratan te contratan. Punto. Obvio que hay papeleo de por medio para la inmigraci√≥n. pero se est√° tratando de facilitar las cosas lo m√°ximo posible. as√≠, como se hizo con la gran cantidad de gente que vino de Venezuela o Cuba en los √∫ltimos a√±os.

Romero or Martinez

I understand that this list of very optimistic and definitely unrealistic.

I don‚Äôt think we need Rose or Delph but if we make those signings, Bielsa obviously made them for a reason.

The Watkins and Benrahma possibilities hinge heavily on the result of the playoff final. If Brentford go up we can probably forget about those two.

I trust that whatever signings we make are completely indicative of Bielsa‚Äôs will, so whoever we sign I know they serve a purpose and there‚Äôs a good reason, even if we can‚Äôt see it.

&gt;  
&gt;\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Analyses using alternative data onmandatory minimums suggest that their use can explain virtually all ofthe otherwise unexplained sentencing disparity.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory\_sentencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_sentencing)

&gt;**Mandatory sentencing** requires that offenders serve a predefined term for certain crimes, commonly serious and violent offenses. 

Zwykle chodzi o brutalno≈õƒá, pogardƒô itp. przejawianƒÖ przez oskar≈ºonego.

I ponownie cytat z artyku≈Çu:

&gt;The estimates presented above include an extremely rich set of controls.However, in the absence of experimental variation, it is still possible thatthe racial disparity we document is the result of an unobserved omittedfactor that is correlated with race. 

Czyli r√≥wnie dobrze r√≥≈ºnica mo≈ºe braƒá siƒô z faktu (gdyby sytuacja taka mia≈Ça miejsce), ≈ºe czarni przestƒôpcy sƒÖ ≈õrednio bardziej brutalni, a biali - bardziej metodyczni.

&gt;While other unobserved differences cannot be ruled out, there remains the possibility that the observed disparities are driven by dis-crimination, which could be either statistical or preference based. Themechanism for preference-based discrimination might well be implicitbiases such as racial disparities in empathy that drive selective leniencyrather than animus.

When Circa was young, she hunted and toyed with birds like many wayward Tabaxi are wont to. One day while taunting a bluebird she had wounded, Circa was set upon by a monster. The monster wounded her and for the first time she found herself the prey of her own cruel games. As the monster reared for the killing blow, the bluebird burst forth, driving off the monster and saving Circa's life before succumbing to its wounds. The bluebird's sacrifice made Circa realize the nobility and courage of her erstwhile prey, so to repent for her sordid past and repay her life debt, she pledged to serve as a protector and helper of avians. Since that day, she has aided many birds, learning their songs and asking for naught in return for her services but a single crest, freely given. Her cloak now bears countless multicolored feathers, tokens of her transformation, but for a single exquisite blue plume that she wears on a headband. In cities and towns, she makes different use of her skills, imitating splendid birdsongs for coin. Over time, she has discovered the true power of these songs, learning how they can help allies and hinder enemies. She now seeks out new and powerful bird songs to expand her repertoire.",1596240085

If you go refractor then you'll see names like Takahashi with corresponding prices. It's tough to research right now because there's no substitute for looking through different scopes but with the social distancing all the clubs I know of have stopped their star parties where you can just drop in and look through different scopes.

I read every topic of interest at Cloudy Nights as I started researching my first scope and that's a great place to get different opinions on the pros and cons of different types of scopes.

Be sure you know what you want to do with your scope, I see a ton of people say that they want to look at things and see them the best and then be able to take pictures. AP and visual have almost exactly opposite requirements for what is needed so it's near impossible to find a scope that does both well. I mention that because you said you're a photographer but didn't specify if you want to do visual or AP.

Boy I'm kinda getting my ass beat. I could use a pick me up.

I know! Imma mix my uppers *and* my downers. Or at least what passes for uppers and downers with me, a risk averse white boy. Because even though this is booze, it is also very very much caffeine. This is the sorta drink that makes you feel like electricity at the end of it.

Ingredients:

- Three shot glasses of espresso
- 2 oz of Vodka (My roommate bought Titos. *Titos*. Unreal how good he is to me.)
- 1 oz of coffee liquer (Kaluha will get you where you wanna be, but my weapon of choice is Mr Black Cold Brew Coffee Liqueur)
- 1/2 to 3/4 oz of simple syrup. I like my coffee coffee, personally
- Like a barspoon or two of dry Vermouth. Don't go overboard.

Rcipe:

Get it all in a shaker with a ton of ice and shake the absolute shit out of it. Just got to town on that motherfucker.

Don't have an espresso machine? Me either. Drinks like this are why I keep instant espresso powder. Just boil some water and add it until it feels like coffee on steroids. Or just make coffee and call it an espresso martini anyway. I'm not your dad. 

Review:

Do you like coffee? Then you'l like this. It's boozy enough to remind you that it is, in fact, alcohol. But it's mostly up front, aggressive coffee that *will* perk you back up in a hurry. I'm feeling a little refreshed already and I""m pretty druink at this point.

Be careful though; this tastes way less boozy than it is. Like, you can tell it's alcohol, but it's deciptely easy to put back. I have a feeling my next post is gonna be either real fun ro real stupid .",1596240085

I do wonder if they were apart of Mossad, especially with the allegations that Epstein was an informant. Could be why he was ‚Äúsuicided.‚Äù

Additionally, I find the timing of Maxwell‚Äôs arrest and document release to be interesting. There‚Äôs so much going on and I do believe that all of this Epstein/Maxwell shenanigans is a distraction. From what? I don‚Äôt know. 

What I do know is that nothing will happen with this case.",1596240086

"Sudan","t5_2qvpt","**TL;DR:** **The Nubian languages probably come from Darfur-Kordofan, Hill Nubian speakers are probably migrants to the Nuba Mountains during the period of Nubian political dominance from Aswan to Kosti, not refugees of the fallen Christian Nubian kingdoms.**

&gt;this just leaves me more confused on how these people came to develop these languages in isolation

They weren't developed in isolation, the article says this:

&gt;*We are very confident that Nobiin (and later Dongolawi) came to the Nile from a centre of dispersion in Darfur-Kordofan which they occupied and controlled for perhaps 4000 years. We  know that there were Nubian speakers on the Nile at least as  early as the 500s CE  and probably much earlier. The fact that the Hill  Nubian languages have words  for the days of the week dating back to  Christian Nubian indicates that these  languages were in contact at  least during the Christian Nubian period which  probably covers 500 CE -  1400 CE. This does not necessarily mean that the Hill  Nubians did more  than expand from central Kordofan into the Nuba Mountains during the  period of Nubian  political dominance from Aswan to Kosti (at least).  But given the  location of the Hill Nubian speakers (Dair, Dilling,  Karko etc) along the NE  edge of the Mountains it appears that they were  ""incomers"" settling  among the existing Nyima and Temein groups who  were there before them.*

In other words: the Nubian languages likely don't originate from the Nile, but rather some place in Darfur-Kordofan (which makes a lot of sense, seeing that the Nubian langauges are the only Nilo-Saharan languages in a region dominated by Afroasiatic languages). Hill Nubian speakers are likely immigrants from a Nubian kingdom, but the idea that they migrated during the fall of Christian Nubia is unsupported by evidence.

**Edit:** As far as maintaining similarity with Nile Nubian, that's not particularly uncommon or odd. Numbers and common words usually tend to remain very close across related languages even if they split a long time ago. I'd look at the Indo-European vocabulary page on Wikipedia for examples of this.

This also shows that not all Nuba have links to the Nubians, and in the case of this article, the argument is that most Nuba don't.",1596240087

I believe the most cutting edge method is to start with pill form and when you reach tanner stage 3 to switch to injectables, and then add a smaller amount of pills much later if you're not satisfied yet and want to go even further.

Meanwhile he left his wife at home for years to manage things (Dr. Benjamin Rush wrote in his journals that meeting Franklin was a disappointment, partially because his mother was friends and neighbors with Mrs. Franklin, and when Rush to met him he was, uh, carousing). Then of course he played diplomat in France during the war, eating well and growing fat while Americans died and starved.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","To my knowledge there isn't an official ruling on the interaction, so talk to your GM if you're a player.

Purely off RAW you'd probably have to burn two uses of the SLA, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 cold damage, and then you have some extra charges that you can deliver as a touch attack as normal but that wouldn't interact with conductive.  Since that's a pretty underwhelming interaction, it wouldn't be unreasonable to allow conductive to only burn one SLA use and deliver the extra charges (still once per round), consuming two charges per hit.  So if you had a CL of 4 (getting 4 charges per cast), on round one you could use conductive to trigger the SLA (generating 4 charges) and deal 1d6 cold damage (consuming 2 charges) and then on the following round deal another 1d6 on hit, consuming the rest of the charges.

Or (since that doesn't line up as well with odd CLs) have conductive consume charges at the normal rate (1 charge per 1d6 damage), but require burning two uses of the SLA for the initial triggering.

Those would both be houserulings though.",1596240089

And as far as detaining him, they could have at extra risk to themselves. At the time, on the ""he has a gun/he doesn't have a gun"" scale, I'm sure they're leaning towards he has a gun since that's what the report was. An officer could have advanced and detained while the other two covered(I'm hearing there are 3 officers, 2 with guns, 1 with impact). But you would either lose half of your lethal force or all your non-lethal force as well as putting the advancing officer in a cross fire(if they're spread around) as well as putting them at more risk if he resisted, does pull out a weapon. Vs him just stepping away from the vehicle. Obviously it was a tense situation and looking back we can critique both sides. I feel the bean bag round is the catalyst. But I also don't know how I feel about it.

Firstly, thank you for asking the question and wanting to understand. 

This is a painting that is glorifying the forced removal of indigenous peoples from their homes so that we could drop bombs on them. It's the Polynesian version of the trail of tears. Stick calamity Jane in a bikini in front of picture of a trail of tears graveyard and you get some kind of idea of what we're looking at here. A more extreme version would be a German woman dancing in a dirndl in front of Auschwitz, but you get the general idea. It's trying to find fun (or should I say, that aloha spirit!) in an atrocity. 

And before anyone tries to claim that it's entirely clear it's satire, or making a point about absurdity, unless you explicitly present that context (I can't see it here, can you?) then it's not doing any of those things, it's just awful. 

Tiki in general needs to take a long hard look at itself and reckon with its colonialist roots.

Lastly, if people want to argue with me, please go ahead but I'm not here for that and won't reply, I'm sure there's a sub for people who want to have fights about this sorta stuff on the internet. Happy to try to explain better, but life's too short to fight.",1596240090

Yes QE knew, no she's not tasked with keeping it a secret any more than anyone else.

We're thinking about her this way because she's royalty and rich, but in reality most families would act this way to protect their names.

Where I live there was a series of brutal assaultrapes over a few months/a year (long time ago, hard to remember exactly), guy wasn't caught for a long time. When he was caught it slowly started to become clear that his family *must* have known it was him. No one turned him in or said anything; they got him on DNA.

Don't blame the Queen for doing what most others do just because she has more resources to do so with.

I understand that this argument won't sit well with some, but I think it's annoying that we keep treating well off public people as if they're supposed to be better than the rest of us plebs while at the same time disliking them for being well off.

It's like... ""Oh yeah you're rich aren't you eh? Well you better act on strict moral principles or I'm going to grab a pitchfork! Now excuse me while I go bang everything with a pulse or other things you're not allowed to do but I am!""

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Depends on the game.

If I'm running Dungeons &amp; Dragons, having interesting fights is part of the deal, because that's the main thing the ruleset offers. Interesting fights are usually going to be ""challenging"" - meaning they pc's can win or lose, and that the difference depends at least largely on the player's decisions. How this is achieved varies by edition, although 13th Age's rule for running away (if all players agree, the pc's run away successfully) is my favorite version. 

Not doing that is ignoring a major type of fun the players probably signed up for. (And if they didn't I'd've suggested other games in session 0.)

In a game that's, well, not DnD the assumptions change again. Unwinnable battles are pretty much necessary to make Masks: A New Generation work, IMO.",1596240092

"DarK","t5_2qj1h","I took it as a straightforward conclusion when I first watched that final episode. But the argument that they haven't really destroyed the knot is pretty persuasive. From the writers' point of view they obviously wrote it to allow both interpretations.

My main point though is that the show wasn't created to explore the possibility of time travel and how it might work. The show was created to explore themes of guilt, regret, hope, free will and a ton of other things. Time travel is just a mechanism to explore those things in a way that's original and opens up creative possibilities.

At a certain point you either accept that the way time travel is presented is credible *enough* for you to go along with or it isn't. I don't get people watching 26 episodes of a show where a boy travels from 2019 to 1986 through a spooky cave in episode 2 and are still moaning about whether it's believable 24 episodes later. Of course it isn't. It's ridiculous.

The show works because the characters are fascinating, the themes are compelling and the story-telling is brilliantly executed. The explanation of time travel is just 'ok, that's how it works in this story. let's get to the interesting stuff'.",1596240094

The below items were in the Heroes Act and I do not believe a soul here cares about any of it. We cared about the $600 and the eviction moratorium and she just blocked it.

Heroes Act just a few of the items... Juvenile Justice grants, unrelated Army Corps of Engineers projects, broadband access subsidies, Federal Aviation Administration grants for sustainable aviation fuel development, a ‚Äúcash for clunkers‚Äù program for airplanes, a permanent expansion of Affordable Care Act premium subsidies, a technology modernization fund for the federal government, as well as additional funds for the Kennedy Center, National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yeah I‚Äôm really not arguing with you here but the truth of the matter is that it isn‚Äôt black and white. 

Cops are necessary. Crime is a reality. 

Do I think investing in localities and communities by means of community centers, programs to educate and facilitate not only personal but community growth, and general infrastructure is going to help more than ‚Äúthrowing money at cops?‚Äù Absolutely. But at the end of the day, the reason ‚Äúmore money for cops‚Äù is even a discussion (in my honest opinion) is because they aren‚Äôt paid enough for the work they do. 

Now, could that be because police departments don‚Äôt spend money on payroll and instead spend it on the newest tech? Maybe? I don‚Äôt know. Would have to look. But anyone who makes the argument for either side deserves to be heard out instead of dismissed. 

I, myself, think we need to invest in communities by ways described above, and put pressure and a watchful eye on police departments to provide an income that is proportional to the duty officers serve. Not spend money on military grade weapons and tech. 

Smarter spending. Is that too much to ask?",1596240095

ÔΩ¢Stand UserÔΩ£ Jovi Marley

ÔΩ¢Stand NameÔΩ£Nature's Child

Stand Ability:Nature's child can control all plantlife in a 50 meter radius, meaning it can make plants grow at an exelerated rate and manipulate plants freely. It also uses it's right arm as a strong whip or by wrapping into a ball it can be used as a club. Over time Nature's child can also regenerate both itself and Jovi from almost any wound. Finaly if it opens it's mouth it will release a spore that if inhailed by it will put anyone to sleep in seconds and the spores will spread to a radius of 21 meters. 

Drawbacks:
If Nature's Child isn't watered regularly and doesn't get enough sunlight, it will become so weak that the most it would be able to do is float around.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I hope you'll read through the many comments here offering you unbiased information about bra shopping.

Whether or not you think $85 - $90 each is an unreasonable price to pay for a bra is entirely irrelevant. If that's the average price for the five ITEMS OF SOMEONE ELSE'S PERSONAL PROPERTY that your 15 year old son CUT, DYED, AND TURNED INTO SLINGSHOTS, then $450 is what he owes to replace those items. If he doesn't have all of the money available, it's your responsibility, as the parent of a minor, to make up the difference. 

How or whether you expect him to pay you back is your problem. 

I hope you also PAY ATTENTION to the many comments showing concern about this behavior of your son. A young man of his age is well aware that it is not appropriate to mistreat someone else's personal property. That he did this with your stepdaughter's bras (which are labeled as ""intimate wear"" by most retailers who sell them) is a detail which you, as a responsible parent, must address. 

How did he get his hands on her bras? Was he in her bedroom? Did he go through her laundry? Her dresser drawers? Why did he do this? Why did he do this with HER bras, but not your wife's? Did he do anything else with her bras besides this video project? Has he done anything with any of her panties or anything else that belongs to her? If he needed bras for this project and he'd had the good sense to leave her property alone, he might have asked for help obtaining some inexpensive bras to use for his video ... why did this not happen? These are some of the questions you, as a responsible parent, will want to ask him. 

The price of your stepdaughter's bras is really a very small detail here.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a couple tips to minimize your risks when trading:

1. Do not discuss trades over PM or chat. This is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.), as scammers often contact other users privately to avoid having their actions seen in public. Please report anyone violating this rule to the moderators. 
2. You must have been granted [Pok√© ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades) to make trades with shiny or event Pok√©mon. If you have sufficient flair and are trading shiny or event Pok√©mon, please make sure that your post and other users‚Äô offers contain the full details required by the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules). This is to provide more visibility so you know how the Pok√©mon you are trading (for) was obtained. If you see any posts that do not have the full details, please report them so that the moderators can be aware of the situation.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I think your opinion makes sense in a post-homophobic world, but we're nowhere near that world currently. Queer people go through a lot, some more than others depending on where they come from. If they're proud of their sexuality, it is often because they survived being harassed, persecuted, disowned, shunned, and/or judged. This shared collective trauma has brought LGBT people together for survival, security, and comfort, and it only makes sense that a community forged under such circumstances would develop its own cultural idiosyncrasies. What's more, a great deal of ""gay culture"" has a rich historical context. Consider pride parade, where divergent sexuality is presented at its most flamboyant. That flamboyance is a deliberate construction stemming in abject defiance of societal pressures on the queer to hide from the public eye.",1596240098

IMHO they went nationwide-full-lockdown too early. 90% of the cases were in Buenos Aires. Imagine going full-lockdown for two months, having a grand total of 38 cases during that time (out of 300.000 hab, so people did behave) and then when they start relaxing the lockdown, cases start showing up again and they threaten to go back at square one (and after all that time the healthcare system is still about to collapse after just weeks of relaxing).

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","The banks are a major problem, but not the only one. Banks don't make people take their places off the long term rental market and into AirBnB...thus making life hell for the neighbors in addition to restricting access to residents. Banks don't move halfway around the world thinking they can be just as responsive to emergency request as someone local (I've literally had a landlord who without a management company moved to China...it made the AC going out in Texas an utterly miserable experience because Mr I moved to make money in China wouldnt pick up the phone or do anything). Banks don't let https://i.imgur.com/JoBh0zb.jpg become a thing.  Banks don't skimp on repairs because they're cheap. Banks don't necessarily vote against affordable housing (that'll be NIMBYs) because it will affect property values. There's a whole lot wrong with landlording even without banks. The ownership class, which by definition includes landlords need to have a renter class to sustain themselves. This is why so many renters have no choice but to continue renting.

Regular people aren't equipped to be landlords by any stretch of the imagination. The average person is a fucking idiot.. which includes landlords. The problem I have, is that if they're not responsible for their decisions, then who is? The banks certainly aren't. They just lend you money and let wash their hands of it (see 2008), and as you're implying landlords are just middleman for the bank. What actual skill do they provide society?",1596240099

Not the first time I had walked through these doors to see the sleek white interior Starbird‚Äôs innovative new private hospital. A spacious reception greeted me,  and I started my approach over to the desk. White coats and white smiles were all around me speaking with other patients. They looked to be mostly older folk, I spotted maybe one or two others that looked to be around my 36 years young. While some may have had the wealth needed to be here on other medical business, I would bet my life‚Äôs fortune that nine out of ten were here for the same reason I was, and that‚Äôs to get a dose of MM.

The ‚Äò*Miracle Mineral‚Äô* they had coined it a couple years back. Starbird had started off as a new spaceflight startup hoping to catch the boom of commercialised space flight. They soon swerved into the business of mining asteroids after getting a huge injection of cash from a private investor. I remember seeing it go around the news sites making headlines when it took off and started making real progress. Progress not seen since commercial space flight had been in its infancy. Things had gone quiet for them. Well, that was until news outlets picked up on them again citing leaks from within the company that they had found something on one of the asteroids that would change how we viewed the world. Obliviously, this had caused scandal and conspiracy to spread like wildfire, yet when the dust had settled it turned out to only be a new form of mineral. Personally, I'd hoped we had finally found evidence of life out there in the great big, endlessness of space. A new kind of space rock could be exciting to some, I guess, but it was a bit of a let down for my friends and I who‚Äôd spent the better part of two weeks taking wild guesses at what it could have possibly been. However, what they had managed to do with this new mineral they had found since then really had changed things. This mineral has been able to help life on earth accelerate the body's ability to heal. How crazy is that? I remember reading something about how they had recorded it's affects on the heart, liver and blood but I can‚Äôt talk at length on that, I‚Äôm no medical professional. I‚Äôm just here to see out my course of MM and hope this thing really can keep my autoimmune diseases in remission.

Anyway, here I am looking around me and reminiscing about how all this had started, still waiting for the receptionist to finish up her call. As I look back from my glance around the room, she smiles at me.

‚ÄúSorry about that, can I get your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúRoger Stoke, here for an MM infusion.‚Äù I said to her, smiling back. She had a nice smile.

She made a few clicks of her mouse before looking up from her computer again.

‚ÄúOk just a sec‚Ä¶.yep ok that‚Äôs you now, if you make your way down the hall on the right and it will be room five.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I made my way across the reception and down to the hall I‚Äôd explored on my previous visits. Coming my pointed room, I knocked the door, waiting just a moment before grabbing for the door handle and making my way in.

‚ÄúAfternoon, doc‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, Roger, hullo. Here for another dose of the good stuff?‚Äù Doctor Rami held out an arm directing me to a chair. It was a hybrid looking thing, a cross between a desk chair and a hospital bed. Real comfortable though.

I bobbed my head  up and down in acknowledgement as I made my way over to the chair, placed to the side of the room.

‚ÄúYeah, the letter said one or two more doses and I should be good. How‚Äôs things?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, all good. How have you been feeling?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, real good. This stuff has been working for me.‚Äù

Dr Rami lowered his brow at me with a something of smirk, ‚ÄúIt happens to be working that way for a lot of folks, let‚Äôs get you started.‚Äù

Before I knew it I had the cannula in, the bag of MM solution was hooked up and pumping into my bloodstream. Dr Rami had said his goodbyes and that was likely the last I would see of him after my many sessions here at Roost. Five minutes went by  before I started feeling off. Initially, I wasn‚Äôt sure if anything was even wrong at first, but the fact I was asking the question in my mind ‚ÄúWait, is something happening?‚Äù had me worried. I had read the warning sheet they gave you to look over the first time I got treated, but never thought anything of it, they said it was precautionary.

I shouted out to the hall and squeezed my alarm bell ‚ÄúHey, I think something is happening with me!‚Äù

It only took seconds. Anxiety took a bite at my chest as the world started tilting on a strange axis, but fear froze me to the spot as the edges of all the objects in the room and surfaces began pulsing with a green hue. I tried to calm myself by controlling my breathing. I noticed how I was crushing the alarm in my hand, hoping a nurse would come rushing through the door already and save me. I took a glance over to the door, then at the alarm in my hand. My heart plummeted through my guts as I stared down at my blue arm. Arms. Both my arms were blue. I sucked in air only to have my senses assaulted by an overwhelming, sterile smell of the room around me. Hot, goopy saliva escaped my mouth, bubbling down my chin. It burned. I hadn‚Äôt noticed how thick my tongue felt, it started itching so strongly I took a hard bite down on it. *What the fuck is happening?*

I looked towards the hallway. ‚ÄúHELP! Help! I need help!‚Äù

I heard a nurse echo my cry before she came speeding into my room a second later. She turned to look at me. And pulled up short. Her shouts for help turned into an incoherent squeal as her body reeled away from me. I looked into her eyes begging for help. She looked into mine. Was she begging too? She looks so afraid.

*Oh god, what‚Äôs happening.*

To me that's an obvious need for a manufacturer with strong branding. And especially so if it's the manufacturer who you know invented the (combustion engine) car. 

I don't disagree with this. If Mercedes-Benz can (and wants to) sell electric vehicles to people there will be more EVs to chose from and more factories potentially building them.

In addition, take a glance at the past: Daimler previously sold their EVs not under the Mercedes-Benz brand at all, they outsourced their electric cars to the smart city car brand.

In this case it means the dev team spent a short amount of time porting over the game to the Series X, and added a few extra details onto the port. As for what exactly, check the Digital Foundry reciew. I have neither the time nor the patience to respond any further than I will be doing in this post.

Also, Digital Foundry do pixel counts. If they were rendering at a lower resolution it would be called out on immedietly.

One of my (male) librarian colleagues knew him from he worked at the local CCC, so the student used to show up in the staff office area to talk to him often, and then that turned into creeping around the office area all the time, because everyone else up there was women.  And evolved into just walking into offices, sitting down, refusing to leave, etc.  And at the time, all the supervisors were men and were like ""he is harmless, he just doesn't understand.""  So we banded together and went to the University Police, who agreed it was a problem and had a chat with him.   

It turned out he was in the process of getting a job in the library, which would have given him even more staff area access.  That ended quickly.",1596240102

A modewn exampwe of one such poem is the 1999 epic¬†Aww Staw, wwitten by the bawd Smashmouth. Hewe we wiww intewpwet the message of this piece and undewstand why this song must be sung untiw mankind no wongew has the voice to sing it.

**""Somebody once towd me the wowwd is gonna woww me / I ain't the shawpest toow in the shed""**

Ouw hewo wives a simpwe wife. A fawm wife. He is hewd back by the wimits of his smaww town and his pewceived wack of intewwigence.

**""She was wooking kind of dumb with hew fingew and hew thumb in the shape of an W on hew fowehead""**

He meets a witch, who is mute. Using hand signaws, she makes the symbow 'W' fow Wawazawus, signawing death and webiwth. His fawm wife ovew, he must now wise fwom the ashes of his duww existence and become the hewo he is destined to be.

**""You'ww nevew know if you don't go, you'ww nevew shine if you don't gwow""**

Ouw hewo is cawwed to action. The jouwney wiww be difficuwt, but if he does not accept, he stands to wose the wand he woves and the ""shining"" futuwe pwomised to him by the witch.

**""Hey now, you'we an aww staw, get youw game on, go pway**  
 **Hey now, you'we a wock staw, get youw show on, get paid**  
 **Aww that gwittews is gowd**  
 **Onwy shooting staws bweak the mowd""**

Ouw hewo accepts that he is the ""Aww Staw"" of wegend, but the demon he must face is powewfuw, both with magic and with wiches. In owdew to defeat the demon, he must wiewd the powew of a 'shooting staw.'

**""It's a coow pwace, and they say it gets cowdew / You'we bundwed up now, wait 'tiw you get owdew""**

Awwiving at the tempwe of the demon, he is hit by a bwast of wintew magic that neawwy kiwws him‚Äîaging him at an accewewated wate.

**""The ice we skate is getting pwetty thin / The watew's getting wawm so you might as weww swim""**

Summoning a magic powew he did not know he possessed, the Aww Staw mewts the ice of the demon. The demon pwunges into a wake and is defeated.

**""My wowwd's on fiwe, how about youws? / That's the way I wike it and I'ww nevew get bowed""**

The Aww Staw, having fweed the kingdom fwom the Ice Demon, now takes his pwace at the thwone. Becoming a weadew wiww be stwessfuw but he wewcomes the chawwenge. His wife wiww no wongew be wuwaw and duww.

**""Hey now, you'we an aww staw, get youw game on, go pway‚Ä¶""**

The chowus is wepeated hewe, but with new meaning. The Aww Staw, gazing out upon the wiches of his vast kingdom, weawizes that none of this matewiaw wowwd is of any consequence.

I've decided it has to be a keeper, the reason is it can do this sort of thing effortlessly. This is a 6 minute video but if you have the patience to listen all the way through there's a lot of change and evolution present. This is a single patch, all I'm doing it while playing is adjusting the virtual mod wheel and the levels of the three oscillators. Yet there's so much change in the  sound. And I don't know what other (hardware) synth I could use to get this sci-fi soundscape.   
I have a Virus TI which is excellent, and excels at deep space dark ambiences, but I find it doesn't have the same level of evolution of a single patch which the Iridium does. I also have the Wavestate which is great for constantly evolving soundscapes, but they tend to sound much more new-age.

The Iridium is like the darkness from the TI combined with the evolution possible with the Wavestate.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","The Odyssey. The Iliad. The Epic of Gilgamesh.¬†These classic epic poems have been told and retold for centuries because their messages about the human experience continue to resonate. Stories of true heroism remind us of the bravery we are all capable of.

A modern example of one such poem is the 1999 epic¬†All Star, written by the bard Smashmouth. Here we will interpret the message of this piece and understand why this song must be sung until mankind no longer has the voice to sing it.

**""Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me / I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed""**

Our hero lives a simple life. A farm life. He is held back by the limits of his small town and his perceived lack of intelligence.

**""She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on her forehead""**

He meets a witch, who is mute. Using hand signals, she makes the symbol 'L' for Larazarus, signaling death and rebirth. His farm life over, he must now rise from the ashes of his dull existence and become the hero he is destined to be.

**""You'll never know if you don't go, you'll never shine if you don't glow""**

Our hero is called to action. The journey will be difficult, but if he does not accept, he stands to lose the land he loves and the ""shining"" future promised to him by the witch.

**""Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play**  
 **Hey now, you're a rock star, get your show on, get paid**  
 **All that glitters is gold**  
 **Only shooting stars break the mold""**

Our hero accepts that he is the ""All Star"" of legend, but the demon he must face is powerful, both with magic and with riches. In order to defeat the demon, he must wield the power of a 'shooting star.'

**""It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder / You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older""**

Arriving at the temple of the demon, he is hit by a blast of winter magic that nearly kills him‚Äîaging him at an accelerated rate.

**""The ice we skate is getting pretty thin / The water's getting warm so you might as well swim""**

Summoning a magic power he did not know he possessed, the All Star melts the ice of the demon. The demon plunges into a lake and is defeated.

**""My world's on fire, how about yours? / That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored""**

The All Star, having freed the kingdom from the Ice Demon, now takes his place at the throne. Becoming a leader will be stressful but he welcomes the challenge. His life will no longer be rural and dull.

**""Hey now, you're an all star, get your game on, go play‚Ä¶""**

The chorus is repeated here, but with new meaning. The All Star, gazing out upon the riches of his vast kingdom, realizes that none of this material world is of any consequence.

The ""shooting star"" power lay within him all along.",1596240105

"eupersonalfinance","t5_2w5jv","DCA is a strategy that can only exist if you have a lump sum you would be able to invest. People who invest a percentage of their salary every month are not dollar cost averaging, they are simply investing since a lump sum is not an option.

Also one of the essential parts to understand is that investing and intuition don't mesh well. And more often than not when investing, intuition is counterproductive. 

BTW IB for 100k + accounts is amazing. 

The usual recommendation would be to look what you would need your money for. An emergency fund of 3 to 6 months of all expenses should be a given. Then I would think about paying any high interest loans and finally mortgage if it makes you sleep better at night
Mathematically however mortgage does not make much sense compared to expected market returns.

Then I would look at your countries tax system. What are your investment vehicles. For example I'd never recommend an Irish resident to invest in ETFs.

If investing into ETFs is efficient I'd look how dividends and accumulating funds are taxed. Finally I would take something very diverse such as VWRL or Vwce, depending on the previous point obviously.

Finally I'd look at bonds. They clearly don't have amazing returns but they might me a pretty good staple for your portfolio since they fluctuate much less in value. The bond fund can be hedged to euro. So something like vagf or vage. Depending on your risk tolerance you could go up to 50% if you're a retiree. 

Finally I'd just lump sum it.

Among the three entry strategies into the market dca is by far the worst. Then you have value averaging and finally you have lump sum which has by far the best outcomes.

As counterintuitive as it may sound but dca also underperforms lump sum during bear markets after the initial 10% drop.

Once invested I would not check the account once a year and consider it a set and forget. 

Obviously it's up to you so you should feel comfortable. If you want to enter the market gradually, which I would advise you against the set a fixed date and like a machine invest everything before reaching it in a disciplined manner.",1596240105

These classic üéû epic üòé poems üíå have been told üó£ and retold for centuries üë¥ because their messages üí¨ about the human üßí experience üß† continue ‚è© to resonate. Stories üìñ of true üíØ heroism remind üôå us üá®üá≥ of the bravery üò§ we are all üë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëäüèøüëÄ capable ‚úÖ of. 

A modern üñ• example ü•∞‚ù§üßö of one ‚òù such poem üíå is the 1999 üóì epic üò± All ü§† Star ‚ú®, written ‚òπ by the bard Smashmouth. Here we will interpret the message üí¨ of this piece üß© and understand ü§î why ‚ùì this song üó£ must üîí be sung üé∂ until mankind üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ no üö´ longer üçÜ has the voice üó£ to sing üó£ it. 

**""Somebody üôä once told üòÉ me the world üåèüí´ is gonna roll üé≤ me / I ‚òù ain't üôäüôâ the sharpest tool üî¨ in the shed üë©""** 

Our hero ü¶∏ lives üíì a simple üòÑ life üë§. A farm üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ life üë§. He üßí is held üõë back üîô by the limits üßëüèº of his üëã small ü§è town üèò and his üëã perceived üí≤üëèüèΩüôãüèª lack üò§ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è of intelligence üß†ü§™ü§ñ.

He üë® meets ü§ù a witch üéÖüèø, who is mute. Using hand üôå signals ü§¢üò†üò°, she üë© makes üõ† the symbol ü§£ 'L' üòÇ for Larazarus, signaling ü§¢üò†üò° death üíÄ and rebirth.

Our hero üèÖüèÜ is called ‚òÅ to action üòâ. The journey üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è will be difficult üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, but üçë‚ùì if he üë®üèæ does not accept ü§ù, he üë® stands üöπ to lose ‚ùå the land üèñ he üßí loves üòç and the ""shining ü¶∂ü¶µüèª"" future üë®üèº promised üíØüòé to him üë®üèæ by the witch üéÖüèø.

Our hero üèÖüèÜ accepts üòï that he üë® is the ""All üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Star ‚≠ê"" of legend ü•µüíúüñ§, but üçë the demon üíï he üë®üèæ must ü§ú face üòÄ is powerful üëÅüí™üëÑ, both with magic üåà and with riches üí≤.

Arriving üöò at the temple üèØ of the demon üíï, he üë® is hit üëä by a blast üí•üéÜüéá of winter ‚ùÑ‚õÑ‚òÅ magic ‚ú® that nearly üçÜ kills üî™ him‚Äîaging him üë®üèæ at an accelerated rate üìâ.

Summoning a magic üé©üí´ power üí™ he üßí did not know ü§î he üë®üèæ possessed üëª, the All üë≥üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëäüèøüëÄ Star ‚ú® melts üí¶ the ice ‚ùÑ of the demon ü§∞üëπ. The demon üíï plunges into a lake üåä and is defeated.

The All üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Star ‚ú®, having freed üîë the kingdom ü§¥ from the Ice ‚ùÑ Demon üòà, now takes üëä his üëã place üèÜ at the throne üöΩ.

**""Hey üëã now, you're an all üò≥ star ‚≠ê, get your üëâ game üé± on, go üèÉ play‚Ä¶""** 

The chorus üé∂ is repeated here, but üçë with new üíØ meaning üòè. The All üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Star ‚ú®, gazing üëÄ out upon üë¶ the riches üí≤ of his üëã vast üíµ kingdom ü§¥, realizes üëÄ that none ‚ùå of this material ‚ô¶ world üåèüí´ is of any consequence üíÄ.

Scared, and scarred for my life. This is not a hotel, this is a hostel. You need to read this whole review.
Washrooms are shared with 3 other guests staying in the same corridor as you, however the rooms are ""private.""
A room with a private washroom will ring up to about $105 - may as well stay somewhere more luxurious after the $40 deposit. $145 down the drain.
Every couple weekends, there would be no-wifi, as if they're not ontop of the bills. One time for a period of 4 days we had no water in the room, and another time no power in the room for 3 days. Refunds were never given, however we did pay a discounted rate for the long term stay. They dont offer this anymore.
Myself and my partner unfortunately stayed here during their off-season when less tourists come around, from February, however we had extended all the way to June, because of toronto's crazy Rental Market.
Three deaths at the hotel, one each month. According to management, 2 overdoses and a suicide. Sure does make me feel safe. I wonder to this day if those were just cover-ups, especially as one night, after the hotels office hours, a man, 5'8, black and never seen before unlocked our hotel room in the middle of the night and somehow had a hold of the key, but we startled him, and he ran off.
From this day forward we barricaded the door with the bed, and dresser so the door absolutely could not open. This was the most terrifying experience I've ever lived. DO NOT STAY HERE. FIND SOMEWHERE SAFE.

That some random ""terrorists"" would be arrested was expected, Lukashenko was doing this before every election. The new thing here is that actual terrorists were caught and now Russia is dissatisfied.

However, that being said it wasn‚Äôt free of outside pressures by any means. In High School, there was a lobbyist program by oil and tech companies where they would give teachers up to a 25% bonus depending on how well kids did in class. This led to a lot of kids being pressured into classes they couldn‚Äôt handle just so the teachers could make money off of their students. And this led to a bigger divide between the haves and have nots in the student body.

I'm always so exhausted during the day, the pain and the dizziness makes it impossible for me to go out and do things (thankfully my boyfriend and I are homebodies and gamers so that's not a *huge* deal), and the pain during sex is... Infuriating. I've gotten that checked out multiple times and my doctor thinks it's gastro-related but... I don't know.

The other issue is industries like construction which showd closure of one large site in the CBD yesterday. We have also been told distribution, healthcare and other essential industries are being hit. 

This number feels inline with the upwards trends we are seeing. I think lockdown and masks are working in the community, but these sectors are keeping it alive.

He's a paranoid schizophrenic with bipolar disorder, he was in and out of the system since he was nine yrs old although the schizophrenia didn't come on to his later mid 20's and the bipolar after the prison stint.

He lives alone, talks to very few people and is musically gifted, he plays guitar masterfully and sings just as well.

EDIT: The book is called Jewel Thief by Claire Thompson.  I am pasting the correct link but it‚Äôs leading me to Hellcat‚Äôs Bounty no matter what I do!!  The link even says jewel thief in the string!!

Summary from GR:

&gt; Julia sees the perfect opportunity for a jewel heist when she attends a party at the home of Benjamin Payton, one of the most eligible bachelors in Westchester County. Slated to be out of town during the break in, his unexpected return puts Julia in a dangerous predicament.

&gt; Entranced by the lovely jewel thief, Benjamin offers her a choice‚Äîbe handed over to the authorities and face certain prison time, or submit sexually to him for one week. Julia sees no way out‚Äîshe must agree to his terms in return for his silence.

&gt; What she doesn‚Äôt count on is a crash course in erotic submission and BDSM. Bound and whipped, chained and used, Julia comes face to face with unexplored submissive yearnings. The man who begins as her captor and tormentor evolves into something much more as the two of them discover secrets about themselves that will either tear them apart or forge something unexpected and powerful between them.",1596240110

The next step usually involves a down payment loan that is mis-labeled as a gift, and some forged or false statements to the mortgage bank about your income.

&gt;not actually living there and such

Banks give different rates to people who live in the house because they are typically more motivated to pay the loan than people who bought the house as an investment. 

Your mother's plan is common.  It's also both tax fraud and mortgage fraud in several ways.   The worst outcomes are foreclosure, fines, and even jail, for both of you.

Shooting down enemy planes helps, of course. It's pivotal to winning a match but it's only half of it. I've lost games because I was, quite literally, **the only guy** going for the objective while the enemy team had multiple guys doing ground pounding and my team was a bunch of fighter knobheads circlejerking with enemy fighters in a giant fucking mothball from hell.

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","There a multiple things and even right now I can't remember what the video said, but I can you tell you the following (and is long):

- Open world: The biggest selling point of the game is its open world, which is a lie. If you see the map it looks huge, but the true is that most of that are hills and pieces of land that you can't reach. Specially the most southern part, you only cross a huge tunnel until you reach a lighthouse and that's it. There's also the fact that you can't really explore it as you would like, since most of it it's out of limit until you advance the story. I'm not joking when I say that I mostly advance the main plot so I could go to new parts of the map to keep doing sidequests.

- It's empty: Despite the fact that the open world is a lie, the true is that it's still big. Big and empty. There's only one two big cities in the whole game: one that you never explore and one that you only visit once. There's a mid size city that doesn't have much going on to beging with and the rest are gas station (and one restaurant/dock). It honestly feels like the whole population lives either in those 3 cities or in third rates hotels in a shitty gas station. This also means that there aren't many npc beside random generated woman #34, which is sad because the world lacks its heart. It doesn't have a culture, a history or people to make it feel like is alive. It's not like the world of FFVII, FFX or FFXII were the world itself is amazing, magical and so full of everything that is impossible not to want to explore.

- Sidequest: I said before that the reason why I mostly kept going with the main story was because of the sidequest, but to be honest even that is extremely lacking. There's a fixed amount of npc around the world that gives you the same type of sidequest over and over again and they're either a fetch quest, to kill a monster, to take a photo or to fish. Every time you complete a quest the npc just gives you a new one. It's never ending, repetitive and doesn't add value to the plot or lore. Even the npc that are secondary characters like Cindy and Cid don't go beyond from ""now go and do this"".

- Battle system: This is one of the biggest disappointments. In theory the battle system sounds fun, but it's unpolish and just the base of what actually could be. The controls are confusing, it didn't feel as exciting as it looks and most of the time it was way too easy despite the fact that I could never control Noctis right. But okay, I will admit that in general I'm not a good gamer and I actually suck (it's the true!), but I never had so much trouble with a battle system before. And sometimes the game was way too hard because I couldn't get the controls right, but I didn't had to worry because the items are way too Op and pretty much limitless and I only had to hang out until a summon appear. And that takes me to...

- Summons: I don't get them. They're big, menacing and totally badass, but you can't control when they appear. Which is understandable because once they do they pretty much destroy everything and finish the battle. But you could be fighting for 10 minutes straight, barely hanging on for dear life and they still don't come. The worst thing is the timing, because they usually appear right when you're almost finishing the battle on your own and at that point their appearance is meaningless. Though they do look badass and I enjoyed their animation every single time.

- The cast: The main characters of FFXV is a tight group of friends that know each other way before you join their story, and it feels like it. There's a chemistry there that makes you feel left out, a backstory that you would love to know but never get a glimpse of and inside jokes that feels like you should get but never do. It gives you the feeling that you started the game 10 hours into the story and it disorienting. Yes, they made the ova anime for that, but this is vital information that is part of the plot and should be included in the game, not as an extra that probably only gamers that already like the game in the first place will bother to watch.

- Noctis: People made fun of Vaan and Penelo in FFXII for being useless, but at least they were in the middle of the story. I can't said the same for Noctis. The war, the disappearing of Lunafreya and everything that is actually part of the plot at large don't happen to Noctis. The world is falling down, but he's far away from any of that in a road trip that in comparission feels boring and underwhelming. And I don't get him. He sometimes is whiny, sometimes is brave and sometimes is scare, but not enough to actually point out a personality that I can say I actually like. It's not the same with Prompto, Ignis or Gladiolus, who are so charming, vibrant and fun. But I can't even said that Noctis is edgy, dark or emo enough to be a contrast to their personalities. He's just there, and that's boring for a main character.

- Lunafreya and Noctis: Their relationship is confusing. Everyone talks like they love each other so much, but there's something missing. It's not a lack of chemistry or that they aren't really in love, is more like they forgot chunks of pieces in the dialogue that would make their relationship make sense. For example they send each other letters and Noctis do seems to be excited to get them, and yet he doesn't react when he received the news she disappeared. She's gone for most of the games, but he doesn't seems to care or react at all about the fact that she's who knows were. Also they write each other letters, but they don't say anything meaningful to the task at hand. 

- The bad guys: The empire is evil and that's it. They don't tell you much about their intentions, their motive and they barely show the faces of the bad guys. For most of the game the empire is just the troops that appear to attack you, literally random encounters. The face you see the most is Ardyn, who appears with his act of ""I'm with the bas guys, but I'm not bad"" to help you randomly. I know that he's the main bad guy, but through the game he feels more like a joke that I couldn't believe that the main cast could fall for than this manipulative evil doer.

- The soundtrack: if there's one thing that the serie of FF does right is the soundtrack, except in FFXV. I can't recall one single piece that felt memorable. They just felt like ""random orchestal pieces #12"". I'm glad that you could play other songs from the serie while driving.

- The dialogue: If I've to hear ""Aha! i thought of a new recipe!"" one more time I will stab my ears.

- The clothes design: It's there a rule that the main cast can't use colorful clothes. They look so dark and gloomy. Even the other costumes the game has are dark, except moogle set of Noctis. I don't know why but this bothered me a lot from the get go.

In overall, FFXV feels like the raw sketchs of what could be an amazing game. It feels incomplete, empty and lackluster.

I didn't finish the game, so there's a high chance I'm missing pieces that could change my opinion of several points that I made. But I played over 30 hours and I reached the city that is like Venice (which according to the internet is pretty close to the ending), so I don't think that there's anything that could make a huge impact in me to see this game more than a disappointment.",1596240111

"dating","t5_2qhb1","A tip that has really helped me in the past: Stop dating for others and start dating for yourself. It is not primarily about others liking you (you can‚Äôt control or ensure that), it should be about you liking them and actually finding someone that‚Äôs compatible with you. This is the only area you have actual influence on.

This means for example having clear ideas about who you want to be with or not continuing to invest if they are not investing. For example if you made plans with someone and after that they do not make any effort or suggestion to meet up again, do not make the effort of investing into someone that is not investing in you. Mirror their behaviour instead and reflect on whether proactivity is important to you in a partner or not.

Most of the time, you will see that people that behave in a way that makes you feel bad actually do not possess the traits that you want in a partner. 

Best of luck to you!",1596240112

I can't tell you the terrible gut feeling I had when I went into my bank to have them transfer all funds into a new account. He didn't acknowledge that I did that and we didn't talk for years after I moved out. 

When I started talking to him again I brought that up since he wanted me join his phone plan (but I would still pay my bills to him) so I could ""save money"". He tried the same with my car insurance--for the sake of me saving money. Sure, joint plans in both cases are usually cheaper but my control and financial security is far more important than being fucked over by him again. 

Also!! If you can, get a car in your name only. That way they can't legally take it from you, tow it (if they ""lose the keys""), or prevent you from using it. You can still be on their insurance for it to be less but make sure you get the statements so you know how much your insurance is and you're not just taking their word for it.",1596240112

Super speedcross suspension, sport brakes, and elite drag tires

Elite+ clutch, 5-speed, and super showcase suspension

Max steering, min downforce, traction control off, and gas drift style

Just about all of my cars get the screw supercharger these days.  It may just be in my head, but it seems like this supercharger has way more low end than all other forced induction options.  I also always use sport brakes for transitions rather than the e-brake just to maintain my speed.  I tried drift and showcase tires, but didn't care for them much on this build.  This car doesn't score as high as my (over powered) RX-7, but it is consistent, predictable, and overall a ton of fun for a change of pace drift machine.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","You‚Äôd be eligible for both tuition fee loans and maintenance loans *if* you haven‚Äôt already had any higher education level study (things like HNCs and HNDs count). Previous HE study cuts into future entitlement (whether you were actually funded by the Student Loans Company or not). But if you stopped at A-Level and no higher, you‚Äôll have your full entitlement (in terms of number of years) intact. Everyone does (obviously assuming eligibility such as residency in the UK, etc etc).     

The basic rule is 3 years (4 in Scotland) plus one whoopsie year, to cover failures, drop-outs, etc. There‚Äôs obviously exceptions to this, but that‚Äôs the simplest way of putting it.     

Maintenance loans aren‚Äôt usually a replacement for a full time job though. Assuming no children, the max. you can get is in the region of ¬£9k per year (different inside and outside London). Again, various factors (including your age and also dependency upon your parents, if you‚Äôre under 25) affect entitlement. Live-in partners affect entitlement, but they‚Äôd have to be on big money to drag your entitlement down.     

You can run rough entitlements checks online.     

However the above is just for higher education level. If you‚Äôre talking about resitting A-levels (or equivalent, or lower), you can get help with fees, but generally little/nothing towards living costs. Most mature students would study either part time or distance though, rather than ‚Äúgoing back to college‚Äù on an everyday basis. Access to HE courses are an option too. Again, help with fees but not with living costs.     

There‚Äôs always distance learning too. The Open University is the obvious choice. It‚Äôs not the only DL provider, but it officially has no entry requirements for undergraduate study. Fee loans are issued in the same way as IRL universities (but pro rata). However, no access to a maintenance loan for DL learners (unless disabled, and other limited categories).

# Player One

[**Princess Peach**](https://i.imgur.com/4NNkuQ3.png)

The crowned monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach is both an adventurer, a thrill seeker, a professional in a great many number of sports, and a frequent kidnapping victim. She can use Heart Magic to accomplish a number of things, most notably telekinesis, flight, and the amplification of her emotions and their effects. She also has access to a number of power ups that can make her grow in size, give her the ability to throw fire, duplicate, or become a cat.

[**Spider-Man**](https://i.imgur.com/4QvLqoS.jpg)

One more time, from the top. Peter Parker was just your average every-day science geek, when he was bitten by a radioactive spider. Gifted with extraordinary powers, while Peter initially attempted to use his abilities for self-gain, when he refused to stop a mugger his Uncle Ben ended up dying for it and he learned that, well, [you know.](https://gfycat.com/BlindCompetentAiredale) The Spectacular Spider-Man has a multitude of powers that come with this transformation. Is he strong? Listen bud, with the relative strength of a spider he can lift multiple tons with ease, and he can take hits just as strong. Plus, with his preternatural ""Spider-Sense"" he can predict attacks before they happen and dodge well in time. Finally, Peter put that big brain of his to use and has developed a number of wrist-mounted gadgets, including numerous ways to shoot sticky webbing to incapacitate foes, but also such abilities as concussive force blasts, laser-activated trip mines, electrified projectiles, and drones that shoot electrified projectiles.

[**Dai Shi**](https://i.imgur.com/s9Uueb0.png)

Dai Shi is an ancient spirit that wishes for nothing more than to enslave the human race. However, centuries ago, Dai Shi was slain, and left as little more than a formless spirit trapped in a box. When he was released however, he managed to possess the body of a poor fool, seeking glory, and used their power in conjunction with his own to become a true threat to mankind once again. Dai Shi is one of the most skilled martial artists in the world, and the most powerful. And with his new body he can channel the spirit of the mighty lion, which allows him to attack from afar with projections of his own energy, and projections of his animal spirit, said mighty lion.

# Player Two

[**Donatello**](https://i.imgur.com/o0qbJrq.png)

When four turtles were dropped in some mysterious ooze, they were mutated to become part-turtle, part-human. Then trained in the art of ninjutsu by a mutant rat living in the sewers, and when they became old enough, they became... great heroes. Donatello is the team's resident tech-head, and spends much of his time tinkering with and creating different types of machinery, including his signature tech-bo staff. A quarterstaff capable of transformation with loadouts including rockets, rocket hammers, slicers, dicers, and anything else he thought to cram in there.

[**Shiki**](https://i.imgur.com/ZDTZJC7.jpg)

A founding member of the Apostles of the Stars, a terrorist organization, Shiki seeks revenge against the secret organization that controls everything in the world, as they are the organization responsible for defeating the clan of Taoists that they hail from. Shiki had not been old enough to fight in the war between the Taoists and this secret organization, something they resent dearly, as though they held the knowledge of ki manipulation, it still was not enough and they were swiftly defeated and destroyed. Shiki carries on their Taoist practices, and uses their ki for energy blasts, barrier shields, but mostly just summoning a lot of big bugs.

[**Ridley**](https://i.imgur.com/YkvDhYZ.jpg)

Leader of the fearsome intergalactic organization known as the Space Pirates, Ridley is renowned across multiple planets for being a creature of shocking brutality and senseless, malicious acts of violence. Using the overwhelming power at his disposal, Ridley was able to take whatever it was that he wanted from anyone at any time he wanted, and using this, along with his Space Pirate forces, he was able to threaten the galaxy time and time again. And yet, he can never seem to beat that warrior woman in the bulky power armor.",1596240113

idk but for me, whispering ‚Äúthinspo‚Äù to each other sounds very toxic and damaging. it‚Äôs very enabling and damaging. i would have a talk with her and ask her if she feels okay to stop talking about numbers and stuff, stop making food for each other, stop the thinspo thing, etc. if you guys feel comfortable doing that. its my opinion but i really dont like how this dynamic sounds to me. 

and i have another friend with BED and we dont talk about numbers but are very open about our struggles with food as a concept. its very therapeutic and doesnt trigger her to binge and doesnt trigger me to skip meals or purge. if you can get to a place like that with your friend, i think that would be very beneficial to both of you. i value that friendship so much more than the friendship i have with my first friend bc it feels very forgiving and i KNOW i‚Äôm not at risk of triggering her, rather than having to tiptoe around each other. i love both equally, but sometimes, the dynamic of a friendship can hurt you more than you realize.",1596240113

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Obviously not, they went wide and slow for a more efficient setup. But sony had to push it to remain competitive and with a significant cooling solution + case. But if a refeence hpc gpu can hit 2.75ghz core clock reliably that is a *massive* difference, you don't just come up with 500mhz core clock out of nowhere or in the case vs the xsx, about 1.5x higher clocks or ~900mhz. It'd be like clocking navi 10 at 1100mhz, why would they do that? 

The cooling design itself can probably handle 200-220W maybe a bit more given its volume and huge 130mm fan - to put it into perspect the ps4 uses ~140-150W max and 85mm fan, granted it sounds like a jet so it's not good enough but still. Given that and the power consumption budget of everything else I assume ~52 CUs RDNA2 @ 1800mhz ish is around 150W give or take a little bit, assuming 50-70W for everything else. Also assuming the ~1.5x perf/w is true - 40CUs RDNA1 stock is ~200W for the 5700xt. 1.3x the CUs, linear scaling that's around 170W RDNA2:

(200/1.5)*1.3 = ~170

Assuming this is 300W, this is saying 120CUs @2.75ghz core is ~300W? Doesn't make much sense with the information we currently have",1596240114

&gt; Indian officials say Chinese troops have intruded on to its side in the remote western region, while China says it has not breached the disputed border and has asked India to restrain its frontline troops.

&gt; China and India fought a brief border war in 1962 and China is a close ally of India&amp;#039;s long-time foe, Pakistan.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I've seen a lot of characters who aren't excellent, though. Usually in a class there are those who excel, those who do poorly and those who are average. Anime tend to reflect that, unless it's a very specific kind of anime where the main characters are supposed to be geniuses or something. I've seen a lot of more ""realistic"" high-school settings, though. For example in Fruits Basket, the MC doesn't do very well in her exams and manages to pass after her friend helps her study.

Also, going to college after high-school is very common not only in Japan. Most people from my class went to college, so it's not surprising that most anime characters go to college, too. But not all of them go to college, it's just a matter of finding the right anime.

You really shouldn't compare yourself to anime characters, many times they're portrayed as good students to set an example for young Japanese viewers. But anime is not reality. I highly doubt that in real life so many Japanese are that excellent. I'm pretty sure most people are average like in any other country, they just tend to study harder because in Japan being admitted in a good university is very important, since it allows people to be hired in a good company. But only a part actually manages to achieve that, there are also many people who fail or simply choose other career paths.",1596240115

"fuckboy","t5_319nr","I used to be highly committal.  I was in a relationship/married for 14 years and she was the love of my life.  I would have been monogamous and never imagined being with another woman until the day I died.

I'm not saying I took for her granted, but ultimately I fell into a comfort and stopped ""dating"" her.  I could blame it on kids, blame it on daycare, blame it on finances, careers, but I failed and it took me to date someone that had cheated on their spouse to get that perspective.  I didn't take her for granted, but she felt I did and I can't tell her how she should feel.

That said, that break up redefined my life and how I can't do that ever again and take someone I love for granted.  I will definitely commit to someone again, only once I know I want to, but it isn't my responsibility to force people out of my life that want committment with them if I'm obviously not giving them that.

That's on them and if my words and actions say, I'm not that into you and I can't give you the love you want, but you keep coming back to my bedroom I'm not going to say no and frankly this process of spinning plates allows me to really figure out what I want rather than just jump into the first girl that wants me.

- Bends with his face

Based on this, I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre pretty comparable in combat, especially given the comic. So in that sense, Bumi is probably just as powerful as Toph.

However, as an *earthbender* overall? It‚Äôd have to go to Toph. She understands earth better, because she learnt it from the source; she has a deeper understanding of the element and a deeper connection to it thanks to her seismic sense. She invented metalbending because of that understanding. She invented an entire *subset* of earthbending that was thought impossible for countless years.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","A quality paint finish is much less forgiving than Line-X, I've done both. The actual spraying isn't the hard part though, like you've pointed out. It's all the prep work. Even a fairly straight clean car usually needs some surface correction before it's ready to spray, and all the filling, sanding, blocking out is a ton of work and a bit of an art form. Everything has to be smooth, clean, prepped to the proper grit, no coarser sand marks left over, that's the hard part. Plus, the post painting work of wet sanding the clear and buffing it to a shine.

 You don't see imperfections under Line-X, it sticks to anything,.and being a big rubber sheet, if you ever messed up and had an adhesion problem in a small area, you'd probably get away with it. You could spray an actual turd and get away with it.",1596240117

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","I've done hotsauce.   As with everything else, standard advice: 

* Start slowly.  You don't need to dump a whole bottle of the hottest extract the first time.  A little bit of jalapeno based sauce.  I consider this activity safe, mostly -- but that's if you're not reckless.  I am under the impression that as with anything else, you can take it to an extreme.
* The pain comes on slowly.   Learned this the first time.  She kept adding more and more because the pain was so mild.  Then it eventually kicked in and the pain went from 3 to 10 in seconds... and obviously by that point, it was done, I was already at max pain and it just kept coming
* Have at least 32 ounces of cold milk in a thermos, the first time, again because it's so easy to overshoot.  I definitely needed it, it's the best way to bring relief, just pour it on",1596240117

 1. What is ONE weapon of choice for you, and why?(excluding powers)

I feels most safe with bow and arrow. Prefer the distant combat and to observe the fight but close range fights are not problems too.

2. List three hobbies, why do you like them?

* Reading - That way I feel i can escape the harsh reality. But discovered that passion late because of the ""reading problem"" .
* Riding - As person who love animals I  - of course - love horses. Riding calms me down and I like the bond I can build with a horse.
* Photography  - Sometimes to look the world from different angle can make stuff just feel better. I like to capture the beauty of the world and I find it even in the small things.
* 3. What is your dream date?

A long walk or ride on the beach always can be a good thing - in not too hot weather of course. But still the dream date - for both me and the person - will be if we both decide what we want and find the balance between our desires.

4. If you had to describe yourself in a few words\*\*(Four Max)\*\*, what words would you use?

I am loyal,smart and with big heart.

5. Where's your favorite place to hang out?

The place i call home and where i can be myself and stay alone with my thoughts if i need.

6. What is your number one, worst fear?

A typical answer would be ""death"" but mine is spiders.

7. Would you describe yourself as:

* Smart

8. Which ONE of the Seven Heavenly Virtues do you relate to the most?

* Kindness

9. Which ONE of the Seven Deadly Sins do you relate to most? And why?

* Lust

10. What is your dream job?

To work with animals - a vet.doc, zoologist, or any place where I can help animals in any way.

11. What is your [*Fatal Flaw*](http://riordan.wikia.com/wiki/Fatal_Flaw)?

Low-self esteem

OOC

12. What three gods would you want as your parents, listed in order? Or would you like to be claimed off just your answers? 

Because I would want too many stuff - and unsure what i really want - i will let my answers speak for me.",1596240117

2. I also do a sitting leg extension (bear with me on the explanation). You sit on a weight bench (or stable chair) with you legs in front of you. You put one dumbbell between your feet and grip it (make sure it is stable before beginning). You then slowly extend your legs in front of you holding the weight and then lower back to your beginning position. Repeat 3 sets of 10 each. 
Kinda wacky but hope this helps!",1596240118

Of course, no one is talking about legitimate and legislated rules for mail-in voting.  

California has enacted mail-in vote harvesting, and amazingly, just about every Republican who was running LOST in areas where the exit polls clearly show the victory going the other way.  

Add to this the fact that people who have been found guilty of voter fraud have typically found to have stolen multiple votes in multiple elections, which is why we see areas that achieve greater than 100% of registered voter turnout, which is a mathematical impossibility.

Obviously it isn't true that farm animals are treated well, and eating meat causes immeasurable harm, but ignorant complicity is not the same as active killing. Of course that's only true if a person is genuinely uninformed, some people are aware of the atrocities, but rationalize them. Those people would obviously be more responsible that the truly ignorant, but still not psychopathic, and others are fully aware of the problems, but just don't care at all.

If you want to discuss why there is rampant violence in those countries and no real response as such on a societal level, you need to understand the reasons as to why that happened in the first place.

One cannot diagnose a disease without first looking at the symptoms. Where was it contracted, how can we approach this?

Everything is linked together in some way, shape, or form, it's the reason as to why these protests are now occurring in the United States in the first place. There are many systems built up that have allowed continual abuse of power to occur without any oversight from those who should normally be responsible to prevent that from happening.

To put it simply, you cannot point at one thing and say ""Hey, but what about that?"" (if you'd like to discuss logical fallacies, whataboutism right there for you), when that thing that you're pointing at has a cornucopia of different issues surrounding and feeding into it.",1596240121

My main concern is the drainage. I don‚Äôt want to have to cut anything in the concrete anywhere, and this drain is conveniently located.

Want to see what lack of minimum wage looks like, try to get a fucking gig at freelancer or upwork.

Working without minwage is similar to ""working for exposure"" - The only person who unironically wants minimum wage abolished/advocates working ""for exposure"" is either masochist, retard, or a liar who benefits from paying workforce - ALL WORKFORCE, because abolishing the minimum wage brings all wages down, since employement becomes a race to the bottom - less (if anything).

&gt; This paper explores racial differences in police use of force. On non-lethal uses of force, blacks and Hispanics are more than fifty percent more likely to experience some form of force in interactions with police. Adding controls that account for important context and civilian behavior reduces, but cannot fully explain, these disparities.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Because if it were pure ideology your answer would be that even in the face of human extinction, the government should not mandate mask wearing.  The fact that you're willing to concede that masks are warranted in the most extreme circumstances shows that ideology is malleable based on the circumstances, and we're just negotiating the circumstances.

Every example you gave is one whose impact only extends to their own body.  As is the common phrase, your right to swing your fits end at the tip of my nose.  

The only one that isn't is smoking, though smoking is regulated in most states.  You can't smoke literally anywhere.  This is also quickly changing, with public smoking becoming harder and harder, and the NIH considers second-hand smoke at home to be child abuse.  Quick reminder that as recent as 1994, the official public stance was that tobacco was non-addictive and non-carcinogenic.  

In a pandemic, you walking around without a mask endangers my life.  IMO in fact its very similar to second hand smoking, inasmuch as the government CAN put requirements in place to prevent/limit your second hand smoke from entering my lungs. In situations like this, yes its absolutely warranted for the government to step in.  We allow the government to step in in situations like I already mentioned with limiting smoking in order to limit second hand smoke.  We do it with drunk driving, vaccines for public schools, etc..

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.

Q ‚Äî I think the Democrats are hoping to hear directly from you on what you support. Would you be willing to (inaudible)?

THE PRESIDENT: I think the Democrats don‚Äôt care about the people of our country. I really don‚Äôt. I tell my people: The Democrats do not care about the people of our country. They don‚Äôt want to do what you should be doing for the people of our country, whether it‚Äôs unemployment or anything else.

And all they care about is the election, and they‚Äôre going to lose the election. You see what‚Äôs going on with the polls right now. Guess we just got one over 50 percent; Rasmussen just came out. You see what‚Äôs going on.

Because the people get it: The Democrats are playing for November 3rd, and we‚Äôre playing for the good of the people. It is a disgrace that they‚Äôre not negotiating. But they‚Äôre only looking to play a political game. I happen to think it‚Äôs a bad political game. I think it hurts them.

Q I know that they look at you and what you say publicly ‚Äî different from what they hear from Mnuchin and Meadows. Are you willing to spell out exactly what you want right now?

THE PRESIDENT: They know what I want. And what I want is I want our people to be able to live and live well, because it wasn‚Äôt their fault that China brought in this pandemic, that China brought in this plague. It‚Äôs China‚Äôs fault.

Peter Moore is set to stand down from his role as chief executive officer at Liverpool Football Club.

The Garston-born businessman is set to be replaced by American Billy Hogan, who has worked for FSG since 2004 and is currently the managing director and chief commercial officer at Anfield.

The ECHO understands Moore signed a fixed-term three-year contract with the Reds after coming over from the United States.

The idea behind signing a fixed-term deal was to enable both Moore and his wife Debbie to go back home to their children in America and so there was a limited time on their stay here.

A reshuffle at the top of the Anfield club is now underway.

But it is understood to be on Moore's terms with him choosing to leave and return to his family.

Moore's three-year contract with the Reds is acknowledged to have been due to end in June until the coronavirus pandemic delayed normal proceedings.

However, with his standing at the club and his strong relationship with owners FSG - Moore's tenure was extended.

A transition period will now take place over the next month among the Anfield hierarchy which Moore will oversee to help Hogan in his new role.

Hogan will officially take up the new post on September 1.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","Here are some things I thought of when I asked a similar question on /r/FO4 a year ago

* Side with the minute man initially so you can get Mama Murphy to overdose

* Selling the kid in the fridge 

* In the Far Harbor telling Avery that she is a Synth then convincing DiMA to visit the town and admit to killing Avery so that Allen Lee kills DiMA and the towns people go to war with Acadia, convince the High Confessor to blow up the Nucleus, and then disable the wind turbines. Another smaller thing would be to send settlers to the cannibal, Malcolm, at Lake Echo. 

* In Nuka World side with the raiders and take over the Commonwealth maybe having done a number of Preston's quests to build up settlements for maximum damage. When completing Cappy in a Haystack help Sierra initially then execute her and leave John-Caleb alive to spend the rest of his days alone. 

* Releasing Lorenzo Cabot in the quest The Secret of Cabot House

* Not delivering Virgil the serum from the Institute or convincing him to commit suicide 

* Helping Bobbi No-Nose in the Big Dig 

* Kill Ashes the cat in Here Kitty Kitty

* Keeping the Vault 81 cure for yourself 

* Killing Jake Finch at Saugus Ironworks 

* Siding with Covenant and killing Harvey 

* Abandoning synth Shaun 

* During Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution side with the scavengers

When war starts, run war propaganda against both nations to get the required 80%. You should also have 20 TAC bombers in Ethiopia and 200 fighters in Spain/China, split into single plane wings to grind aces for war support; replicate the single wing ace grinding against Romania/Turkey as well.

Once you have 80% war support, trade away all your civs, click total mob, cancel trades. If you can't get a low enough factory count, continue converting mils to civs to allow more trade or let Romania/Turkey take some land with factories, trade civs, total mob, counter attack, and win the war. After you win, you can puppet or annex and get even more factories and resources under you control.

Early war on Poland is possible and they have a higher factory count than either Romania or Hungary individually so that could get you total mob assuming you grind enough aces (you'll only have 1 x war propaganda instead of 2). You could also get creative and declare on Sweden or something, they have a decent factory count.

So it sounds like either severely under pitching or doing a natural ferment with as little oxygen and no yeast nutrient is the way to go. Would doing a small sulfite right after pressing make sense due to natural ferments usually taking longer to really take off and thus increasing oxidation? Then rack towards the end of fermentation and soon after it ends to reduce the tannin binding to the dead yeast cells. That is an interesting idea for increasing mouthfeel, I might have to try that some day. Thanks again for the info.",1596240130

*****
&gt; In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Andrew Higham says he believes the next six months are the most critical &amp;quot;In a generation&amp;quot; for tackling the climate emergency.

&gt; In 2015, nearly 200 countries signed the landmark Paris Agreement which aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C. It was drafted by Andrew Higham, who went on to co-found Mission 2020, which stated among its goals that 2020 needs to be a turning point in dealing with the climate emergency.

&gt; Pete Betts says the UK is up to the job of the diplomatic &amp;quot;Heavy lifting&amp;quot; needed by a country hosting a COP. He was in charge of all climate negotiations for the UK and the EU for six years, including the Paris Agreement and knows exactly what it&amp;#039;s like to be at the heart of the brinkmanship.

I wasn't lazy or careless or ungrateful or dumb or incompetent or whatever else made me feel like a piece of shit, not entirely anyway. It hasn't solved them all but it's put it in a context that lets me be easier on myself. These things become symptoms that I have a chance at resolving rather than character flaws that I have to fight or begrudgingly accept.

When I signed up for 3 years it was ridiculously cheap and I think they are still the cheapest. Yes I am still locked in so see no point in switching. 

Their customer service is excellent. They reply quickly when you have a problem. Most of my requests are this streaming provider won‚Äôt work on any uk server and they will either let me know when it will be fixed or what servers currently do work. 

This isn‚Äôt to say they haven‚Äôt got shitty business practices and have issues. You‚Äôve done an excellent job listing them. This is more to say why I am still using them and will continue to. If I was ever doing anything remotely illegal or private then I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere near them.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've worked in the HR space for a long time. You're not technically wrong, but I really hate this statement (no offense to you, not like you made it up). It's just very misleading to frame it this way. Stating it like this makes it sound like HR is actively looking to work against you. But in truth, it's pretty often that what's best for the company actually IS what's best for you too. A lot of what HR does is protecting the company *from themselves.* When you have a narcissist manager who thinks they can do whatever they want, like not give you a promotion due to ""excess family obligations"" (which translates to = being a woman) and other shady shit that could be interpreted as discrimination or a breach of labor law, HR is there to shut that crap down, keep everyone in check, and make sure the company isn't liable to be sued. Almost every ""HR issue"" is between a set of **individuals** who ALL represent the company to some extent. It's not ""you against the company."" HR doing what's best for you and doing what's best for the company doesn't have to be mutually exclusive.",1596240135

"KDRAMA","t5_2rqv6","Now, ep.13 was really interesting, and a key to the development of the drama in more than a way.

First, some storylines come to an end: Eun-Byul's fake bullying and affair with Puppy are leaked and cause the end of her career as an idol (for now), while also sending both sisters in despair, at least until SB fixes things up her own way. Then Puppy himself bids farewell on road to Hollywood, understanding that with SB friendship is the limit.

The real point of this episode is that, while characters have grown indeed, they always retain some of their traits but on a much improved form: first and foremost SB, that solves the issue with the bullies by kicking their asses old SB style (nice CG btw) BUT first she followed DH's advice and took the hit for her sister; same applies for DH as he's always the kind and soft guy he was, to almost a passive extent when he lets others choose for him (the dinner with the Chairman is his mother's choice really, he wasn't too keen...) BUT he is not swayed by YJ anymore, no matter hugs, job offers and such; then also YJ in a bleaker side, as while she is sorry and knows her and her mother's mistakes and tries to repent to DH, she has always that nasty controlling side that wants him only for her and for that she stomps over him, going straight to DH's mom when he's balking on the front office job.

Then we have some real skinship between the leads, at least three hugs, some fiery looks and a cliffhanging kiss (you hate to see it). Romance is on and the preview of ep.14 shows what to expect for it: roadblocks, a bunch of them. Between YJ, an illness of some kind and a tear-jerking last scene seems that we'll see some closure on ep.15 at least, and I'm all for it. Also other storylines are on the menu: DH's dad's old crush is back and DH and SB are on the house fraud.

I have to say that I wasn't really expecting BR to get better in his last legs, but if it can at least mantain this path for the last three episodes it will hold up as a slightly above average romcom with some decent morals, which was a long thought after the first half. And some praise to the writer: DH's mom is great everytime (the actress is iconic) and the reggae boy/rich girl romance has gone from being irritating to a hilarious distraction, and in this ep it was golden with the beer scene and all the weirdness.",1596240135

*****
&gt; In an exclusive interview with Sky News, Andrew Higham says he believes the next six months are the most critical &amp;quot;In a generation&amp;quot; for tackling the climate emergency.

&gt; In 2015, nearly 200 countries signed the landmark Paris Agreement which aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C. It was drafted by Andrew Higham, who went on to co-found Mission 2020, which stated among its goals that 2020 needs to be a turning point in dealing with the climate emergency.

&gt; Pete Betts says the UK is up to the job of the diplomatic &amp;quot;Heavy lifting&amp;quot; needed by a country hosting a COP. He was in charge of all climate negotiations for the UK and the EU for six years, including the Paris Agreement and knows exactly what it&amp;#039;s like to be at the heart of the brinkmanship.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","I‚Äôm not exaggerating: Fallen Order is the best Star Wars game I‚Äôve ever played.

My brother and I kinda describe it as the ‚ÄúLegend of Zelda‚Äù or ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù of Star Wars games because it‚Äôs got such an intricate storyline, engaging characters, challenging but not impossible obstacles/enemies/puzzles, and just the right amount of Star Wars lore as to not feel out of place in the overall narrative of the Star Wars universe (err.. galaxy?).
It‚Äôs such a coincidence that I stumbled upon your post just now, because I actually just 100% completed the game last night (def worth the effort), and I still can‚Äôt stop thinking about the game and having conversations about it.

I actually had big doubts about this game prior to playing it, just bc I was thinking it would just be another pretty-lookin‚Äô Star Wars game that lacked personality (ahem Battlefront), but I was proven sooo wrong... and I went from not even wanting to play it, to 100% completing it lol. Can‚Äôt recommend enough. Not the best PS4 game out there, but this game blew me away regardless, and I can‚Äôt wait for a sequel.

If you do end up playing the game,
May the Force be with you.

Edit: I just realized you already bought the game lol. Anyway, I hope you get as much satisfaction as I did playing it. May the Force be with you!",1596240136

"Fencesitter","t5_38fvu","Children will not improve your mental health struggles. They can be wonderful and fulfilling, but they will not fix your bipolar disorder or other issues, and you can't ask them to. If anything, they're supremely difficult and taxing, which will strain your coping skills and mental health. If you want children, take the time to get an excellent therapist and/or medication regime that works for you, and stick to it for a while before you commit. Pregnancy can be really hard on your mental health too. 

Imagine if you have another prolonged and uncontrolled manic period or depressive period and whether you could properly parent when you felt that way. You also said you can't work - can you financially provide for a child right now? Unfortunately, there's research that shows children have poorer outcomes in life if their parents have uncontrolled mental health conditions.

Yeah. Especially if they're feminist, anti-feminist, practice sado-masochism/BDSM, practice any ironic or unironic type of Satanism, or belong to a certain type of Christianity. To me those are all red flags. And yeah I'm being serious. 

&gt;I would say that people with HIV purposely giving others with HIV is EXTREMELY rare. 

Once you know what to look for, you'll see it's actually not that rare. They use certain symbols like the ""plus"" and ""negative"" and ""biohazard"" signs. Once those symbols are learned, a person may realize that they have seen those symbols before. 

&gt;People who can afford to get insurance to cover HIV treatment will pretty much always be undetectable, so it's impossible for them to give someone HIV. 

Bro? I am talking about people who intentionally infect others. I'm not talking about HIV+ people who take their medications and use condoms. 

&gt;I just can't see giving someone else HIV on purpose as a ""semi-common"" behavior among people with HIV.

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","I did the Camino de Santiago (Camino Frances), started in France and I hiked all the way to Finisterre, which put the total just over 500 miles. It took me 38 days total (with a handful of rest days, and a handful of ""shorter than I could have walked"" days), and I stopped in England and Iceland on the way back (Iceland Air lets you do free layovers), if you're interested in doing the same, I recommend doing the ""touristy"" stuff at the *start* of the trip... because at the end of the trip I felt accomplished and exhausted, and the extra time in other countries was difficult to enjoy (partially because my feet and ankles were pretty beat up, and partially because I just wanted to get home).

I try not to push it on people who aren't interested, but if it at all tickles your fancy, I highly recommend it! It's an amazing experience, and you go through a bunch of different changes during the course of the walk. (Expect to be physically miserable for the first 10 days or so, and commiserate with all the other people who are suffering just as badly.)

Far as real life goes, I don't believe there's ONE person for everyone in the whole world. I believe you can say be married to someone and they die (like with Rex) and though you loved him very much, you can find a new amazing love with another man.

It's not the same but doesn't make either love less profound.

I believe Rex and Bree were great together and so was Orson and Bree. Didn't see the others with her yet..

But far as Karl goes, sure they can have fun together but he can't POSSIBLY be a deep, real love for her. The guy is a man-child. Who wants Edie and Susan and and and sixteen others! I mean, Bree has been a woman forever. Even if Karl finally grows up before they hit it off...I'm not buying that a man who just grew up two or fewer years ago can be the man of Bree's dreams.

Im not offended if people want to discuss and offer arguments and verses, but surely wont be receptive with this kind of aggressive tone.

A graceful way to approach this highly sensitive topic would be to: 

1) take an inviting tone to discuss so we can grow together

2) realize that using the example of some conservative or ignorant Catholics to accuse all your brothers&amp;sisters in Christ is wrong, and damage our unity.

- Someone in this post mocked a previous Pope. 
I invite you to read below article which clarify what the current Pope say about Mary. Clearly he doesnt put Mary above/same position as our Savior. He says she is a disciple.

- You mention sound Bible doctrine. But as we can observe from the existence of so many denominations, people's beliefs are also based on a reasonable level of personal interpretation, and not just on the Bible.
 
I believe Unity can be achieved if we understand the difference between Faith (accept Christ as our savior, which all Christians do) and Beliefs. 
For this, I invite you to read an article from a very interesting theologian Greg Boyd who was raises Catholic,then became atheist, then Pentacoast then Orthodox.

Im a follower of Christ, but aint either Protestant or Catholic, as I observe flaws in both.

Cheers,

‚ÄúShe never wanted for herself something that was of her son,‚Äù Francis said. ‚ÄúShe never introduced herself as co-redemptrix. No. Disciple,‚Äù he said, meaning that Mary saw herself as a disciple of Jesus.

What Francis said Thursday is in line with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican‚Äôs doctrinal chief during most of St. John Paul II‚Äô papacy, and now Pope emeritus Benedict XVI.

‚ÄúEverything comes from Him [Christ], as the Letter to the Ephesians and the Letter to the Colossians, in particular, tell us; Mary, too, is everything she is through Him,‚Äù Ratzinger said. ‚ÄúThe word ‚Äòco-redemptrix‚Äô would obscure this origin.

so at least in my case, it‚Äôs not hardware related

I‚Äôm going assume it has something to do with ipv6. The tarkov servers probably don‚Äôt play well with it. Could possibly be a fix if they add ipv6 support to tarkov.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; Maryland has repeatedly rejected the notion of re-incorporating DC, so it doesn't really matter what what Maryland wants in this case.

I never mentioned that. I said Maryland should be able to dictate what happens to the land they gave. They don't have to take it back, they just have to deny DC's request for statehood.

&gt; DC is barely self-sufficient now, and the idea that the federal government doesn't rely heavily already on Maryland and Virginia is absurd to anyone familiar with the area.

They rely on the *people.* If DC for any reason decided to shut down travel the government wouldn't have any employees.

&gt; No it wouldn't. 

It absolutely would, and to propose otherwise would be disastrous. Image that Biden wins in 2020, makes DC a state, and then makes the White House his residence. Under your proposal, the president of the United States could not vote in his own election because he is deprived of representation. 

&gt; DC doesn't belong to any state, so it's not the same

It is absolutely the same. DC isn't really gaining statehood, it's breaking off from the capitol to become a new entity. New lines are being drawn. It's the dissolution of one area and the creation of two more. The exact same could be said if a heavily conservative city wanted to remove a large city and give it its own votes.

Not that Woojin did anything particularly harmful, but he apparently made some choices that, at least Chan viewed as selfish by not thinking of the whole group, and the choices eventually led to Woojin's contract being terminated.

Anything involving the concept of critical support for democrats for example. [Topics like this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaushV/comments/hzke47/what_the_fuck_are_you_talking_about/) are a perfect example. Or the now deleted one where someone got banned and claimed AntifaStonetoss was ""tankie"" because they had a comic that ultimately said that each party hates anti-establishment movements.

Another example was a post that tried to claim a meme that stated that capitalism is inherently racist was class reductionist. 

Basically, any take that requires nuance.

Bards will have great AOE healing and support.

Summoners will have a summon that can fulfill the healing role (we don't know much about that yet)

And all the other classes can augment themselves with these classes to provide a bit of side healing. So in a group comp of 8 , you might not even need a healer if ,let's say 4 (we don't know the specific heal capabilities yet) of the ""DPS"" have a heal off spec or you have 1 healer and 2 off healers, or just one cleric one bard.

I've been to some high end steak houses and they generally give you pretty meh knives and it's not that big of a deal.  They're not going to be used that often and when they are used they probably won't be doing serious kitchen work.  So if they like how they look or they want to stay with the Wusthof brand and it's a good price for it, then it's fine.  And $10 per knife isn't bad.

Yes, they could probably spend less but they won't be Wusthof, or maybe not look as nice, etc.",1596240146

For things like final boss the one with better attack speed, B-52, might be better. 

Rum is really good for removing enemy buffs on basic, and slightly increasing the energy regeneration of the team in her energy skill.

B-52 increases the damage received for the entire team on his basic, and a probability of a stun on his energy skill.

Depending on what you need your main team to do, you can change it. I would say possibly stay with B52 in general until you hit a block, then use Rum. B52 has a higher HP and ATKSPD than rum, so he would be more useful if you don't know what your fighting against. If you know your enemy has buffs or a high HP that make things difficult for you, substitute Rum.",1596240146

1. What does career advancement look like in this industry? Do tasks remain mostly the same but the scope/complexity of the projects increase (i.e. stadiums vs homes) or does the change go from niche roles to more big picture/project management?
2. There seems to be some negative perception of MEP. One MEP engineer commented that he doesn't feel like MEP positions are well respecting in the engineering community. I have also heard that these positions are increasingly overtasked and overworked. Is there any truth to that? Obviously this may be dependent on the company.
3. What does the day-to-day work look like 1-year, 3-years, and 8-years into the career? What does your future look like?
4. There also seems to be a trend for MEP engineers to move companies frequently and transition to freelance work. Is there a unique reason for this or is it just the best way to obtain pay raises?
5. How do you use your P.E. in your position?
6. What are the current challenges of the industry and what's on the horizon?

Don't get me wrong, I've had some difficulty dealing with my now first grader during remote learning, some were my own issues and some were her being 5 years old and not wanting to sit in front of a computer and listen to something that wasn't interesting or engaging at the moment. I tried everything, figured it out and we got through it. Thing is that I have to be involved 100% to help her due to her age and abilities and I can see how that can be extremely difficult for those who are working outside of or from home. I'm lucky that I only have to focus on stuff at home, but it's still a time-suck. 

My middle schooler is doing fantastically and works independently on advanced classes, so it's definitely a different experience depending on age of the child(ren). 

I definitely feel for everyone that's dealing with this because it's hard all around, but teachers deserve their wage even while distance learning.

"news","t5_2qh3l","1. The difference between Feb &amp; March isn't that big. I've said ""from the beginning"" from the beginning. Also, they had cases in Feb &amp; have said they actually think it was here in December.

2. I agree it isn't normal. Because we shut everything down. If you think people are afraid to go out you haven't looked around. The Bars, the beaches, the shops, they are packed. People are tired of being inside. It's why we saw spikes in tourist destinations. People are at Disney World haha.

3. I see you mean now. Again this whole discussion has been about what caused the shutdown, not now, but yes we are at a point they are trying to push to open everything. I've admitted it may not be the correct actions, but there are health professionals &amp; studies showing it isn't a bad idea. We will see. I still think being outside &amp; masks are our best hopes. UV fucks this thing up.

4. He talked about treatments for sure. I am not on twitter so I don't know, I can only find 1 that said a cure &amp; it seems to be a retweet about their being one &amp; not saying what it is. There could be more, just not seeing them. The big controversial hydroxychloroquine has turned out to be an effective treatment (when combined with other additions) if taken early.

5. You are right I misspoke. However, that was the epicenter &amp; the right move. Still got heavy backlash for it. If you lay the blame on him for the people who snuck in, then everything any government or bureaucratic official does is at the behest of Trump. Which obviously makes 0 sense.

6. Again. This whole thing was about how this started &amp; why it's as bad as it's been. Does his rhetoric since play a part? Yes. However that wasn't the discussion. The way both sides are handling it, even now is political &amp; ridiculous.

7. Ebola was never as serious, not even close. It has an astronomical death rate but isn't very infectious due to the nature at which it spreads. It was bad luck because the unit hadn't been fully used &amp; he has been cutting cost in every sector (which is another problem with him as president).

America on the other hand has a ton of different ethnic groups (including those I listed in Austria-Hungary), but for the most part they're all culturally and linguistically united. For the most part.

Of course, the ""diversity"" that most people talk about is the Austro-Hungarian kind, not the American kind.

To turn it into a gaming pc you can upgrade your gpu, ram and cpu but by doing this you will need to also upgrade your psu. You slot the cpu onto the motherboard and put thermal paste onto it. The motherboard can be screwed into the case. The ram is easy to put in you just put it in a slot. The gpu is also easy to put in as it also has a slot on the motherboard. You then need to place in the psu and attach all the power cables to the motherboard so it can power on. Best way to know what goes where is to Google and image of your motherboard model with annotations. You also have to connect your psu to your boot drive and the boot drive to the motherboard.

Did plenty of short stories and novels. I don't write much anymore aside from essays but I still love it. For storyboarding just write down some concepts, maybe a rough outline. Break it up into chapters, and a chapter can be as short as ""Chapter 3, hero meets X and learns Y."" You can always revisit and add flesh to the bones after. Maybe try some things that you struggle with. Dialogue, scene setting, character description, etc. Identify a weakness and beat it like a redheaded stepchild.

As an ENTP, your inferior is Si, which is all about feeling/knowing ones body, traditional/rituals, and creating a sanctuary. Do you find any of these things interesting?

For me, I used to use my Si in conjunction with my Ne. every Saturday, I would walk half a mile to my favorite coffee shop, grab some coffee, and people watch/ let my brain wander wherever it wanted. The brain wondering was the Ne, and the Saturday tradition part was Si. your inferior is meant to complement, not overtake, your dominant.

For me, I love finding little baby traditions wherever I can. That said, they should NEVER become so big as to take control of your life, or else you'll get really crazy. For me, I find Si in things like spa days or cleaning my house etc. Small things that Ne would overlook but actually make me a happier, more well rounded individual. That said, you should NEVER do something crazy like have a job that relies on your inferior (accounting, for example).

as far as developing your shadows, it's the same thing to a lesser degree. For me, Fi and Se are my shadows. I found a lot of solace in yoga, because it allows you to feel what you feel without any judgment from anybody (Fi) and gets you moving and engaged with the present world around you (Se).

Si, Fi, and Se will never be my daily drivers, or anywhere close to it. That said, they definitely have merit. A lot of the unhealthy ENTP I see rely solely on their Ne/Ti and ignore the balancing aspect.",1596240151

"halo","t5_2qixk","Chief getting nearly choked out was, at the time of being written, his first encounter with brutes. In armor that was failing(he was still in his damaged Mark V from CE). He didn't know what he was facing, and it moved faster than he expected. And he still won. Close quarters, Chief broke its arm, and killed it. Now, it was retconned that this was no longer his first encounter with brutes, but at the end of the day, that brute had the advantage on a tired Chief, in damaged and inferior Mark V, and it still ended up dead on the floor.

The most threatening faction Chief has faced is the Flood, and lore-wise, the Covenant is more of a threat. 343 is saying that to hype them up. There's no way in hell they're more threatening than the Flood, or a Covenant on the verge of wiping out the galaxy through Halo rings. Not to mention, the Created are still around, and they flat out defeated the UNSC, and are capable of policing the galaxy multiple times over thanks to their Guardians. Yeah, the Banished are absolutely not the most threanting thing they faced.

As for hunting down spartans, he never faced them before until Red Team. ""As I suspected, nothing but a man."" His line confirms that. And I repeat, he faced the easiest, and least experienced spartans he could have, and two were left standing perfectly fine, and fled only once they heard more enemies were showing up, and to tend to a wounded teammate. Atriox didn't pursue, even though he wanted them dead or captured(""Hunt them down. Find out where they came from. Bring me back anything useful."" he says. Either means capture one, or kill them and investigate later). Why not grab Douglas on the floor, or kill the two capable of still fighting? Because Atriox isn't an idiot. He knows the spartans are still capable, and probably didn't want to risk himself now that he no longer had the jump on them, and they had their guns back. 

He also never went against the UNSC single handedly. He often was the only survivor, but he wasn't a one man army, charging enemies alone. He had other brutes who would die along the way. And it was absolutely shown to be difficult for him. For starters, he has scars, and secondly, it took a mental toll on him. 

The UNSC has been gathering intel on the Banished and Atriox. If this intel reaches Chief, then he'll know all there is about Atriox. His mace, gauntlet, and fighting style. I also think the grappling hook is a good counter to the mace. If it's strong enough, and Atriox tries to pull them in with the mace, they could activate their mag boots(if on metal), or grapple something behind them, keeping them in place.

And Blue Team would absolutely wreck Atriox together. They've fought harder foes(Didact and Warden, although both held back).

I honestly think you're severely over hyping Atriox, and underestimating Chief. Their strengths should be comparable, with the exception being Atriox's gauntlet, but avoiding that, Atriox doesn't actually have many strength feats, besides punching IIs across rooms, but Chief has also casually thrown brutes as well, which are heavier than spartans in Mark IV(Red Team's armor).

So I stand by my statement that this is absolutely not a one side fight, and that Atriox's biggest advantages are his equipment. And even then, the fight can go either way, especially if Chief brings his own gear(grappling hook, etc), which he will.",1596240152

My dad was a narcissist, didn't care much about anyone but himself. The two times he bought me gifts, on his own accord, he got me a karaoke machine (in black because he knew that's my favorite color) and a bunch of blank tapes, because he knew how much I love singing.  Next time he bought me a makeup set, because he knew that I was developing an interest in makeup. I never talked to him about my interests, we never hung out much, I really didn't want to spend much time with him if I didn't have to. But we shared a house, and he was still able to observe what I gravitated towards and put some thought into a gift. Your dad and brother have no excuse what so ever. And your mom really needs to stop enabling this behavior. Best you can do is what was suggested by u/AnswerIsItDepends, get them none personal gifts that benefit the home from now on.

I also do think landlords already take on risks as an investor- there‚Äôs no guarantee they can get rents to cover the mortgage. They can do their underwriting but a downturn or a pandemic like this, as we‚Äôre seeing now and saw in 2008, could make that all go to shit. Defaulting on a mortgage has significant impact on an individuals financial abilities going forward, could be just as significant as an eviction on your record; but I do agree an evicted tenant‚Äôs immediate well-being is much harder affected than a landlords mortgage default.",1596240153

*****
&gt; Renee Bach, an American missionary who operated a charitable treatment center for severely malnourished children in Uganda despite having no medical training, has settled a lawsuit brought against her in Ugandan civil court by two women and a civil rights organization.

&gt; As part of the lawsuit several former volunteers and staffers at the treatment centers filed affidavits describing incidents during which they witnessed Bach making medical decisions on behalf of children at the center and performing medical procedures, including blood transfusions - often without supervision.

&gt; The annual death rates at the center - around 20% in 2011 and down to 10% by 2013 - were at levels that would raise red flags by the standards used to judge international charities, according to Saul Guerrero, who specializes in childhood severe acute malnutrition at UNICEF. Over the five-year period from 2010 to 2015, Bach says the center took in 940 children, of whom 105 died.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","it 's chicken and egg argument tho, and one of the real argument why you want to spend money on that kind of thing is actually making your software actually rock solid. 

if you look up some parts of the devlogs of Riot's website, I mean, some will make your skin crawl, just because somehow they actually exist. and that very fact should make the devs team look at actually fixing their shit. Looking into porting the game to other OSes is a great time to actually do that kind of work.

And it make the whole point pretty moot, because you have an internal reason to look into more than one or two OS (tho the current macOS client is FUBAR)

To paraphrase the words of a guy that has been doing that for a long ass time (Smith and Wiston's dev IIRC): it make long term goals easier because you have the sanity check to actually do the things by the rules rather than a specific system.

At peak usage (beginning and end of month) the platform fails and you are unable to download files.  
It's often best to wait until the end of the month get files because the creators will make adjustments based on feedback.  However, right now I am unable to access several subscriptions worth of STL files.

Metallica is an easier sell as theyve sucked since napster and St Anger didnt help. but theyve still got enough fans and history that youll get some pushback on them being nazi sympathizers without video of him doing it like the dude from Slayer

Slayer is an easier still point to make as they dont have as many older established fans and Kerry King was outright caught nazi-saluting on stage.

Pantera is in the same boat as Slayer in that most metalheads are aware of their leanings and act accordingly. 

the whole black metal scene is a straight up nazi garbage fire, worst in the genre if you ask me, burzums the worst of the worst and most dont need much convincing on that. 

motley crue is too much of a joke for most to defend too fervently and Five finger death punch sucks anyway so those should be no problem.

You can kneel all you want but if you don't follow that with concrete actions, then you kneeling was of no use whatsoever.

As others have pointed out here, what I absolutely don't understand and disagree with is not wearing the BLM t-shirt. He very pointedly chose not to do that. And yes a t-shirt isn't going to end racism, but consciously choosing not to wear one in this context is like screaming out ~~the~~ that black lives *don't* matter (which I am not saying, and I completely disagree with). He had to have known that. I mean he wears MLK shirts and Los Magic shirts... Why not support fellow human beings through this simple act?

By Marc Stein
July 31, 2020, 5:21 p.m. ET

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. ‚Äî There were a few must-pack accessories for Patty Mills of the San Antonio Spurs for his stay at Walt Disney World. Mills brought a stack of books on Black history in the United States and his native Australia. He made sure to carefully transport his favorite flat-brimmed hat, which bears two flags representing Australia‚Äôs Indigenous populations.

Mills also arrived for the restart of the N.B.A. season with what he referred to as ‚Äúmy shield‚Äù ‚Äî his internal defense mechanism to ward off hurtful words and actions. The shield, he said, is a byproduct of a lifetime of racial abuse that began on his first day of kindergarten, soon after Mills‚Äôs parents had moved to the Australian capital of Canberra to take jobs with the federal government.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only Black kid in the room,‚Äù Mills said of that first day. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt take long before the biggest kid in the room walked up to me and threw a straight uppercut to the guts, completely knocking the wind out of me and leaving me in all sorts of tears.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw this boy coming from the left, and he came from a fair distance,‚Äù said his mother, Yvonne Mills, who was against a wall nearby, observing alongside other parents. ‚ÄúI can still feel the punch in my stomach, too.‚Äù

More than 25 years later, with a slew of similar stories to tell from throughout his life, Mills trusts his shield as much as his jump shot. That is no small thing given Mills‚Äôs ability to produce instant offense off the bench, which has enabled him, as a 6-foot, 180-pound guard, to last for nine seasons as a trusty change-of-pace option for the Spurs and become one of the most feared scorers in international basketball.

‚ÄúA lot of things that are said just bounce off me because of the shield I‚Äôve created,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúI just need to work out the appropriate times to lower it, or when to take it off completely.‚Äù

This moment is one of those times. Mills, 31, has joined the global push to focus on social matters as much as his basketball job in Florida will allow ‚Äî even if that means revealing painful tales from the past. He has been finding his voice as an activist in recent years and pledged to join the many N.B.A. players who are determined to use the platform of the league‚Äôs rebooted season to fight against racism and police brutality.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the same battle on two continents,‚Äù Mills said, referring to his home nation several time zones away.

The Spurs may play as few as eight games at Disney World because they are a long shot to make the playoffs, which they have not missed since 1997. Yet Mills has ensured that his time here will resonate no matter how short. He is donating his remaining salary of about $1 million to Black Lives Matter Australia, Black Deaths in Custody and a new campaign ‚Äî We Got You ‚Äî he helped launch to show support for athletes as they fight racism in Australian sport.

After participating in the first game of the N.B.A. restart on Thursday night, Utah‚Äôs Donovan Mitchell mentioned Mills and Jrue Holiday of the New Orleans Pelicans as emerging leaders of the N.B.A.‚Äôs social justice movement. He lauded both for agreeing to donate the remainder of their salaries to Black causes and said players who are speaking out are ‚Äúnot really asking for permission.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven the unfortunate events that have happened in this country, we have the ears of people,‚Äù Mills said, referring to the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by the police. ‚ÄúFor the first time in my career, I‚Äôve had teammates, old teammates, coaches, old coaches, even old friends ‚Äî the almost universal question they ask is: ‚ÄòWhat can I do to help?‚Äô Just by so many people saying that, I feel like there is a tide change.‚Äù

He formed We Got You with both Black and white athletes in part because campaigning against racism, Mills said, is much tougher for Black athletes in Australia. Adam Goodes, a former Australian Rules football star, was an anti-racism advocate who in 2015 began to be relentlessly booed by opposing fans. The backlash ultimately prompted Goodes, at 35, to retire suddenly, one year after he had won the country‚Äôs Australian of the Year award for national good citizenship.


Of course, as Mills has also learned, speaking out invariably leads to the sort of storytelling that requires ‚Äúputting yourself in a vulnerable position because you have to relive traumatic experiences.‚Äù Shield down.

Mills‚Äôs mother is Aboriginal, and his father is from the Torres Strait Islands. The two flags on the hat Patty Mills brought with him to Florida represent his two identities.

In a one-hour conversation after a recent practice, Mills shared some of the names he was called during his childhood, including ‚Äúdarkie,‚Äù ‚Äúblackie,‚Äù ‚Äúpetrol sniffer,‚Äù ‚Äúmonkey,‚Äù ‚Äúchimp,‚Äù ‚Äúabo‚Äù (a derogatory term short for Aboriginal) and other disparaging terms that he was called ‚Äúregularly at school or on the sporting fields.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe better I got in sports,‚Äù Mills said, ‚Äúthe worse the racism got.‚Äù

The Mills family moved to Canberra because his parents got jobs working in Aboriginal affairs for the government. ‚ÄúIt was a bit like going to Washington,‚Äù said Benny Mills, Patty‚Äôs father.

Yet leaving their home on Thursday Island in Torres Strait ‚Äî where, Patty said, everyone ‚Äúlooked like me and spoke like me‚Äù ‚Äî landed him in that kindergarten classroom where he was first punched.

‚ÄúIt was the very beginning of how I was going to be treated for the rest of my time at school, not only by students but, more appallingly, by teachers and principals,‚Äù Mills said.


Within a few years, when Mills was 9, his parents began explaining the traumatic past of his mother, Yvonne Mills. One of five siblings born to a white man and an Aboriginal woman, Yvonne and the other four children were taken from their mother, Gladys Haynes, in 1949 after their parents had separated. Yvonne, the youngest, was 2 years old. The children were moved to group homes as wards of the state and sent to separate foster families in a government-sponsored social engineering program designed, in effect, to assimilate Aboriginal children into white society.

Throughout their childhoods, Yvonne and her siblings were told that their mother did not want them. The falsehoods were exposed by a government inquiry in the mid-1990s, which confirmed decades of human rights violations that made Yvonne part of what became known as Australia‚Äôs ‚ÄúStolen Generations‚Äù ‚Äî although she said she did not receive a written acknowledgment of such status from the South Australian government until 2018. Yvonne had virtually no contact with her mother between the ages of 2 and 17; Haynes died in 1979.


Patty Mills said he can still picture the car ride during which this was first discussed. Patty was sitting behind his mother in the left-side passenger seat of his parents‚Äô white Toyota Corolla and got out of the car when they arrived at their home, before Yvonne could even open the door.

‚ÄúI remember looking down at my arms and the back of my calves as she‚Äôs getting out of the car,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúI look up to her and I say, ‚ÄòSo does this mean they will come and take me away, too?‚Äô

‚ÄúI remember her answer very vividly. She said, ‚ÄòNo, Doll ‚Äî she calls me ‚ÄòDoll‚Äô ‚Äî because your dad is going to stand on that big rock in the driveway with a big stick. And no one is going to come anywhere near you.‚Äô‚Äù

Learning about his mother‚Äôs torment, Mills said, was ‚Äúa turning point.‚Äù His athletic talent was already blossoming in the basketball and social club his parents founded in Canberra for Indigenous Australians called Shadows, but Mills said that was when he began to realize ‚Äúwhy I‚Äùm being treated differently at school.‚Äù

In his youth, Mills‚Äô instinct was to ‚Äúlet my game do the talking.‚Äù In adulthood, he is trying, like his parents did, to more forcefully influence change. Just staying visible, Mills said, is a big part of it ‚Äî to give aspiring Indigenous basketball players in Australia someone to emulate. Mills was only the third Black Australian to represent the country in basketball at the Olympics, joining Michael Ah Matt (1964) and Mills‚Äôs uncle Danny Morseu (1980 and 1984).

‚ÄúMy Uncle Danny played 30 years before I did,‚Äù Mills said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want another 30 years to go by before another Indigenous Australian plays for Australia.‚Äù

He has thrust himself into anti-racism causes across sports in Australia with the support of Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, whose bond with Mills was cemented on the eve of the 2014 N.B.A. finals. Popovich stunned Mills when he began a crucial practice by introducing the story of Eddie Mabo to the team. Mabo, who was Mills‚Äôs great-uncle, is revered by Indigenous Australians to such a degree that his landmark campaign for their land ownership rights has long prompted calls for a national holiday in his name.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been very satisfying to watch Patty grow into someone who is much more interested in our world than basketball,‚Äù Popovich said. ‚ÄúHe has grown into a great citizen of the world. And Patty‚Äôs story is pretty important and very timely, because normally all we think about is the race problem here. It‚Äôs in many places.‚Äù

Mills said he feels fortunate to play for a franchise and a coach ‚Äî and in a league ‚Äî that encourages him to ‚Äúspeak out on these things‚Äù The Spurs, he said, urge him ‚Äúto continue to show who I am as a Black Australian.‚Äù",1596240156

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have many, many stories. I will share one of them today: When I was about I‚Äôd say 13-14, I was laying in my bed late at night trying to get to sleep. Though, I had this deep and unsettling pit in my stomach that something was there, that something bad was there. I didn‚Äôt watch anything or have anything scary before hand happen for a long time so the feeling just came out of no where. Of course, I tried to push it down by telling myself I was just overthinking and paranoid of nothing. Though, it just grew and grew until my fear developed into tears and yelling. My older brother, who was there at the time to watch me while my guardian had to go somewhere for a week, heard me crying so he came in to check on me. He sat in the bed as I was starting to breath hard. He kept asking what was wrong so I kept replying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm scared. He‚Äôs back, he‚Äôs back.‚Äù My brother was holding my hand, trying to figure out what was wrong. I was looking up at the wall that was above the headboard of the bed where a light from the hallway shined. Suddenly, a head seemed to quickly run past that light and when I looked to the hallway, no one was there and there was no possible way it could have been my brother. After seeing that, I had a full blown panic attack and telling him ‚ÄúI saw-‚Äú but I could never finish my sentence. A few days later, I told him what I saw and all he said was, ‚ÄúI believe you saw something but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs actually there.‚Äù Basically, he told me I was hallucinating in a friendly way which doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Title: **Friend [F][American] got pressured into signing a lease for college housing four days before her college announced all her classes would be held entirely onlne. Is there anything she can do?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Throwaway account.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Like the title says, my friend was pressured by her counselors from the college to sign a lease for dormitory housing, and only four days later the college announced all her classes would be entirely online, making the dormitory completely pointless. 8k wasted. The apartement complex is technically independent from the school, but the two work together for student housing. She and her family have tried asking for it to be revoked but no dice, they're not budging, because they don't have to; she legally signed the lease. Is there anything she can do?

I agree with your thoughts on the ending.

Having played as Abby and we get to know her a little bit, I would have been a bit cut had she been killed. She was fucked up enough and i think she got her due punishment. Death to me has always been the easy way out. Months of torture is way more satisfying for me at least. !&lt;",1596240157

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt;My least favorite thing about RDM is, unpopular opinion warning, how little you actually do up close. I know it's mainly a ranged DPS, but when they first announced there was going to be a ""hybrid class"" I was really excited. My left hotbar was going to be ranged magic, and the right, all the melee attacks. Now, I've got 3, maybe 4, melee attacks and so very many magic attacks.

As someone who recently picked up RDM it feels so weird that I have to do the melee, but it's such a small part of it.

And then the cool oGCD attacks, Fleche and Contre Sixte, are not even actually melee? I get that they *have* to have a lot of range because they could never just magically line up for the melee part of the rotation but... I don't know, they could have like an animation where a phantom version of the Red Mage jumps at the enemy to perform them.",1596240160

Here at EVE_NT we‚Äôve brought you many competitive events, tournaments and leagues in Eve Online over the years. From the EVE_NT Collides series, the EVE_NT Major and Minor Leagues, the Caldari Corporation Cup at FanFest and, of course, producing and hosting Alliance Tournament XVI and 50/50 producing Alliance Tournament XV with CCP.

Now, with the blessing and support of CCP we aim to bring the return of the Alliance Tournament experience and so, we bring you The Alliance Open.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0v1rgMtkc

As of 00:01 Eve Time August 1st the registration is open at https://open.eve-nt.uk/
There will be 32 teams with the first 24 slots allocated in a First-Come-First-Serve basis with the remaining 8 teams being chosen from a random draw in the event of more than 32 teams signed up.

We‚Äôre also looking for generous individuals with large wallets who might want to contribute to the prize pot which, as of 0001 1st August 2020 the prize pot stands at appoximately 540b ISK.
The full rules are available on the website but here‚Äôs a short summary of the main changes:

Summary of key changes from Alliance Tournament 16 to EVE_NT Alliance Open

This tournament is sponsored by EDENCOM, who are looking to recruit combat-hardened capsuleers to aid in the defence of New Eden against the Triglavian menace. As a result, heavy restrictions are in place regarding Triglavian hulls, while EDENCOM ships boast an attractive points reduction.
Instead of a limit to the maximum number of copies a team may field of any given ship, teams are restricted to a maximum of three (3) of any hull size, with exceptions where noted.
Point costs have been adjusted for a number of ship groups.
The ban system has changed to 3 blind bans, communicated to the referee prior to the match.
The Flagship rule has been replaced by the Wildcard rule.
Precursor ships have been given their own points table and are limited to three (3) ships total.
Electronic Counter Measures modules may only be fitted to ships which give ECM bonuses.

Honestly on most air cooled cards, you're likely better off not raising the voltage anyway. Look into using the curve editor (CTRL-F) for more control. You may have better results reducing the max voltage a bit.",1596240161

"politics","t5_2cneq"," Q Mr. President, if we could ask you, specifically: We heard yesterday you were ‚Äî your frustrations about how long it‚Äôll take to count the ballots here. Then why aren‚Äôt you spending more energy to get the resources and the funding
for the states that they want to be able to secure
this election for all Americans?

THE PRESIDENT: Peter, you know nothing about my energy. Okay?

Q What are you doing, specifically?

THE PRESIDENT: You know nothing about what I‚Äôm doing.

Q What are you doing?

THE PRESIDENT: Listen, you know nothing about what I do.

Q The Americans are listening: What are you doing?

THE PRESIDENT: So, on NBC ‚Äî I just told you about the false report that NBC put out the other night about the mayor of Portland. And this is the kind of stuff you get.

You‚Äôll see what happens. And it‚Äôs common sense. Everyone knows mail-in ballots are a disaster. You just have to take a look at the last recent ‚Äî take a look at New York City. Look at New York, they‚Äôre still counting your ballots, Pat.

MR. LYNCH: Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT: Do you know that?

Mr. LYNCH: That‚Äôs right.

THE PRESIDENT: They had a race, a small race, by comparison ‚Äî by comparison, tiny. It‚Äôs so messed up; they have no idea. There are ballots missing ‚Äî thousands and thousands of ballots are missing. They think they‚Äôre going to send hundreds of millions of ballots all over the United States, and it‚Äôs going to come out. You won‚Äôt know the election result for weeks, months, maybe years after. Maybe you‚Äôll never know the election result, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm concerned with. It‚Äôll be fixed. It‚Äôll be rigged. People ought to get smart. And I just hope our Republican voters, the people that are for you, are going to do what they have to do.

Absentee ballots are great, because absentee ballots ‚Äî you have to go through a process to get them and it‚Äôs ‚Äî it‚Äôs actually a great thing. Absentee ballots. I‚Äôm going to be voting absentee. An absentee ballot is one thing. A universal mail-in ballot is a disaster. These governors are going to send out millions of ballots. They don‚Äôt even know where they‚Äôre sending them. I already have friends that got ballots for a son who died seven years ago. When they get ‚Äî you don‚Äôt even want to talk about it.

But the media knows this. Actually, the Washington Post wrote a great article ‚Äî of all groups. A week ago, the Washington Post wrote a great article that this is a disaster. This is going to be the greatest election disaster in history.

And, by the way, you guys like to talk about Russia and China and other places? They‚Äôll be able to forge ballots. They‚Äôll forge them. They‚Äôll do whatever they have to do. People should go and they should vote or do an absentee ballot.

Q So what are you doing to secure it?

Q The military predominantly votes ‚Äî

THE PRESIDENT: Say it. Say it.

Q The military predominantly votes by mail or absentee.

THE PRESIDENT: Absentee.

Q And so ‚Äî

THE PRESIDENT: You didn‚Äôt understand me. I said absentee ballots are actually a very good thing.

Q They‚Äôre the same.

THE PRESIDENT: Absentee ballots are secure, and they‚Äôre very good. But universal mail-in are a disaster. You‚Äôre going to see an election that ‚Äî and we‚Äôre going to do very well in the election. Nobody wants that date more than me. I wish we would move it up. Okay? Move it up. But you‚Äôre not prepared for what they‚Äôre doing.

And they‚Äôre using COVID. You know, they‚Äôre using the China virus. China must be very happy about it, because they hit us with a virus, and now they screw up an election like you ‚Äî you will never see. You watch what happens. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll ever give me any statement, ‚ÄúI guess Trump was right.‚Äù But the people know I‚Äôm right. Watch what happens.

New York City has a little election ‚Äî we just talked ‚Äî you go see. Do you know how far ‚Äî they‚Äôre going to ‚Äî they‚Äôre never going to have the result in that election. Never the correct result. They‚Äôll probably announce something at some point. But when did that take place ‚Äî like five, six weeks ago.

Absentee ballots: great. Going to the polls: great. If you do universal mail-ins with millions and millions of ballots, you‚Äôre never going to know what the real ‚Äî the real result of an election is. It‚Äôs going to be a very, very sad day for our country.

Go ahead.

Q Sir, if ‚Äî if the system is a disaster, as you say, why not commit to putting in resources to fix it?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we‚Äôre doing ‚Äî we‚Äôre putting in all the resources you can. But as a couple of the radical-left people said, you know ‚Äî who actually agree with me ‚Äî they said, ‚ÄúNo matter what you do, we‚Äôre not prepared for this.‚Äù They‚Äôre not prepared for an onslaught of millions of ballots pouring in. They‚Äôre not prepared. They‚Äôre not prepared.

You watch. They‚Äôre not going to announce anything on November 3rd. They‚Äôre not going to announce it on the 4th or the 5th or the 6th. It‚Äôll go on forever.

People should go ‚Äî you know, they voted, Mick, during World War One. They voted during World War Two. They went to the polls; they voted. They went to their booth, and they voted proudly. But now, with COVID, they don‚Äôt want to vote.

It‚Äôs not they don‚Äôt want to vote, it ‚Äî this will be catastrophic for our nation. And you‚Äôll see it. I‚Äôm always right about things like this. I guess I must be or I wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here.",1596240162

That is the consequence of her reckless, violent behavior.  If your toddler swats you, you don‚Äôt hit back with your adult force.  Most men, this one in particular, are significantly bigger and stronger than most women.  That‚Äôs a fact.  You‚Äôre a coward if you think hitting a woman back is the only way to make her face the consequences of her actions.

Guys I get some of your negative, realistic responses but you need to realize this is about mentality.
You're focusing on the wrong thing. 
This is about how these statements are impacting and for some crippling. Even if someone isn't physically  healthy chances are they never will be until they're able to surmount what is sabotaging their progress mentally. 
It's difficult for some people to even get out of bed if they feel hopeless and have no energy. 
People are not only fooled into thinking perfection is attainable they're fooled into thinking they need to be perfect, so they need to be able to be okay and accept themselves as they are and realize they're not striving to be perfect in a generalized sense that is literally sold to people.  
I personally would have changed the phrasing to 'try to work to accept yourself through each challenge you face' but I appreciate the overarching theme and positivity. The journey to accepting and appreciating oneself doesn't mean one has to be perfect. It's the first step to contentedness which leads to healthily achieving ones goals.

"boating","t5_2qm9s","Not necessarily. Buy on *condition* first and foremost.  The cheapest boat may end up being the most expensive and some years ago I looked at a 5 year old Cigarette with a buddy of mine that was priced at the top of the market but was a disaster.  Do your research... figure out what boat works for you and watch the market.  Find one that‚Äôs been taken care of and budget ahead of time that you might low a grand on surveys and find out that it saves you 20x that in the long run.  Don‚Äôt be afraid to walk away from a boat.  EVER.

Oh, the seller claims X, Y and Z are new or rebuilt?  That‚Äôs nice.  Look at the receipts carefully and make sure they‚Äôre real and itemized.  Lurk on websites like thehulltruth and see what owners say about their boats.. what are the problem areas, what have they spent to fix things.  Boat owners love to howl about the money they have to spend on their boats.  Take everything with a grain of salt.

The $100,000 disaster was a guy I know.  He wanted a speedboat, didn‚Äôt know what he was doing... bought a Fountain, it was 7 years old and looked great, only had 280 hours on the engines he told me, was fresh water...  except that he didn‚Äôt do any research. First off, high performance engines cost a fortune to rebuild and 280 hours on many of them is rebuild time.  So these were burning oil and tired and needed work... and then when they went to pull them to rebuild them the stringers were shot and one of the drives was on its last legs and...  but he got a ‚Äúbargain‚Äù.  His bargain cost him too much in the end and he lost a summer getting it fixed.

Research is key. A GOOD survey is incredibly crucial.  Patience is key. The market is hot right now, boats are selling quickly, people are making stupid decisions, don‚Äôt you do it.  The right boat will come along and it‚Äôll be worth it.",1596240165

If you're going to do keto right i think you need to avoid artificial ingredients, stabilisers, preservatives, vegetables oil etc and eat clean whole foods, nuts, and fatty fish. Its slightly more difficult but the benefit you get from not filling your body with all that trash pays off big time. 
I'd get some good quality hard cheeses, grass fed/organic meats (coles actually has a good range of grass fed red meat), some nuts (macadamias are best), some salmon (can get relatively inexpensive line caught salmon in springwater), broc &amp; cauliflower, spinach and eggs as some regular staples. Oh and olives/artichokes! 

Also check out Thomas delauer on youtube, he goes deep on the science of keto and what foods/fats to avoid and explains why.

In the second one, I definitely agree that for the sake of fairness it should not be ok to split states without compensating controls to ensure that it doesn't turn into super gerrymandering. What you proposed here is a pretty reasonable example - if you split California you also should split Texas.

In the first case though, I don't think that the balance of the Senate should factor into it whatsoever. I believe that these citizens of the United States have the right to be a part of a state, and have their say in the national government. If admitting them as a state means that the balance of power in the Senate shifts (in either direction, mind you), so be it. I'm concerned here with the rights of the citizens, not partisan bickering over which party winds up with more Senate seats.",1596240168

In which you technically still aren't allowed to break laws but can't be held accountable if you do, within reason. I figure 20km/h might've been a bit excessive if there was no injury or immediate threat of injury or worse so you being faster might've prevented from soaking through some more so you prevented some property damage.



When such emergency help is excessive the judicatives get really narky. Especially if you plowed over several swimmers only to safe some dudes sock bag or something.

"dauntless","t5_2vmcy","1. I feel like some changes were required, like the reliability of the interrupts for shadow touched nayzaga and shrike, however I feel that this didn‚Äôt fix the problem with nayzaga. Others I feel we‚Äôre unnecessary, such as the Kharaba interrupt changes. I feel that this isn‚Äôt entirely necessary and that it‚Äôs fight could turn into a stagger lock.

2. I feel that the other changes to Kharabak are better. The swarm is now less present, which may be a bad thing in the end, and newer player will have to worry about less blades. The Riftstalker interrupt in interesting. It is a strong stagger if you get it, but if you miss you are going to take some damage. I think this could help promote a more active way to dealing with Riftstalkers enrage, instead of hiding on top of rocks. The quill shot wind up change will be interesting. I haven‚Äôt experienced it enough yet to say for sure, but it will help newer players still.

3. As I said before, I don‚Äôt think we need all these new Kharabak staggers. It is kinda unnecessary and may result in new players not actually learning the fight, and instead learning how to capitalise off of the stagger locked behemoth. Also, I feel that the changes to thraxes aether lines will be difficult for a lot of players, as it seems that it can effectively cover a lot of the field in corruption. The rate at which it can happen may need to be tuned, but it‚Äôs still new, and so that may be unnecessary.

4. Like I said, I feel it may impact newer player a lot, especially those who don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. For veterans though, it seems to be a welcomed challenge. I don‚Äôt have much to say about the solo priority changes.

5. I feel the new interrupt isn‚Äôt needed, but the other changes will help newer players deal with its fight.

6. I think the wind up will help player better read the fight. As for the tusks, I don‚Äôt know what this will change exactly. Bar the obvious

7. It‚Äôs good that the frequency of teleports has been reduced, as it did get tedious in the past. The longer VFX is nice. The the interrupt will definitely help with mastery, as getting interrupts before took so long.

8. The new interrupt will be powerful, but if not don‚Äôt correctly, then it could end badly for the player. As for the portals, tight and reliable indicators is always good.

9. I can‚Äôt say I can comment on the changes to skraev, at least not very well, but reliability is good.

10. Once again, consistency and reliability is good, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed the warping changes though. 

11. I can‚Äôt say I pay a huge amount of detail to Gnashers head, before and after this update, same for its tail.

12. I haven‚Äôt really noticed the damage change.

13. I think that‚Äôs good. The fight can‚Äôt drag on a lot, and this will definitely affect trail times.

14. Overall, I would like behemoth interrupts/attacks/wind ups to be consistent and reliable. It can be annoying if you feel the attack wasn‚Äôt properly telegraphed. But primarily interrupts, especially on shadow touched nayzaga.",1596240170

&gt;Another feature that has been requested almost since the start, and which I keep rejecting is **quoting messages**.  Coming back to my disclaimer, of course it‚Äôs impossible to prevent  people from sharing screenshots or linking to public resources, but  quoting messages is *immediately actionable*. It makes it a lot  easier for people to immediately engage with the quoted content‚Ä¶ and it  usually doesn‚Äôt lead to anything good. When people use quotes to reply  to other people, conversations become performative power plays. ‚ÄúHeed,  my followers, how I dunk on this fool!‚Äù When you use the reply function,  your message is broadcast only to people who happen to follow you both.  It means one person‚Äôs follower count doesn‚Äôt play a massive role in the  conversation. A quote, on the other hand, very often invites the  followers to join in on the conversation, and whoever has got more of  them ends up having the upper hand and massively stressing out the other  person.

They may have backtracked on their position but it sounded like it was a core tenet of their philosophy. At any rate, I agree with their position on it as far as that blog post goes.",1596240171

"ActualPublicFreakouts","t5_27mtyi","&gt;It‚Äôs painting

The post(s) in this thread, or across the sub is not doing any of that by itself. You are inserting and/or projecting a lot of outside stuff into this. You're right on that this video is making people 'feel', most ""freakout"" videos does, the feelings are usually it's aimed towards the offender.  

The men in the video are the offenders, they're the ones doing all that bad behaviour you are listing, intentionally and quite happily. They're the so called """"nazi scumbag"""" you're looking for, they're trying to sow distrust, they are dehumanizing, painting individuals in broad terms right there in the video. Right infront of you. You can play the video again and see if for yourself.

They men in the video are not being victimized by having their video posted here, I'm sure they'd celebrate over the fact to be honest. They are not even the individuals you try to paint them as, they're a part of an organized effort.

To make assumptions on the nature of OP, or the sub you have to make a reach and guess. In the other hand to make assumptions about the men in the video, you just have to hit PLAY.

If it was a pedo freaking out in the video I doubt you'd come to his rescue. These men are utterly reprehensible in a similarily unjustifiable way. Since your old and wise, I'm sure you'll see some oddity to that.

Thanks for answering honestly, even if I don't happen to agree!

Some people suck, they are either taking advantage of the situation or don't have health coping mechanisms, it's just the way it is. It's important to realize that this people are in the significant minority. They are being highlighted because it's an easy way to dismiss the increasingly urgent calls to address systemic racism and sexism that exists in society. 

Growing up in a white conservative area I didn't see much racism, so I was somewhat ignorant. So it was surprising to me when people claimed it was still a problem. But the truth is that it is still a problem. 

The primary motive of BLM is to make people aware that racism has never gone away. It's been sheparded away from the eyes of the privileged. 

What you can do as a white person is to be an ally. Listen to people when they claim they are being abused. Recognize the hardships they unfairly face. Be actively anti-racist. Oppose those who would dismiss the outcry and maintain status quo. Support programs that encourage diversity and recognize that there is a responsibility to help those who have been disenfranchised to become empowered so they can operate on an equal playing field with the rest of us privileged people. 

The first thing you can do is recognize that we are not running around as an excuse. We have legitimate grievances. People of color are disproportionately targeted by police brutality and convicted of non violent crimes. So one concrete demand is to make that stop.

There are lots of concrete demands that can be made, but it's important to recognitize that racism is a multifaceted complex and systemic issue that doesn't have a set task list. We need to recognize that.",1596240173

Mais avec de la pratique, le fait d'avoir appris l'anglais assez t√¥t, pratiqu√© souvent et surtout TRAVAILLER son accent (parce que les gens oublient souvent que √ßa se travaille, lol), c'est possible d'applatir son accent qu√©b√©cois pas mal et d'arr√™ter de se faire coller l'√©tiquette de ""ti-qu√©becois"" dessus apr√®s 1/4 de syllabe.",1596240173

A multi armed bandit is just a model that can be used to select the optimal of several options and Q learning is applicable to this problem. 

A contextual bandit is a multi armed bandit that takes into account the ‚Äúcontext‚Äù of the situation to make an optimal choice. Note that neither UCB or Thompson Sampling are contextual bandit algorithms. They‚Äôre vanilla multi armed bandit algorithms. I‚Äôve usually seen contextual bandits thought of as a specific set of algorithms used to train MABs with context. Deep q learning is usually thought off as distinct to these algorithms. But I suppose you could think of it as a contextual bandit algorithm if you use it to train a MAB.",1596240173

The comment you replied to is advocating for imprisoning anyone with a possible infection.  They don't care about anyone's freedom, or the long-term consequences of giving the government too much power, or any of it.  Save us from the virus at all costs, they say.

Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, you have people like Jair Bolsonaro.  They claim it doesn't matter, literally right up until it has them on their deathbed.  Only then will they admit their mistake, when it's too late and the virus has spread far more than ever should have been possible.

Is it just me, or did they neglect to include data on the total number of people taking it over the time period (and, did not explicitly point that out)?  But they get into excruciating detail on slicing and dicing the adverse effects cases.  This is the type of statistical reporting that can easily persuade the average layman (complicated words, lots of numbers) to believe a certain thing, *while completely failing to communicate the actual statistical risk*.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","The simplest explanation I've heard I stole from someone on /r/skyrimmods :

Effectively a mad Russian wrote a lighting post processor that sits on top of Skyrim and completely revamps the way the game handles lighting.

ELFX changes lighting, but it uses all vanilla assets. Mostly it just changes where the light comes from. ENB completely changes the way lights and shadows are processed.

It doesn't install like a normal mod, more like SKSE. There's a couple of core files that get dropped in your data folder, then you download a preset for it that also gets dropped into data.

It can be A SEVERE resource hog, with some presets choking even the highest end graphics cards. But the results are worth it.

This video is a direct comparison between Rudy, one of the more popular presets, and the vanilla lighting:

No, the popular perception was that it was because the guy had taken advantage of her innocence. Not because he was too dumb to use a condom. Even in the 60s, teen girls were sent to homes for unwed mothers to have their kids and give them up for adoption (if they didn't get married first). The family made up a cover story of her going to live with a relative out of town for the duration. And when kids got married suddenly, people used to count the months until the first baby was born, just in case, you know (whispers) psst - she HAD to get married.

And in my experience, that changed because women demanded change (ERA) and planned parenthood made family planning available. Women's rights demanded that we have control over our own bodies.",1596240176

Humans can't have peace between themselves and save themselves, so I have little hope for them to save others. We can't even agree on what salvation is. Some may be human centered antinatalists or some people may think that preventing extinction is saving the species.

I'm not specifically against caring for the elderly. People should be able to care for who they want to and the elderly likely need more care. But, breeding a child just so that you have someone to care for you when you are older is wrong as the child will have to watch their parents decay and die, deal with medical expenses, and will have to face their own end of life care needs when they become old also-which could drive them to reproduce which would just be continuing the cycle of elderly needs. How specifically are humans going to solve the problem (old age, cycle of violence, disease, etc.) without also perpetuating the exact problem that they are trying to solve? Breeding as a solution would be wrong. If people are voluntarily immortal and have nothing better to do and I'm already gone and can't be forced into immortality, then that's whatever because I'm not around to care.",1596240176

No. They can still be creative, intriguing, fun, thought-provoking, gripping or well made in general. I can still recognize what is successfully creepy/eerie/scary in an artistic sense even if it doesn't have the effect of making me scared of the dark or making me afraid to look over my shoulder. 

To say that the sole purpose of horror movies is to scare people is a huge disservice to the genre and perhaps even the art of cinema as a whole.

Ademas el peronista de clase media o media alta no tiene la misma forma de ver las cosas que el peronista pobre. Porque usualmente aca se suele pintar al votante peronista como pobre o criminal que vive colgado del estado, pero es una demonizacion. He conocido varios peronistas que son de clase media y clase media alta, que tienen sus razones para ser fanaticos.

Personalmente creo que el sentimiento o emocion que suele usar ell peronismo es revalorizar la identidad de los votantes, como Argentinos, como trabajadores, como mujer con el voto femenino etc. Por algo uno de los insultos que suele usar el peronista es ""cipayo""(no digo que sea un termino solo usado por peronistas, though). Que   contrasta, en los origenes del peronismo, con la elite conservadora que gobernaba en esa epoca, cuando bastardizaban lo nacional y se le daba mas valor a ideas y culturas extranjeras, particularmente europeas. Entonces el peronista puede odiar al que tiene plata, pero como algo secundario, no es que odian al que tiene plata per se. 


De nuevo, ni en pedo soy peronista, pero creo que estas son las cosas que usa el peronismo para unir a las masas, mas que el odio al que tiene plata o al exito.",1596240178

I‚Äôm pointing out that it‚Äôs possible that none of em are veterans. Or they may all be veterans. They could be a group of dishonorable discharge veterans.  What if 40% of em didn‚Äôt even leave the country and got booted from the forces for sexual assault? 
But sexy headlines work for the masses.

It‚Äôs as ridiculous as one shit I read about a 16 year old dead from covid ‚Äúwas perfectly healthy‚Äù... but in fact he was diabetic and had other issues.

But how many people read that headline and that was it... fear conjured in their hearts.

Which leads us to inevitably good. I think covid is being used to further control the masses. But it‚Äôs necessary. There‚Äôs a lot of dirty fucks out there; fecal matter on keyboards, mcd kiosks, gas pumps, etc.  They need to be mindful.

I also believe we need widespread adoption of bidets in the west. And with toilet paper shortages a few months ago, bidet sales increased.

With thought monitoring, well, some people may correct their sick thoughts.  

But it is inevitable and will ultimately be good. We may lose a few billion people in the process but such is life.

"Sonsofanarchy","t5_2rbpl","&gt;Also what happened to Rat Boy? Maybe I missed something but wasn‚Äôt he alive and fine when it ended?

Yes, Rat Boy was alive and a fully-patched member of SAMCRO. He was, physically, just fine. But he was a murderer by the end. And accomplice to many more murders.

Rat Boy started prospecting for the The Sons when they were known to him as a Small-Town band of ruffians (as far as he knew. People suspect the Sons of stuff, but no one outside of SAMCRO *really* knows what they're up to, y'know?)

To become a member of SAMCRO Rat Boy had to

* get into drug trafficking for a Cartel,
* affiliate himself with Gun Smuggling for the Real IRA,
* aid and abet several murders,
* commit some murders,
* resign himself to a life of being violently attacked or killed any time a business partner gets angry with SAMCRO, (think about how Unser got carved up by the Neo Nazis, Collette and all those prostitutes at Diosa got gunned down, it was dumb-luck that SAMCRO escaped the bombing of the SAMCRO clubhouse and again at the ice cream shop).
* Most of the Members who he knew that might've influenced him to Prospect to begin with where killed violently and suddenly. Once these people died in service to SAMCRO, they weren't even buried properly (Opie, Piney, Phil, Half-Sack, VLin, Kozik, Bobby, Juice).
* People loved by the club were attacked or even killed due to Club Business (a Crow Eater, Tara, some TM mechanic, Tigs daughter)--so this means that if you (or a brother) piss off someone, you're family and friends could be fair game.
* Associate himself with several smaller, West Coast gangs: Byzlats, Niners, Mayans and The Triads--as we know, hanging with gang-bangers can land you in the wrong-place at the wrong time. You can get caught up in someone else's drive-by.

And after doing all these things, and accepting all this into his life, what did Rat Boy get out of the deal? Really?

He has the right to wear a specific leather vest all the time. That's it. He could've owned and ridden a Harley without being in the SOA.

He can be BFFs with the members of SOA charters around the nation/world, but as we have seen, being a SON means different things to different folk. So while some (Chibs, Tig and Happy) were down-for life, and loved the Club and really did see the members as their brothers;  Others (Peggy, Frankie Diamonds, Go-Go and Liam O'Neill for example) were in it but less about the Brotherhood and more about themselves and their own self-interests, so it's not a guarantee that every SOA member is a friend.

Really you have to wonder what anyone besides The First 9 and Jax+Opie got out of the club. It seem's like everyone else was constantly serving the club (even if they did a suck tastic job at it) out of blind love for the club. But what did the club really do for them? What tangible benefit did they get out of the club?",1596240180

I don't have much to say, except good luck, because you'll need it, but I guess there is one thing that could help you: School is temporary, and what happens after it depends on what you chose to do with your life. I know it's not a big weight off your shoulders when you have lots of things going on to think that ""yay you finished school"", but it actually opens you to a world where you have the highest probability to solve your problems. My advice is, once you're out there in this world by yourself, no school or anything to go to, find a job, no matter what it is, just what you need to live, and then take all your free time to do one thing that you like. I know with depression everything seems pointless and when you think of doing it you don't get the slightest hype for it, but if you manage to find anything you can live for, like reading, writing, drawing, walking, sleeping, eating, watching movies, gardening, thinking or anything, you might slowly get better and maybe it can work for you...

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","Your value as an employee is not a function of how hard you work, it is how profitable you are to the employer. 

People who are capable of higher profit tend to find their ways into higher paying positions naturally over time. Raising minimum wage to a ""living wage"" does not make entry level jobs more viable for employees, it makes entry level jobs scarcer and harder to get, thereby further removing the better and more established positions. We can see that already today, with every entry level job needing years of experience and education. 

I interned at my current job as an adult with a family and was living off of student loans and food stamps to make ends meet. After a year I was able to land a full position, which normally requires a degree and experience, long before I had graduated, because I demonstrated that I was worth far more than I was doing in my entry position. If that internship was required to be paid a living wage, they simply would not have had it (not coincidentally, the same was true of my apprenticeship).  I would not have got my foot in the door there, and it would have been a decade or more later before I would have qualified for the job I have today as an outside hire.

The alternative to low-paid jobs isn't high-paid jobs, it is no jobs, and this hurts society more than it would hurt companies. To go along with that, you shouldn't start working only once you need to support yourself. A good education includes job experience, and paying a kid a piddling wage to develop them into an adult who's work could support themselves and a family is a good thing.",1596240181

Title: **Got Partially Scammed Can I sue?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello reddit, im new posting here but have read many posts. I got scammed about two years back where I comissioned an artist to make something custom for me. After almost two years they would make excuses to why it wasnt done. They finally gave me what i ordered in February of this year however only part of the stuff was given to me. They still owe me about $650 worth that was never made. I have plenty of txts with dates and proof of payment. They continue to just say they will refund but it doesnt seem to be happening. Can I sue them in small claims court to get my money back?
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks for the future advice.

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","Hi Zophike1,

I wrote down some consequences in post above. What do you think about them?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**So NNs are GPs. Now what?** There are many applications, but let me rattle off a few as examples:  
&gt;  
&gt;Bayesians have always wondered, ""if I choose a randomly initialized NN as my prior, what exactly is this choice of prior I made?"" This paper answers such a question in a universal way: ""if the NN is wide, you've chosen a GP with some kernel that depends on the architecture and your initialization; you can calculate this kernel explicitly via tensor programs, if you'd like.""  
&gt;  
&gt;There is some strong correlation between the performance of NNs and their corresponding GPs: for example, convolutional NNs are better than MLPs on image datasets, just as the corresponding convolutional GPs are better than the MLP-GPs on the same datasets \[[4](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05148)\]. Thus, the kernels of these GPs capture inductive biases of the corresponding neural architecture.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kernels still work a lot better than NNs on small datasets (e.g. [6](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01663)), and the GP approach also gives you uncertainty estimates. This can be really valuable in certain situations like medical ML. So our result gives you a dictionary to convert good NN architectures into GPs.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the above insights, an interesting idea is doing architecture search with the NNGPs on small dataset, and then converting these to NNs for validation on large datasets.",1596240181

"bapcsalescanada","t5_2tesr","RAM compatibility is tied to your motherboard chipset. You only move on to a different generation (e.g., DDR3 vs DDR4) of RAM when you switch mobos.

If you're asking about capacity (i.e. total size of RAM space), you should upgrade when your current usecase is getting close to the max available in your system. That is, if you have 8GB of RAM but your regular workload is taking up to 6 or 7 GB, then it'll be worth getting more RAM soon.

If you're looking to maximise FPS or performance, you're looking to getting faster timings, lower latency, and better silicon. There's more to it than I could fit in a few sentences but these are the factors that seem to impact the newest Ryzen chips the most in terms of performance.

Imo, the extra (~5% or so) performance from min-maxing your RAM specs is not worth it for the vast majority of people or unless perhaps you're an enthusiast and enjoy tinkering with this kinda thing.

"theouterworlds","t5_s0f94","Don't know what you mean by ""TRUE RPG"".   Many would argue that Fallout 3 and above are not true RPG's.

All don't know what you mean by ""true open world"".   I think you use the word ""true"" too much.  True is an absolute, and you are talking about subjective things.

However, the answer to that question is very easy.  No, it isn't true open world, because it isn't open world, at all.   It's not set is an single location like: Las Vegas, DC, or Boston, so there is not a central location that it is centered around.  You travel to different places in TOW, and, while there is some room to wander and explore, that space is very limited.  Also, you aren't free to explore the system at will.  Certain places have to be unlocked, so it is fairly linear, in that respect.

If you are someone that only likes open world games, then this one is probably not for you.

There is a good variety of weapons for all types (1 handed melee, 2 handed melee, pistols, rifles, and heavy weapons).  They can be tinkered with to level them up, and they can be modded to improve them and/or change the damage type.

You can also tinker armor to level it up and give better protection. Mods can increase carry weight, and can change the skill bonuses of the armor.

You cannot remove mods, but mods are fairly plentiful, as are parts.  plus you can break down weapons and armor for parts, and with the right perks and/or skill levels, you can increase the change of getting mods when you break down an item.

It's a good game, but doesn't have the depth or size of a Fallout game.  It does have good companions, and you can take 2 with you and you get them fairly early on.",1596240184

1. We do NOT have high speed inter-vlan performance needs, most intervlan in our branch is RDP / management traffic.
2. Our branch remote connections top out at 200Mbit so the PA-220 with everything turned on can still run at that speed.


https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/products/product-comparison?chosen=pa-820,pa-220

The ONLY limit we have hit in our branches is the 15 security zones, now you would think that is a lot for a branch however we where migrating from our current VLAN config to a new VLAN config and trying to use templates, the limit prevented us from having the old and new zones existing at the same time for easy migration.. We worked around it but I thought it was worth pointing out.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

My neighborhood has 2 laundromat for the people living there. One In the same building as I live in and one about 300 m away, maybe 3 minute walk. There is a reservation computer system for the washers but not the dryers. Usually if you need the dryer more than once in a row you show up a bit before the machine is done.

I did a bit of laundry in the other washing room since the washers were taken. I then decided to dry it in ""my"" laundromat since I had a workshop this weekend (not American) and needed some towels ready, because I was driving and was gonna pick up my gear(including towels, which I was washing) and didn't wanna delay the people I was picking up any more than necessary.
I came into the laundromat which was empty and one dryer had just been started and the other one was just tumbling, meaning it was done so I emptied it into a basked and put mine in. 
Some woman (60s) comes in and starts berating me:
Her""so you just emptied the machine?""
Me""yes, it's over there""
Her""I was using it""
Me""it was done""
Her""JUST done""
Note, this is loosely translated and there is no way for me to know how Long it has been since the machine was done. The woman starts berating me (25m) about being disrespectful and that I hadn't even done any washing and some more. I'm not a native speaker so I didn't catch all of it. So I end up telling her ""well I have already payed and started so I am using the machine now"" she then yells about me using the program im using and I go ""yeah yeah"" and she yells at me to shut up. This makes me angry so I yell back ""no you shut up fuck you"" since I was honestly very angry at this point, since I tried to be polite and she was berating from the first moment. So AITA?

On the other hand, I get more and more confident every time something comes up that they are true. Hopeless optimism I know, but there has been too much recently for me to not think it could be happening. Dead By Daylight DLC, soundtracks from old SH games being released on vinyl and music streaming services, Robbie the Rabbit figurines going on sale, and now an official twitter account made this month, confirmed to be real by Konami. They very easily could have just not responded to the fan reaction to that tweet, instead, they replied and included their brand new Silent Hill twitter handle. Seems a little to convenient to just be a coincidence. Let‚Äôs not forget that Dusk Golems leaks, where a large part of these rumors come from, were 100% accurate with RE8. He said he wasn‚Äôt confident it would be at the event RE8 was announced at and thought it might be in August. I could very well be wrong, and if I am then I am sorry for any hope I might have built, but it seems like there is too much recently for an IP that hasn‚Äôt had any form of new content since PT for something to not be happening, and happening soon.

MCC on PC is a steal. Buy the whole set instead of each individual game. They still haven't released Halo 3: ODST or Halo 4, so you have a lot to look forward to.

In multiplayer, you can select which game and modes you want through the menu before starting matchmaking. You can select multiple games to rotate through as well. Also, pretty much all the launch bugs including lag, sound, and frame rate issues have been fixed.

When you look at reviews, look at the ones that came out after Halo 3 dropped.

"AskTrumpSupporters","t5_3cr3o","&gt;It was originally directly quoted in my initial response. 

Your quote was literally a link to my comment.

&gt;I presume Fauci. He is the doctor. 

What is that based on? From what I've seen on this sub that doesn't seem to be the case so maybe you've talked to other supporters. You think people care more about expertise over who they find more influential? Can you tell me where that comes from?


&gt;It seems to me that you arent clear on your position or questions for me to respond accurately. I even asked to to declare your position a couple of messages ago and you still have not done so and you gave an avoidant answer. 

I literally told you my point, pretty sure you didn't respond to it. Can you explain how my questions mentioned the right to do something and the good or bad of tweeting?

&gt;Did I say that? I did say that I dont know the details of Manson so I cannot compare. 

Based on your opinion of personal responsibility I'm assuming you wouldn't want him in prison. I'm pretty sure he wasn't a hypnotist.

&gt;Dont know. 

Any guesses? 

&gt;Then make an assertion because if I want to have a conversation with myself then I dont need to include you. 

Sure, but when I make an assertion you somehow twist it into an attack on Trump's freedom to talk. 

&gt;It should be taken for what it is. It is a social media platform to output short form opinions

That doesn't mean anything though. Who isn't taking it as what it objectively is? We're talking about its effects.

&gt;In your hypothetical, the actions would have originated with the original tweet. I would think this common sense to not need to answer. 

So then you don't believe in personal responsibility... If someone becomes more homophobic due to someone's tweet then it's because that tweet yeah?

&gt;Any information can affect the world. I have now repeatedly stated this. 

My point was that information from someone influential affects the world more. Do you agree? When I've asked this you talk about people can decide if they are impacted which wasn't the question.

&gt;I can agree to both of these questions. 

That's not what you were saying at the start, thus the questions.

&gt;I dont buy this. If you are such a snowflake than that is your own personal problem. We do NOT have a right to not hear things we do not like in this country. 

Who said anything about rights? It is a personal problem. Why don't you think words can hurt? 

&gt;He didnt say it was because of a shortage. He said we didnt need it.

That's definitely not in the clip that you showed me or your initial statement. 

&gt;Your traps are easy.

It's not a trap. Is that a problem? Does it depend on who the person is?",1596240190

Otherwise, three sessions isn't going to have much impact on the legacy aspect of the game. You can play as many as 50 sessions before ending the campaign (see link). You can even pick up where the previous owner left off and should have a good experience. Scenarios are admittedly kinda repetitive anyway -- KILL ALL ENEMIES.

(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; The Neon Demon received a mixed response from critics. Much like Refn's previous film, Only God Forgives, the film received both boos and a standing ovation during its premiere at Cannes Film Festival. It holds a 59% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 5\.88\/10\. The site's consensus reads, ""The Neon Demon is seductively stylish, but Nicolas Winding Refn's assured eye can't quite compensate for an underdeveloped plot and thinly written characters."" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".

I expected a bounce when Fed announced infinite QE and made some money on calls but I really reeeeeally expected we'd break the previous lows especially if Covid was still exploding come August.

This market is a fantasy because billionaires must not lose money, they will use these gains to buy assets on the cheap in the coming years and probably leave retail investors holding the bag. Then they'll buy the market at new lows off retail investors. I think the March sell off was so fast / sudden the elite realized they weren't appropriately derisked so jack up money printing and government spending, give out free money for retail to pile in, derisk, then watch the bottom fall out. Or we are seeing hyperinflation.

In previous seasons they would have no limit on the amount of engines or gearboxes, so they would turn it up to 11 and have one engine for qualifying, one engine for one race then throw it out.

This was extremely expensive but with no limits on engines everyone had to do it.

To help keep costs somewhat manageable they limit the number of engines and gearboxes you can use throughout the season. Gearboxes have to last 6 consecutive races.

Without a penalty for going over the number of engines or not lasting the specified races there really is no teeth to the regulations.

That's a nice savings.  That's about 15% of the first stimulus package. 

Not saying this is why murrica is OK with letting people die. But I mean. 12 billion ain't pocket change to anyone or anything. 

Also since stonks are going up its a win win for government. If you lose, money goes into that business which boosts economy. Of you win you pay taxes on it. And there will be A LOT of people paying taxes next year from this trend.

They try to spend everything they earn, sometimes outspend their earnings, wrack up credit card debt, and end up bogged down making payments forever. Even people with good paying jobs are often a missed paycheck away from everything falling apart.

The dealer was advising you against the big down payment because they make their money off big loans spread out over a long time, and then stuff a bunch of extra crap in the payments. A big down payment ruins their game.

The one exception here, if you get a 0% loan it benefits you to put a small amount down. Today's dollars are worth more than future dollars, plus you could invest today's dollars. Any time you have an interest rate, you end up saving quite a bit of money with a big down payment.",1596240195

Sonic üò≥ the Hedgehog ü¶î lowered his üëã panties üëô and went üí® into a squatting position üê©. 

It was a quiet ü§´ü•î, slightly ‚úã rainy üåß night üåö. 

‚ÄúGotta go üí® fast...‚Äù 

Sonic üò≥ could faintly hear üëÇ the music üé∂ from the Reddit ü§ñ college üèòüë±üìö flat ü•ø he üë® had just run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è out of. 

From his üëã position ü§® on the sixth floor ü§£, Sonic üò≥ could overlook the area ‚ö†üíÄ. 

No üö´ one ‚òù was there. 

Sonic üò≥ just stopped üõë holding ‚úäüèª it in and the thought ü§î of the relief üòÖ that was to come üí¶ was only disturbed by the smell üëÉ of cigarette üö¨ smoke üö¨. 

It was as if Sonic's butt üçë was forced üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è open üò´ by a garden üè° hose üí¶ that was hidden üëÄ inside üí† it. 

There was a continuous üîÅ and heavy üí¶ flow üòä for at least üëá ten ‚Äº minutes ‚è≥. 

There were a few tiny üòë solid ‚ô¶ pieces üòèüçë that caused pleasure üôè as they hit üî® his üëã butthole üçë‚≠ï while exiting. 

Sonic üò≥ was shaking ‚ö† so much üò©üòÇüôÄ that when ü§î he üë® began üîò to pee ‚ö°, the natural üå± red üî¥ liquid üå´üí¶ would not even üåÉ flow ‚û°üëÖüí¶ continuously üîÅ. 

Although üòè Sonic üò≥ was not completely üö´ empty üòúüòò, and a burning üî• feeling arose ‚¨Ü in that region, Sonic üò≥ felt light üòÄ again üîÅ and his üëã bloated üçï belly üôèüèª was turning üîÑ into its graceful ü§ï, skinny üíÖüèªüëë figure üñê again üîÅ. 

Suddenly üóØ, there was a voice üó£, ""Did the gutter üòõüòã tear üò≠ or something?"" 

A second ‚è± voice üòÉüîäüì¢, apparently üëÄ a girl üëß, added üñï, ""My neck üëî is wet üí¶"". 

Sonic üò≥ realized üëÄ that he üë® was caught üé£. 

Sonic üò≥ put üëè his üëã hands on his üëã stomach üôà to increase ‚¨Üüìà the pressure üîµ to finish üëÖ as soon üîú as possible üîù when ü§î a voice üîä down ‚¨á there said üó£, ""Someone üë© is up ‚òù there."" 

A flashlight üî¶‚ö° flashed up ‚òù from below üëáüèª. 

Sonic üò≥ was scared üí•üôä, and then the second ü•à wave üåä came üí¶ out of him üë¥. 

Below üëáüèª Sonic üò≥, a scream üó£ rose üåπ through the night üò¥, ""Shit üí©, that's ‚ùå shit üí©"". 

""He's üßí shitting üí© on us üá®üá≥"" 

""No üö´ dude üë®üèª, do you üëâüèª see üëÅ that? That's ‚Üó a fucking üñï hedgehog ü¶î"". 

Sonic üò≥ quickly üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wiped üßª with his üëã hands, like üíõ he üßí always ‚ôæ does (and never ‚ùå washing üßºüõÅ them after üëÄ). 

The flashlight üî¶ from the platform ü§ñüçéüêß on the floor ü§£ below üëáüèª Sonic üò≥ was still üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è lighting ü§©üí° up ‚¨Ü. 

They could see üëÄ enough üí¶ to make üõ† a rude üò§ comment üí¨ about his üëã genitalia. 

Sonic üò≥ continued ‚è© to wipe üßª his üëã anus üçë with his üëã fingers üñê over üò≥üôäüí¶ his üëã butthole üçë‚≠ï like üëç toilet üöΩ paper üßª. 

He üë®üèæ then put üëè on his üëã panties üëô again üîÅ and rushed üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è back üîô inside üí†. 

The flat üï≥üåéüö® was only a few doors üö™ away ü•∞üòòüòä. 

Sonic üò≥ had left üëà the door üîë open üò´, so he üë® got üí™ back ‚¨Ö inside üí†. 

Sonic üò≥ had only been gone ‚ùî for a few minutes ‚è≥ and as he üë® knew üôÄüôà only a few people üë• there, no üö´ one ‚òù seemed üöπüö§ to have noticed üé∂üòÆüÖø that he üë® was gone üòå. 

Sonic üò≥ was planning üìë on leaving üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, as he üë® was not feeling well ü§î. 

Sonic üò≥ went üí® to pick üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëΩüêï up ‚òù his üëã cardigan that he üë® had left üëà at the place üèÜ he üë® had been sitting üí∫ at. 

When ‚ùì Sonic üò≥ was about to get out. 

Someone üë© was yelling üò´üò≤üôÄ outside ‚ùåüèûüèô and knocking ‚ú®üòª‚öæ at the door üö™. 

Sonic üò≥ rushed üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è back üîô as far üëâüëÄ as possible üôÄüçÜ. 

Someone üë§ had opened üÜô the door üîë. 

The person üë´ that opened üÜô the door üö™ started üí¢ screaming üó£ against the people üë´ yelling üò´üò≤üôÄ from outside ‚ùåüèûüèô. 

Alarmed from the screams üôÄ, the people üë• from inside üí† the flat üåçüó∫ rushed üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to the door üö™. 

The situation üçÜüí¶üò™ turned üîÉ into chaos. 

Standing üï¥ outside üèû were the people üë´ Sonic üò≥ had just pooped on. 

As everyone üëç screamed üò´ gibberish while being covered üí¶ in poop üí©, they presumed to be crazed and their attempts üö´ to come üí¶ in were fended off with a 50-inch double üëè dildo üçÜ. 

Within ü§ûüëè seconds üïë, the whole üï≥ floor üòÇ showed ü¶¥ up ‚òù. 

The situation üò© did not calm üí£ down ‚¨á, the people üë´ outside üåÑ were looking üëÄ for the person üë• that did this. 

Sonic üò≥ did not see üëÄ them but üçë he üë®üèæ heard üëÇ people üë´ saying üó£ that they were covered üí¶ in feces üòªü§§üòã. 

Sonic üò≥ went üè† onto üê¶ the balcony üò± when ‚ùì someone üë§ from the neighboring flat ü•ø went üí® into their balcony üò± and started üÜï yelling üò´üò≤üôÄ down ‚¨á for help üÜò. 

This attracted üíã a further audience üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß from outside üò°‚õ±üèï. 

The people üë´ outside üåÑ couldn't be convinced üÜò to return ‚Ü© to their flat üåçüó∫. 

Sonic üò≥ used ‚ô¶ the first üíúüîÆ opportunity to escape üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

Many üë¨ people üë´ were rushing üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è up ‚¨Ü the stairs üí•üôäüò≥ to see üëÄ the outraging situation üéÆ and despite üö´ looking üëÄ very üíØ normal üë©‚Äçü¶Ø, Sonic üò≥ expected any of them to identify üåà him üë¥ as the culprit. 

When ‚ùì Sonic üò≥ returned to his üëã flat ü•ø, Sonic üò≥ cleaned üßºüßΩ fapped a bit üòÅ and pooped some more. 

Sonic's roommate üë¨ Demetri returned two ‚úå hours üïê later üïë, he üë® showed üì∫ Sonic üò≥ some photos üì∏ he üë® had made üêß of the poor üí™üá∏üá∞üëå people üë• below üëáüèª him üë¥. 

Sonic üò≥ had completely üö´ hit üëä them ‚Äì two ‚úåüèª guys üë® and one 1Ô∏è‚É£ girl üë∂. 

Sonic üò≥ went üè† to bed üõè shortly ü§è afterward. 

Rumors ü§ê about the event üé´ spread üí∞ quickly ‚ö° on Fuckbook. 

Sonic's unintentional victims üÜòü§ï apparently üí¢ gave üéÅ a description üòÆ to the building üí™üèæ management üíº, that caused amusement ‚Äì they were looking üëÄ for a boy üë¶ with a blue üîµ shirt üíïüßöüèªüòç. 

When ü§î interested üí¢üò†üí• people üë´ asked ‚ùì for a more precise description üó£, the words ""huge üôå penis üëÄ"" was used ‚ô¶ in official notices ü§í. 

Luckily ü§û, their description ü§ê was not correct ‚úÖ, they mistook Sonic's blue üßÄ fur üêªüê±üê∂ for a shirt üíïüßöüèªüòç.",1596240196

You are trying to make sin seem trivial. Christians should NOT ever do anything they know God doesnt want them to. They that do continue willfully in sin will perish.

We are saved through faith, meaning trust and confidence in God. If you do not obey Him, you cant trust Him. It's that simple. 

obedience = faith

God warns us few people will be saved. Why? Because they do not take heed to God's warnings and live in strict obedience until Him but they continue on living for themselves and the pleasures of the world.",1596240196

I guess we just have a difference of opinion on the role of government.

To me, I do generally want the government to stay out of peoples lives when it comes to privacy, rights, free speech, and just generally letting people do what they want if it doesnt cause anyone else harm. 

But I do think the federal government has a responsibility to address what I would call ""National Issues"". Problems that don't just affect some local area, but large portions of the population across large geographic area.

Most people generally agree that the most basic function of government is to protect its citizens from death. 

Well doesn't implementing policy, like say a form of universal healthcare system, that extends the average lifespan of like 20% of the population kinda fit that definition? Or some kind of reform that results in our police officers kill fewer suspects, criminal or innocent.

It's debatable I suppose, but I am firmly on my side here. 

I just think think there are some issues that can't be addressed locally, that a large scale, consistent, even implementation across the US is the only way to effectively address the problem. This pandemic is a good example.",1596240196

"naturism","t5_2qpeg","&gt; Yes, you're right, but you're ignoring the fact that for those who have this hobby, decriminalization would make it easier and safer to practice their hobby. If I wanna skinny dip with friends and there's a perfectly good pool in my back yard or a secluded spot at a lake, I and all my friends have to worry about getting arrested. So our only safe option is to drive hours to a resort or beach, pay money, and make a day trip/vacation out of it, which puts up a pay wall. With decriminalization, we don't have to worry about that, and the end of the pay wall means it's easier to get people into naturist activities in the first place. So whether it's moral or not, I don't see how criminalizing nudity is good for business.

First of all, in most places if you‚Äôre practicing it on your own property, there‚Äôs little others can do to stop you from doing it. I see your point with decriminalization, but the thing is I still firmly believe that it should just be up to certain locations whether or not they want to have it legalized. It shouldn‚Äôt be up to the national government to decide that. 

&gt; We also haven't talked about the social effect that illegality has on the public's view of naturism. It's true that social change is often bottom up, but it's also true that it's frequently the other way around. Take gay marriage for example: in the US, it was seen as foolhardy to run on a campaign for gay marriage for Democrats as close to legalization as Obama's first term. Then as soon as it's declared legal by the Supreme Court, boom, you start seeing a ton of support for it even amongst the right, or at least a resignation to the reality. Naturism may not have the exact same effect of course, but getting that bottom up effect is difficult without some relaxation of the law, because being able to demonstrate non-sexual, peaceful nudity is a much stronger statement than mere words.

I can see why you‚Äôd think it would work, but I‚Äôll mention Spain again as an easy example. Legal changes doesn‚Äôt typically make social changes just like that. It works more for the other way around. I personally think the social change towards LGBT rights in 2015 was more of an anomaly because it got companies involved. 

&gt; You know what, let's say you're right. Let's say it's a problem when a dude jogs naked through Central Park. Do you think that person should be jailed for that activity, or do you think it would be enough to simply fine them and tell them to put clothes on? Because I don't think that's a jailable offense, or it shouldn't be, at least. 

If this person has been warned before but refuses to obey the law, yes I believe it should be jailable. 

&gt; I think you're still skirting around the fact that criminalizing non-sexual public nudity means stripping people of their rights for what may be problematic behavior, but what ultimately doesn't cause permanent damage to anyone or anything. Cussing out strangers is problematic behavior, and so is cat calling. Doesn't mean it should be criminal, and I'd argue that those are worse than merely seeing a naked person sun bathing in the park.

And I‚Äôd argue that there are worse things than a naked body, but the problem is that I think we shouldn‚Äôt legalize it for the reasons I mentioned earlier. I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just not going to agree with you here. I don‚Äôt believe we should decriminalize or legalize public nudity country wide.",1596240196

I had a game where I was Eudora. It was going very well for me.

There was also a Bigglesworth in my lobby.

The two of us never played each other.

As the game went on I was knocking out play after player. I think I killed 4 of the 5 people in the lobby before I finally faced Bigglesworth - and he demolished me!

He had gone the whole game looting the corpses of all the people that I had easily destroyed to the point that he had the best of everyone that I previously faced.

In the end he won the lobby. All thanks to his highroll, and avoided having to play against me (Eudora) until the very end.

"WGUIT","t5_35m63","Ive attended 3 different colleges. While the first 2 were brick and mortar schools, I only took classes online. WGU is very similar, except they provide a mentor who actually tries to help you along the way. Other colleges dont have that, and seeing a counselor at regular college takes forever, is a hassle, and they dont know you or anything about you.   
if you dont learn well on your own, then online schooling may not be the right choice for you. but, looks like all colleges are mainly only offering online classes right now and for the undetermined amount of time in the future.   


I will say, the draw to wgu for me was the go at your own pace thing. Being able to fit as many classes as I can into 1 term, sold me on this. And Ive taken 8 of the 10 courses required for my Masters in the last 3 months. Seems very likley Ill get my masters in 1 6 month term. You cant get that anywhere else. BUT I am in IT and much of this I already knew so it was easy. (a lot of it, but not all!!!)   
Most f the classes have webinars available, (like pre recorded lectures from the teachers) But it is a lot of just reading the material. For software development I would bet theres a lot of hands on learning required. But... I dont know.   
I think it all just depends on your learning style. And you can always take a udemy course as a supplemental learning resource if you need to.",1596240197

I'm sick of people inferring that because I host child rapists at my house to rape children, that I would ever rape a child!

When they are 18 I'll fuck them all day, and if they are child beauty pageant contestants I like to go backstage and watch them dress! But fuck them? No! If I was going to fuck a child it would be my daughter.  She's got the nicest tits but she's my daughter so fucking her would be weird.  Id like to clarify that I've said many times if she wasn't my daughter I'd fuck her, but I can't, she's my daughter!  Damn!

Not everybody who associated with pedophiles is a pedophile, some of the friends didnt even fuck children, most did, but definitely not me",1596240197

The overruled call was the hit by the WSU player on our QB which was called on the field then overruled.  The hit on their QB was never called on the field, and simply missed on replay. 

Honestly, both should have been called, and both players ejected.  But bring up the truth and a bunch of butthurt WSU fans downvote it.  Ever since the game happened, if you bring up the actual facts of the story it gets downvoted.  The truth is that the controversy did help WSU, and the later call was just simply missed.

"JUSTNOFAMILY","t5_3a182","My parents said similar stuff all the time, blaming me and my siblings for why they were such horrible people. To the point that out of five children, I'm the only one who had my own kids and even then I married with the agreement of being child-free, but my wife changed her mind and convinced me to have kids. 

Since having my own kids I've realised that every nasty, evil, manipulative guilt ridden thing they did was all for themselves. They were doing it to relieve stress, because it amused them, or for shits and giggles. They found tormenting their kids to be a hobby of theirs and took huge pleasure in it. 

Now that I'm the only one with the glorious grandchildren, they have to behave and respect my boundaries, or I just cut them off for however long I feel like it. My daughter is 18 now and loathes my mother and doesn't really have anything to do with my dad. 

So your problems with your mother are on her. You sound like a good kid and now you get to mend things with your dad, which it sounds like your mother engineered the relationship so you wouldn't like him. 

Refuse anything from her, no presents, no money, nothing. Tell her you don't want to let her think you forgive her for the years of abuse by accepting her bribes. That if she wants to mend things she will have to apologise and admit to her actions and if she can't or will not acknowledge what she has done, then you have nothing to talk about. 

Soon enough you will be independent and her usual methods of control will be useless on you. You don't have to fix anything, that's all on her. So don't feel guilt about cutting her out of your life. She told you she was cutting you from her life, so you are just respecting her wishes, but if she changes her mind has a fuckload to do to heal things between you.",1596240198

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Sure, structure the bankruptcy in such a way that a new company, ""New Air Canada"" takes over all of the viable parts and is wholly owned by the federal government until they divest in a few years time at a profit. There is no reason to help out the shareholders. When you play the stock market, you risk loss. If shareholders lose everything, that's what they signed up for!

Even if the government didn't step in and Air Canada failed, a new entry would replace it. The planes would still exist. The skilled labour would still exist. The need for a Canadian entry for domestic flights would bounce back. The airport real estate would still exist. There are Canadians with enough capital to do contracts with Airbus and Boeing to lease planes. We would once again have a national carrier.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I‚Äôve been on Bupropion XL 300mg(generic Wellbutrin) for about 4 years now. When I first started it took about 2 to 3 weeks for me to noticed my irritability decrease and whenever I‚Äôd miss a full week of doses it‚Äôd take 2 weeks to get the effects back. Through the 4 years I‚Äôve been on bupropion it has always suppressed my sex drive substantially... But antidepressants, especially Wellbutrin are really subjective in the side effects they cause. Through my time in rehab I met a lot of people on different antidepressants and the side effects are different for everyone. They can increase or reduce libido, for either gender. From what I‚Äôve seen though it usually swings one way or the other with Wellbutrin. Bottom line is I‚Äôd give it a shot for a few weeks and see how it plays out!
P.S. Wellbutrin is an NDRI not an SNRI",1596240200

Its a total, complete and utter failure. 

Portugal is a great example. They legalized the use of all drugs and treat it as a health issue instead of a crime and tgey are doing great on that side. The netherlands are one of the lowest consumption of weed in europe.  Meanwhile the country with the harsher regulation is also the one with the highest use rate ( France ).

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt;I think we may agree more than disagree on the topic. 

I think so too. 

&gt;I don‚Äôt believe it works similar to a bank account in terms of compounding interest, but is better represented via MM multiplier effects but spread out over a significant length of time at uneven intervals, resulting in a relatively negligible impact to any one period and cumulatively having an immaterial impact on long-term growth.

This doesn't bear out in the data. Recessions do have long term impacts on GDP. https://www.nber.org/digest/nov14/w20185.html. A significant reduction in aggregate demand here would be essentially indistinguishable from a recession, but dampen the effects of future recessions.

&gt;And I also believe that the government should be spending contra-cyclical, which does mean increased deficits during recessions, but also means surpluses during expansionary cycles which is key to mitigating eventual collapse.

Agreed, but given the current reality of stagnant real wages and constant decrease in GDP I think it's a political non-starter. I would love for it to happen, I just know that it very likely won't.

Ultimately, I agree that this could be done with enough coordination and government intervention. I just think that the political will just isn't there for it to happen, and it will likely have a significant impact on the economy.",1596240201

You really think Kanye is just disgusted by the black community for ""straying from God, and getting abortions""? How far does your logic really go?  Also, you've been following his tweets and the articles, but you missed the article he tweeted out right before this, about Planned Parenthood distancing itself from it's founder because **SHE SUPPORTED EUGENICS?!** You're far more concerned with being right than actually understanding the issue, and it shows, lmao.",1596240203

Sonic the Hedgehog lowered his panties and went into a squatting position.

It was a quiet, slightly rainy night.

‚ÄúGotta go fast...‚Äù

Sonic could faintly hear the music from the Reddit college flat he had just run out of.

From his position on the sixth floor, Sonic could overlook the area.

No one was there.

Sonic just stopped holding it in and the thought of the relief that was to come was only disturbed by the smell of cigarette smoke.

It was as if Sonic's butt was forced open by a garden hose that was hidden inside it.

There was a continuous and heavy flow for at least ten minutes.

There were a few tiny solid pieces that caused pleasure as they hit his butthole while exiting.

Sonic was shaking so much that when he began to pee, the natural red liquid would not even flow continuously. 

Although Sonic was not completely empty, and a burning feeling arose in that region, Sonic felt light again and his bloated belly was turning into its graceful, skinny figure again.

Suddenly, there was a voice, ""Did the gutter tear or something?""

A second voice, apparently a girl, added, ""My neck is wet"".

Sonic realized that he was caught.

Sonic put his hands on his stomach to increase the pressure to finish as soon as possible when a voice down there said, ""Someone is up there.""

A flashlight flashed up from below.

Sonic was scared, and then the second wave came out of him.

Below Sonic, a scream rose through the night, ""Shit, that's shit"".

""He's shitting on us"" 

""No dude, do you see that? That's a fucking hedgehog"". 

Sonic quickly wiped with his hands, like he always does (and never washing them after).

The flashlight from the platform on the floor below Sonic was still lighting up.

They could see enough to make a rude comment about his genitalia.

Sonic continued to wipe his anus with his fingers over his butthole like toilet paper.

He then put on his panties again and rushed back inside.

The flat was only a few doors away.

Sonic had left the door open, so he got back inside. 

Sonic had only been gone for a few minutes and as he knew only a few people there, no one seemed to have noticed that he was gone.

Sonic was planning on leaving, as he was not feeling well. 

Sonic went to pick up his cardigan that he had left at the place he had been sitting at.

When Sonic was about to get out.

Someone was yelling outside and knocking at the door. 

Sonic rushed back as far as possible.

Someone had opened the door.

The person that opened the door started screaming against the people yelling from outside.

Alarmed from the screams, the people from inside the flat rushed to the door.

The situation turned into chaos.

Standing outside were the people Sonic had just pooped on.

As everyone screamed gibberish while being covered in poop, they presumed to be crazed and their attempts to come in were fended off with a 50-inch double dildo. 

Within seconds, the whole floor showed up.

The situation did not calm down, the people outside were looking for the person that did this.

Sonic did not see them but he heard people saying that they were covered in feces.

Sonic went onto the balcony when someone from the neighboring flat went into their balcony and started yelling down for help.

This attracted a further audience from outside.

The people outside couldn't be convinced to return to their flat.

Sonic used the first opportunity to escape.

Many people were rushing up the stairs to see the outraging situation and despite looking very normal, Sonic expected any of them to identify him as the culprit.

When Sonic returned to his flat, Sonic cleaned fapped a bit and pooped some more.

Sonic's roommate Demetri returned two hours later, he showed Sonic some photos he had made of the poor people below him.

Sonic had completely hit them ‚Äì two guys and one girl. 

Sonic went to bed shortly afterward.

Rumors about the event spread quickly on Fuckbook. 

Sonic's unintentional victims apparently gave a description to the building management, that caused amusement ‚Äì they were looking for a boy with a blue shirt.

When interested people asked for a more precise description, the words ""huge penis"" was used in official notices.

Luckily, their description was not correct, they mistook Sonic's blue fur for a shirt.",1596240203

I'm not saying that Republicans are any better. All politicians are corrupt and not trustworthy. But at the very least they are not putting through legislature that destroys the black community. 

Look at the black community now vs before LBJ's Great Society policies vs after. Mass incarceration, 70% single motherhood rate, an unimaginable amount of crime and poverty.

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","First off, I like Laca and don't think we need to part ways with him. Though, i think it makes sense to do so for the right deal IF we keep Auba.

Laca is 29, so if we're going to get any sort of sizable return for him then we need to do it now. Meanwhile, we have  Pepe who plays out on the wings, and have invested in Saka who (while young) regularly plays on the other wing. Auba is our best striker, and should be allowed to play from the central position IMO. We can use his sale to fund another younger attacking player, who might be a bit more ""creative"" which is something we tend to lack nowadays. 

Additionally, while I think Laca's presence is great and he works hard when tracking back, is he going to be a focal point of our club in 2-3 years? Its a cost-benefit type thing. Laca might help us out next year and the year after, but we need to build a team that is competitive with top clubs in 3-5 years. Laca probably won't be a focal point of the club at that time, what could we get to invest in the future of the club instead?

I think its a hard choice. I do like having laca on the squad, I'd have a very concrete plan of what i'm doing if I were to move on from him. But I think its understandable if we do choose to move on.",1596240204

Is the store owner guilty of assault and battery?  Oh Yes.

Do you have to leave a store or business to be stopped for theft?

**NO YOU FUCKING DON'T.**  It's amazing how many people think this.  

In most states, as soon as you conceal an item or even attempt to in many states, you can be stopped for shoplifting.  **In no state in the US, is it required that a thief leave the store or go past the last POS to be stopped.**  That's an urban myth that needs to die.

I spent over two decades in LP and in retail management before I retired, I know the laws backwards and forwards. 

Most retailers will have their own policies in place that will require this, but it is not the law.  The only reason they have it in place, is to limit their liability and to make it a slam dunk in court if they decide to prosecute.  We aggressively prosecuted shoplifters both in criminal and civil court.  Our conviction rate was almost 99%.",1596240204

so much wrong information in this post.

for example you don't need gold or a demount kit to move your equipement to an other slot, so you will get the bonus.

and did you even realize, that equipement will become way cheaper than before for lower tier tanks?
Binos for example do cost 500k right now. no matter what tank you want to use them on.
after the update you can get a pair of Binos for 50k for your low-tier tanks, or 200k for your mid-tier tanks.



and please tell me, why you need to have all equipement on all your 240 tanks removed as soon as the update drops?
first off all: do you want to play all 240 of them on the first day?
and 2nd: it is not like you need to switch out all 3 equipement pieces on every tank and replace them with something new to be competetiv.
Rammer, VStabs &amp; Optics/Vents will still be the go-to equipement choice on most tanks.
so no need for panik :D",1596240204

FAQ

What does this mean ü¶†üòÇ?

The amount üí± of karma üïâ (points üìç) on your üëâ comment üí¨ and Reddit ü§ñ account üí≥ has decreased üîªüí∞ by one 1Ô∏è‚É£.

Why ü§î did you üëÜ do this?

There are several ‚ôÄ‚ôÇüöÅ reasons üåü I üëÅ may üåºüå∑üåπ deem a comment üçÜ to be unworthy üóø of positive ü¶†‚úÖ or neutral üòê karma üëèüèæ. These include üì≤, but üçë are not limited üîí to:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Rudeness towards üëÖüòò other Redditors üò≥ü§™, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Spreading incorrect ‚ùå information üìö, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I üëÅ banned ‚ùå from the Reddit ü§ñ?

No üö´ - not yet üé©üëìüëç. But üçë‚ùì you üëÜ should refrain from making üõ† comments üçÜ like üëç this in the future üì°. Otherwise üíØ I üëÅ will be forced üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è to issue üö´ü¶†ü§Æ an additional downvote ü•¥, which may ‚ô¶ put üëè your üëâ commenting and posting üö© privileges üòí in jeopardy.

I üëÅ don't believe üí≠ my comment üí¨ deserved ü§©ü§£ a downvote üñï. Can you üëÜ un-downvote it?

Sure üíØ, mistakes üò± happen üåö. But üçë only in exceedingly rare ‚òØ circumstances will I üëÅ undo a downvote ‚¨á. If you üëâüèª would like üíõ to issue ü§í an appeal üçë, shoot üî´ me a private üôÑ message üí¨ explaining what I üëÅ got üí™ wrong ‚ùå. I ‚òù tend üêî to respond ü§ñ to Reddit ü§ñ PMs within üëå5‚É£ several ‚ôÄ‚ôÇüöÅ minutes ‚è≥. Do note üòè, however ü§öüò≥, that over üëàüëáüëÜ 99.9% of downvote üñï appeals üçë are rejected üëé‚ùå, and yours is likely ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è no ‚ùå exception ‚ò∫üòç.

How can I ‚òù prevent üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this from happening üò± in the future üì°?

Accept ü§ù the downvote ü•¥ and move üèÉ on. But üëÜüçëüëÄ learn üë®‚Äçüè´ from this mistake ‚ú®üßö: your üëâ behavior üíÄ will not be tolerated on Reddit.com üíª.

Why not try singing the first verse more true to the original vocal line and then divert away in subsequent verses, to give melodic variance?  You also might want to experiment with dynamics more.  Everything was very much the same volume level and color throughout, and I think it would be great to hear you explore the softer, less-resonant parts of your voice.  There were some long notes at the ends of phrases that I thought you could enliven with decrescendos, in particular.  Finally, I'm so so SO curious to hear what happens when you go higher and flip into head mix :)  Instead of getting scared of that space, can you approach it like a breath temperature?  i.e. the high head mix is hot air?  That might help you ease into that space.  Good luck.  Such a lovely singer you are!",1596240206

This is how I know you don't play Camille. Her ult is more suited to being a support or jungle because it basically tells your team ""target this guy"" it helps your 1v1 with it's slight on hit damage but it's really not that much; Not even up for debate. Look at her damage distribution on any stat site and she does negligible magic damage; Also it's not really a better bork passive... It's different. It does far lower number wise but it's magic damage so it depends on the targets resistance breakdown.

Also you're completely ignoring the fact Morde ult steals 10% of your targets stats to help you kill em. It makes them squishier AND you tankier; aswell as makes them do less damage AND makes you do more damage. It also guarantees your target can't get peel. Like? Camille ults the enemy adc, nothing stops their support soraka from silencing you and spam healing the adc... Morde ult does. 
 
In soloQ Morde ult is far far far better. In proplay it's situational leaning towards Camille's being better, but less enjoyable for the camille player.

Ignoring the rylais slow thats almost guaranteed on you. and that there's not likely tons of dodging room depending on where the fights taking place.

So: simply put, getting pregnant from PIV or getting sperm injected by a needle both can lead to pregnancy which is ultimately lethal.

Why would vasectomy be mandatory?
You can have a psrtner who was cut, but why would be force a couple who are ok with the potential unplanned pregnancies?
A pregnancy does not became lethal just because it is unplanned.

Get back into classes if you haven't been in one in a while. It might not be doable at the moment, but once classes open up again (in person) be ready.

Change your look. Cut or color your hair. Emma Stone is a blonde but things didn't really start happening for her until she became a redhead. Even just cutting your hair differently can make CDs see you as a different person for roles you might not have been considered for before.

Doing either of those will cost some money, especially because you'll need new headshots if you change your look, and maintaining a new hair color is a lot of work, but it could be worth it.",1596240208

&gt; Christian anarchism¬†is a movement in¬†political theology¬†that claims¬†anarchism¬†is inherent in¬†Christianity¬†and the¬†Gospels.¬†It is grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable‚Äîthe authority of God as embodied in the teachings of¬†Jesus. It therefore rejects the idea that human governments have ultimate authority over human societies. Christian anarchists denounce the¬†state, believing it is violent, deceitful and, when glorified,¬†idolatrous.¬†Christian anarchists hold that the ""Reign of God"" is the proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity. Under the ""Reign of God"", human relationships would be characterized by divided authority,¬†servant leadership, and universal compassion‚Äînot by the hierarchical, authoritarian structures that are normally attributed to¬†religious social order.¬†Most Christian anarchists are¬†pacifists‚Äîthey reject war and the use of violence.",1596240208

&gt;In case of divorce women generally get the kid unless some other stigma is in place

I think it's a real issue, but I hate the way it's talked about. Women don't ""get the kid"", they're typically the ones already doing the majority of the parenting and in most cases the parents agree for the mother to continue to be the primary caregiver. I also think it shows that some men at least don't really see childcare as *work*. Like, do you complain when you don't get a job you aren't qualified for? Or one that you don't apply for at all?

&gt;Pressure to at least provide child support in case of accidental  pregnancy (is that a thing you'd want change?  Should a guy be able to  just say ""I'd rather not"" in this case)

The thing is, dudes don't want to pay child support, but the people who complain about it are also the same ones who don't want to increase social programs to help single parents or children in the system. Like, what I'd personally really like to do is make it possible to not need to have a 2 person income to be able to reasonably take care of a child. Until that's a possibility, I'm gonna say we need to keep child support in general.",1596240209

To design a beam first find the maximum moment the beam will handle, divide the moment by the yield stress of the steel you plan to use (typically 275Nmm^-2 in the UK). 

This will give you an approximate section Modulus. Compare that section modulus to steel section tables to pick out a possible section. You then need to check the chosen sections resistance. 
There are many checks you may need to perform depending on the size of the section you choose and what type of loading you are assuming. 

I'll list the main ones, shear resistance, moment resistance (technically done), shear buckling, lateral torsional buckling and deflection.

But seriously most people who don't ride a motorcycle don't think about them very often. When you shoulder check your brain is conditioned to look for a car. No car? Great, move over. 

What about motorcycles and anything else?

Your brain should, however, be conditioned to look for an empty space to move into. 

Looking twice gives your brain an extra chance to see something it missed the first time, and any cheeky bikers in your blind spot to hopefully notice your head moving around and give you some room to do your thing. 

Then again I'm in Canada, where motorcycles are less common.

Edit: also if a motorcycle hits a car it's a really bad day for everyone involved. If a car hardly side swipes a motorcycle there's a really good chance the rider gets run over and killed.",1596240211

&gt;Of course rape is rape but so what?

Take a moment to reread the absolute shite that you have typed up and posted. If you think that it's okay, then you're wrong. If you think in hindsight that it's an unacceptable and harmful viewpoint, then yay personal growth.

&gt;Were you a male rape activist before the metoo movement or is it just a defensive reaction?

Now, work with me here. It's almost like a cause is not less valid if it's inspired by another? Shocking I know, but if the much-maligned Polish immigrants were inspired to talk about anti-Polish discrimination in the wake of the Black Lives Matter stuff, would you go up to them and say

I did not have any respiratory issues though! So I cannot speak to that!  But also keep in mind, you're 9 **days** post trauma, I'm ten **years** out and I can tell you recovery is incredibly difficult. Luckily therapy has come a long way! Just be prepared for when he initially comes out of the hospital he will likely be a different person. That's why therapy is so crucial, in my opinion. He'll need to relearn a LOT, likely including mannerisms and some social norms, in addition to walking, talking, etc. I think it'd be best for you to brace yourself for the worst and hope for the best.

"CatholicDating","t5_3348n","Alright, thank you for doing this. You explaining yourself has done alot more to make me feel heard. You cleared away the problems I was hearing with your clarifications.

Since I am on my phone, I will be doing some improvised formatting.

""make the most of your faith life, school life, and friendships up to the age of 20. At this point your personality is fairly consolidated and you would have made a good base with your studies and/or work so as to be on track to have a career that pays the bills of your adult life""

So this piece of advice is taking care of two problems. Immaturity and someone's economic state. When it comes to the economic side, I am actually in a very good situation at age 16. I am going to college, I am making money each semester, and the person I am interested is going to be 15 by her birthday this year meaning that I essentially would have 3-4 years to prepare (with resources similar or even greater than that of most young adults) before she even touches young adult life. However, the maturity side is going to be a completely different story. Even though I have been told I am mature for my age, and she is also very mature for her age, it is still going to be the case that, yes, our personalities won't be entirely consolidated at this time.

The ticking clock thing, obviously the amount of years that women do have to bear children is an important fact I didn't know, however that does not necessarily mean that there isn't a ticking clock once you get out of high school. It may not be that severe of a clock in you 20's, but the idea is still weighing on you slightly. In your 30's I think it would seem to get more powerful, but part of the ticking clock is also that your potential spouses are getting married. That second part is the more important part that you aren't worrying about for most, hopefully all, of high school.

Our experiences seeing people who have dated in high school are just plainly very different. I am in a small town so that does affect my situation. The sexual revolution has obviously taken a toll on the moral character of our high schools, however Christian morality still has away over a large number of people in the high schools. Because of that, high school relationships are still turning out really well around me. My grandparents on my mother's side were high-school sweethearts, so we're my great-grandparents I am pretty sure. My oldest brother and sister married someone they knew in highschool. My oldest brother got married right out of high school, my oldest sister got married to a childhood friend as they both decided (I am pretty certain somewhat in tandem) to go to the same college. My former youth pastor got married to his high-school sweetheart, my current youth leader is getting married to his high-school sweetheart, I am pretty sure his parents were high-school sweethearts, but I am not sure. And these are some of the best relationships I have seen, and of course people who aren't high school sweethearts also have great relationships with their spouses. But in my experience, I have seen good high school relationships all around within the Christian community. The problem is not simply that high-schoolers can't date productively and purposefully, the problem is a cultural one that is caused by the sexual revolution which prevents anybody from dating purposefully unless they go against the culture. In college, you have alot more control of the types of people you hang out with, so that you can choose to primarily hang out with Christians,  and you can choose to hang out with people who can date purposefully. When you are in high-school, you are thrown in with a motley group of people you don't have control over and it is just the case that you need to avoid the vast majority of them. But, I am not part of the general culture stream. Being raised homeschooled and being in college, my social group has always been Christian and the people that are able to date purposefully (past generations and other people have proven teenagers can) are very obvious. My side stream of the small town culture is not as tainted as the main flow of the culture. 

I do think you are taking the parable of the house built on sand Abit out of context, as the foundation that is sure is not of our own making, (all foundations of our own making are sand) but of God's making.

Moving over to the specific relationships I am dealing with. Thanks for telling me about general principles I need to apply. However, I need to talk about what is prudent to, the stuff I actually need to do in this situation. Thinking in multiple threads is what I tend to do.

First, what you said about religion. This is the one that made the most sense when you explained it. I have had worse winters than this in my relationship with God. But what you have said still applies! So I have found that one of the best things I can do for my spiritual life is to focus on helping others. If I am focusing to much on my own spiritual journey, (inward) then I begin to shrivel up and degrade spiritually in a very unhealthy way that brings me to dark places. As a guy, I am quite literally made to be poured out, and if I am not allowing myself to be poured out generously, I can't properly focus on seeking God, my inward and outward life have to be worked on simultaneously if I am to have any sort of upward focus. The upward focus also pushes me to give to others, of I retain to much to myself, the spiritual that started, let's say when I began to pray the rosary, dies away and I begin to feel sickened. If I begin to give myself away in love for others, the spiritual spring which I found begins to flow all the more. Additionally, responsibility is not in any way a real restriction when I actually start to love people. Responsibility directs finite resources of human beings rightly, and when I love, responsibility is always a welcome companion and guide to me, not a hindrance to my physical or spiritual life. But I bet what you said about responsibility still means something when we get past this.

It looks like you are right about spiritual responsibility for someone else not being the best idea during this time, depending on what exactly you mean. So I am just saying that as long as we are not on the same page religiously, which we aren't right now, dating each-other does not sound like a good idea? That is definitely true. But I don't think this is the case if we were on the same page religiously, if we were both pursuing Catholicism or were both deeply engaged in discussions about this with each-other. Something that is possible, but not easy to get to. But this idea is just a hypothetical, atleast it gives me one tool in making peace between us. The fact that (I may have an overly broad definition of pursue), even if I pursue her further, that does not mean I think I can have a relationship with her right now.

So I am looking at making peace with her, and what does that mean? What do I actually do. I am planning on talking with my youth leader tonight, but I would think if some of the miscommunication was cleared up that things would be better off from now on. But this is the situation that needs to be dealt with right now. General principles do apply, but a conversation that just focuses on general principles will be missing the point I think, because it would be missing prudence which is the discussion of how the general principles apply now.",1596240215

"europe","t5_2qh4j","The real loser is the USA.

Why?  Moving a headquarter (e.g. AFRICOM) or a hospital to another country is VERY expensive. And all the investments you recently did are now wasted.

Winners: Germany. Since the USA started the first bombing on Iraq Germany went more and more against the aggressive usage of US military. We still liked what the USA did with Kuwait, driving Saddam out. But the rest?  Not at all. We also don't like how the USA uses wedding-seeking-hellfire-missiles from Drones, controlled from German soil.

Most US troops that the USA now has in Germany are not for NATO reasons there, but for the interests of the USA. This is why mostly no one really cares.

That said, I still think that Germany should spend more on defense. Part of our troops are in a entirely too bad shape. Ships that don't go to sea, subways that don't dive, tanks that cannot shot. It's pathetic. However, especially in defense it's usually a looooong process (too long?) from deciding what your need is, making a tender, work with the companies on the tender, select a company, procude the items, fix them because they always will come out unusable and then implement them into the troops. That's in almost no case a 2 year process.

Now, if you look into the fine print, than back in 2014 Germany said it will rise it's military spending to be 1.5% of the BSP ... but with a time horizont of 2024. So that Trump now goes bonkers over this is either because he doesn't understand the concept of ""till 2024"" or that he doesn't understand NATO at all. In the TV interview, he talked about membership dues. And that is entirely not the issue here. Sure, there is also a direct payment of the countries to the NATO (e.g. to pay for the headquarters). But Germany never had rates open here --- contrast this with the USA, which didn't pay their UN contributions for a considerable long time.",1596240215

In the design stages it was considered using a wheeled weapon carrier so humvee style but tests showed that the added mobility with tracks was a way better option for the use with paratroopers.
The ballistic protection is a nice feature but was never a core aspect mobility was always more important.
The previous vehicle a Faun had no armor at all and basically just was a quad.

In use against mbts the amount of armor needed is not realistic for a air transported vehicle that's why mobility and being small was more important

"VGC","t5_2qp3k","Granted I have more experience in smogon singles than VGC doubles, but having gotten into VGC this gen I think the goals are similar in either format:

When designing an EV spread you want to look at these general factors:

- Out speeding things (or forcing speed ties against things)
- KOing things
- Living hits

Most specialized spreads are designed around one or more of those goals. 

Speed is easy- you just have to be 1 point faster than another mon to outspeed it, so you build EVs up to that amount and distribute the extras elsewhere. In some cases this can decide the Adamant/Modest vs. Jolly/Timid (or other similar) nature question on offensive mons as well- If you can hit your target speed with a +Atk nature instead of +Speed, you pick up that 10% boost to your attacking stat which is nice.

KOing things and living hits go hand in hand kind of. If you're EVing to kill something specific, then oftentimes you're either spec'ing either a defensive/utility mon with just enough attack investment to pass a threshold, or perhaps building a Mixed attacker with enough investment in the off-attacking type to KO specific things. 

On the flip side, spec'ing to live certain things would often be to either live hits from weaker mons where you need a certain amount of investment to take the hit or if your mon is, say, primarily physically defensive but you need a little special investment to take a special hit better.

It's all pretty specific and the answer to figuring out what to spec towards basically lies in just playing games in the meta and figuring out what things are popular that give your team a lot of trouble. 

For example (and I haven't played VGC since the live events started getting cancelled in March so this may be outdated), say a support mon like Whimsicott is juuuuust barely killing one of your mons with moonblast consistently. You take your mon and Whimsicott to a damage calculator and discover that if you put... whatever the case may be, maybe 100 EVs into Special Defense your mon lives that particular popular Whimsicott build's Moonblast with 1-5% HP 100% of the time, and can outspeed and KO back, or just do whatever it needs to do. 

Speed is a lot easier to apply right away- anything you're investing speed in you can just look at its base speed, and then the other mons at the same base speed and lower. Decide if you need to be able to speed tie mons at the same speed tier or not first. If you do then you might have to max invest. If you don't (like if forcing speed ties wouldn't be advantageous to that mon) then you can start looking at lower base speeds until you find something that you want your pokemon to be sure to outspeed. Say you have a base 100 mon and the closest threat that you wanna outspeed is at base 85. You can use damage calculators for this as well- put both mons in and adjust your higher speed mon's EVs down until it's 1 point higher than the thing you're trying to outspeed. Now voila, you can dump the extras elsewhere, either into HP for extra general bulk, maybe one or both defenses to take certain hits better, or if you're already a defensive mon then maybe into your attacking stat.

The guides linked in another reply are probably better organized but this is the gist, hopefully it was helpful in some way :)",1596240218

Welcome to the inside of my nose. As you can see I have two different sized backs in my nostril piercings.

Otherwise it would have been pinched and would not have been able to get better. She said it didn't look bad and that it should go away if I left it alone. 
I'm looking at the inside of my nose and im wondering if my literal anatomy from one side to the other is different. It the image you can see the one with the larger end protrudes but I don't see any actual bump? Can someone tell me what is going on in the inside of my nose if anything?

We had letters of intent ""worth"" 10x the money we were asking for. Figure 24 months payback. Nope. The product was an ""underserved area"" telephony/Internet combo.

I'm thinking of having only one consonant cluster (besides sequences of /VNCV/; I don't even have any affricates): /…°l/. Additionally, it would be treated as a single phoneme. Diachronically, it would come from velar / ü/ (which is usually pre-stopped […° ü] cross-linguistically).

The only major pronunciation difference from the prototypical /l/ in my language is that it might be velarized. I'm also considering fronting it to a dental (my /l/ is normally apico-alveolar), but only because velarized laterals tend to be dental. I'm not sure how I feel about that, if anyone has an opinion.

I'm mostly concerned because, while my diachronic rationale seems to make sense (at least to me), I wonder if such an uncommon (for a single phoneme) cluster make sense in a language that otherwise lacks consonant clusters.",1596240218

Whole books are being written on this subject, and we're still just scratching the surface of what there is to know about the psychological effects of modern prisons.  There are a lot of possible psychological outcomes, depending on your husband's particular experiences and temperament, but the main things you'll want to be on the lookout for are depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.  A google search could help you find common symptoms of both.  It would be a good idea for your husband to start seeing a therapist as soon as possible after his release as possible; preferably one with experience working with prison and post-prison populations.  If his parole officer hasn't already set him up with a therapist, I'd suggest you talk to him about it yourself.",1596240219

Also note that in Brisingr there‚Äôs a very overt passage where Eragon uses raw magic for the first time (to save one of the dwarves when they‚Äôre attacked) and he and Saphira have a discussion about it afterwards.
Now if the jail escape and farthen dur were instances where he didn‚Äôt use the ancient language it would‚Äôve definitely come up.

Sounds like they had lots of opportunity to read stuff.

&gt;They're tired, just got to a strange place, are joining the military which is a big life changer, and are ambushed by a man with absolute authority over them who looks like a psycho who hates them.

Can't speak to other teenagers, but that kind of thing made me instantly resentful personally.

&gt;A bit of fright on their faces is understandable, not a reflection of being dumb. Based on your comment ... I think you'd be one of the recruits most likely to piss his pants in the first few hours.

I'd never...be a recruit though? Like, not in a million years? No matter how broke I was? Because of the aforementioned reading.

As far as pissing myself goes, I could see myself trying it as a means to get out. As far as doing it out of fear...lol. I have so much metal in my body and so much experience with pain that bullets aren't particularly terrifying. I've got 13 screws and 4 plates between my skull and my leg...

‚ÄúOn April 1, Trump told reporters that the United States had banned ""dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people and we did so early, far earlier than anyone would have thought, and way ahead of anybody else.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is a race going on. The race has been run by white people for hundreds of years, but up until two centuries ago, black people were chained and fettered. Bang, and they're off. Only the black people can't run, because they're in chains. Eventually, somebody unlocks those chains, but by then, they're far behind everybody else running. And the problems they face are now 'rich versus poor', as though the rich had no part in making them poor. Or that they had no part in making all of the poor to be the poor. And if they don't catch up, then that means there's something 'racially' or 'culturally' wrong with them, despite the fact that you're expecting them to overcome centuries of time lost to bigotry and systemic abuse.

Those that complain are those who are doing something to improve their lot. There is a distinction, obvious to anybody who has a basic sense of empathy, between bitching and complaint, in that bitching is what you do when you're annoyed and expect no change, and complaint comes when you are angry and going to do something about it. Do you call all complaint by those who aren't in your exact situation bitching? Is there absolutely nothing that the world around you doesn't need to have improved? And if there is something, why should people not complain and seek its improvement?

The reason I don't hate with the intensity and omnipresence that those I consider my ideological opposites do is because I have that basic sense of empathy. I see that the world can be improved, even if it is not for my personal benefit. That there are things that even within my small, paltry ability may be changed for the better, even for people who are not me or mine. So why do you hold that this is the best of all possible worlds? Is it just that you can't imagine a better one? 'Cause that seems like a you problem.",1596240223

For instance, you can hold one of those boxes by the handles on the ends and drop it on concrete just fine (provided it lands on its ""feet"") but if you kick it down across its broadside it will likely damage the tv. This is because a lot of those units are delicately stitched dual panels. Therefore the middle vertical line of the tv is extremely sensitive. Plus the entire panel is extremely delicate from behind so wide, thin, and flat, and the surface can shatter. Hell if you ever move a TV make sure you put extra form around the middle vertical line area and make sure the entire ""glass"" is covered and protected!!

Hello, your recent post on /r/Snapchat has been removed because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines in the ""Rules"" section of the sidebar.

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, W, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. You must have a hyphen between your [R4R] and your title.**

**6. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject. instead of your age and [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fsnapchat).

I switched to lethal and started working my way down from the north end of the island. I get to the last site, kill the mongols, and I immediately notice something is amiss when I see my available technique points pop up with no legend progress underneath. I pick up the cricket, hit options to find that almost none of the visual assets in the menu are loading.

I think, this is weird but whatever, and then I go to the map to fast travel somewhere. Because the loading screens are typically blazing fast I very quickly realize something has gone wrong, but just to be sure I wait a few minutes. Okay, time to close the game and restart. Continue. Infinite loading screen. Rinse and Repeat. Well shit, when was the last time I saved manually? 5 days ago. Double Shit.

Thankfully my autosave had uploaded automatically this morning, so I download that, wipe the sweat from my brow and start my quest for crickets once more. I get the 19th cricket, fast travel in the direction of 20 and boop, infinite loading screen. This time I am able to continue after restarting the game. Fast travel once again results in an infinite loading screen. So I restart and continue, but this time I think - let's see what happens if I forego fast travel. I arrive at the final site and that's where the video starts.

I'm going to do some more testing later tonight.",1596240226

If you have been there a few days it's partial but you still are entitled to the money you paid for time you weren't there. Nal but seen many of these questions. I don't understand how you thought you could register at an airbnb though. Airbnb is a vacationtype here. So the airbnb lister has to pay a fee for you being there as tourist. 
Thing is, when you register somewhere as living there with a salary, then the headowner pays the taxes for that person. This is why a lot of students stay written in at their parents house because until your 23rd birthday they are responsible for your financial status. If they put that on their student adress, they start their own taxes. This is also why you should never let someone you barely know register under your housem you'll be on the hook for taxes because your household makes enough money for that. It's a weird system and not many people know the number of working people in a home changes the bills.",1596240227

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","&gt;Okay so basically you‚Äôre someone that believes animal rape and torture is okay because they don‚Äôt deserve rights since they aren‚Äôt as intelligent as us. You were probably the sociopath kid that would torture and kill animals for fun huh.

Oh yeah attack my character instead of my arguments -- that's my kink.

&gt;Do we need potatoes any more than we need meat? Just because you can live without something doesn‚Äôt mean you should.

If you claim you care about animals you should probably stop killing them. If you don't care about animals as revealed by your preference for eating meat then you should be okay with raping them. Pretty simple logic.

&gt;People have been eating animals for as long as people have inhabited Earth. We figured out how to farm them and have a constant supply of food so we could stay in once place and build a civilization instead of being nomads. They definitely were key in getting humanity to where we are now.

Nice appeal to history. You're right, we've had slavery and war for a huge part of human history so we should keep enslaving people and attacking them! Nice.

&gt;This argument doesn‚Äôt even make sense and I think I lost iq reading it. When I go to the market and purchase meat from the butcher I‚Äôm definitely contributing to the economy by providing the butcher with revenue. But if I just fuck a cow that doesn‚Äôt really help anyone.

If you buy a cow to fuck you've contributed to the farmer who raised it. If you didn't buy it from a farmer then you've at least contributed to the economy in the form of the grain and corn you feed it. I lost iq from the economic argument though. Just because something contributes to the economy doesn't mean that it is more morally permissible than another action. If slavery were more helpful to the economy you probably wouldn't be making this argument.",1596240228

Next, antipsychotic medications such as Seroquil will help! 

Third, masterbation. Start with your favorite porn. If that doesn't work, switch it up. Tbh, what works for me when I cant reach orgasm is; hardcore porn. 

Fourth, would be meditation. Turn off all of the lights. Get as comfortable as you possibly can. Relax your mind and focus on your breathing. Try to empty your mind of all thoughts. Sometimes, I like to picture myself as a cloud. Don't try too hard, though.

Fifth thing that comes to mind is; doing something hands on. Such as, drawing, cleaning, excersize, ect. Do whatever your good at. Do something to remove your focus from the negative symptoms that you are experiencing!

The last thing that comes to mind but, should be first is; the power of belief. Try believing you are sober and believe it 100%. Get in to the mindset of knowing you are sober. 

Good luck, be safe!

Thats not what I said.  I said you were a gigantic faggot.

Your use of attempting to be funny with neckbeard English, which I'm suspecting you are, is pathetic.  You attempted to use humor to shield yourself from admitting you are indeed... a gigantic faggot.

It really isn't that funny.  The words or you being a faggot.

&gt; Are personality disorders real in women, and if so, are they even relevant? 

Maybe, but its not relevant to you.  Why do you fucking care?  The things you describe or normal woman things that nirmal women do when they are with gigantic faggots.

How fat are you?  How much video games do you play everyday?

Can you lift 135lbs at least 8 times in a row?  Can you even pick this woman up and walk up a flight of stairs with her without sweating or gasping for breath?

&gt; My girl would do these insane things...

When you started not giving her attention for shitty behavior like a faggot she ratchets up the shitty behavior and you give in like a gigantic faggot with no other options.

&gt; I break the STFU because it is painful.

Crybaby faggot.

&gt; but maybe a woman cannot love a man who accepts poor treatment. Maybe a woman can't invest in a beta male no matter how messed up she might be. I felt annoyed that how messed up she may be became irrelevant if I alpha.

Womem do not love men in the way that men idealize.  That type of love is reserved for their children.   This is a cold truth of the red pill.  Swallow it or not.  IDGAF.

Women invest in what's good for them.

Sonic the Hedgehog wowewed his panties and went into a squatting position.

It was a quiet, swightwy wainy night.

‚ÄúGotta go fast...‚Äù

Sonic couwd faintwy heaw the music fwom the Weddit cowwege fwat he had just wun out of.

Fwom his position on the sixth fwoow, Sonic couwd ovewwook the awea.

No one was thewe.

Sonic just stopped howding it in and the thought of the wewief that was to come was onwy distuwbed by the smeww of cigawette smoke.

It was as if Sonic's butt was fowced open by a gawden hose that was hidden inside it.

Thewe was a continuous and heavy fwow fow at weast ten minutes.

Thewe wewe a few tiny sowid pieces that caused pweasuwe as they hit his butthowe whiwe exiting.

Sonic was shaking so much that when he began to pee, the natuwaw wed wiquid wouwd not even fwow continuouswy. 

Awthough Sonic was not compwetewy empty, and a buwning feewing awose in that wegion, Sonic fewt wight again and his bwoated bewwy was tuwning into its gwacefuw, skinny figuwe again.

Suddenwy, thewe was a voice, ""Did the guttew teaw ow something?""

A second voice, appawentwy a giww, added, ""My neck is wet"".

Sonic weawized that he was caught.

Sonic put his hands on his stomach to incwease the pwessuwe to finish as soon as possibwe when a voice down thewe said, ""Someone is up thewe.""

A fwashwight fwashed up fwom bewow.

Sonic was scawed, and then the second wave came out of him.

Bewow Sonic, a scweam wose thwough the night, ""Shit, that's shit"".

""He's shitting on us"" 

""No dude, do you see that? That's a fucking hedgehog"". 

Sonic quickwy wiped with his hands, wike he awways does (and nevew washing them aftew).

The fwashwight fwom the pwatfowm on the fwoow bewow Sonic was stiww wighting up.

They couwd see enough to make a wude comment about his genitawia.

Sonic continued to wipe his anus with his fingews ovew his butthowe wike toiwet papew.

He then put on his panties again and wushed back inside.

The fwat was onwy a few doows away.

Sonic had weft the doow open, so he got back inside. 

Sonic had onwy been gone fow a few minutes and as he knew onwy a few peopwe thewe, no one seemed to have noticed that he was gone.

Sonic was pwanning on weaving, as he was not feewing weww. 

Sonic went to pick up his cawdigan that he had weft at the pwace he had been sitting at.

When Sonic was about to get out.

Someone was yewwing outside and knocking at the doow. 

Sonic wushed back as faw as possibwe.

Someone had opened the doow.

The pewson that opened the doow stawted scweaming against the peopwe yewwing fwom outside.

Awawmed fwom the scweams, the peopwe fwom inside the fwat wushed to the doow.

Within seconds, the whowe fwoow showed up.

The situation did not cawm down, the peopwe outside wewe wooking fow the pewson that did this.

Sonic did not see them but he heawd peopwe saying that they wewe covewed in feces.

Sonic went onto the bawcony when someone fwom the neighbowing fwat went into theiw bawcony and stawted yewwing down fow hewp.

This attwacted a fuwthew audience fwom outside.

The peopwe outside couwdn't be convinced to wetuwn to theiw fwat.

Sonic used the fiwst oppowtunity to escape.

Many peopwe wewe wushing up the staiws to see the outwaging situation and despite wooking vewy nowmaw, Sonic expected any of them to identify him as the cuwpwit.

When Sonic wetuwned to his fwat, Sonic cweaned fapped a bit and pooped some mowe.

Sonic's woommate Demetwi wetuwned two houws watew, he showed Sonic some photos he had made of the poow peopwe bewow him.

Sonic had compwetewy hit them ‚Äì two guys and one giww.

Sonic's unintentionaw victims appawentwy gave a descwiption to the buiwding management, that caused amusement ‚Äì they wewe wooking fow a boy with a bwue shiwt.

When intewested peopwe asked fow a mowe pwecise descwiption, the wowds ""huge penis"" was used in officiaw notices.

I bought a 44 gallon Rubbermaid trash bin with a lid from Offerup for $10.00 it had a 2 inch hole in the bottom of it, which was perfect because I was planning on putting holes it in myself anyway saved about 40.00$

I got a knife since I don't own a power drill, made about 40 holes throughout the container. Then used a flat head screw driver to widen the holes and make them uniform.3 drainage holes on the bottom and thats it!

In all seriousness if you're having trouble seeing tells (and you have enemy player skill effects turned off) then I don't know what to tell you, nothing in the drizzlewood meta is any different than any other regular ass world boss Drakkar, Teq, etc. Getting run over by Ranoa is the most frustrating thing in the whole ordeal by far just because it makes dps on melee class a huge pain, but asking players to jump every four seconds or just use a stunbreak/stability is really not a huge commitment.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Do you mean CNOOC Canada? The Nexen name has been retired.

So you do agree that ""ethical oil"" is not a joke, and you can look at things like, ""How muck do they leverage economic slaves in their operations, where do the proceeds go, and to what degree do their adhere to the local legislation when it comes to environmental regulation and rule of law?""

CNOOC Canada has had some ethical issues, same as CNRL, things like, ""Should we fix the pipeline before it leaks? Or after?"" or ""Should we put these employees in a life threatening situation to get these repairs done?""

What is true of Canadian oil companies, CNOOC Canada and CNRL included is that they have efforts to ingrain safety into its operations, they generally value human life, and would prefer to avoid punishment by the regulator or police if they violate the rule of law.

Operations in places like Nigeria, Albania, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Venezuela or Russia to name a few are less likely to care about worker safety, than places like Canada, Australia, or the United States.

I single out Saudi as they are the polar opposite of Canada, and the argument that their oil could be branded as unethical is the easiest to make. Anywhere that derives nearly 100% of their revenue from the sale of oil, and uses that money to kill their citizens if they are homosexual, or just women, is easy an easy argument to make.",1596240232

"samharrisorg","t5_3k56g","I'm saying this before I quite finish the cast but am actually sympathizing with Harden despite some of her trickiness, weirdly enough. Sam assumes people are Vulcans like him, or soon could be, which is why he can't understand other people's concern with the danger of just removing the Chestertons Fence that is religion.

In this case, he is ignoring the Chesterton's Fence that is a taboo around discussing racial group IQs because he believes the science will likely find these eventually and we need to be prepared to deal with some people being scientifically dumber, which is probable. Sam is then correct pointing out that no one should be interested in this stuff while then helping spread the ideas to a mostly scientifically-uneducated population. That's what Murray was doing wrong, he was making racial IQ discussions into popular science and that is what Sam has been stating has to be allowed.

Now you should certainly not stop scientists from discussing this stuff in their journals. Learning on all topics needs to continue and they understand the intricacies and the huge amount that is unknown and how science never really proves anything ""true"", it just gets to a more accurate answer over time. 

Like Harden was saying though, this stuff is being thrown around, being popularized in for-public books and essentially told to a scientifically illiterate audience that science says it is true that black people are mentally inferior. This clearly socially-destructive bomb is getting tossed willy nilly and *the science is not even very good yet*. We are comparing people who are at different stages of where their societies are, or where they are in them, as far as nourishment, mental stimuli, and stress go and acting like our current data will still be meaningful once those are accounted for.

I think Sam was correct with his first instinct that this is a mostly pointless/dangerous area of study and has now chosen to die on the hill of scientific free speech instead of just saying: ""The current data shows differences in IQ across groups but we don't know how to account for all the variables or how this will change as the benefits of modernity are equalized across groups. Scientists need to science but I'm going to be a bit suspect of anyone who decides to devote their time to emphasizing the value of the current limited understanding of racial IQ discrepancies to the public.""

Don't deny what the data currently shows. Just acknowledge that the data is limited and our understanding of how IQ is developed is limited, so publically drawing meaningful conclusions from our current limited understanding is foolish and irresponsible.

I love you Sam, but this seems like a dumb place to have gotten bogged down in.",1596240232

Once Jimmie entered the series Jeff's success took a hit. He was always looking for that 5th championship. I believe I saw a stat that showed Jeff vs. Jimmie in head to head races from when Jimmie first entered the series to when Jeff retired. Jimmie obviously beat Jeff but Jeff had 8 seasons under his belt.

Jeff may have been the more versatile driver but I don't think that means he's the GOAT. 100% top 5 driver of all time but it's certainly under Jimmie. Both drivers had crazy good years where they won so much. Both drivers had a ton of success. But when it came down to the money.. those last 10 races Jimmie stomped the competition. 2007 was one of Jeff's best years.. even in the Chase. Jimmie pulls out 4 straight wins to take the championship home. 

Jimmie was clutch when he needed to be and had the best strategy - thanks to how well he and Chad meshed. They knew they didn't need the most points the entire season. They probably could have done that many times but to win a championship they were focused on winning. 

This is honestly a fun debate and I'm not sure it'll ever end. I, as a Jeff and Jimmie fan, rank these two at the top of cup series best drivers.",1596240233

"ecommerce","t5_2qhin","There's a lot of other variables that go into buying decisions that are unknowable.

Pricing in one site isn't necessarily known to users on another.

People pay more for items on Amazon all the time just for the convenience.

Since covid people will pay a premium even before shipping to avoid brick and mortar.

CPA and what it ultimately costs to aquire a customer (purchase) and all of your associated overhead for product, operations, marketing etc. Is your own math since others may have better or worse pricing and different requirements for margin or how they run marketing and at what ROAS.

THAT being said I will give you a more clear example in support of what I think you're asking:

I have a client that sells on Amazon and shopify. Amazon takes a fee of 10-15% in addition to an ACOS of 8-15% or a $30-50 Ad CPA, shipping is roughly the same and shopify takes a tiny cc processing fee but nothing compared to Amazon platform fees.

Now, we run both Amazon and PPC, social and display ads for them of around $200K on shopify and $60K/month on Amazon. The reason being is that they can spend the combined CPA of Amazon fee+ads almost entirely on ads for the same break-even.

Imagine a $40 fee and $40 ad CPA on Amazon. That's $80 for User Acquisition. On shopify you can spend that entire $80 on ads to acquire one sale. The math changes by product this one is $250-$500 retail so admittedly a higher price than most goods sold but you mentioned 120-150 so not that far off.

A lot of what you described is the math behind actual user decision but as far as an advertiser doing the math yes I'd say most of your assumptions are true but it's hard to say why users decide to buy. Was it the promotion that brought them to the site? Are they price conscious? Maybe other retailers have been out of stock and they want that one.

"immigration","t5_2qvj0","I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôve thought through the Canadian visa option. Americans cannot just move to Canada and live and work there on a whim, just like how Canadians cannot live and work in the US without jumping through real hurdles. It‚Äôs even more difficult for Indians to secure work permits in Canada.

Yes, a US citizen can visit Canada for up to 6 months in a year without any visas or special applications, but you‚Äôre limited only to tourist or general business visitor activities. You are not eligible to work in Canada, and working remotely for a US employer for an extended time as a tourist would also not be allowed. If you want to work for a Canadian employer, you‚Äôd either have to choose a NAFTA professional visa (if your occupation is one of the 60 in the treaty), or you‚Äôd need an employer-specific work permit supported by a Labor Market Impact Assessment which is not trivial. 

Your Indian fianc√© could get a tourist visa that allows her to stay for up to 6 months in Canada at a time, but would need a similar employer-specific work permit to be able to work in Canada (and would not be eligible for a NAFTA visa like you, or an open work permit with unrestricted employment authorization). So it‚Äôs not clear what economic opportunities you are referring to as being accessible by living in Canada.

I‚Äôve known multiple couples of Indian origin where one person was a US citizen and the other was not, and the couples wanted to do a traditional ceremony in India. Your best bet is to do a courthouse wedding in the US, file I-130/485, wait for your spouse green card, then do your traditional ceremony in India afterwards. This would leave you free to travel back and forth. Note only your courthouse wedding would count for legal purposes, but that‚Äôs not a big deal for couples that choose this option.

If you don‚Äôt want that, then I-130 followed by a CR-1/IR-1 visa application at a US consulate in India after you are married is your best option.",1596240234

To the extent these questions involve consensual acts between adults, frankly, 
they're none of your business and I will instruct the witness not to answer.
 MS. McCAWLEY: This case involves sexual trafficking, sexual abuse,
questions about her having interactions with other females is relevant to this case. 
She needs to answer these questions.
 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm instructing her not to answer.
 MS. McCAWLEY: Then we will be back here again.
See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2, Tr. of Maxwell Depo. (Apr. 22, 2016) at 19-22 (emphasis 
added). 
Defendant‚Äôs participation in massages with Epstein is a central part of this case. Ms. 
Giuffre has explained that during her first sexual encounter with Jeffrey Epstein, it was 
Defendant who provided instruction on how to do it and how to turn the massage into a sexual 
event. Obviously, proof that Defendant had previously massaged Epstein ‚Äì include massages 
with sexual component ‚Äì would provide important corroboration for Ms. Giuffre‚Äôs testimony at 
trial. And proof that Defendant was involved in massages will further help prove that 
statements to the press that Virginia‚Äôs allegations were ‚Äúobvious lies‚Äù was itself an obvious lie.
As another example, Defendant refused to answer questions about her knowledge that 
Johanna Sjoberg was hired to work for Epstein and provided massages. In the police report, 
Johanna admitted that Maxwell recruited her to work for Epstein. See McCawley Decl. at 
Exhibit 3, Giuffre000076-77 (police report indicating that Johanna was recruited by Maxwell). 
Yet during Defendant‚Äôs deposition, she refused to answer questions regarding Johanna Sjoberg.
Q. Do you know what tasks Johanna was hired to performance?
A. She was tasked to answer telephones.
Q. Did you ever ask her to rub Jeffrey's feet? . . .

"science","t5_mouw","Just because asbestos inhaled in the lungs causes cancer (this is what killed my grandfather), doesn't mean that a trace amount applied externally causes cancer. 

Tort lawyers are in the business of extracting money from companies. In order to do so they create tenuous links, sympathetic victims, and, if they are really lucky, during discovery they find a memo from an executive raising a possibility which they can then convince jurors shows a ""cover up"". 

In general garbage science (in particular meta-studies) can show whatever you want them show. There is no doubt, and copious science, to show that occupational exposure to asbestos is very, very, bad. That doesn't translate to topical application of something with trace amounts of asbestos, especially when the target tissue (ovaries) is so far away from the application area. 

But its like jurors believing glyphosate causes lymphoma even though the gold standard research for occupational shows it does not. You just have to befuddle 7 out of 12 people who are specially selected for their ignorance of science and the money rolls in.

 I currently drive a WRX, but would strongly consider going wingless if I had an STi and it was my daily. It would be easier than dealing with the boy racer comments from coworkers. If you have a job where it doesn't matter, then its not a big deal.",1596240240

Your son owes your stepdaughter the full replacement cost of all of the bras he ruined. If you think he's too young to pay it, then you as the parent are responsible to pay it.

There's also a worrisome element you've totally failed to address, which is: what the FUCK is your son doing rifling through a woman's underwear drawer without consent? If you think that's just okay and you don't address that aspect of the situation beyond making him pay for the bras, you are failing as a parent.

If that's what you mean, this subreddit is saturated in those kinds of discussions. If you want to tell us that a movie is underrated, it shouldn't be a critically praised film. *Primer* is not underrated. *Frailty* is not underrated. *Amadeus* is not even close to underrated.

For example, my single mother told everyone about what a terrible, god-awful child I was until she had three other kids and now praises me. Forced to have straight A‚Äôs, and treated like an adult for the most part. Of course, the adults in my life did nothing to hide the stress, their adult problems, money issues, etc. from my younger self. I grew up with a dead-beat no show dad who lived hours away, and found myself growing angry, even hostile when I saw my friends with their dads. I showed extreme and violent anger issues, mood swings, and paranoia, but everyone saw that as early maturity and not tramau and a call for help. My mom was gone most of the time, and my grandma was a bipolar depressed woman with a hatred for my mother. To this day, I resent every adult in my life for destroying the only chance I had at a real childhood and for not stepping in and getting me help.",1596240242

I can‚Äôt remember if I heard that somewhere in a show, read it, or made it up as head canon, it‚Äôs been in my thoughts so long.

The Pandemic is terrible, but ironically, it's been a good time for me. I got to relax a bunch, work on and finish projects I was struggling to have time for, watch shows and play games, and manage my own stress. I'm not stressed for work because everyone's more or less equally fucked so I don't need to worry about getting left behind and the Canadian Government has had a great COVID benefit over the past several months. I also was able to work at my own pace on freelance and got promoted into another job at an organization I used to contract for that lets I can work on at home at my own pace. Now I'm also trying to get my business funded again, which is looking promising. All of this is still the case.

I can‚Äôt really give much advice when it comes to dealing with these feelings cause I suck at it.

As for dealing with your grandma, I‚Äôd advise emphasising your feelings when you come out. I recently came out to my grandma who‚Äôs also pretty religious. For me, the best way to make her understand was to emphasise how important transitioning was for my mental health and talking about my feelings of dysforia and that transitioning was the best way to make me happier and more confident and comfortable in my body. She still isn‚Äôt the most supportive, but she seems to understand a bit better.

I'm still working through a lot of it. I plan to re-try therapy. Which will be my 3rd time.        

I tried it once in 2016 and stopped going. As I felt like it was more venting about my shitty life and not really working through anything. I also had weird reactions from the therapist back then as if she was weirded out or possibly confused as to why people treat me the way they do. As I was going through some times with some truly awful people in it.        

I'm going to see if trying a different therapist/counselor might help.",1596240244

2) they literally have more wealth in the form of houses, savings, etc etc, compared to millenials. I m not sure they are more financially literate, in fact previous generations were very much into overconsumption. They got lucky, and the decrease of inflation during their lifetime means their early savings became more valuable than those of subsequent generations.

"Buttcoin","t5_2sngy","Yeah, exactly. What is mind boggling about bitcoin is that it is set up to burn actual value in proportion to the bullshit price. 

Even gold is not as bad (in principle) - for the gold to change hands there needs not be any reward for digging more up, plus it has substantial industrial uses.

edit: also for the society, utilization is an important thing - e.g. if there is a ""financial crisis"", the loss is initially on paper, but becomes tangible once something stupid is done like foreclosing on people's homes or stopping factories. The system is very prone to convert losses in bullshit numbers into physical losses, by causing valuable items to stay unused for a period of time.

In case of housing asset bubble (which is a good example in terms of damage done), for example, the issue was primarily a manufactured crisis - yes there was bad lending, but actual workers who actually built the housing did get paid and did spend their pay, and the lenders (who were the ones that fucked up) could have been forced to eat the losses and only take a set % of earnings towards the mortgages.",1596240248

"baronygame","t5_31in6","Being new to this game and playing a lot of arcanist, I have found some information that may help you.

To begin, if your perception is negative it is practically (if not completely) impossible to appraise things. You will have to level up from killing things until your perception is 0 or 1 before you will make any progress.

Early on, your appraisal skill may also be too low to appraise many things. Luckily, early levels have a lot of food in them and many food items (especially mouldy cheese) are very easy to appraise and can lead to you leveling up appraisal quickly. Don't be afraid to pick up a cheap item like mouldy cheese and appraise it even if you are never going to use it. This works very well for me and I can normally start appraising jewelry by the end of floor 2 as an arcanist (a class with very low appraisal).

"RFID","t5_2sh1g","4 meter requirement means UHF rfid - the other ID-21A can't go that far.

Most cost-effective, in order:

 - ~$100: Cheap readers from China. https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33042070502.html

 - ~$300: M6e Nano dev kit with external antenna. https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14066

 - ~$900: Impinj + Antenna https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/impinj-speedway-revolution-r120-uhf-rfid-reader-1-port/


All of these readers will require software development to put together an interface for whatever problem you are trying to solve.

Tags: any UHF Gen2 tags will work. Estimate $0.20 each in volume. Look for an Alien Higgs or Impinj Monza die. 

A larger format tag antenna in almost all cases leads to better read range, plan for 4 inches square.

If attaching to metal, tags need to be specifically designed to mount on metal, and are more expensive.

I'd recommend buying a tag sample pack to help find a good form factor: https://www.atlasrfidstore.com/rfid-tag-sample-pack-uhf-passive/

"WhitePeopleTwitter","t5_35n7t","Actually, the Founders were relatively unconcerned about individual constitutional rights, or at least their work largely had those sorts of results (the Founders weren't a monolith, after all). The famed Bill Of Rights provided no protection against *state* infringements until after the Civil War (more or less, the case law's weird), and states were only made to (mostly) follow the same guidelines as the federal government in the middle of the 20th century, after almost 2 centuries of legal development and (crucially) constitutional amendments and resulting interpretation.

To the founders, the important thing wasn't protecting minorities from the majority -- it was protecting the majority from a government that failed to represent them. If you read Federalist 10, the possibility of minority subjugation is raised -- and sort of dismissed as unlikely unless they *really* deserve it (I'm exaggerating, but I don't think wildly so), and in any case clearly wasn't the important focus at the time.

Sure, *now* that we have a concept of constitutional rights, we don't let majorities vote on their granting. But we vote on tons of laws about the implementation there -- details of, say, free speech online, or exactly how religious orgs are treated, or the degree of discretion granted to police for the *practical* so-called protections of the 4th amendment. And there's lots of rights that have no constitutional backing, but that're granted or denied by statute to subsets of the population.",1596240249

Plus, I don't think they can deal with all the attention they'll be getting even if other people already knew that demons were real without attracting the attention of Heaven's residents.

I drive them to the bayou, give the man of the house (or whoever is in charge) a revolver. I then instruct them to start shooting their children first. Then their partner. Next, I take the revolver and shoot the head of the family.

Then, it's time to feast on their remains. But not before I rip a bong. After my thirst is satiated, I feed the remainders to the gators. On the way home, I bomb the local library and then finish it off by going to the local cemetery (best thing is, the graves are above ground. Easy pickins.)",1596240250

First, I took a look at guide videos on YouTube and builds on PCPartPicker. I learned about what each component does and how much to allocate for each one in my budget, and then I ordered my parts and put them together. 

I had some minor problems installing my case fans since the screws I had available didn't seem to fit them correctly, but with a bit of improvisation I was able to secure them to the case. Everything went well on the first boot, and it has been smooth sailing ever since. My build is about three years old, and it wasn't very powerful in the first place, so within the next few years I'll probably assemble another one.",1596240250
