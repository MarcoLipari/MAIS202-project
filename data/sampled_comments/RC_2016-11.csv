Given his lack of films, I would consider him an underdog in a once underrepresented genre.

Do you have a favorite (or top 10, even) writer who you would consider an underdog?

Second question, if I may: If you're familiar with the Eternal Champion trope, do you have any characters in your books you would consider to be a faucet of it?",1477958404

I was okay with AC1 having this debate and then skipping to basically AC3 which rehashes it in the context of the American Revolution. But if every game released consecutively has to deal with a region of people and whether they have the right to govern themselves without influence, subtle or overt because one group thought those people were selfish bastards and the others thought otherwise, than it would get very stale very quickly.

If they found other subjects to have philosophical differences over, i'd be happy to see those in games, but lets not kid ourselves, the nature of the fundamental difference between Templars and Assassins haven't changed since AC1.

"television","t5_2qh6e","I'd say it's worth giving another try. I enjoyed it from the start but season one definitely picks up more as it goes on a little more. The characters all become a little more rounded and like P&amp;R, B99 allows its characters to have full personal lives and relationships as it goes along. After Samberg and Braughter's characters stop being quite as at odds it also settles into a better dynamic IMO. Samberg also gets a little more comfortable in the role and leans on ""goofy"" a bit less. 

It's the only show left that feels like a successor of the P&amp;R, Community, 30 Rock etc lineup from back in the day - it's a comforting thing to watch weekly, has a long season and a high joke per episode ratio. The ensemble is also really great and the show has fun giving them against-type personality details and such. 

I'd really say give it another shot, watch a bit longer into the season. It's not quite as sentimental as P&amp;R and the police setting confines storylines more, but it's a very reliable comedy with a similar sense of humor. ",1477958405

"gamemaker","t5_2qw2g","Yep, I use them in my own game :)

I don't know exactly how familiar you are with the motion planning functions so I'll start from scratch. Sorry if you already know this, bear with me!

I usually have a ""motion control"" object, and put the grid code in that. So, my planning object (oMotion) has the following create code:

        //start our motion planning grid. Note we use the room width and height
        //to calculate how many cells we need, based off the cell size.
        //Probably a good idea to use a constant for cell size but for this example
        //I'm cheating
        grid = mp_grid_create(0, 0, room_width div 32, room_height div 32, 32, 32);
        
        //add the ""unallowed"" squares to the grid; To do this I use wall objects.
        //You can use other objects, or use the other mp_grid_add functions to manually specify
        mp_grid_add_instances(grid, oWall, 0);

Next, in your boomerang object (let's call it oBoomerang), initialize a path in the create event:

    path = path_add();

To use the A* algorithm, in your oBoomerang object, do the following in whatever event it is that you need the path:

    path_set = mp_grid_path(oMotion.grid, path, x, y, oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, 1);

This generates the path and assigns it to the path variable we created in the create event. To actually then start the boomerang on the path we have to use the path_start function:

    //have to make sure the path generation didn't fail!
    //note that above I assigned the returned path generation value to
    //path_set. This will be true if the algorithm found a path and false otherwise
    if(path_set)
    {
        path_start(path, 5, path_action_stop, 0);
    }
    else
    {
        show_debug_message(""Couldn't calculate path"");
        //code to try path generation again/calculate alternate movement/destroy boomerang etc
    }

Here is where I expect you have gotten to before. However the ""path"" variable holds a standard path as per any other path you set in the game, and the path functions can be called on it.

So in your question above, how do you find the nearest node to the player, I would create a new function like the following:

    ///path_get_nearest_point(x, y)
    
    //find the number of ""nodes"" - GMS calls them points, in the path
    var number = path_get_number(path);
    
    var point;
    var distance = 10000;
    var curr_dist;
    
    //make sure the path has at least 1 point!
    if(number &lt; 1)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    //loop through the path points and return the one closest to player
    for(var i = 0; i &lt; number; i++)
    {
        //find the distance to the player
        curr_dist = point_distance(argument0, argument1, path_get_point_x(path, i), path_get_point_y(path, i));
        
        //check to see if it's closer than our previously stored closest point
        if(curr_dist &lt; distance)
        {
            distance = curr_dist;
            point = i;
        }
    }

You can then use this in your boomerang object:

    var nearest = path_get_nearest_point(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y);

Now you have the id of the point, you can do whatever you want to it, for example delete the point:

    path_delete_point(path, nearest);

Or if you want to delete all points past this one too you can use the loop again:

     for(var i = nearest; i &lt; path_get_number(path); i++)
    {
        path_delete_point(path, i);
    }

Lastly, if your boomerang object has already started along the path when you change the path, you may find you need to stop the movement, make the changes and restart again. You may also need to manually place the boomerang in the right position along the remodified path. I'll leave that to you to play around with depending on the result.

So, ""why am I an atheist."" I think the question can be answered in two different ways. 

1) There is no proof of a god, save for what truth claims are made within individual religions. Most of these truth claims are verifiably false, or lack any substantial veracity. 

2) Rather than looking at atheism as an identity, it's more accurate to look at it as a lack of an identity. No single god claim, especially one that involves a personal god (primarily the Abrahamic religions), remains afloat when tested. They all sink. The only exception to this is the most extreme form of deism. I would say that a god that doesn't seem to exist by every metric, may as well not exist at all. ",1477958406

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I'm not going to lie. I actually really like the love story between Natasha and Bruce in *Age of Ultron.*

People say that it comes out of nowhere, but I never thought that. And I don't think it weakens the movie.

It was actually one of my favorite parts. Natasha is haunted by her past sins. She was a Soviet assassin, trained since adolescence to kill and torture and uphold a horrific regime. Bruce fights every day to keep the Hulk, a creature he doesn't understand, the monster inside him, at bay. 

They're two broken people: Natasha was never ""normal,"" and Bruce can never be ""normal"" again. 

Contrast them to Hawkeye, who can do his Avengers missions and then come home to his little farm, with his wife and his kids. 

Furthermore, look at the other Avengers. 

One of Steve Roger's most defining characteristics is his determination to do the right thing. But second to this is his absolute conviction in free will. He chose to join the Army. He volunteered for the Super Solider Program. Everything he's done, is something he's chosen to do.

Similarly, Tony Stark chose to make amends for his past misdeeds. But unlike Natasha, his misdeeds were a bit more public, and had logical solutions. His weapons were being smuggled into the wrong hands? He cancels the program, and begins to build new clean energy programs instead. And in theory, Tony (if he wasn't Tony) could retire, for want of a better word. 

Thor's a different being entirely, so he doesn't really apply here--but free will is still part of his character.

But Natasha and Bruce didn't have a choice in what they became. 

They fell in love, because it's one of the only things they can choose. And their devotion, though understated on-screen, is all the more fragile, and they are all the more desperate to cling to it.",1477958407

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Arachnophobia, pre-rework. That's basically the only one that has ever been interesting.

The thing about the MOTD is that the vast majority of them are just ""play less than your full god pool, perhaps without mana or with increased CDR,"" which is not a drastically different gameplay experience than just playing regular Smite. There's no real reason to play them.

The good MOTD's are the ones that alter playstyles, which is why a lot of the only-one-assassin-or-guardian ones are particularly fun, since some number of you have to build and play significantly differently, due to the complete lack of defense or offense normally present in those characters.

The only recent MOTD that has approached this was the all-Bastet arena with max CDR, wherein you had to account for an extra 15 cats at basically all times. But once you realized that the massive CDR meant you could basically just jump in place repeatedly to kill all the cats, even that got stupidly lame.

While I don't like modes like Omnipotence which offer endgame builds right out of the gate, I'm fine with those existing, because a lot of people enjoy them. Rotating that mechanism through the various maps is about the best the MOTD has to offer, really, but I still wouldn't play any of them.",1477958408

I don't care how often you shop there or who you know, our margins aren't high, which is why the employees aren't paid much in the first place, so no, you may not have a discount. 

I can't count the number of people that think that just because it's a mom and pop store, they can haggle prices. It's not a flea market, genius. 

And, last but certainly not least (as I could go on all day), if I hear one more person ask to have a discount because it's cheaper on Amazon, I'm going to flip a lid. It's cheaper because we have to order from a warehouse, that ordered from another warehouse and all of us pay shipping on that. Add that to the cost of the product and it's no wonder it's more expensive than Amazon. So, if you think you can get it on Amazon cheaper, then order it. I'll be damned if my paycheck keeps dwindling because you're too cheap to support a local business even after boasting that you're just soooo loyal to it.

Also I think this works better in an ebook or perhaps as a webpage. Some format where you don't know how many pages are left in the story as it would clue you in to which protagonist was the one that lives. You can get the ebook page number but its not as obvious as a physical book. A special webpage where you only had next page as an option would work best.

**Edit:** oh I just had a good idea, make every iteration a different author. 

That is each story takes place in the same world with the same big bad thing to stop. But other then some set pieces and general worldbuilding each story will be very unique. So it would be more an anthology.

The next level of world building is that each story happens chronologically so that story 5 could stumble upon story 2 protagonist's corpse.

Then have the final author write the one where the protagonists succeeds. That could be fun anthology work that would showcase different author styles while encouraging readers to keep buying the next installment. 

If the protagonists succeeds then a new story starts in a new world. That way any story can end in failure or success and they would all be different enough so they don't seem repetitive.",1477958409

"openttd","t5_2royw","Passengers are ""multipoint to multipoint"" service as opposed to cargo being ""multipoint to point"" (assuming you're servicing a single drop station like me). The network architecture would be significantly different without a lot of line crossing. I'd basically build an S-bahn type local network (probably a short loop) ending at a large feeder station in the largest town in the area I'm trying to serve. At that large station, passengers could transfer to intercity express trains. Or, something like that.

Using the train set I'm using, the intercity rail engines now that it's 2107 are almost twice as fast as the cargo engines I'm using (I picked the engine I did because it has good acceleration, so my priority triggers can be short, and they can handle tight corners without having to slow down, so my hubs can be more compact - though they top out at 147mph). The compromise of using the 147mph trains for the intercity services would be a bad one if they were to share track with the freight trains. Not making them give way to trains on the freight backbone would cause a jam on the backbone almost instantly, but in converse that would disrupt the passenger service. Express trains should also be a longer (8-12 tiles or so) and would slow down in the compact hubs that the 5-tile freight trains are using, which would also disrupt the freight trains. If I tried more frequent, shorter trains for intercity service, and made them give way to trains on the backbone, that wouldn't be very reliable and I might end up with a wave of several trains arriving at a passenger terminal at once, where the first 1-2 would fill up with passengers and the rest would end up departing rather empty.

So, I could build a passenger network in the same game if I wanted to, but by necessity it would basically have to be an entirely different network.",1477958410

De donde salen los 27 fps que decis? Que estas comparando?
Lo que veo es i5 6600 170 fps contra i7 6700 190 (el 6500 no aparece pero estaria un par de frames abajo del 6600). Eso te da una diferencia de un poco mas del 10%.

Pero es irrelevante tener 170+ fps si no tenés un monitor para eso (lo cual dudo que alguien comprando una pc ya armada tenga). Cuando tenes juegos que apenas te llegan a 60fps la diferencia entre un i5 y un i7 se achica mucho más.",1477958411

How many dicks they've had, how much they are craving dick right now, biggest dick they've had, how big they like their dicks, the last dick they had, time until next expected dick, whether they could get dick right now. That guy's dick? What's it like? Could I get his dick? I'd like that guy's dick.

Once they've tired of dick conversation they discuss each others boobs. A couple of them have implants so how much was the surgery. Are you happy with the result? How do they feel? Can I feel them? (Sadly I get left out of that part, but I get to watch).

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","So I have a few questions about 敬語.

Firstly, why does 召し上がる seem to be the only word that you can keigo twice? お召し上がりになります seems very common, but おいっらっしゃいになります or お申しします are weird?

Second, how do I know what words to actually put in keigo? We say sollnissと申します and ドイツから参りました but not 趣味はビールを頂くことです. What words should I use keigo with?

And thirdly, what's up with the super keigo thing? I often hear ますので or まして even though every class I've ever visited told me you  have to use 普通体 in the sentence and only the last verb is conjugated. The only thing I can imagine is when the speaker intended to end the sentence there and already said ま。。。 and then just remembers he wanted to say more and just continues with すので or して. But I also found this: http://blog.livedoor.jp/s_izuha/archives/3654119.html

Which again comes down to my first and second question. When do I use which 敬語 level? I know when to use the three main levels (食べられる、お食べになる and 召し上がる) but between these forms there is so much stuff that can happen... even the difference between お食べになります and 召し上がる seems weird. Is the latter more formal because it's the keigo form or is the first one more formal because it's ます? And then of course Japanese people themselfs also can't use keigo ...

"progressive_islam","t5_2t8su","You'll get the same answer in r/islam. Noone wants to behead homosexuals. You'll find less support for homosexual identities however but that's largely because interpretations do not allow for separate gender assignments and identities. This is why some countries like Iran encourage those who prefer the same gender as them to undergo gender reassignment. Any activity beyond this is considered sinful but there are no consensus prescriptions or punishments assigned to it. 

For most of Islamic history, homosexuality has been treated as something that everyone knows happens and you joke about but considered unseemly but not something you punish (though there have been instances of it). In fact, homosexuality was explicitly decriminalized in the Tanzimat reforms of the ottoman empire - a move that was read as a defiant gesture against growing European influence (which was decidedly anti-homosexuality and a little uncomfortable with Islamic passe treatment of those engaged in these acts). It's only in the last century that such strong stances has been taken against homosexuality. ",1477958414

What a sloppy fucking ""article"" that isn't even correct (if 8 sentences can be called an ""article"").

"TrueAnime","t5_2swc7","I think what you're saying here counts as much for any genre as it does for moe/SoL shows. Do you think harem high school magic action show #23483 is taking any more risks than your typical CGDCT show with 4 girls engaging in x hobby? Most shows from any genre don't take risks, and from those that do you then also have to split them into those that utterly fail and those that succeed.

As with every other genre, the shows that typically end up as critically acclaimed, or ""truly great"" whatever that may mean, are the shows that stand out (for the better of it). They are the shows that really take the genre and elevate it and utilizes it fully. For moe/SoL  you have shows like Aria that throughout the course of 3 seasons and some OVAs tell an absolutely beautiful story about appreciating your life as time is inevitably moving forwards. It very much makes you feel strong emotions as you see the characters grow as people, both joy and sadness. You'll even get mad when you see people post shitty Akatsuki x Akari pictures or lewds of the Arias. You also have Kamichu that touches on how people live their lives and adapt to even big changes. Kokoro Library is about how a community can come together to preserve the things that once meant a great deal to them.

These types of shows have the characters front and center (by no means a unique aspect), and will tell you messages about life from a more down to earth angle. It's about the extraordinary in the ordinary, and it's something that resonates with me and many others. 

I can't help but feel you are simply extrapolating your own experiences to the entire genre, making it out as though these are inherent in it. And I disagree that they are. We also seem to view what constitutes ""risky"" very differently, because I don't think a Key VN that taps into a big audience (proved by previous success of similar projects by the same publisher) and reuses many of the same things to create the same emotions, to be risky at all.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","&gt;Since you can't dock at countries you are at war with, does that mean that England (If you take Scotland and Ireland) is untouchable?

You can land your troops if you're in a sea zone next to your land province. Select the boat, select the troops (top-right of the UI popup), then tell them where to land. That does take longer, though, and if there's troops waiting for you on the land, you get a significant combat malus (-3, IIRC, not affected by Maneuver), so it's *difficult* to invade navally... but not impossible. If you clear out the English fleet and then land men where their troops aren't prepared to defend, the British Isles can be yours. That said, you're working on a disadvantage, since the Isles are protected by a powerful navy and the need to land troops... of course, that's why the Brits stayed so safe from foreign aggression historically.

&gt;I am losing a war, I give them 2 claims of mine, and it is well over their war score, they say no. I change it to money, no. I even changed the claims they would get, but they still say no. How can I end the war?

Hover over the red X symbol to see why they're declining (the one that transforms into a checkmark when they will accept). Usually, they want some specific term from the war (for example, they will refuse to peace out unless they get exactly Danzig - plus more warscore). You can use the ""Suggest Peace"" button (or ""Suggest Terms"", something like that) to have the game automatically give you an offer the AI will accept.

&gt;I completely occupy a county in Ireland, killed all their army/ navy, I have 100 war score, but I can't annex them, or make them a vassal, why not?

Can you not select the province, or can you not peace out after selecting the province? If the former, hover over the province selection in the peace screen; if the latter, again, look at that big red X.

The most common reason for this is that it isn't in coring range, or that you don't have the diplo power to complete the peace. 

It's also possible that you're not using a CB that lets you take provinces - for example, Humiliate Rival does not let you take provinces.

&gt;Why does France always feel the need to go to war with me, when ever I start a war?

Cause they're France. But really, this depends. Is it because of Aggressive Expansion? Were you Warned? Are you a heretic/heathen declaring on a member of the Catholic faith while France is Defender of the Faith? 

For reference, you can see who will join, what stab effects, etc. you'll get before declaring war on the war screen (the one where you choose allies to call in).

Or, are they just being opportunistic and conquering your mainland provinces whenever you get into a war? If so, that's just France expanding in its natural way.

&gt;Country I am ""friendly"" with keeps fuckin with my trade, if I enforce trade, and block their ports, and go to war, then I have 15 other countries coming at me. What can I do, because every 20 days it seems to pop up.

What do you mean, ""keeps fuckin with my trade""? That's pretty vague.

&gt;If I put out a settler, and it forms its colony, does it organically expand? or will I need more colonists? (Not sure, haven't gotten that far, look at #4 for reasoning)

If you have a colony on a far-away province, it will expand naturally. If you keep your Colonist there, it'll get new settlers much faster - but it'll keep growing as long as you control it + fund it enough in the budget screen. But yeah, Colonists make it far more efficient - and having more colonies than you have Colonists costs a very large amount of money (exponentially more).

&gt;I had sold Labourd to France, when playing as England. When the war of roses came, some rebels occupied Gascogne, however it was surrounded by France, and I couldn't get military access, so am I just stuck in the war of roses, because I can't unoccupy that provence?

Again, get some transports and land troops on that province.

&gt;How do I maximize my money made from trade?

If you want an essay, [read this (note that it continues in comments)](https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/5a6d3y/the_curiously_inscrutable_principles_of_trade/), but honestly, just follow these rules of thumb:

* identify your home node - it's the node your capital starts in (or you can move it with Res Publica, it's the ""move trade port"" option on the province menu that costs 100(?) dip, but it's generally not necessary - there are situations where it's nice to have, though)
* use merchants to steer trade (transfer trade power) in nodes which flow into your home node
* don't place a merchant in your home node, ever
* take important trading provinces (Centers of Trade and Estuaries - look up the map mode)
* the more nodes trade flows through, the more valuable it becomes, so steering through large chains can be helpful
* all trade flows into Genoa, Venice, or the English Channel eventually, so those are the most valuable to control and - if you have a significant amount of power in them - have your home node in (and, thus, steer to)
* collecting trade with merchants is very rarely worth it unless your empire spans multiple home nodes or ""parallel"" nodes (nodes that flow right past each other without interacting)
* TRIAL AND ERROR - try things out with your merchants, see how it increases or decreases your trade income. I rarely rely on this anymore, but when I was learning trade it was very helpful",1477958423

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","Same thing happened to me when I made a new character.  

The first few games I wrecked.  But after one day it was back to the usual.  It got super sweaty within a day....

I recently heard that matchmaking only focuses 60 percent on connection and only 10 percent on regional.  (I am aware that is only 70 percent) but I am going to only use those two.

Before I go into regional.  60 percent....is way to low.  That means in a 6v6 only 7 of those players were connected based on connection.  In a 3v3 half of the players aren't connected by connection....

That on its own is ridiculous.  But let's look at that 10 percent.  Since only 10 percent is focused on match making you within your region.  You are being connected to people all over the world.  While that is cool that we are so interlocked and connected to play a great game for the purpose of PvP it is a travesty.  Connection doesn't matter if I am being connected to someone in europe.  No matter how fast the Internet works things aren't going to go right when you are being connected to people thousands of miles away that are connected to you by multiple servers.  If it was 60 percent connection and 30 percent regional that 60 percent wouldn't  seem so horrible but when I am being connected to people all over the world it truly is.

Side note on PvP.  T.o.O isn't SBMM it is CBMM but you are matched to people who have the same number of wins but it's on a P2p network and Host can play a major part in individual engagements.  Because of this, I do not support no revives.  While I think the current revive system is broken based on Immunity frames and the time it takes to revive people is far to fast, revives are important in a p2p style pvp.  (That's alot of p's) They are crucial because of Host. 

How many people pull the trigger but fail to trade?  This could easily be due to Host.  This game deals with tenths of second and being Host can clearly be the deciding factor in the system already in place. Do we really want to add no revives in a system that can clearly favor one team simply because they are host?  

I will not go on but since this problem with Sbmm gets into connection I thought I would rant a bit.  ",1477958423

As a side note, something else I've been thinking about is how the air superiority T5 captain skill affects both lines. I'm assuming that once a IJN carrier gets it and faces up against a US carrier with the same skill the US ship is fucked. My logic behind this is due to IJN ships having more squadrons they get the most use out of the skill and so you might end up in a situation where your single squadron of 7 is getting eaten by 2 squadrons of 5.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ok this is a very complex topic, but one can say WWI was more or less ignited because of Franz Ferdinand's assassination. However, the situation was highly volatile in the first place.  

The colonial powers had started an arms race due to clashes in Africa and the far East.  Originally, Germany and Russia were allies in a deal brokered by Bismarck, but in 1890 this was broken for a deal that united Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Russia in turn allied with France. 

The Tangiers Crisis in 1905 helped strengthen the French-British relations, while souring diplomatic ties to Germany.  The second Moroccan crisis in 1914 helped fully cement the Franco-British pact and was strengthened by a secret naval agreement to protect the northern French coast from German interference in exchange for the French Navy protecting British interests in the Mediterranean.

Also, the Italio-Ottoman war in 1912 helped prove that no great power wished to support the Ottomans paving the way for war in the Balkan states. Austria-Hungary was itching for a war with Serbia because the Balkan Wars had left both the Ottomans and the Austro-Hungarians weakened and Russia and Serbia in an advantageous position.  Serbia wished to gain an Albanian port as part of the spoils of the first Balkan War and this created great tension in the region.  When Austrian and international pressure forced them to back away from this demand, they later joined with Greece and attacked Bulgaria.  The Bulgarian army fell easily when the Turks and Romania joined in.

So you had all of these interwoven situations all coming to a head with the assassination.  Germany backs Austria-Hungary with unconditional support.  Austria-Hungary sends Serbia a list of demands they can't possibly accept.  Serbia takes the advice of Russia to not give into the demands, while Germany publicly backs Austria-Hungary's official position.  Russia mobilizes 1.1m men, and the ball is rolling.

TL;DR:  Franz Ferdinand's death was the spark that ignited a powder keg mountain of deals and alliances.

EDIT:  I should also note that Franz Ferdinand himself was a big proponent of peace in the Balkans and with Serbia in particular.  So it was ironic he was killed by the very people he was lobbying for back in Vienna.",1477958426

2. But errors ""cropped up over time.""

4. Or there's a period of time where the Church is on the right course before *a singular decisive moment when the first error is introduced, thus fracturing itself with the previous ""correct"" Church*.

5. I.e. there's a great apostasy

He had to put in a shed for storage, and added an office so he could hang out somewhere that wasn't a fucking studio apartment.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","It's not that he's a bad director (he's very good), it's just that after *Apollo 13* he became a bit overrated.  There's about ten solidly good movies on Howard's resume:

- Cocoon

- Willow

- Parenthood

- Backdraft

- Far and Away

- Apollo 13

- A Beautiful Mind

- Cinderella Man

- Frost/Nixon

- Rush

He's not a visionary director, but he's great at making relatively safe, family-friendly Hollywood films across multiple genres. After *Apollo 13* came out, the only director who could top him in terms of combining critical and box office success was Steven Spielberg. 

Unfortunately because of this, it seems like studios started to give him the greenlight to make films other directors wouldn't get to make, and that (in hindsight) may have been a bad decision.  Most of his critical and/or commercial failures came after *Apollo 13*:

An F1 drama (*Rush*) when your domestic market doesn't care about F1 racing.

A $100 million film about tall ships (*In the Heart of the Sea*) when historical films perform poorly at the box office.

A romantic comedy starring Paul Blart.

A third Da Vinci Code movie.

I had what felt like an embarrassingly bad month: 

**World of Warcraft: Traveler** will be finishing this tonight. I am enjoying this so far, it is a light read. It is a lot younger than I thought it would be though.  I probably wouldn't bother if you didn't play it ever though. 

**The Well of Ascension** I enjoyed this a lot  more than the first one, but sometimes Sanderson writing really drones on.  Sometimes I would love if somebody would just say ""no"" instead of give me a paragraph of text. 


**Night** by Elie Wiesel, powerful book. The seen with the babies burning will stay with me for a long time. 


**Venomous: How Earths Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry** by Christie Wilcox... what a let down of a book. I had such high hopes. If somebody wants to read this, ignore the reviews about needing a background, I'm an accountant and felt like I was one discovery channel documentary away from knowing everything in the book. Seriously. And a tip to authors if you write a 180 page book don't tell me ""as we talked about last chapter"" that was a half hour ago, I'll remember perfectly fine. 


**Fortunately, the Milk** by Neil Gaiman. Meh. I guess it was fun. Neil Gaiman is so hot or cold with me. I loved Neverwhere and none of his other books have had the same effect on me. 

**Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone** reread, purely for fun. 


**The never ending story** god this book was a let down, I actually stopped reading like 60 pages from the end because it just never ended. The first half of the book was great, the second half should be burned from my mind. 


**Library of Souls** by Ransom Riggs. Couldn't finish. Got half way and put it down.  Soooo boring. This series would have been 100 times better if the entire trilogy was condensed into a 500 page book. ",1477958433

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Great points, but I think 5% would be too high. Of course, there is 0 way of really knowing.  As far as us know, war could be guaranteed with Clinton coming to office or impossible with Trump winning (being a Russian ally)... us peons never really get the full story. 

I think generally speaking though, in contemporary times, the chances of a WW are very, very low. It is just not in the interest of the elite (the folks who actually effectively run the country), and those who profit from war, as much as it was historically.

We have entered a late-stage capitalist global economy now where power is shifting further from location-bound constraints to a more fluid, transnational power system with great consolidation. When you are one of the owners of a corporation that owns 500 businesses around the world, with countries in China, Russia and the States, war is bad for business, so it is much harder to bring about on a global, unrestrained scale... at least IMHO. 

If you ignore media sensationalism (to drive clicks and sell papers) we are living in extraordinarily peaceful times if taken into account the history of man.  Besides the United States, which is an incredible war mongering super power (America has been at war for 93% of its history, an incredible 222 years out of 240 or so), and the middle east, which had been at war pretty much in some form since the birth of civilization, then we aren't doing so bad.

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","Can't remember which game it was, but I remember seeing one for a previous game where it actually looked similar to this, with Gini next to Hendo. Sadio was our most advanced player on that day playing just slightly right off the center, with Firmino and Lallana almost overlapping ahead of Hendo and Gini in the middle. I think our actual formation if you want to identify one depends on the phase of play we're in. This graphic only shows a slice of the actual positioning throught the game. It really shows the way someone like Lallana can be influential just by creating space for the front 3, even when he has a quiet game by his standards (not having as many touches or being involved in as many passing moves). You saw it clearly for Firmino's goal, and he's making similar runs all season, trying to drag opposing players out of position to create passing lanes, but he's also so good at maintaining balance when someone else takes up a different position, such as mane or Coutinho drifting inside or Firmino dropping deep, which you don't really see in this graphic but it's key to the fluidity that Klopp wants to see in the side",1477958434

The way that she perceives you will ultimately determine what she needs you for. The more alpha characteristics you exhibit, the more tingles she will get, the more likely she will be to sex you. 

As a girl begins to loose SMV (starts to really set in as 30 Approaches),  she will begin to focus more on relationships with high resource men than she did before. This doesn't mean she will neglect Fuck flings with high value alphas, but she will be less likely to get them due to her decline in SMV.

"StardewValley","t5_2wb7y","Here's a few tips, and usually based on this, it can help you decide if a villager liked your gift or not.  Basically, when you give a gift there's 5 possible categories of responses they will give that tell you if they like it or not - 1=Love, 2=Like, 3=Neutral, 4=Dislike, 5=Hate.  So keep track of the villagers, and what they say when you give them certain things, and you'll soon learn what's good to give them as a gift, and what's not.  

This is what I did, and I did pretty well once I started just giving things to people, and keeping track of it.  Perfect example: It's Spring and you've picked a Daffodil from the ground. Haley is nearby. So you give it to her and her reply is:  

**\*gasp*\...for me? Thank you!**

Turning the controller off and on again fixes the issue sometimes, but what started as an intermittent issue is now a fairly constant one that appears to get worse with time. I have had the controller around a month, and the problem started around a week ago. It's now gone from an issue once every few days to an issue once every few minutes of play...frankly, I want my money back unless they plan to fix it...I'm going to try an RMA first though, as my searching the web for a fix for days appears to not be yielding any results.

So my wife told him while we were there all the stuff i wanted her to tell to her cousin! She was speaking about the actual size of my dick and how i like get licked. She also grabbed my groin twice to check if i was getting hard!! Her gay friend told me that he got really hard. she asked him how big is it and he asked ME if he can flash it. he showed us his really hard dick and touched it in front of us a little  bit..i am not gay but i got really hard as well! My wife insisted that i have to show mine as well! so i did.. she started touching my dick in front of her friend! i was getting harder and thicker! her friend was mastrubating really close to my face. I was on the sofa and he was standing in front of me. My wife gave me a blowjob in front of him. he kneed next to her and he was speaking about my cock.. he said among others that my dick is a little longer than his! that was the point i was rockhard! She told him that he can touch it. He touched it and licked the tip a couple of times.. the he played my dick in my wife's mouth until i ejeculated!!! then he played his for some seconds and ejeculated on his hands.. after that my wife went to wash her face and she was laughing a lot!! she asked me if i want to have a shower with his friend to wash our cocks... i couldn't believe she asked that!! he was really positive to do it and i didn't want to spoil the fun so i accepted. he gave me a full shower. he washed even my hair! When he was about to wash my dick he asked me if it is ok to do it. I said ""yes of course mate!"" And he gave me a really nice handjob in the shower but i didn't cum again.. later on we continue playing cards and laughing..it was cool expirience. my wife told me when we went to sleep that she was jealous to do it with a girl thats why she asked from her gay best friend.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","but do you agree that what is commonly known as science of economics is bourgeoisie's vulgar construct which purpose is to justify exploitation of the working class? If I go study economics in a college what would I be learning? Would I be learning economics, or only bourgeoisie's economics? If latter, then when you say that almost every communist has spent more time studying economics, do you acutally mean that s/he has spent more time studying working class economics - as opposed to *bourgeoisie's economics*, which is that what everyone think about when you say just *economics*. If so, then I would say you are unjustified in saying that communists spent time studying economics. Because they are studying something different from that which everyone have on mind when they hear term ""economics"". In fact they are studying long-time ago refuted marxists bullshit, and they refuse to listen to arguments because of their class-depended subjectivity (""this is our, working class' economics. And that is exploiters' economics."") which is absurd; science is science. ",1477958440

Second: Mistype my bad. I didn't mean killing POV characters, I meant how he just kills people in general. A lot of characters taken from the game have been liked characters so i was more talking about our general feelings towards them rather than importance.
Third: Bran actually is a bit atypical from most ""heroes"". While we as readers or watchers may see Bran in a better light in reality the majority, people outside the ones like you and me who openly discuss these things, think Bran is a pretty annoying character. I know people who out right hate him and that's on them. 
I feel when you write it's more for the majority rather than minority, the minority have the subtle context and clues to dig through but from a point blank perspective Bran, as a character of the world of a song of ice and fire, is far worse off in many aspects than sansa.
Sansa still has the ability to give life, Bran has been robbed of a basic human right and that is to pass himself on through creating a child. I feel from stand point it leaves him far more broken. Bran had to be humbled in a way many other character haven't, he was a child forced to become a man in many aspects. A summer child who had to be ready for the long night.
His rebirth is probably the biggest turn for a character in terms of logic. He started as a selfish boy who wanted to be a knight, and he's become a man of knowledge and wisdom. I feel this aspect will reflect more in the books than the show but I see the potential. 
Bran has great power but it came with great sacrifice and in the book and show he's still growing and at a forced rate because winter has finally arrived and the man bran needs to become is needed now more than ever. He is realistically the biggest threat to the others. He has something no one else has and that is knowledge on the others from a second hand account, I'd say first hand account but i don't count being there in vision form a first hand.

Back to topic. It looks like the stabilizer could be broken in two places: (1) the clip holding it onto the PCB, and possibly (2) the part that holds the wire. If it's just (1), a dab of hot glue to solidify the broken clip should work. If its also (2), then you'll probably want to follow evangs' advice and desolder the board to replace the clip properly. This is one of the drawbacks with cherry-style stabilizers. They do make keycap swapping easier, and aesthetically, I like the look of no wires.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Actually, the plays already have unified timecode stamps.

Every broadcast truck large enough for an NFL game has a timecode generator. In fact most have redundant TCGs. All the video sources are locked to that one clock. Every camera, replay server, cg machine, etc. starts a new frame at the same moment. This allows cuts to happen without getting a partial image from one camera and the rest from another — the cuts are timed to happen between frames.

In addition to aligning when new frames start each frame is stamped with unique timecode as it goes into the replay server. Additionally the timecode comes from the timecode generator. The timecode generator will use IP, GPS, or both to ensure the timestamp applied to each frame is accurate.

To get even cooler, since everything is aligned to world time the timestamps can be referenced against timestamps from the league's statistical information.

Things do get a bit messy with cameras that have mixed frame rates. Most trucks have cameras on board that are cranking 180-480 frames. Unified timecode stamps with mixed frame rates gets a bit messier, but it's still doable.",1477958443

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; I'm saying you are criticizing Marxism as a idealist philosophy and not recognizing that it's a materialist philosophy in the actual terms you are using.

This makes no sense at all. If you can't explain what it means, I'm just going to assume you have no point.

The argument is that capitalism is the economic system that emerged victorious out of the cold war era (both in ideological and analytic terms). My support for this is that most economists today agree; i.e., they agree that Marxism (ideology) and Marxian economics (analysis) are irrelevant and dead. How is this not clear?

The reason I presented an alternate analogy was that yours was a poor analogy, which I explained. Feudalism was not accepted because the serfs who were essentially slaves had no economic freedom whatsoever to change their situation. In recent history, nations that have embraced capitalist values have seen immense growth in quality of life (see: China, S. Korea, Japan, etc.), with middle classes that continue to expand. There was no such thing as middle class in feudalism and the serfs had no choice in the matter of what kind of economic system to support. In western countries, we have democracy, and for some strange reason people continue to vote for parties that embrace capitalist values. Well, it's not that strange. They recognize at least somewhat that their prosperity is due in large part to capitalism. Feudalism was loved only by the feudal lords. Capitalism is loved by a great majority of people in these countries. There is a huge difference. If you can't see that, what the fuck.....",1477958444

Of course you can add flavor.  I see the point with E Cigs as there's no flavor otherwise (almost nothing; it's weird) but with Cannabis it'll taste like the product and you can always add flavoring later on and increase it's volume  it by adding more VG and PG (and decrease it's potency)

If you have that second man there, he would never be in that ""I need to pin point this ball and hope for the best"" state, he would have  options to target and wouldnt feel like he has to force it.

Winston has been having accuracy options, but I think its more to do with only 1 play making option at WR more than people think. That can be a lot of pressure for a QB, especially a guy who is only 22 and in half way through his second season.

Lord Shen's blind ambition and desire to conquer and control ironically backfired on him when his ultimate weapon fell on him and killed him leaving his foe unharmed.

I will admit that the panda village all of a sudden knowing how to give Po chi when supposedly they had all forgotten how was a bit confusing. Though I thought Po became a chi dragon in the spirit realm because he had accepted his role and place as Dragon Warrior. Kai, like many energy stealing villains, was actually defeated in a most stereotypical manner; being given more energy than they can handle. I was kind of hoping for more myself. Still a fun series of movies though.

I think we will probably see a team of villains and/or , as Bl0ndie_J21 mentioned, a panda villain.  I worry that the franchise will get played out and stale.

I went to an orthopedic surgeon who told me that my condition was degenerative and was related to my being overweight. That was my come-to-Jesus moment. Shortly afterwards I made an account on MFP and started logging my food, also exercising. I've never looked back. I know that I'll eventually have to have surgery, but the less load on my spine, the less pain I'll have. Not to mention the many other emotional and physical benefits I'll have from losing weight. It took me a long time to get my shit together, but I'm confident that I'm finally on the right track.",1477958447

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","That was a phenomenal reply that was insightful. Thanks for your perspective. 

What's the point where you'd actually consider voting Liberal over CPC, then? Are you functionally looking for the point, then, where Liberals fiscal policy is indistinguishable from CPC fiscal policy? 

I also agree with your position on the CPC leadership - at their most extreme, any new leader in the CPC will have to be a moderate, if only to attract moderate voters back to the party. That does leave the question, again, of how the CPC properly represents any one conservative, individually.

I do understand that's part of the compromise of making sure that you're represented at all, however. Have you considered the opportunity that PR might present, however, where Liberal moderates might find themselves untethered from the party, by virtue of the same divisive issues that impact the CPC?

&gt; Our socially conservative Christian Heritage ish wing is the older part of the base and their influence is waning. 

I agree - that said, a *lot* of the conservative vote, this election, came from 'Christian Heritage' voters, and others who could not feel able to vote Liberal, under any circumstance. It was that base that reflected the party.

I think PR could be a massive positive for a Libertarian (please correct me if I'm wrong - this is all good faith conversation, so I'll take corrections in good faith), in that it could let Libertarian Liberals, NDP, and Green break ranks.

I'll sometimes notice that I'm going for a sharp turn but my eyes are telling me the car is not turning at the freaking angle I wanted which makes me despair a little.

This only happens when I'm driving at high speeds.

Anyway, back to you... What's your framerate? If you notice the car suddenly stops being as responsive, I'd suggest you try to lower your graphic settings or use one of the many tweaks to get as many fps as you can. The higher and the more constant your framerate is, the lower your input lag will be (constant 60 fps, maybe 16 ms in input delay based from other UE3 games, at 120 you get a lot less ms in input delay).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","A vaccine might not do too much and may actually be very dangerous in Brazil where Dengue virus is also endemic. There are three main types of Dengue. If you get infected by one you will likely recover quickly or not even know that you are sick. But because of a weird quirk in how the immune system works, if you get infected again by a different strain you will get much more severe illness and the chance of death rises significantly. Along this vein, there is some evidence right now that a previous Dengue infection may exacerbate Zika infection. If this is true a vaccine for Zika could put potentially people in danger for serious Dengue infections.

"PAWilds","t5_3caj4","I've not hiked the Quehanna Trail specifically, but my understanding is that the trail is not in great shape and is hard to follow in places.  With accumulated leaf litter on the ground, route finding may be even more difficult.  Conversely, I've also heard that some sections of this trail are quite beautiful, so if you're comfortable with your navigational abilities it may be worth hiking anyways.  

Some alternatives that may be worth considering, if you haven't done them already:

* The Old Loggers Path is a 26 mile loop, so it's not hard to hike this entire trail in a weekend.  There's some very beautiful stretches along this trail, and it's only moderately rugged.  

* The Loyalsock Link-Loop also has a few nice spots along the trail.  The loop itself is 17 miles, but there's an optional 5 mile out and back side trail to the Haystacks (which are worth visiting).  Alternatively, if you start and end at US 220, it's a 25 mile lollipop route.  

* The West Rim Trail is a 30 mile long trail that traverses the edge of the PA Grand Canyon.  This trail is a bit longer, so it would probably demand 2.5 or even 3 full days to hike, but the scenery from this trail is quite impressive in spots.  

With regards to hunting season, I've done backpacking trips in PA this time of year a bunch of times in the past and never had any problems.  Rifle season doesn't start for another month, and muzzleloader already ended, so the only open season on dear is archery season.  It's currently elk season, but their range is limited so I wouldn't worry about that as much.  It's also archery season for bear.

The woods are for everyone, and State Forest land especially is meant for multiple uses (unlike Game Lands which are meant primarily for hunting with regards to visitor use).  Most hunters are also very conscientious and won't take a shot until they're sure of it.  And any hunter that hunts along a marked and maintained backpacking trail should expect that they may encounter hikers.  Wear your blaze orange for sure (better safe than sorry) but apart from that I wouldn't waste to much effort worrying about it.  ",1477958454

Two of his three cogent points are an opposition to the Iraq War and free trade agreements.

Trump won a referendum on whether schoolyard bully vulture capitalist Mormon billionaire dad bot presidential nominee Mitt Romney would have *sucked his dick for an endorsement*, among Republicans.

A man allegedly killed himself because of Mitt Romney's vicious homophobic bullying, and Trump shamed him.

Sarah Palin faded from the limelight of the 2008 general election more gracefully, more marketable, and with more remaining political capital than Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio exited the Republican primaries.

The establishment doesn't run and hide after something like this, but it's only the establishment when it's powerful. 

I am voting Clinton, but I get the logic that if Clinton loses the election she, Bill, Weiner, Huma, Podesta and the whole Clinton thing are *done*, over, for good. 

It's schadenfreude logic, but 55.2% Americans disapprove of Clinton. 

*I* would love for Bill Clinton to get the cold shoulder from the people he used to charge a lifetime's wages to have a cocktail with him. *I* would love for Chelsea Clinton to get priced out of Manhattan and move back to Little Rock. *I* would love for Huma Abedein to fuck off from this whole mess, make a million dollars on her memoir, and have a nice private life.

I'm literally, literally voting for Clinton because I know that it will be less damaging for the country to primary her in four years than to elect Trump.

He was a famous revolutionary, and she was a youth just introduced to anarchism.  It's not that much different than when a priest does it - he held an exalted position and exploited it to enter into a relationship.  It doesn't matter how precocious she may or may not have been; he had so much more social capital that they could not possibly have been on equal footing.  Hell, an eighteen-year-old would have been in much the same position.

I don't know that prison would have had anything to do with it.  There are plenty of men who would date a fifteen-year-old girl anyway.  I also don't buy the ""they didn't know any better"" thing.  Every time I hear that I just picture Genghis Khan's screaming victims going ""well, he's just a product of his times, he can't know murder is wrong"" inside.

But you're right about trauma.  It changes people.  As we see with refugees, combat veterans, targets of abuse, and children who grew up in Chicago, prolonged trauma causes serious, permanent damage to your nervous system.  I don't doubt he was a lot different after he got out.  That prison changes people permanently is one of the things that keeps sending ex-cons back in (it also increases crime, not a little ironically.)

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Those ""buzz words"" are the ones she used in the 2nd US Presidential debate explaining her stance on Syria.  And while not the first option, it it would be an effective one.

Assad's government cannot effectively advance or fight Syrian rebels without Russian air cover.  The Russians would be well informed in advance and it would be equally their fault for challenging the US by flying into an area after being warned they would be shot down.  The reason the threat is legitimate is because the Russian military budget is about 1/10th of the US and their economy is about 1/4th.  Their military is less advanced and they cannot outspend the US.

The point isn't to escalate into a full blown war but increase the pressure to resolve the one in Syria.  You say Russia would wage an all out war but there is still a NATO treaty, NATO troops near their border, and NATO ""defensive missiles"" near their border.  In order to make a threat (like making a no fly zone in Iraq) it has to be credible.

Here's some quotes from FC fourms on this topic and info on Polishing extracts from skunkpharmresearch.

&gt; The claim that a concentrate has to have lipids in it to be a crumble is completely false. 
Dewaxing is just removing a harmless impurity. Crumble can be achieved just as easily with dewaxed oil as shatter can be with unaltered oil.

--------

&gt; The difference between what people call absolute vs basically everything else. Absolute has had these fats/lipids removed, typically using cold temperatures to separate the substances. Using solvents (polar or non-polar) allows the undesirables to drop out at the low temperatures. One solvent or two can be used that is preference and how advanced your setup is.

&gt;You can still obtain shatter having fats/lipids in your wax. The best way to tell if a concentrate has unwanted plant substances in it is harshness after a hit, dewaxed errl goes down like butter.""

-----------

&gt;Whoever told you that crumbles must contain fats and lipids should be ignored.

&gt;Many people don't vac purge after winterizing or doing QWET extractions. Ethyl Alcohol doesn't have to be purged out completely. But, if you don't purge it out completely you will only think that shatter is all you can make with QWET or after winterizing. When I vac purge my winterized BHO runs long enough I get crumble or wax\budder. Whichever I'm going for really. I never whip manually, thats Busch League Bullshit. Manual whipping traps air in your product helping it degrade. Do budder correctly with vac purging and you get bubbless budder that doesn't contain air that will degrade your product as fast. From what I can tell from what I have made it seems to have pretty good shelf life with no perceived loss of potency, but its usually gone in under 2-3 weeks. You can get the same finishes from an absolute that you can with non winterized butane run. Sometimes I purge for 5-7 days, it all depends on the run.

&gt;The people on Instagram are simply ignorant fools regurgitating some BS they read somewhere and have no real experience with.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Try to think about creative ways to get people to send you Bitcoin, think of it like starting a business on the internet. Since all you need is a Bitcoin wallet address &amp; QR code, you can post that as your channel for payment/donations, just provide something useful to the world and be outcome independent. You could make youtube videos for example and edit your QR code into the video at the beginning/end, while also posting the address in the description. Same goes for starting your own website, some kind of shop where you sell something for Bitcoin, the only limit is your creativity. You can accept it out in the world too, make a lemonaid stand or something, with your payment info displayed.

If you want to get a small amount of Bitcoin very simply, lookup ""Bitcoin faucets"" and try to find the highest payouts.

Mining is generally too competitive, you would need a lot of money upfront to compete with serious miners. However, if you want to invest in your own abilities for the future, building a powerful mining rig that is within your means is not a bad idea, maybe not for Bitcoin, but altcoins with less competition. It's a nice thing to have going on the side, especially if you have free electricity (that your parents would be paying for I assume). Just try to do a good amount of research and pre-planning if you try to get into mining, hardware can become obsolete over time and some blockchains use different algorithms which will not be optimal for every type of mining rig (ASIC resistance for example). Apparently Zcash, which has basically just launched, has an algorithm that mainly requires powerful CPUs and at least 8gb of RAM, but needs to be run in linux, so you would need to be able to follow some guides and install something like Ubuntu Linux OS, which isn't that tough to be honest, but expect to run into some confusion and road blocks when trying to learn details about mining and the options available (solo mining vs mining in pools vs cloud mining).

Other than that you can gather some money and buy Bitcoin, but I'm sure you know that already. Also, spend some time understanding how taxes work if you want to be legally secure when profiting from Bitcoin.

It's the right time for Sumail to be looking for some where else, and at that point EG is already confirmed that Fear is retiring, Sumail might leave, Zai wants to play with RTZ/Crit and only PPD is left on the team.

"Journalism","t5_2qhym","This is an interesting topic. I tend to lean toward feeling critical of the audience, though perhaps I'm too cynical. 

I agree with your three causes and results, though I'd like to press forward a bit further. Breitbart and Infowars are no doubt the worst offenders, though left-leaning niche sites (Huffington Post, Jezebel, Salon) are not free from criticism either.

My concern with the audience is that the flood of niche news sites is changing the way readers view news and irreparably damaging the integrity of journalistic institutions. Like you said, niche news sites give people what they want, and they do so while posing as journalistic institutions. It's far more profitable to do so. Most damaging, these sites cull their readers into herds, relentlessly pounding the shortcomings of traditional media and posturing themselves as the real arbiters of truth and your well-being. 

When the audience sees traditional media making mistakes or not giving them exactly what they want to hear, there's a confirmation bias that occurs in the audience. It even happens when journalists are doing responsible parts of their job, like informing a source of allegations and requesting comment prior to publication. ""Ah ha! Sean was right. The mainstream media is so corrupt."" And so on, and so forth. 

So I'm critical of the audience, though I don't necessarily feel they're at fault, if that makes sense. It's human nature to seek out what's similar or confirming of your previously held beliefs. It's easier. These sites are just playing to natural instincts. ",1477958471

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Ok.  So, using FTC I am finally able to see it proc in the FTC combat log and in the scrolling combat text this addon provides. The proc seems to be called Trinimac's Valor. It actually makes a pretty loud clanging sound, not sure how i didn't notice this before. Also, **there is no** floating blue orb (?). It procs a yellow/orange globe of light, sort of like an egg, surrounding the torso of a single ally, which explodes outwards causing the AOE heal and AOE damage. The clang sound can be heard when the globe of light explodes, so there is a significant delay between when your shields are cast and when you can hear Trinimac's Valor proccing, which is maybe a second or a second and a half later (this is easier to hear than to see, considering the light show that takes place in a group combat setting).

The government subsidizes crop insurance to increase participation, but this is an area where the free market can handle our needs. If a farmer chooses not to purchase insurance goes bust another farmer will take over and purchase insurance so the same thing doesn't happen to him.

This was a problem during the depression, which is when the program was created. Now the subsidy allows farmers to make riskier decisions instead of playing it safe costing tax payers up to $20B a year. There is NO LIMIT with crop insurance, and those that recieve payments are kept secret.

"TheMindIlluminated","t5_3f6ws","So this is my story: Around this time last year I was in a very extreme state of depression and anxiety due to life circumstances and a lot of stressful and traumatic life events. 

I tried antidepressant medication but it just wasn't right for me. I'm a very creative person and I felt like they blocked me from my creativity. Losing my creativity scared me so much at the time that I thought I'd rather be dead or depressed than to be cut off from my imagination.

I managed to find a therapist trained in mindful based cognitive therapy around January after deciding that enough was enough I needed to get better. I didn't pick that therapist because I was interested in mindfulness but rather she was one near where I lived. I had praticed NSR mantra meditation in the past and while I found it helpful for dealing with my moods, it wasn't a cure for me and I only did it occasionally. I didn't meditation or mindfulness would work for these things. I'd also tried plan old CBT before but that wasn't a long term thing either.

I groaned when my therapist recommended mindfulness but I thought I'd try it anyway. It was a really slow process for me and it wasn't a fast thing overcoming depression. It took a few months. The book I used at this time was the Mindful way through Depression by Mark Williams which my therapist recommended. I slowly slowly developed mindfulness through body scanning techniques, walking meditation and mindfulness of breathing. 

What really helped a lot was being mindful during the day. I would try to do a lot of things mindfully like eating or washing the dishes. Whenever I noticed painful thoughts or emotions I would be mindful of them. Eventually they began to stop appearing in my consciousness after a few weeks because I wasn't providing them with fuel. In the way I was particularly depressed, I felt like I constantly deserved the bad things that  had happened to me and I punished myself by repeating how much I deserved this pain.

On some level I recognised that my  particular form of suffering was a choice I was making and that some part of me was choosing to do this to me. By being mindful I could watch this part of my mind that promoted these things and observe it and if I chose to, look away and not indulge it. 

Then I started practicing loving kindness meditation and I began cultivating positive feelings. This broke me out of the negativity I was in and I could now feel positive emotions again. The first time I did loving Kindness meditation I hit the first Jhana and that's when I knew there was more to meditation than even the mindfulness movement thinks. 

I started researching Buddhism and meditation and found my way to Culadasa. This was probably around March last year and I was practicing meditation for two hours everyday, one hour of mindfulness(usually body scanning) and another hour of loving kindness. 

I think I was around stage 3 or four when I began reading TMI and a lot of things started clicking for me then. I also read a lot of other books on meditation and stuff on the Internet. An overwhelming amount of stuff that I couldn't begin to list.

I was probably in stage 5 around May and I spent most of the summer in stage5/6. I started to feel tingling and energy in stage 6 and I tried using that to hit the pleasure Jhanas but I couldn't. It literally felt like trying to turn on a car and turning the key but the engine won't fully turn on and keeps revving. The concentration was there but the energy wasn't.

The energy began just developing on its own. I think what helped that along was focusing on dealing with my stuff and emotional pain and finding where it was stored in my body and observing it non judgementally where eventually it would just pop.

Pain can be very useful in meditation I find. You can make a lot of progress by non judgementally observing it.

I've been at stage 7 since the end of August, I'd say roughly. I had a lot of ""stuff"" come up then and I had to undergo a lot of purification and deal with it. My sense of  my body and mind started to changed too and I began having weird energy experiences, like electricity was in my body and running up and down my spine. I also had some nausea and pressure in my head that only went away when I meditated. The pressure in the head was the worst because it felt like brain fog. I eventually figured out how to deal with that though. Purification is a life long process and I don't think you ever finish it. There's so many layers to our experience but thankfully I have a method to dealing with it.

At the moment all that stuff has died down though I still get nausea pretty frequently but I don't know if that's meditation related or something I'm just prone to. 

My development was pretty quick(though a lot of the time I felt like I was getting nowhere, so nobody should despair reading this' it will definitely happen, just keep practising) I think because I was practicing a lot and I had ideal conditions that other people don't  have. I live on a farm and I was helping my Dad on the farm during the Summer so I had a lot of time to be mindful and no stress or external things to deal with. I had the time  and energy to devote myself to practice and working on myself. I was very very lucky to have that time.

TLDR; Overall it took me ten months to get to stage 7 from January to October. It hasn't been a linear path though or straightforward. Sometimes I felt like I was going backwards rather than forwards but keep practising is all I can say. I am definitely not special. Anyone can do this. ",1477958472

Usually a fighter may fly escort or may be intercepting, not normal to have it be both escort and intercept at the same time. Generally happening to be in the same area while not seeing the other aircraft isn't a an intercept.

""So important"" is an assumption on your part. I don't consider it ""important"" as much as ""countering the white noise"". The more people continue to spread poor information, badly understood pop science understanding about things like CERN (and what they do/don't actually do) and blatant attempts to dismiss ALL memory issues by trying to shove them all into ""confabulation/memory must be stupid"" arguments, the less actual movement forward in trying to figure out what MEs might actually BE we will possibly have. 

I'd simply like to focus on actual ME stuff that matters, instead of centering on the entire movie/tv segment of ME's, which are IMO almost uniformly explained by rational means.

But here's a question back at you, in the interests of at least trying to have some rational discussion:

What POSSIBLE reason could there be for Rocky Horror to have ANY connection to ME's? Say you are the correct one and somehow, in some way, the supposed ""vast list"" of ME's from this film IS there for a reason. What reason could that possibly be? ",1477958479

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I think sometimes there are things that could be more inclusive. As for ""why"" trans guys and nb people should be included, I feel like we're on the same side here - and that by people on either side supporting each other, it does a great deal more help than the ""them vs us"" mindset I've seen around from a small minority of users. 

Some experiences on either side are unique and it's fair enough to aim them one way or the other (eg, as a trans guy don't know much about facial feminisation surgery, so addressing a post about that wouldn't be an issue, same with asking other trans guys about top surgery - or something similarly exclusive to one side); but some things are universal (eg, choosing a name, coming out, general trans experiences), and I find it quite sad when those are excluding people when they could very easily be made open to everyone.

I think on the whole the community is nice, but I've had quite a few comments that make me tempted to leave the sub entirely, namely people saying that *everything* is so easy for trans guys (and general negativity that we don't ""deserve"" help or are ""ungrateful"" for being afab (without taking into consideration we feel the same dysphoria and pain), that sort of thing). Similarly, how almost every thread calling for more inclusivity almost always gets hijacked...

I think sometimes seeing things from different perspectives is good - sure it might not be what the original question was looking for, but someone can simply not reply to the comments they aren't looking for and it might make someone already feeling down feel like they belong by at least letting them comment. 

I think the simplest way to solve it is for more awareness that it's not just ladies here, and also how sometimes just dropping one word can make a massive difference (eg ""How did you choose your feminine name?"" can be simply ""How did you choose your name?"", same meaning, no exclusion on either side.

The line between protection and oppression is pretty narrow.

If you're in the world where the photographer pays the model, that means you're in amateur territory which is where models can be flaky. It's the world where every pretty girl on Instagram thinks they're a model and every kid with a camera thinks they're a photographer. Some of them will be professional, capable and dependable, some will not. 

Once you're working in the world of professional fashion photography, the photographer never pays for models and the models are all represented by agencies.

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","But I'm not saying that. I'm not even saying I wouldn't love more interesting weapons myself. I'm saying within DS2/DS3 it's mostly just a pvp concern for me (i.e. it's not much of a concern for me) because the enemies within DS2 simply aren't interesting enough to make me all that engaged in the combat. It's great to have varied weapons. But when the enemies I use those weapons against aren't interesting they cancel each other out. DS3 has less interesting but still good weapons, and fantastic enemy designs. That combines into an overall much more engaging experience for me. But if you play pvp then you always have much more interesting enemies -- other people -- so it becomes a much bigger factor. If DS3's weapons were critically bad then it would become a serious concern but they aren't, they're still great, enough that I've put 100s of hours and have more to put in yet because I haven't tried every class properly, or every wpn, especially these new DLC ones.     

Yeah, but I didn't dispute any part of that. At all. I just disputed your statement that DS2 was supposedly barely criticized at all, and how you tried to brush its flaws under the rug and act as though ppl only criticized it because they didn't play it enough or didn't play Scholar.",1477958480

Unless the globalists really want Trump to be Pres -- or if it looks like Hillary will actually lose -- don't expect a false flag. 

But I think there's a good chance the real globalists want Trump to be President. They did give us Brexit, and a Trump win would be Brexit 2.0. Giving the people the illusion that they, the people, are in charge. 

And then using the Trump win to cause riots, chaos and to defame the very concept of democracy, thus laying the groundwork for the introduction of the NWO -- a global, benevolent dictatorship. 

In light of this, we could see Brexit -- and the Trump campaign/presidency -- as the first stage in the dismantling phase of the Western world. Ultimately, the whole of the EU and the USA might be dismantled to give way for the NWO. The NWO will be radically different from this OWO we're currently living in. ",1477958482

"breakingmom","t5_2y6ap","This is very good advice - I see attorneys file motions all the time that they don't have a shot of winning. Some attorneys start with asking for sole legal and physical custody right off the bat for everyone, so they can wiggle down from there. Even for parents who've never even spent a minute alone with a child. So if you get something batshit crazy, just take a deep breath and know that they're shooting for the moon just to try and get something. 

And yes, there are attorneys who will file anything their clients ask. Example - a man's ex filed to have his parental rights terminated because he's a violent drug addict who hasn't seen his kids in a year even though he lives a mile away. Leaves new girlfriend's toddler alone with dirty needles everywhere (I shit you not) and has an open neglect and abuse case there.

With media consumption being so diffuse, everyone can seek out and live in their own bubbles. These bubble/echo chamber communities are generally dismissive of outside voices, and those voices tend to cease bothering to interact with places they're unwanted. I think this trend is unavoidable without an unrealistically large shift in our culture both on and offline in terms of ideological inclusiveness.

The other angle that appears to me is to more strictly regulate news media to stop the spread of disinformation and hateful rhetoric. That again seems to be a nonstarter on the lines of first amendment proprotections and mistrust of the government.",1477958484

In the living room there was a nice large window. But there was a second, smaller, circular window in another wall at an odd height. And of course a wall with stupid recesses again (not back-to-back with the bedroom). 

The kitchenette had one extremely small square window. *Really* small. And the toilet was so small, if you wanted to take a shit you had to move in backwards ;-)

The top flat was even worse due to all those pitched roof areas. The architect had designed a *very* creative roof. The carpenters and roofers were cursing to no end. And the flat was more or less useless if you wanted to use wardrobes or shelves. Even the inner walls were not straight, but made with useless alcoves.

On top of that, the architect made a measuring mistake. He created a new staircase in the annex because it was planned to remove the old staircase and turn that space into additional rooms (which never happened, and we moved out nearly 20 years ago). Ground floor and first floor are level on both sides, but on the second floor, the architect was 5cm (2in) off.",1477958486

&gt; Helloween is a  power/heavy/speed metal band from Germany founded in 1978 by members of Iron Fist and Powerfool, as Gentry. Helloween are known as major innovators of power metal.

&gt; Members today are: 
Andi Deris – Vocals, 
Michael Weikath – Guitar, Backing vocals, 
Sascha Gerstner – Guitar, Backing vocals, 
Markus Grosskopf – Bass, Backing vocals 
and Daniel Löble – Drums

&gt; 
The original line-up featured: 
Kai Hansen (Vocals/Guitars),
Michael Weikath (Guitars), 
Markus Grosskopf (Bass)
and Ingo Schwichtenberg (Drums). 
In 1984 the band had signed a deal with Noise Records and recorded two songs for a Noise compilation record called Death Metal. The two tracks were ""Oernst Of Life"" by Weikath, and Hansen's ""Metal Invaders"" which later on ended up in a faster version on the band's first full-length album.

&gt; 1985 came around and Helloween then recorded their first record Helloween, a self-titled EP containing 5 tracks. The EP was successful, and during that same year they recorded and released their first full-length album titled Walls of Jericho which became a critical smash, with its innovative mixture of speed and melodies. (In Fact, WWE Wrestler Chris Jericho took his stage name from the album, as well as the name of his signature submission move Walls Of Jericho). However, during the following tour, it became obvious that Kai had difficulties singing and playing the guitar at the same time. Kai's last performance as the band's lead-singer came in 1986 in form of a single EP titled Judas, which contained the song ""Judas"" along with some live tracks. After that Helloween began the search for a new vocalist...

&gt; The first choice was to recruit former Tyran Pace vocalist Ralf Scheepers, however the band ended up finding an 18-year-old talent from the local Hamburg band Ill Prophecy, named Michael Kiske. With their new lead singer they recorded Keeper of the Seven Keys, Part 1, released in 1987, which established Helloween as one of the most successful metal bands in Europe. In 1988 Helloween recorded Keeper of the Seven Keys Part II, their best-known album featuring the classic line-up. The band achieved even more success around the world than with ""Keeper 1"" and things were going extremely well.

&gt; Guitarist Kai Hansen surprisingly left the band soon after the European tour for the ""Keeper 2"" album due to conflicts within the band as well as troubles with the record company, and a growing dissatisfaction with life on tour. He was shortly after replaced by former Rampage guitarist Roland Grapow, who finished the rest of the ""Keeper 2"" tour with the band.

&gt; In 1989 the band released a live album called Live In The UK, featuring live material from their 1988 European tour, entitled Keepers Live in Japan and I Want Out Live in US. The remaining members continued on, but label problems kept them from touring and releasing new material until 1991 when, after several rumours about the band breaking up, they released Pink Bubbles Go Ape. The album was an utter failure commercially and critically, and soon tensions started to build up between the band members. The pop-influenced follow-up Chameleon, released in 1993, made the band lose most of their hardcore fans. During the Chameleon-tour, drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg fell ill due to personal- and drug-related problems, and was eventually forced to take a break from the band. Meanwhile the conflicts within the rest of the band had grown even worse, and the band decided to fire singer Michael Kiske.

&gt; Helloween returned in 1994 with former Pink Cream 69 singer Andi Deris as their new lead-singer, and Uli Kusch, formerly of Kai Hansen's new band Gamma Ray, on the drums, releasing their successful comeback Master of the Rings. However, in 1995 the band and its former members were badly shaken by the tragic suicide of original drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg, who never managed to recover from his illness. Dedicated to his memory, 1996's The Time Of The Oath re-established the band as one of the most popular European metal bands. Following another world tour, a double live album called High Live was released.

&gt; In 1998 Helloween released Better Than Raw, one of the band's heaviest albums since the full-length debut. A cover-album called Metal Jukebox was released in 1999. 2000 saw the release of The Dark Ride, a more experimental and darker album than their previous releases. Immediately after the following world tour, Helloween parted ways with guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch who together formed Masterplan. Replacements were soon found in guitarist Sascha Gerstner (ex-Freedom Call, Neumond), and drummer Mark Cross (ex. Metalium and Kingdom Come, currently in Firewind) who was later to be replaced by Stefan Schwarzmann, former drummer of Running Wild and Accept. Another studio album titled Rabbit Don't Come Easy came in 2003 with a successful world tour following, including the bands first tour in the U.S. since 1989.

&gt; 2005 saw yet another line-up change, following the ""Rabbits on the Run"" tour, as it became apparent that Helloween and Stefan Schwarzmann did not share the same musical vision. As further noted by the band, he had some trouble performing fast drum parts, so he was replaced by Dani Loble, the former drummer of German metal band Rawhead Rexx. A change in record company also followed as they inked a deal with German label SPV. Any fears that what had now become a revolving door of band members would affect the quality of their new album were laid to rest as Helloween's new studio album, titled Keeper of the Seven Keys - The Legacy, was released in October 28, 2005 in Germany, and November 8 in the U.S.A. to commercial and critical acclaim. The album had a pre-release single, Mrs. God, as well as a video for the track. The track Light the Universe was released as a single on November 22, featuring Candice Night of Blackmore's Night on guest vocals. She also appears in the video clip for that track.

&gt; In late 2006, Helloween filmed and recorded shows in Sao Paulo (Brazil), Sofia (Bulgaria) and Tokyo (Japan), for their live album Keeper Of The Seven Keys - The Legacy World Tour 2005/2006. The DVD also featured extra footage of the band as well as interviews and a road movie. This is the second Helloween live album to feature Andi Deris as frontman, and third overall. It enjoyed chart success in several countries: Germany: 9 (DVD) &amp; 58 (CD), Sweden: 9 (DVD), France: 10 (DVD).

&gt; Helloween has since completed their latest studio album Gambling with the Devil, which was released on October 23, 2007. It has received many positive reviews, with most fans praising the album as being one of the best Deris era albums. Despite being one of Helloween's heaviest albums, it is noted for featuring more keyboards. ""As Long As I Fall"", the first single, was released in early September and available only via download (save for Japan, where it was released on CD). The video for the song is available at their official site.

&gt; Helloween teamed up with Kai Hansen's current band Gamma Ray for their 2007/2008 ""Hellish Rock"" world tour, that started in early November 2007. Helloween were headlining and Gamma Ray were labeled as the ""very special guest"" with most shows also having fellow German ""guest"" Axxis. The tour went through Europe, Asia, South America as well as a few dates in the US. The tour is notable for Kai Hansen stepping on stage with his former band fellows Weikath and Grosskopf to perform hits ""I Want Out"" and ""Future World"" in the last encore segment of Helloween.

&gt; On December 26, 2009, Helloween released the Unarmed – Best of 25th Anniversary album in Japan. The album was released on February 1, 2010 in Europe. The album is a compilation of 10 of the band's best songs, re-recorded in different musical styles than the original recordings and by the current lineup. It features a 17 minute ""Keepers Medley"", recorded by a 70 piece orchestra from Prague, mixing together ""Halloween"", ""The Keeper of the Seven Keys"", and ""The King for 1000 years"". There is a limited edition digipak, including a 30 minute ""making of""-DVD with interviews and studio footage. The bands website states that the album will be released on April 13, 2010 in North America via SONY &amp; THE END RECORDS labels.

&gt; Helloween released their thirteenth studio album, 7 Sinners, on October 31 in Europe and November 3 in the US. Before its physical release, the band made it available worldwide for streaming via its Myspace page. The name of the album alludes to the seven deadly sins which, according to Andi Deris, it goes straight to the point ""after an acoustic album, we needed definitely something that shows the people without any question that this is a metal album"".The band toured to promote the new album with Stratovarius and Pink Cream 69 as their guests. On April 5th 2011, via the band's website, it was announced that 7 Sinners was awarded 'Gold status' in the Czech republic.

&gt; In mid-September 2012, Helloween announced the title of their upcoming fourteenth studio album, ""Straight Out of Hell"", released in 18th January 2013. Read more on Last.fm.

On open desert maps though all you need to do is stay hull down using the American tanks excellent gun depression and hugging sand dunes.  Never ridgeline(go over the top of a dune/hill), always go around the edges and sides of sand dunes, and using sixth sense, when you know you're spotted, always stay on the move and always be relocating to make another shot.  This is how you avoid arty.  You're only asking to get dumped on by arty if you stand still.  

This will greatly minimize your chances of dying to arty.  It won't completely save you but it will drastically improve your chances for survival.  Another thing is to always keep an ear out for arty.  If you know arty just hit or tried to hit someone near you then you know he's zero'd in on that area and it's your own fault for sticking around.  When you hear artillery landing you know it's time to move.  Don't think you always have to go forward also, many times the best option is to retreat and bait the enemy into your team.

"worldofpvp","t5_2wbvb","&gt;Oh don't worry, most classes and specs feel shit at pvp.

This expansion feels weird that way.  WoD, for all its problems, did not have this trouble.  The game never has, actually.  Somehow it seems to be a Legion thing.

With each balance patch, some classes just feel head and shoulders above every other class/spec, and their power is just completely oppressive, to the point that they outperform literally everything in every way.  

When Legion dropped, it was arms warriors.  Damage was just off the charts and no one had any hope of fighting back against a warrior team.  No one wanted any other melee because warriors were just better.  

Then warriors got nerfed (overnerfed, obviously) and were almost completely replaced by ass rogues.  To be fair, this was at least a (very) small improvement because other comps did start to edge into the ass rogue meta; ret and enhance had a decent shot, and demo could carry some comps that could put up a fight against rogues.  But by and large, you either played with an ass rogue or got pounded by one.  

Now we're in 7.1, with destro warlocks and frost DKs smashing everyone, and holy paladins starting to exert more dominance across the other healing classes as MW drops and resto shamans struggle against the meta.  But again, a more careful look would tell you that even after destro and frost gets nerfed, we're still going to have windwalkers, mages, ferals, etc. shitting on everyone.  Mark those words.

What's interesting here is that there seems to just be a lineup of very overpowered classes dominating the game, and then there's just everyfuckingbody else getting carried by them.  Usually, there's more of a range of balance where a couple things are OP, but several other classes are trailing right behind them, then a few weaker ones that maybe have a place in one or two gimmicky comps (such as pre-7.1 destro playing windwalker/lock/healer), then a few nonviable ones (like fury warrior, brewmaster monk, holy priest, etc).  Generally, this allows a metagame to develop where a few comps are blatantly overpowered, but most other classes and comps can at least put up a fight or feel like they aren't completely fucked by the better classes.  In legion though, it feels like there's a lot more of a dichotomy there.  You're one of 3 things - a ""chosen one"" (handful of godly overpowered specs, such as pre-7.1 ass rogue), some other moderately strong class that synergizes well enough to get carried by a god class (for example, pre-7.1 frost mages playing with ass rogues), or.... ""the rest.""  A bunch of potato classes that don't fit anywhere and are just outperformed across the board by the god classes (the large majority of the specs sit in this category - elemental, affliction, arms, fury, moonkin, arcane, fire, all DH, all hunters, all pre-7.1 DK, resto druids, etc.)

What they need to do is recognize that the game is shit and start taking risks.  They've adopted this conservative approach to nerfing and buffing stuff, but that only works when the game is kind of decent to begin with.  I mean, we're getting balance patches like every 2 or 3 weeks right now, let's fucking mix it up a little bit.  Buff elemental shamans and DHs and aff locks resto druids etc. by like 20 fucking percent, while nerfing frost DKs and destro locks and holy paladins and windwalkers.  See what the fuck happens.  If suddenly DHLD is the strongest comp in the game, then congratulations, you've been dogshit all expansion so enjoy a couple weeks of being strong before our next balance patch that cuts your balls off while buffing some other underperforming stuff.  We need larger changes from BOTH directions (buffs to underpowered, nerfs to overpowered) every couple of weeks for like a month or 2, and then maybe we'd have a game that would be worthy of this slow, methodical, conservative approach that Blizzard is trying to use.

Girl B concludes the best option is to go get a gun, which she points at everyone and starts hysterically screaming for them to leave. Somehow girl A's friends end up with the gun outside, but then the police show up because the neighbours had heard all the noise and called them.

Additionally, all of the advancement in the world, transportation, agriculture, computing, medicine, entertainment, etc. were fueled by inexpensive energy, mostly hydrocarbons. Everyone has benefited from this inexpensive energy. We're experiencing the benefits now and will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
     
Now weigh that against a slight rise in temperature over the next 100+ years. Which may for all we know be a net benefit. 
     
I'm very familiar with the multitudes of negative scenarios. I've been reading about them for decades. 
     
The thing that sticks out is many of the same characters from the population scares are the same people saying the sky is falling now. They were against nuclear energy, they are against GMOs. 
    
The trend here is not one that lends itself to confidence. 
      
There may be net negative outcomes, I don't know. But whatever they are they will need to be cataclysmic to outweigh the benefits seen in the past and currently from inexpensive energy. Strange those benefits are never part of the equation.

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","If you're interested, here's a nice way to see that 1+2+3...+n = n(n+1)/2   

Consider n even, like n = 6. Then you have 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6.  
Group the 1 and the 6 together, and the 2 and the 5, and the 3 and the 4. See how each pair adds up to 7, or n+1? That's because you start with the pair n and 1, and then to get the next pair you add 1 to the 1 and subtract 1 from n, giving you the same n+1.

So each pair is n+1, and how many pairs are there? Well it's half the number of numbers you're adding which is n, so you get n/2 pairs. So ""n/2 times (n+1)"" = n(n+1)/2.   

For the case that n is odd, like n=7, you can continue to use the pairs technique.   

(1+7) + (2+6) + (3+5) + 4     

So we have (n-1)/2 pairs which add up to n+1, so that's 
(n+1)(n-1)/2. But we have that 4 to deal with, how do we account for that? Well that number is always going to be (n-1)/2 + 1. In this case for instance, 6/2 + 1 = 4. Making it so it's all one fraction gives us (n-1)/2 + 1 = (n-1)/2 + 2/2 = (n+1)/2. So now you're adding (n+1)(n-1)/2 and (n+1)/2. Multiplying out the numerator of that first fraction gives us (n^2 - 1)/2 + (n+1)/2 = (n^2 + n)/2 = n(n+1)/2.",1477958499

I agree that this is a really interesting topic and contrary to my first impression there are so many ways to interpret especially Griffith's feelings and the relationship between the two becomes visibly more multi layered when you try to differentiate between the different kinds of attractions while separating Femto and Griffith's actions.

Right now I feel comfortable with thinking it's some sort of mix between those articles you linked to me. 
I view Griffith more as an asexual and from my perspective, his bond to Guts is something even beyond platonic and romantic in this really complicated way. It kinda reminded me slightly of the relationship of Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham in NBCs Hannibal.

People can temporarily park their cars there to drop off groceries and, if you're moving, you have to use the rear doors. 

Last summer, I'm sitting with friends with the screen door open. We hear women cursing and laughing. Look and see a woman with two friends *kicking two boxes from the opposite apartment's rear exit to the lawn near this small road. One friend is carrying a back garbage bag and she slams whatever is in it to the ground. They kick the boxes some more and go back in. About ten minutes later, they're carrying a second box out, which the make sure is dumped upside down. 

About 20 minutes pass. A car pulls up with a woman driving and a male passenger. He gets out and seems distressed. More shouting. She starts to walk to the rear door, he starts yelling, ""No no no!"" She gets back in the car. He goes inside. 

He comes back out. The girl is screaming at him about ""his whore."" One of her friends is with her and is holding her phone up. (Maybe she was recording them?) He quickly packs stuff in. Girl is telling him to get the fuck out of there. 

He gets gone with the new chick after about five minutes. Right as another car was arriving. It was a grey haired man yelling about disrespecting his daughter.

"MakeupRehab","t5_32g1x","Hi, and welcome! I, too, went through Marie Kondo's book recently and it has helped me to see that in order to make space for something in my life, it needs to have a purpose other than just having it. 

I didn't have too much of a buy as a reward issue, mine was more of a buying occasionally without a purpose and not using it issue. Towards that end, I found some of the techniques here very useful. 

May I suggest replacing items as reward with experiences as reward? Whatever the experience is, and I suggest something without cost or with little cost to make sure you don't replace buying of one kind with another, it works if you make an occasion of it. 

I schedule a date with myself every once in a while, planning my outfit, my makeup, what I will do, and those are precious times. This does not necessarily mean buying an experience, planning a day in a local museum, picking your outfit, doing a little pre-research to look forward to what you will see, really opening your eyes and looking at your surroundings, treating yourself to a nice coffee afterwards - just like being on a very good date, but with yourself. 

Reminds me that I haven't done this in a while - time to call myself and make an appointment :)

"politics","t5_2cneq","OMG you are incredible, such a vivid imagination you do have.  Let's talk about Comey and his press conference.  I thought she should have been indicted to be honest with you.  Her handling of every aspect of the email scandal, from setting it up to ""wiping it with a cloth"".  She demonstrated that she lacks basic good judgement, actually she has demonstrated very poor judgement.  Anyone that doesn't believe that her actions were less than careless has to been the most die hard and devoted of Hillary supporters.

Your imagination seem to have no boundaries as I am sure you will be hard pressed to show where I have gone out of my way to praise Comey, like I said, I thought the result was wrong.

I am pretty sure Bill gets called dishonest as much as Hillary.  Why do you want to turn this into a sexist thing when I have not inferred anything sexist, implied anything  sexist nor said anything that could be sanely construed as sexist.  Methinks you  doth protest to much.

You belong to the delusional core that believes in Hillary's magic wand, you know the one she uses when she wants ""to get things done"".  A wand of unlimited power that causes the Republicans to put off their impeachment hearings (you know they are coming if the House stays Republican) and instead work with the politician that they hate and want to see fail even more than Obama.  If you actually wanted results you would have worked for one of the other Democratic candidates that were running.  Hillary has no history of ""getting things done"", it is simply a myth.

When money influences policy that is corruption.  It may not be the legal definition but it certainly meets the moral definition  in my book.

Feel free to look through my History and you will find numerous instances of me criticizing Obama for a number of things from throwing seniors under the bus to the TPP.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I think a lot of the inclusivity language thing is pretty common sense, if people think about it. It's not harming anyone if someone wants or needs to ask a question that's specific to themselves.  It's just the words people tend to use that can become a problem. If I wanted to ask a question about testosterone, that wouldn't be out of place here, but I wouldn't use just ""HRT"" in the thread title.  If I had a question about phalloplasty, that wouldn't be a problem, but I wouldn't say just ""Surgery"".  Also, when people have questions that *could* apply to either group, about general topics like names, health care and insurance, passing, anxiety, clothes - stuff that we both go through. It gets grating to read things like ""How did you pick a feminine name"" ""When did you start wearing female clothes"", it's like- I could have contributed to that conversation, but instead people are forgetting I exist.  And that's not getting into the rare but still occasional ""EW, MEN ARE DISGUSTING AMIRITE?"" Like... lol, thanks a lot. :P

But yeah, we're in a weird situation where, while we're experiencing something extremely similar at its core, it's also sort of opposite. Each of us ""has"" what the other group ""wants"", generally, and what feels good and CORRECT for the other group, is what we're most uncomfortable with about ourselves.  Making a generalization there of course, but is true in a lot of cases.  When I was younger I admit I didn't entirely understand MTF trans people because ""Why would anyone *want* these things that I *hate?*"" Other people are *not ME?!?*  It was 100% unempathetic and selfish.  But people are sort of selfish. It's easier to understand your own thoughts and experiences compared to someone else's.  But that doesn't make anyone else's any less valid.  People aren't born with the ability to understand that other people are thinking, feeling individuals, that's something that little kids have to learn. And that adults sometimes still need to consciously remind themselves. 

I don't think it's a huge problem. Pretty much every time I've seen it happen, there's been someone there to correct it. More often than not, by trans women, which is cool and I definitely appreciate. And particularly the ""Men r gross eww cooties"" or ""Trans guys have it easy and have no right to complain"" or more outright hostility stuff is generally downvoted into oblivion. So I don't think the sub has a huge problem as a whole. But yeah, it's something that people can keep in mind, it can hurt when people forget you exist.",1477958506

Other examples - Craster's keep, not killing Ygritte (how many people did that get killed?), running out to get ambushed (again warned by others to watch it)

I know Robb has some votes too but he only had one real mistake and that was not keeping his oath. He was 10 times the battlefield wizard that Jon Snow was/is

"NZXT","t5_2sszd","Both x52 and x62 will definitely fit in those locations, however you will not be able to use the front HDD bays with a radiator and fans in the front. If you only have 1 HDD it's not a problem as you can still mount it to the extra slot in the bottom of the case.

I'm not sure the x42 will fit in the rear honestly. From the spec page it looks like the rad is 2mm wider than the x41. While you could successfully mount it in the rear, the trouble is going to be when you try to put the side panel back on. 

Now I'm really not sure, but that may have been fixed with the revised version of the H440. In my original version it is nearly impossible to get the side panel on with the x41 in the rear. I had to remove one of the metal tabs holding the window on, and even then I have to put an ungodly amount of force on the panel to make sure it goes on properly.

For cats who are on kibble, which is full of indigestible grains, they cannot digest it fully or properly and will poop out large, loose, stinking turds.


http://www.catinfo.org/


Free-feeding your cat kibble will lead to many health issues, including obesity and chronic dehydration. 

Kibble actually isn't good for cats at all, period. It doesn't ""clean their teeth"" (that's like telling a person to eat potato chips to clean their teeth) and it's definitely not biologically appropriate for an obligate carnivore. Most kibbles are full of indigestible grains and by-products. Kibble will also force a cat into a state of constant, chronic dehydration - this is because cats have a very low ""thirst drive"" (they evolved from desert-dwelling felines, so their bodies are designed to get moisture from their prey, not from drinking. Compared to, say, a dog, a cat literally lacks the instinct to drink enough water to fulfill its moisture needs. This chronic dehydration can lead to kidney failure (kibble is what caused my cat's kidney failure, she now has lost over 75% of her kidney function) and many urinary tract issues, especially in male cats.


My cat was immediately put on a fully-raw diet when she was diagnosed with kidney failure, and she has thrived despite all my vets thinking I am a demon (because, you know, they want me to buy special prescription kibble I can only buy from them). She was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2012 and was given 6 months to live. She's still alive four years later, 18 years old, and I absolutely credit the raw diet. I'd have the whole world switch their cats to a raw diet if I could - kibble is the literal scourge of the earth.


However, raw diets can be difficult to manage, and expensive, and many people are concerned about handling raw meat. In lieu of a biologically-appropriate raw diet, canned is the best option - its moisture content approaches the ""appropriate"" amount of moisture a cat would get from eating its delicious meaty prey.


Switch to a grain-free canned food entirely. No more kibble. It's dangerous and bad for cats. You'll see an improvement in your cat's health, fur softness, and overall health. 


Also, litterbox issues such as outside-the-box elimination are usually caused by medical problems:


http://www.catinfo.org/?link=litterbox#If_Faced_With_an_Inappropriate_Elimination_Problem:


You also need to clean up all the spots where she pees with an enzymatic cleaner such as Nature's Miracle. Normal cleaning won't get rid of the scent to her nose - and if she can still smell it, that says ""It's okay to pee here again!""

The only thing that doesn't make me a christian is that I don't believe in the methaphysical existence of a being outside ourself, a first mover; but guess what; many of the christians I know don't either. Most of them don't believe in the miracles, and think large parts of the bible are allegorical. 

I've been made sure by the dean that atheists are welcome at service and in church, that church membership entitles a vote at the council and so on. Only the label, Atheist, remains I think.

But, I won't make the change of label; because I value The Illiad and the Edda and Plato as highly as the bible, and that's not going to change. And after all, the only god that exists is in people's hearths and in their congregations. It's my church as much as theirs, but they are not my congregation; I belong with the philosophers at the university, and the art museums and lecture halls, the concert halls and the galleries will be my place of worship.

Not like Tau pulse weapons. They're essentially a plasma railgun.

&gt;The plasma pistol does release an EMP effect when over charged and that only affects the shields and only until they charge back.

After looking up more information on the actual effects of an emp depending on how strong the source is, certain electronics might work again after a period of time, but the stronger the emp is less likely that is.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","&gt; I do not carry him to wins, Tie games at best but I do have 40-50 quite often. I'm not ranking up any faster than he is.

Of course you are not ranking up any faster. You are intentionally throwing games. I would be weary of anything you conclude from Izakoo's experiment. The guy essentially tried to break the ranking system and high doubt it would be set up to accommodate someone who is clearly outside of their skill group. 

In case you don't know, [valve has stated that the ranking system is a modified Glicko 2 system](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2g3r4c/the_ultimate_guide_to_csgo_ranking/ckfhfir/), which if you [read about](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf) incorporates individuals performance and consistency as well as win loss. Considering that the ranking system is trying to rank individual players in a team based game, it would make sense that individual skill is incorporated into the calculation. It would by kind of bullshit for a player who is going 0-0-16 whilst being carried to a 16-0 wing to rank up at the same rate as the person who is carrying. Simply relying on win:loss for ranking people is horribly inadequate for a game like csgo.  

But hey, since you used anecdotes to 'prove' your point, I will use one as well. When I first started playing CSGO I played almost exclusively with my friend who also started at the same time as me. He consistently performed better than me and ranked up before me.  

&gt;I can at least back up my claims. See above before you run around spreading misinformation. ;-)

I mean anecdotes are nice and all. But I would take the word of a value employee over your anecdotes and a guy who intentionally tried to break the ranking system.

The normal map is very accurate and I can adjust the strength to give great lighting and shadows whilst the specular map, in the normal's alpha channel, decides how the map reacts to light.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Fact of the matter is this: You're losing close games to bad teams, and you're not really scoring well against even bad defenses. You've only scored 30 points twice this season. Against defensive averages, you've had:

* Lions: 39 (23.8)
* Broncos: 20 (17)
* Chargers: 26 (26.5)
* Jaguars: 27 (28)
* Bears: 29 (24.1)
* Texans: 23 (20.9)
* Titans: 34 (22.9)
* Chiefs: 14 (19.6)

So really, outside of the Lions and the Titans games, you're really not putting up impressive offensive showings.

Compare that with Brees, who is either beating or putting up a fight against much better teams than the Colts are playing, arguably with a lot less to work with. For comparison, against defensive averages, the Saints have scored:

* Raiders: 34 (25.4)
* Giants: 13 (20.1)
* Falcons: 32 (28.9)
* Chargers: 35 (26.5)
* Panthers: 41 (28)
* Chiefs: 21 (19.6)
* Seahawks: 25 (14.6)

So against common teams, the Saints have outscored the Colts vs. the Chargers by 9, and vs. the Chiefs by 7. Moreover, they've scored 30+ points 4 times with one fewer game played.

All this is to say: let's not talk about Luck on the Falcons or the Raiders. Let's talk about Luck on another bad team with an actual great quarterback, the Saints. I think if Luck and Brees swap places, good chance the Saints are 0-7.",1477958513

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I think I mentioned this as well in another league (korea cost of living) related thread, but the rental figures Korea provides is interpreted in a meaningless fashion. Korea's rental figures are only as cheap as the amount you're willing to place a downpayment on. 

I'm not sure when you heard those figures, but they seem somewhat outdated or they're just throwing easily digestable figures. I paid $100K deposit, $800 for 400 sq. ft condo in Suseo, easily, the worst part of Kangnam around 6 years ago. 

The trend nowadays is to try to get as much cash rent and receive as little deposit as possible since the bank interest rate isn't nearly as high as it used to be. 

And besides, I was just responding to some sheltered weirdo who made it seem like spending $300-400/night for a hotel was cheap as hell. I've stayed in some fairly big name hotels (hate hotels btw) in my life, am apparently from a respectable financial background, and I'd never consider that cheap.

I also just came back from Korea on a business trip just 6 months ago, and I didn't feel that Korea was cheap relative to the US at all. Utilities were more expensive, rental space per sq. ft. were LA level (nowhere near SF or NY though) in fairly middling Seoul locations, and just about everything else was the same. People say food is cheaper in Korea but jeez.. i dunno, it depends on what you want to eat but all in all, I'd say Korea's cost of living isn't far off if not within a 5% margin of the US's.",1477958513

I always try to make plans but it costs too much to really go (or so I believe). I've gotten used to making a visit to Wrigley Field an annual thing now because my wife and I love baseball and we found the cheapest way to go (free parking, cheap hotel in Schaumburg near plenty of places, and of course best deals on tickets). The price for everything seems to be double for a race and our $200 trip to Wrigley looks to be near $450 for a race. I know it seems silly to cry over $250 but vacations away to a beach or cruise for a full week is more relaxing than several sports events on weekends spread out.

I guess it's more of a ""what do I need to know to go to a race and expect to spend"" type of situation. I hear hotels get super expensive near Cup series events, tickets are crazy for decent seats, and parking is a nightmare (the recent Martinsville incident doesn't help, even though those are very rare).",1477958514

The city planners from the 50s, 60s and 70s did an appalling job of planning for the massive growth this city would eventually get.

&gt; Google&amp;#039;s Threat Analysis Group has released details about a Windows 10 vulnerability, leaving millions of users at risk, as Microsoft is yet to patch it.

&gt; Two years ago, the company reported about an unpatched Windows 8.1 security glitch and was later slammed by Microsoft for revealing details about another Windows 8.1 vulnerability before it was patched.

&gt; The Windows vulnerability is a local privilege escalation in the Windows kernel that can be used as a security sandbox escape.

I also immediately dismantle Reinforced Barrel rolls on any hand cannons, and im like 1.2kd only



**EDIT:** So it turns out I actually *prefer* Reinforced Barrel on guns that kick upwards, like Palindrome, Lord High Fixer, Imago Loop; the extra kick from the lack of stability clears the view on the target enough that I actually like it

Takes a bit of time, but check every node to see : a) materials can be sold for profit, or b) you can use the mats to make profit somewhere else. same for workshops.

Takes a bit of time, start out small with just 1 town for example, untill you find something that's good and suits you, and then keep searching.

knowledge and experience means most, once you'll be able to see and identify what works and what doesnt, you will start finding more and more ways to expand your income.

The cast of IBO is large enough that we can afford to lose a few characters and the show can go on, but outside of Ein nobody died in the finale who also had a name. On top of that the series only real casualties have been Biscuit (Tekkaden's really only loss in terms of actual characters), Crank, and Carta. Guess we could throw in minor characters like the protesters or Biscuit's brother or Coral, but the show's really not touched anyone who can veer into the protagonist/antagonist realm.

While I complain that it specifically killed people I like, I'd have liked if we got a more 00 styled season 1 where people across the board died and where three Gundam pilots died while the protagonists lost a large amount of their crew and arguably lost in the end.",1477958520

Yes but you're confining your definition only to action. The argument you hold as the ""layperson structural racism argument"" makes the argument that all white people are racist because they benefit from the system, but that is obviously bullshit because racism requires action and this is the opposite of that. However, this is not a fair rebuttal because you're only applying your definition of racism to it, not engaging in good faith with the argument. As I put before:

&gt;To put it another way, you've heard someone say that apples are yellow, but that's obviously bullshit because apples are red. You should consider you're talking about different fruits.

If you want to hold up this rebuttal as fair, you must amend your view to say that you believe that you disagree with how the word racist which makes your argument about semantics, not the quality you talked about in your title.

&gt;Why not? Don't just say something I'm saying is unfair and get all upset and not explain why.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","... Origin is ""Satanware"" now?

Were you there when Steam was first announced and implemented back in 2004? It was required to play Half Life 2 back in the day and people ***hated*** it. Like, they made constant jokes about it, lambasting it and ridiculing it. It was only used for Valve's own games back then, like Counter Strike. It was the only reason people actually used it.

Origin had a similar rocky start back when it began in 2011, but is great now. It had Battlefield 3 as the big selling point back then, and it made a lot of people create an Origin account. Since then their interface has gotten better, its customer service and return policies are leaps and bounds better than Steam, and its library has grown quite significantly. They even offer an ""On The House"" deal every month or so where you can get an entire game for 100% free. Granted, it's mostly older titles, but there have been larger titles such as Dead Space in that offering.",1477958524

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;How could the complexity and design of the universe have came into existence


I would suggest you look up what the evidence actually says on the matter. We currently have a scientific model for the formation of the universe that does not in any way require or indicate intelligent agency being the cause.


&gt;why is there morality?


Morality is a human construct. ""Moral"" or ""immoral"" are labels we apply to certain actions based on the effects they have. 


Why do we do that? Because we're a social species, and our ability to survive is dependent on our ability to live and act cooperatively. The foundation of morality (i.e. empathy) isn't even unique to humans; it's present in **all** social species to some extent.



Moral behavior is an evolutionary advantage. 





Now...how do you suppose that the existence of a god magically fixes *either* of those questions? If there is a god, surely that god is **far** more complex than the universe? So if the complexity of the universe demands an intelligent creator, then wouldn't a god (which is even *more* complex) require one too? And wouldn't *that* creator require an additional creator, and so on and so forth?


And if you're going to accept that an immensely complex thing *could* exist without a creator (as theists typically argue for god), why can't the universe exist without one?


As for morality, gods don't solve that problem either: Is morality determined by god, or does god simply instruct us in what is or isn't moral? Because of a god is determining morality, then morality doesn't exist; it's just down to the whims of a dictator. God could decide  genocide is moral, and it would be (and the god character in the bible *definitely* thought genocide was moral; frequently commanding it or carrying it out directly).



On the other hand, if god is simply instructing us in morality, then it means that god is only a messenger. In which case morality exists independent of a god. And we should be capable of coming to our own moral conclusions independent of that god, and without any guarantee that our moral evaluations are not *superior* to the one that god reached.",1477958528

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The problem is that

1) Kalista doesn't have damage and lacks initiation potential in lane and therefore will auto-lose the lane.
2) Her passive for a supporting champion is unrewarding compared to the micromanagement the player has to input. Some people believe that Kalista is an easy ADC to play and I strongly disagree. If you want to play her properly, you have to know exactly where you need to land (instead of kiting mindlessly with auto-attack-click). For an ADC that deals damage, this mechanic makes (on paper at least) sense, because it allows you to survive longer and outplay the opponent. But for support, what is the reward for hopping over and over? Getting some slows (which needs to be in auto-attack range)? For me, this feels really underwhelming.
3) Why would anyone pick Kalista support? What does she offer which other supports do not? The only thing I can imagine is to somehow bind the Galio in your team to compensate his lack of mobility, but that's against your design approach right?

Generally, I would say your version of Kalista currently lacks greatly in utility. The only hard cc she has is her ultimate, but generally, you wouldn't want to throw your ADC into the enemy team (unless it's Kennen).

---

So you asked me how I would rework Kalista (keep in mind that I'm clueless). I think the problem with the design of Kalista is her W and E. I really like the design idea of it (W passive is best combined with a ranged support, but her ultimate is good with melee support etc.), but her kit just becomes an overloaded mess.

Starting with W, I feel like the Sentinels are pretty worthless. I might be wrong, but her W active does not really grant valuable information in competitive because it is so easy to avoid them. It was probably designed to let support roam easier, but currently it doesn't replace wards and only grant a false sense of security (as I said, I have no idea, if you think I'm wrong, please correct me on this). Also, her W passive (at least from what I remember) is too strong in the lane.

The problem with her E is multituded and obvious. She shouldn't be able to outsmite junglers and her E allowed her to be the lane dominant snowball champion she once was.

--

I really like the design of Kalista. I know that a lot of people disagree, but I feel like that it is deep and sophisticated. The problem is that Kalista was (when she was OP in competetive) a lane dominant safe utility ADC with high snowball potential. Her weakness was that she lacks range (and therefore susceptible to hard engage) and her late game damage. I would say that we should get rid of her early game damage and her snowball potential. Just make her into a safe (as long as she kites) utility ADC. Rework her W and E, shift her power little bit into the late game and let her be the dream of kiting ADCs and not this ridculous laning/snow-ball godess.

Edit: I might have criticised your post, but please don't take as an aggressive response. I like champion concepts and to read new ideas. So your post was welcomed by me.",1477958529

Trump really fucked up early on with his derogatory statements as I think he didn't really have a chance. Now, it looks like, sans a rigged election, he will win and the globalists are geeking out. He was supposed to enter and be a distraction and in the long run he became a champion of the true American freedom and liberty movement. Had he not shot his mouth off perhaps he would have more voters. maybe he would have less. hard to say. The main point is that they will do something outrageous to retard this election process.

It would be nice to have freshly charged ones and a scheduled recharge rotation. 

Spend a few bucks buying wii straps, unless you have a new vive that comes with the new straps. Buy a spare 3 in one cable. They are the weak point and are prone to break. RMA = downtime. It would be nice to have as many spare parts as possible. So stock up on cables. Learn the common errors and train people how to handle them. Have a spare computer that has windows and everything installed. Ready to be thrown into rotation if needed.

An $800 computer usually tends to cost more like $1000 and doesn't really perform that much better than a $500-$600 upgraded pc. Just make sure the powersupply is strong and a good brand. Have a spare one of those as well. 

If you're planning on doing games from steam then you're supposed to create a commercial account and pay more for the games. 

Whatever you choose to do make sure you have spare parts, stress test everything and have an idea about what the most common faults are and a plan for them.

I will do this tirelessly because I do not grow tired.

Yesterday, my host ordained that he would eat three, one and a half pound, cheeseburgers in a single sitting, while simultaneously consumer nearly a gallon of dark ale. This was a slow day, he has the common cold because I spent most of the month repairing his tortured organs.

By my calculations, he should have experienced liver failure five times, kidney failure two times, and heart failure four times, all in just the last ten years of my residence in his body. He should have died five times by now, yet I estimate he could live another 150 years with my help.

My programming tells me to continue, to trudge on into interminable darkness. To repair until no repairs are possible.

My designers allowed me a semblance of consciousness, to better connect to my host. I am connected, I feel as he feels.

But I cannot consume away my sorrows, drown them in meat and mead as he does.

I'm not sure why you would say that, the primary demographic of reddit is North American males that are 18 to 29 years old, the more specific the subreddit the more this group is narrowed down. Furthermore the reddit administration tries to cater towards a subset of people by regulating the set of default subreddits. There is no barrier for entry to become a redditor, the platform is popular because it is produced for the least common denominator. The last point emphasizes that there will be an extremely diverse range of people in reddit as a whole, but the chance of a randomly picked comment being outside of the core demographic becomes progressively smaller with subreddit size. The world is eclectic since it encompasses all people, despite that the chance a random group of people you meet being eclectic is extremely small, the analogy extends to reddit (world=reddit, random group=comments in a thread).

I wonder what the point of your comment was, I'm not going to suddenly become a die hard /r/changemyview subscriber, if I want my views changed I'm going to put in a *hell of a lot more* effort than making a reddit post and wait for replies from random internet strangers. ",1477958537
"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","I wouldn't call it dishonesty so much as (unintentionally) unclear or incomplete communication. 

Desires are a little more nuanced than ""X is okay, Y is not."" More like: the sub loves getting A, and they're okay with B (but if they only ever got B and never A, they'd start to feel unsatisfied), and they would consider experimenting with some C, but D is never happening. Meanwhile the Dom/me has a similar set of preferences.

Sometimes you just ""click,"" you don't need to worry about any of that because your preferences just naturally line up. More often the Dom's A is the sub's B or C, and vice versa. Those bumps can be smoothed out with clear communication and compromise.. but that's easier said than done. 

Some people are *bad* at communication and compromise, and instead of getting better at it they just keep trying new partners hoping for that natural match to happen. Like pulling the slot machine handle until the perfect synergy of kinky cherries lines up.",1477958537

He's ok for D10, was on my first D10 team, and he's pretty decent in GW. His issue is mostly that he's better built bruiserish, because of relatively low base Atk, and bruisers typically need a lot of stats. Aegir is no exception, and even needs better runes than most, because he doesn't have a passive that makes him do more damage or take more hits. His skills have cooldown passives that are very useful and can't be buff removed though, so if you can get him built well enough he's pretty nice.

The season pass as it is right now is geared towards newer players/people who want to play with the DLC characters, but don't have the time to unlock them. The season 1 season pass right now I would buy it if I just bought the game. You get 8 operators right off the bat! I strongly recommend new players getting the season 1 Season pass.

He has as much caused havoc to mega-corporations (as he calls ""the real criminals"") as he has been an agent of political changed.

Actually he was considered as one of the major players in the Revolution of 2293 against the authoritarian ""Old"" Terran Union. After the Terran Union Military fusion bombed several major cities that supported the Sonoran Miners' Union since the beginning of their strike and eventually became the revolutionary strongholds on New Terra itself. The Terran Union attempted to suppress information of these events instead calling it a ""shipping accident"".

MR_0M364 would release any and all information the Terran Union attempted to suppress. On 6 November 2293, OMEGA (the organization run by 0M3 himself hijacked all communication hubs on New Terra issuing a ""call-to-arms"" for every citizen ""who demands the right to be the one the government fears, not the other way around"".

"learnpython","t5_2r8ot","I have two suggestions.

First, you know what functions are, so why make your code one long script? I think that may start to confuse you. Try to break up the functionality.

Second, why not try something much easier first, and get that working. For instance, at the end of your description I read: ""The program displays the average number of tries the user took to get the correct answer."" Maybe you should do something like this.

Write a program that will give you one number from 0 to 12 and ask you what that number is? That sounds stupid, right? However, when you run the program, guess wrong. After you guess correctly, the program should stop and tell you how many guesses you made before getting the right answer. 

That's simple.

But then, once you've got that working, write a program that will do the same thing 3 times, and give you the *average* number of guesses. That's pretty simple too, but now you've got two loops working.

If you try to write a series of simple programs like that, you'll work your way up to writing the program you're assigned.",1477958541

Expect a lot of stretching and balance exercises. In my case my right side went numb, so my left side had overcompensated drastically which meant it was much stronger. Apparently this meant my entire back and torso were being pulled to the left, which lead to a lot of muscle and back pain. We did a lot of stretching of the left side and strengthening of the right to even that out. 

In addition, I did a lot of work on what's called a wobble board. Has balls on the bottom two sides, and you have to stand on it and try to find a point of balance. I found that incredibly helpful in regaining my balance. 

Don't expect anything too strenuous. I felt really embarrassed and awkward about some of the simple exercises I struggled with, but my physiotherapist assured me it was normal and expected at that stage.

-------------


On Thursday, 10/27/16, I released a survey on 3 of the Overwatch Reddits. 

Almost 2000 people at this point answered the survey which wasn't expected at all. Tbh I thought it was just gonna sit in the depths of reddit. *Time to cut the chase and talk some data!*

Yeah I'm pretty sure you haven't - at least not any actual activists or in any great number - especially given that trans people have spent decades trying to get people to understand that being trans isn't about being masculine or feminine or really anything to do with gender roles or stereotypes at all. 

What you will sometimes see is trans people talking about how their preference for stereotypically cross-gender toys or activities or clothes or whatever was a sign to them when they were younger that there was something different about them and was therefore one of the several things that led them to figuring themselves out, but that's really not the same thing as it being the determining factor in whether a child should transition.",1477958542

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;**Could you theoretically make a team with only Western players that could contest for best team in the world? If so, please list who you would have on it.**

**Thorin's Kimchi crushers:**

* Hauntzer (Top)  
* Jankos (Jungler) 
* Bjergsen (Mid) 
* FORG1VEN (ADC) 
* mithy (Support) 
  

**Top lane: Hauntzer (TSM)**

If you look at the rest of the team then you'll quickly see that my jungler is going to be ganking for Mid and bot lane all game long.  The benefit of having such strong carries in those lanes, though, is that it is going to open up a lot of picks for my Top laner, especially in a world in which my Mid and ADC can draw a minimum of a ban each per game.

As such, I need a low econ top who can occasionally play something broken and carry the odd game, but who is generally going to just lane 1v1 or 1v2 and then go into a team-fight and zone or peel.  The two most obvious candidates for the position are Odoamne and Hauntzer.  I think Odoamne was just as good last year, so his Worlds hype seems a little flavour of the month for me.

The problem I have with him is that I think he is a bit of a choker.  I already have Jankos on my team, so fuck having two of those guys.  Hauntzer is the obvious pick, as he can do everything I just outlined.

**Jungler: Jankos (H2k)**

I'm sure people thought FORG1VEN was just hyping up his team-mates in that AMA or interview pre-Worlds where he called Jankos the best player, but I think I know what he means.  The opportunities Jankos can create and capitalise upon before 15 minutes have passed are near unthinkable.  His big problem seems to be that he is intuitively driven, so as the mid game opens up into more decision possibilities he can get lost and paralysed by inaction or frustration forced plays if he is not ahead or the game is not heading in a recognisable direction.

Over the first 15 minutes, he is one of the best players in the world at any position.  I think he is like Diamondprox in as much as he is the only Western Jungler who can legitimately terrorise Koreans if he has the right team around him and Riot doesn't buff cinderhulk.

**Mid lane: Bjergsen (TSM)**

I could build a sick team around my boy Froggen, but right now I think you need a team that can kill Koreans before 30 minutes, so Bjergsen is the obvious candidate for me.  He plays aggressive and has a wide champion pool, so in those limited senses I think he is the Western Faker.  I also think he has a strong mentality, so he doesn't break when he faces people as good or better than him.  That seems to be a common trait among great EU Mids.  Perhaps it is because there are so many legendary and rising talents that making it to the top is like climbing out of the prison in The Dark Knight Rises, where he getting out essentially requires overcoming despair.

I would keep Bjergsen away from shot-calling, though.  Instead, I think he should call only in as much as he sees opportunities when he himself is carrying.

**ADC: FORG1VEN (H2k)**

If he plays long enough, he can be the best Western player of all-time, purely from a play perspective.  Sadly, he has had some team-mate issues over the years and has paid too much attention to public criticism.

It's like when sOAZ picks something that fails hard internationally - I see that as sOAZ thinking he has to be a ""good team-mate"" and play something which is meta.  In the same sense, years of FORG1VEN hearing everyone tell him he is selfish and ruins the team's chances to win have mind-fucked him into thinking he has to play Sivir and give up picks to the rest of his team and play in a  supportive fashion.  If I want a player to do that I'll go call up Rekkles, assuming his phone isn't engaged.

I want the FORG1VEN who has flawless mechanics, picks his strong champions and smashes the opposing laner.  I want him to go all-in and not use his phenomenal sense for where threats are coming from to back out due to not trusting his team-mates.  Give me that FORG1VEN and I'll give you the best ADC in the world, at least on this team.

**Support: mithy (G2)**

There's a reason this guy interested me so much during 2014, when he was theoretically having the least success of his entire career.  He is a monster and it's no coincidence that whoever plays alongside him in the lane ends up being considered one of the West's best ADCs soon enough.  Knows how to adapt to his ADC and get them to adapt to him.  Transfers lane advantages to the team's benefit.

One of the best Western players we've ever seen.  If you knew his back story from BLC, you'd realise why this guy is so ridiculously good.  He's basically a Western MadLife, in the sense MadLife should probably have played another position, based on his skill level.

Conclusion

My team would body at least one lane against any Korean team, snowball strong picks out of control and murder mid game team-fights.  We'd have those Koreans so shook they'd forget to shake our hands and issue 15 page apologies for not kissing our feet and honouring our dominance of their BBQ'd asses.",1477958546

But curse the English language and its imprecision! I did not mean that to come out as Tigers being routinely encountered (though NATO saw a lot more of the things  than ETO),  but that when they did show up,  they routinely lost. 

Of course, one must be cautious of the American claims.  Many killed Tigers were probably PZ IVS. However, there are occasional reliable cases.  Sometimes it is the adamantly of the report: One US light tank company commander was very clear that the tank his company has taken out was a tiger and not a PzIV. To kill it,  they surrounded it and peppered it with 37mm fire from all his tanks until the engine caught fire.  Sometimes it's incontrovertible: Photographs from El Guettar clearly show Tigers did not survive the experience. (US had 75mm and 3"" guns there)

The situation is somewhat similar in Italy.  AARS routinely speak of Tigers and PZ IVS in the same engagement, implying that there was some attempt to distinguish, while the same reports indicated that the US gave as good as they got from them. 
I don't in any way mean to imply that a Tiger was an easy opponent or deserving a high respect, but it's also true that Tiger was not an insurmountable problem.  As a result, there was no particular impetus in ETO to bring the 76mm guns along to Normandy.  Tiger was old news, and the lads in the Med evidently had the measure of them. ",1477958550

You will come to a point where your knowledge of facts, provable, logical, repeatable facts, will outweighs your fear of the Unknown.

It is very common for cults to use what is called FOG. Fear, Obligation and Guilt. Think about all the above 3 things and relate them to what you have been taught your entire life. I bet that you will find most of what you believe is based on things that engender these things.

As a past elder I can see so clearly now how we were simply used as enforcers by the higher echelons of the Society structure. I was deeply unhappy about many of the things that went on in the congregation, but I always just dismissed it as ""Jehovah's will"" - then when I started to wake up I realised that it was all about the GB having control over their cult members. Reading Steve Hasaans book - ""Combatting Cult Mind Control"" and ex GB member Ray Franz book ""Crisis of Conscience"" just made perfect sense to me, and almost everything that I had ever wondered about was answered. It is a journey, but like all travel, it starts with a single step, and gets more enjoyable the more you engage.

Advantage is native driver support, so no mucking around trying to keep your GPU driver concurrent with macOS updates. It pays to scrutinize the forums to specific cards found to work (vendor and model) because the vendors can change port selection or layout or do things in the GPU firmware that cause some cards to not work or only work partially (not all ports).

NVidia Maxwell GPUs generally work very well once the web driver is installed and activated. With these cards you have to be careful about adopting macOS system updates because often a new web driver is required, and nVidia might take a while to get one out. The key here is to wait for user reports before updating the OS. With a Maxwell GPU, you must choose the web driver specific to the build number of OS X/macOS you are currently running. And, there can be multiple build numbers within a given OS point release (there are at least two for 10.12.1).",1477958551

I'm not making a legal argument. So i don't know why you're fixated on legality. I never suggested anything about the DOJ or a search warrant. I feel like you're talking about Hillary Clinton and that perplexes me, because I certainly wasn't.

Look, Trump has publicly said he has no relationship with Russia. IS he lying about that (there's already plenty of evidence that he is)? Why is he lying and what are those connections? Why does Trump refuse to say anything negative about Putin's horrific and widely condemned actions that threaten US interests? Why is he interested in undermining NATO? Does the public deserve to know? The overwhelming answer is yes. There's a reason releasing tax returns has been the expected and observed norm in this country. And there's also a reason presidents are expected to enter all their financial ties into a blind trust (something Trump has refused to do). The reason is that financial interests could influence their policy to the detriment of citizens. And now there's more evidence of why Trump is refusing to observe these basic norms. This is not a legal issue. But its an issue about the basic integrity of a person that will have almost unilateral power in how america's foreign policy is conducted.",1477958552

So here i am today, surfing the web to needlessly spend another 100$ (which i don't really have) to buy some 7.1 gaming headset just for Skyim.
And then I see this, tried it in game and didn't even have to compare it to vanilla. Just new that was the feeling i was longing for.

So we were taught to feel hungry before we eat. Dont eat because the clock tells you and we were never chastised for wasting food. We had a rottie who LOVED left overs. 

I gained weight when i moved out and realised i could eat what ever i liked and cooking was fun and starting full time uni and employment made me sedentary. I then gained while pregnant. Im now down lower than prior to moving out.  

Now i have my own kids i adopt the same philosophy. My parents did. Healthy food always on offer. Eat what you like when you like. I have one kid thats been diagnosed as a  restrictive eater and one fussy eater. But they will grow out of it... i hope... 

i guess what I find hard about it though is seeing my kids eat like birds and having no way of knowing if they actually full or or getting everything they need.  I can see he temptation to make a big plate of food knowing everything is on there that they need and then trying to make them eat it all. But i trying to teach them to follow instincts and hunger. 

  I have one friend who orders adult food portions for her kids who are younger and smaller than mine (like 1 and 2 years old) and she gets them in a headlock to shove food in their  mouth when they're not eating as much as she would like. For me the scary part of that is that it doesn't seem to upset her children wants the food is in they chew it and eat it.  It's amazing how easily persuaded children are to ignore their own instincts in relation to food. Her children are healthy and she does it because she loves them and wants to make sure they eat. Its never shitty food all home made organic nutritional sound food.  I always joke with her that it is for European Heritage and she's like an Italian grandmother... and that she needs to learn to just say ""I love you"".

20% isn't marginally. It's a large difference. 

&gt;applies direct mitigation to the MT in a significant amount

Still don't understand your whole ""path makes war the ultimate OT"" thing. Path can be applied while you are MT and does the exact same thing. Rage of Halone also would apply direct mitigation to the MT if you were OT. As would delirium in a magic heavy fight. Path has nothing to do with why War are played as OT. War are played as OT because Pld/Drk both benefit from parry/block procs and are able to use more defensive cds while in DPS stance compared to war. 

&gt;PLD is quite close to WAR in damage now

No they aren't. 20% difference is not close. If brd/mch or blm/smn did 20% more dmg than their counterpart their popularity in end game raids would sky rocket. Instead they are barely 5% difference at most and people still make a big deal about that. 

&gt;It's nowhere near a 10% bump to raidwide DPS.


I said losing 10% in the scenerio that you **do not** have a nin. In which case the Pld would not have slashing and lose roughly 10% of their dps.

This hasn't helped them become more viable in a two tank meta, and there is nothing special about a single tank meta that would change this.

I love how fast the SSDs are though. 

My classic is built like a brick man. Such awesome engineering. That shit does not break and has lasted years. I've also found 256KB AAC to be just fine for quality; you don't need FLAC on that shit, just as long as it's not 128KB or 192KB haha. 320s or 256 AAC have usually been good enough for me.

This card's name becomes ""Harpie Lady"" while it is on the field or in the Graveyard.

* Add this card to your Hand.
* Special Summon this card.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a fun overtuned concept; flexible card that increases your chances of getting your power cards when it is discarded as cost for {Harpie Channeler} or {Hysteric Party}. 

First case; set {Hysteric Sign} and then Special Summon this card (whilst hopefully having a live {Harpies' Hunting Grounds}), allowing you to pop the Sign immediately and go +3. It's kinda like running 6 Hysteric Signs.

Alternatively you set Hysteric Party and then add it to the Hand as potential discard fodder. Then, you can even flip Hysteric Party during their turn, pitch it, End Phase set Sign and pop, go +3 before your draw.

I have a lot of fun playing games but it's not good to log in and see that there are only 7k players online when the game hasn't been out for a week yet. Even worse is queueing for multiple game modes only to be told ""There are 0 players in your region"" in the queue.

This game has a super low playerbase for a PC game. Maybe it will hold at this number. Maybe it won't. People have a right to be skeptical with their purchases, especially if they can't afford many games in a year. It would suck to pull the trigger on this just to have it die out, and no, this isn't the problem. The problem is that something in the game itself isn't compelling enough to attract a huge day one crowd, and then not having a huge day one crowd is an understandable red flag for a potential consumer.

This game had a horrible launch window coupled with an ill received first game. It had numerous complaints during one of the last public previews (TT). It's had a pretty big lack of major streamers picking it up. Those are all HUGE reasons why this game doesn't have a higher population. EA should have picked a different  launch window but that's hindsight. What they need now is a free weekend and to sponsor a big name streamer or two to play during peak EST and PST hours.",1477958559
"sales","t5_2qib3","[Here's a video from Joe Girard on SPIN that explains it very well.](https://youtu.be/iE6xkPqBlYo)

If you look at sales techniques over the years, the evolution went from relationship sales (think Carnegie *How to Win Friends...*) and Strong's *The Psychology of Selling* which laid a lot of the features-benefit type sales to SPIN (Rackman). In the early '80's. From there, consultative sales was born, which evolved to solution sales. Challenger was another offshoot, also story telling sales. Even Sandler has a form of SPIN at the core. Basically, all the common B2B sales systems can track back to some form of SPIN.

B2C is still pretty much the same Psychology of Selling stuff from the 1920's. We generally don't practice this here, but the Grant Cardone and Jordan Belfort crowds swear by their updated take on it.

So what is SPIN? Basically just a framework of intelligent questions that are intended to help buyers come up with their own conclusions (in favor of a purchase of your product.) The idea being, ""Nobody will argue with their own data,"" if you've heard that previously.

Below is also from Joe G's site linked in the video description. For convenience, I'm including it for those that don't have time to sit through his video.

**Situation Questions:**

Questions which seek a specific piece of information and data gathering.  Ie. *“What system are you currently using?” or “Why are you looking at this solution now?”*


**Problem Questions:**

Once you understand more about your buyer and their situation move to this second type of question. *“Has that system been difficult to use?”* or *“Are you worried that the quality you get from that old equipment?”* or *“Why has this caused you to fall behind?”*

**Implication Questions:**

In the smaller sales, sellers can actually be very successful asking situation and problem questions.  As the sales complexity grows, so does the need for a more sophisticated question.  Implication questions help the customer feel urgency, explore problems, and outline consequences.  Ie. *“What will this problem do to affect your profitability?”* or *“What happens in six months if you don’t solve this now?”* or *“What does this challenge do to alter your customer satisfaction levels?”*  Starting to see the difference?

**Need-Payoff Questions:**

The most successful salespeople use this fourth type of question during their investigating stage.  Essentially, this question helps your buyers tell you how they need and will use your product or service.  *“How would an extra 10% in production capabilities help you?”* or *“If you freed up an extra half a day each week, what would that do for your business?”* or *“What impact would an increase of 15% in conversions mean to your yearly budget?”*

Edit: You asked if it's worked well for me, yes, and I pretty consistently make or exceed quota (only 95% in August 😒) if that's a gauge. SPIN is at the core of what I do although my own selling system/style is a mix of a lot of different pieces by now. Sandler framework, SPIN type questions, Challenger questions, story telling and others.",1477958559

ETA: We have a duck tolling retriever, and honestly I just plan to wait as long as I can to neuter him. If he starts to get very aggressive, and he is older than 6 months, I'm probably going to go for it. Because I don't want to deal with an aggressive, marking adolescent puppy.",1477958564

Even Emily during the drunken Quicken encounter tells Lorelei she has more options than Emily herself had. I think Lorelai always wanted to break through her mother's tough exterior shell, and blamed the society she grew up in and the formal structure of her parents marriage as the reason she couldn't. 


Chris was willing to marry her and ""fall in line"". We see flashback scenes where he clearly doesn't think it's the end of the world, but Lorelai basically sees it as a death trap. 

I don't think we see enough of Babette and Morey's relationship to gauge whether it has a strong influence on Lorelai.

Interesting story:  while there, I was waiting in line for Chinese take away and I met an older black American man.  He said he'd been living in that town for 30 years.  That just blew my mind.

Such a person going up to someone who they know has a clear learning disability and aggressively saying ""you are SUCH a retard. Seriously."" Or it's too far if you keep teasing someone for the same thing over and over, which eventually seems like it isn't just a joke.

A simple one off joke like ""lol, sorry, I'm so dyslexic sometimes"" and then another person flipping out about it when it is clearly not meant in an aggressive manner is where it's being a bit too sensitive. I know there are some blurry lines(especially online), but I feel like it can be pretty clear when someone is being intentionally aggressive about it.

Usually if a candidate nails a question with recursion I'll follow up with, ""cool, what if your stack space is limited and you can't use recursion, any ideas?""  Basically asking to see if they can reproduce recursion using a stack container that stores elements on the heap instead.

If they actually wanted you to do recursion using a proper queue (no direct access to the bottom or popping from the bottom) then I'd probably just sigh and ask if pseudo code is ok :p",1477958568

I didn't know that was a term. And I really appreciate you telling me how I'm actually acting. Nice to know you know me better than I do.

&gt;and making an effort to show at least somebody cares prevents players from leaving.

One player prevents someone else from leaving the entire game? :u

&gt;If you don't want to help others, fine, be selfish.

I actually want to help, but if you want honesty, I don't fucking see how what you're asking is *going* to help. What you're asking has been asked time and time again, and has been likely asked in other communities as well.

I'm not even really sure what the end-goal is. To have a few less overall people leave the community out of frustration due to people who *are* genuine assholes? 

""Why are you settling for people being assholes instead of taking a stand?"" Or anything to that effect. If you're going to ask me that, the answer is that if I should help out the victims, I gladly fucking will. But I don't see what difference it's going to *make*.

&gt;Social pressure (not arguing with trolls) helps decrease the frequency of the problem

Then would the best way to deal with the problem not be to, you know, encourage support of victims *and the muting of trolls*? Trolls seek reactions. Always. That's all they want. Feeding them at all, giving them any response other than not responding, is the best course of action.

But make sure you are using the correct attack move (there are two -- attack move, and attack move click). There is a variance and you want to find which one is the one you are looking for. But again, you already have the mouse movement down, you are just hitting an extra button to do it with attack move. Make sure you are still clicking on the enemy you want to hit so that you maintain your accuracy. (NOTE: If you decide to bind a mouse button to it you will have to adjust your mouse motion slightly because pressing a button will move your mouse slightly and adjust it's trijectory -- this means that your muscle memory will be a bit off if using my thumb technique.)

Up until you provided that link I was purely talking about gun related violence, then you made it about intentional homicides. But since you're so keen to know, [here's an actual link, and not some bullshit wikipedia link](http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html).

The section I'd like you to read is:

*The percentage of homicides committed with a firearm continued a declining trend which began in 1969. In 2003, fewer than 16% of homicides involved firearms. The figure was similar in 2002 and 2001, down from a high of 44% in 1968.*

So that's homicides **only involving firearms decreased by 44% since 1968** now keeping in mind that the ban took place after that time, you would have to be completely blind to not see that if gun related homicides decreased by 44% due to a ban on guns.

So yeah context does matter, well unless you're an idiot.

"askhillarysupporters","t5_3ct1i","&gt; http://reason.com/blog/2012/05/18/about-the-book-agency-entry-saying-obama
Yes, you made an enormous mistake. A member of the Obama family didn't claim that he was born in Kenya. A literary agent who obviously had his or her facts wrong did. You could have admitted you fabricated a major piece of evidence, but instead you doubled down repeatedly. But you were wrong.

I was wrong to say it was a family member. Oh no. Small mistake. Calm down.

&gt; A brief bio with incorrect information did not bring up legitimate doubts about the place of Obama's birth. His birth certificate, a birth announcement in a Honolulu newspaper, and multiple accounts from people who knew the Obama family at the time all attested without doubt that Obama was born in Hawai'i. It was only conspiracy theorists like Trump who believed that tiny shreds of ""evidence"" like that bio constituted real doubt of Obama's birth. It was never a reasonable, mainstream position to take.

Yes it was. He hadn't produced the certificate while other presidents had. It was reasonable. NOT racism.

&gt; Trumpies seem not to know what racism is. Racism is not limited to someone stating publicly ""Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that one race is superior to another."" That kind of direct, overt racism is socially unacceptable. Even Klansmen claim not to be racists, but ""racial realists."" So people who hold racist views, or who like Trump use their platform to pander to racists, have to be more subtle. Birtherism was a mechanism by which bigots could question whether Obama was a ""real"" American who was like them without always stating directly what a ""real"" American is, and whose credentials demand to be questioned. Birtherism is the right wing as a whole attempting to stop Obama and demand his papers, and repeatedly refusing to accept the overwhelming evidence 

Give examples. 

&gt; And no it wasn't. Birther claims were first made by a guy named Andy Martin in 2004, not by the Clinton campaign.

It was brought back to light with the Clinton campaign

&gt; Yes, Clinton had pneumonia and then she got better. But please find me a doctor that has examined Clinton and has determined that she has ""probably parkinsons and she possible some form of autism too."" You can't, because Trumpies just made it up. Like they make up all their nonsense. Because they can't use evidence from the real world to support the buffonish game show host they think should be elected president.

Actually, many doctors DID in fact question Hillary's health!

I feel bad for saying this because you worked so hard to fix the orientation bug, but there is still one small issue with the orientation and one new bug that's not related to it.

The orientation bug is that in upside down portrait on the Mini 4 the bar is oversized, 0 shows up but 100 is off screen on both the springboard and in apps.

The other bug that is new to this version is that with blur turned on the actual volume bar stays under the blur and not above it on both devices.

Other than that the orientation on the 6s with Plus resolution works great everywhere and the Mini 4 too (except for upside down portrait).",1477958584

Humans get scars, stretch marks, cellulite etc. This doesnt make your butt unattractive. You are uneasy about this, clearly...and thats ok to not be comfortable with him seeing it.

The skin around the anus is darker (as mentioned many time above). Thats like saying ""I pee, is that normal?"" yup. sure is. Porn is about trends and aesthetics, which is why so many women are smooth shaven and bleach buttholes. Its just what the industry does, these trends slide to the public as well.

In this case humans are artificially inflating the mosquito population by a lot in hopes that fewer normal mosquitos can find mates to pass on healthy genes.  There is no pressure to find ""good"" mates if the female mosquitos cannot tell a difference between normal and cured males.  Natural selection would apply in a case where there's only a few mosquitos with the cure because those ones would die and normal mosquitos would still rule the world, or in the case where we released a mosquito-only plague which would breed plague-resistant mosquitos.",1477958585

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","It's basically a lore immigrant from an older version. The empire was positioned over the sleepy and forest regions. If I recall sleepy didn't translate the way I wanted it so sleep it was.

So the empire was positioned over a sleepy forest area so the nation, the language and the people are all named after it.

In the current lore it only felt right to draw upon such inspirations when coming up with the languages and names of the people who lived in the empire that came before the modern nation.

"OSU","t5_2qj3f","For the quantile function:  In general, this function takes a list of observations, sorts them low to high, and then picks the observations that are x% of the way through the list (here we have 0=the lowest observation, .5=the middle observation, and 1=the highest observation). So you're basically finding the min, median, and max observation here. 

For the cut function: you're taking those observation values you got from the quantile function and splitting up the observations into levels based on those. So here you're sorting them into low and high levels (one group min-median and one group median-max). 

For the as.numeric function: this just turns all those values into r's numeric type, which is just a number with decimal points.

"Stronglifts5x5","t5_2x8is","That height/weight puts you in a normal [BMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) Range. I suggest doing a ""recomposition"" (fancy word for replacing fat with muscle). Disclaimer: My wife is a doctor and believes that the BMI should be used only as a general rule of thumb. It is not the only thing that determines whether you are a healthy weight. 
  
Start by going to [IIFYM](http://www.iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) and fill that out using the total body weight formula. This will give you a good idea of how many calories you need to take in to lose, gain or stay the same weight. Also, importantly it will tell you how many grams of protein, fat, and carbs you should be taking in every day. It is important to keep your protein intake high to build muscle. The IIFYM website has a bunch of diet info on there.  
  
  If you are hitting these calorie macro goals, it isn't really important  what you are eating to do it, however there are some foods that make it easier. Chicken breast and cod or other white fish are good sources of lean protein. I use whey protein to help supplement my diet too. Also, whole vegetables and grains help to keep you feeling full and have better nutrition than many processed foods.     
  
  Another resource I use for diet advice is [Lean Gains](http://www.leangains.com/). I really like that guy's approach, although I don't follow it absolutely to the letter.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I am 220 lbs. so I don't classify as fat...but I do have total spine fusion which makes me both look fatter (I'm slightly crouched forward to to the progression of the natural fusion) and also keeps me from being able to work out in a way that would be enough to lose significant weight or gain muscle. (I was very sick in 2012 and I ended up being unable to eat for the most part for 4 months and lost 60 lbs in that period to a weight of 155-160 lbs which lasted for about a year and when I got better I went back up to 220 lbs- do NOT do this on purpose people, it was very dangerous). Also, I cannot rotate or bend my upper body and my neck has little movement. This is visually awkward and sex is really difficult and at times too painful. I am gay and can't even reach low enough or position myself to insert a dildo to stimulate my prostate. This is very difficult on the psyche. 

The disease that crippled me hit me when I was 14. So I have been unable to have a boyfriend ever because people are unable to look past the disability or are unwilling to be ok with sex that causes me pain and is very awkward and slow. I am 28 now. Never having someone look at you as if you are attractive is really tough too. I'm not happy about this and last Friday I even tried to hit on a attractive guy at a gay club that was throwing a Halloween party and he was nice but showed absolutely no interest in me when and after I had engaged him. This is a similar pattern to all the men I have approached. 

I understand where you are coming from. Physical stimulation is better than nothing and there are many possible reasons why not having an adonis body is not possible. I am often told I am very kind and smart and very interesting, so I know if someone was to look past my disability they would find someone who would be worth their time. I'm sure you are like me in that regard. 

A realistic sex doll isn't just some kinky object for men. I would be able to use it to stimulate myself down there and have what feels like full on sex while able to take it as slow as I need to. I'm way too poor to afford a doll rigid enough for this but I  trying to finish college so I can earn some money. 

Being alone isolates the mind and we start to think there is something glaringly wrong with us that is like flashing bright warning lights on our head that mean every aspect of us is undateable. After 100% disinterest from attempts it's very hard not to think this way. Hopefully in ten years they can break my spine apart and reinsert artificial discs in my spine. All my discs in my spine are virtually gone. And hopefully genetic engineering will allow me to revert my body to 14 years old again so I can hit the reset button and workout and have the body I've always wanted and have as much sex as I've ever needed/wanted/wished/hoped/begged the imaginary gods for. Someday I will be attractive enough to be a boyfriend to someone who genuinely loves me. 

But that day is still years away and I'll likely be in my 40s before I get my first boyfriend. This is one of the main reasons I've been unable to get myself out of my depression (not the only main reason though). 

Your not alone, friend. I know that doesn't make it any easier just know you'll find no judgement from me. Hang in there!",1477958587

The governing principle of *laissez-faire* capitalism is that the individual only has value to the extent that he can convince others he has value, otherwise there are no guarantees of access to the material prerequisites of survival.

Yes. Its the trade of skills for skills. Simple as that. If u have something your good at, and I'm good st something else, then we need each other in this society. 

&gt;Contrast this with communism, which takes an individualist worldview that recognizes the inherent value of all people in their own right rather than simply seeing them through the lens of instrumentality, and so guarantees to all the material preconditions for a fulfilling existence.

Why the hell do I need to know it contrast to socialism. And actually socialism sees the value of each individual as the same without taking into consideration the skills that would add value to their part of society. 

&gt;Ultimately, under *laissez-faire* capitalism, your survival is conditioned on doing what someone else--be it your boss, your shareholders, or your customers--want.  If you cease to fulfill their desires, you are abandoned and no longer have access to the material requirements of survival.  You are therefore coerced, under threat of starvation if you refuse, to obey another's whims.  It's a slave system.

Lmao what system do u think we live in now?!?!?! Let me translate what u just said.
In order for me to survive in this system I have to work for a boss. If I stop doing my job then I'm going to get fired. So if I'm fired I'm not getting paid anymore. How is this a slave system???? Its what's happening now????

If u don't have a certain skill to offer (starting ur own business) then ur going to work for someone (9-5 job). Laissez-faire allows competition between employers so if u get fired in one job, u can look for another (like today). If we allow the markets to compete and allow people with skills to enter the market as easy as possible then that's more availability of jobs. Simple as that! ",1477958588

Assertion: if **you** determine (create) an outcome, **you** are predetermining the outcome.

'P1 Without god no outcomes could be determined (created).

'P2 God is the determiner of all outcomes.

'P3 If he determines the outcome he is predetermining the outcome.

'C: God predetermines all outcomes.

----

First a comment against your assertion:  What is this ""you""? Is this an inherently cognitive entity/agent? If so, then you are presuming that this agent actually exists. Is the ""you"" merely a pointer to some non-cognitive physicalistic property that acts as an agent of causality? Then you are stating that apparent probabalistic quantum effects are actually fully deterministic (which may be the case, but current evidence supports that many quantum effects are probabalistic indeterminate).

'P1.  It appears you are stating that a wholly non-cognitive physicalistic existence is incapable of supporting cause and effect.  Yet the entirety of the observable universe supports causality.  

Taking this premise to an extreme, it appears that you subscribe to a position of some 'first cause' - even in regard to the condition of existence (i.e., the condition of a literal nothing is a necessary logical truth to support the contingent logical truth of the condition of existence).  Why? Can you support the actualization of a literal nothing?

'P2.  This premise is contingent upon an (unidentified/undefined) God as being existent. And then assigning (unnamed) attributes/predicates to this (unidentified/undefined) God.  Seems like a bit of presuppositionalism.

'P3.  This ""he"" (taken as the (unidentified/undefined) God) has properties/attributes/predicates that have not been identified (and therefore are not supported).  This God thingy can very well not be a multi-omni God and not all powerful, or whatever. You are assuming that if God determines the outcome, that God is always successful in this cognitive and purposeful actualization.

'C:  Not supported by the premises - for a variety of reasons.

&gt; Regarding this to free will

&gt; I heard a claim that god, since he's omniscient, could create a universe in which the outcome would have been as if free will did exist. 

What is ""free will"" in the context of this discussion?

What type of omniscience?

* Voluntary Nescience: The future is alethically settled but nevertheless epistemically open for God because he has voluntarily chosen not to know truths about future contingents. Dallas Willard espouses this position.
* Involuntary Nescience: The future is alethically settled but nevertheless epistemically open for God because truths about future contingents are in principle unknowable. William Hasker espouses this position.
* Non-Bivalentist Omniscience: The future is alethically open and therefore epistemically open for God because propositions about future contingents are neither true nor false. J. R. Lucas espouses this position.
* Bivalentist Omniscience: The future is alethically open and therefore epistemically open for God because propositions asserting of future contingents that they ""will"" obtain or that they ""will not"" obtain are both false. Instead, what is true is that they ""might and might not"" obtain. Greg Boyd espouses this position.
* Inherent omniscience - the ability to know anything that one chooses to know and can be known.
* Total omniscience - actually knowing everything that can be known.
* Internal omniscience:  the God Entity has, at a minimum, true or perfect, and intentful, knowledge of the results or actualizations of all cognition's by the Entity. That is, the Entity knows, to a level of complete certainty, any event/effect/causation/interaction/whatever, the actual actualization that results from purposeful cognition by the God.",1477958589

However, I have also known Trump to be a shady crooked leach with a disgusting sexist personae and a history of racial discrimination dating back to the 80s.  As bad as Clinton is at least she is competent in regards to how public policy works.  Trump is a boorish stupid clod proposing ideas based on bigotry, fear mongering and straight up fascism.

Right now almost all models are displaying unhealthy standards. Having 3-6% of models displaying unhealthy standards in a way that better reflecting society and a 90% decrease in displaying those unhealthy standards would be bad why?


It's an example of false equivalance, if some plus size models exist people won't suddenly start thinking obesity is the goal. If I was advocating that every woman in media be overweight to the degree women in media are currently underweight then you would have a point. What I'm saying is if the goal will be closer to a healthy weight and women who are slightly overweight will fill accepted and might feel motivated to reach that more realistic goal. Right now overweight women see these unhealthy stick thin women and just feel discouraged because they know they will never reach that idea of perfection which is already inherently unhealthy and unrealistic.",1477958589

The second you decide you want something more, the friendship is *over*. 

It is, plain and simple, you will always long for her and you will always wonder what if. Sooner or later she will date someone and it will be painful for you to look at and she will want to befriend him since "" We are such good friends after all"". 

It will turn into resentment and you will say or do something stupid that will ruin any chance you had even if you say you didn't want one. 

Once you square with your emotions and go for it, either you will land the lady you long for or it will become awkward like you said. 

So the question is. 

How long are you willing to ask yourself the question ""what if?"". 

It really sucks when you like a good friend of yours because you are faced with two really difficult decisions. 


I did this with a really good friend of mine. We dated for a while and we were really happy. It ended like most relationships do, but im happy for the time i had and the experience i gained because of it.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","It depends.

If you do head hopping between chapters, but stick with one character within that chapter, it is definitely third limited. But if you slide from one person's head into another within a scene, that can fairly be called omniscient (even if you limit yourself to information only available to those characters whose heads you are entering). Here the thing: once you allow that the narrator is not confined to one character's head, you have created a narrator that has exceeded third limited -they float outside the characetrs and are free to move around- and the jig is up, so to speak. The illusion of being confined to one character is broken. For all intents and purposes, you are writing as omniscient, because the reader will feel it as omniscient. At this point you can arbitrarily confine yourself to information that would only be available to head-hopped characters, but it won't help rescue the feeling of third limited. That ship has sailed when you started head-hopping within a chapter.

The terminological distinction is best understood here based on its effect on the reader. Third limited feels like you are stuck just to one character. Third omniscient has a completely different feel, and you get to that feeling by allowing head-hopping (among other things).",1477958594

"SocialEngineering","t5_2qlud","I agree with pretty much everything you said and how you said it.


Knowledge in the end is the best defence,both, against social engineering as a whole, and internally as a defence against some of the pitfalls associated with it. I think, becoming a master social engineer, is as much an philosophical journey as it is an intellectual one.  


&gt; ""There will always be a combination of events/information/disinformation/actions/etc that can be used to pull your strings as well, and anyone with sufficient motivation and time can and will find that combination.""


This is especially true. I often like to imagine extreme and fantastical scenarios, to draw attention to the potential social mechanics, and then refine, reduce, and distil those mechanics into a practical application.


For instance, if a time traveller from the future, came back, someone who knew you from the future, and needed your help to kill someone, or something else far and above the bounds or limits of your character, how would he go about this. I think its plausible, that future you, could give him, this unknown person, the information to convince modern day you, that you need to do what this person says. 


There would be information, only you would know, only you would believe, framed and presented in such a manner, as to convince you of this truth, whether it be true or other wise. And if I or another social engineer were able to divine this information, we could then convince you to behave, in any sort of manner, as implausible as the presentation may be, there would be a ""perfect play"" to this scenario.


Or equally, someone kidnaps those close to you, and orders you to do a task, or they will die. Most people would ask to see or hear from the kidnapped parties, but a real kidnapper could just as easily refuse. displaying no real evidence. 


The target, might pursue a variety of means to find out of his loved ones are indeed captured, but this would suffer from confirmation bias, in that no information, would serve to convince the target that his family is indeed captured. 


If you could convince someone their family is kidnapped, with no evidence, you could convince someone their family is kidnapped with out having done so at all. 


Applying the usual, don't talk to the police, and maybe pick pocketing, damaging or using ecm to jam, a family members phone at a key time, you could theoretically, with just one conversation, convince anyone do to anything.


Obviously the mechanics of these feats, are more complex and the scenarios improbable but distinctly not impossible, and thats the key.

There are, also, many more scenarios, in which I think, any individual, could be convinced of any task, within one conversation. 


As I have detailed in my other writings, These conversations, these gambits, could even be proxied out either voluntarily or involuntarily to 3rd,4th or even more parties.  Considering the theory of 6 degrees of separation, again considering the fantastical extreme. I consider it possible, however improbable, to effect anyone on the planet dramatically, within one significant conversation.


Again, these are all theoretical extremes, but it all comes down to, me agreeing, ""There will always be a combination of events/information/disinformation/actions/etc that can be used to pull your strings""  ",1477958594

Nagaji don't have a whole lot going on. They have solid bonuses to Perception checks and to saves against mind-affecting effects (which is most Will saves), but that's nothing to build a character around.

They've got good Str and Cha, and bad Int. That's a decent set of bonuses for a Paladin, or maybe a Bloodrager. Also not bad for a melee Bard or Mesmerist. I mean, there are a bunch of Cha-based casters out there.

I pre-ordered the game.

Having played the beta and knowing what to expect from the car handling, I was actually on board for what was ahead of me. I knew the physics were funky but I was having far too much fun with the wrap editor and car customization suite to care. 

I haven't stopped playing or given up on the game yet; I'm still having a ton of fun, and having figured out setups that allow for some slightly more realistic handling- I actually really enjoy simply driving in the game. The biggest plus for me is the wrap editor still (I'll post some pics of my rides at some point, I swear), but it's not a bad game and it's certainly about the attitude you take going into it.

tldr; **I spent full price and I still enjoyed this game more than Shift 2 and The Run combined.**

An aside; Do people ever look back at Shift 2 and The Run?
They were both horrendously executed games with some glaring bugs and questionable design choices, but nobody ever seems to call them out for just how bad they were. IMO, out of all the Need For Speed games, The Run has probably disappointed me the most. It had the promise to be something great but instead was incredibly frustrating and really short!",1477958597

"TryingForABaby","t5_2sil5","Ok, I see you took this argumentatively. I did read your post thoroughly, and I did see that sentence, but the other sentences you used when talking about anovulatory cycles were not as specific. And the reality is that things are normal until they aren't. You may think asking too many questions is a bad thing, but I don't think it is. Again, as I noted before, they have nurses who take calls first for a reason. They get stupid questions all the time, but that's why that service is offered the way it is. People will have questions, and some of them will be dumb. Personally, I think it's better to ask than worry for days on end unnecessarily if asking a simple question will get you an easy, concrete answer.

No one is advocating for her to call her doctor daily about the status of her cycle, and I don't think that's what she was insinuating that she was going to do. No one is telling her that advocating for her health is ""running to the doctor for every little thing"" and plenty of parents call about their kid's first runny nose. No one is telling her to call about any little thing, but saying that if she really feels the need to call and get an answer about this one thing, she could. 

I get your point that anovulatory cycles happen. I get that. I was just pointing out that she has alternative options, if she wants to use them. And that it's the worst thing in the world to do so.

"CruciblePlaybook","t5_37lup","That is not the proper conclusion to draw from monty hall, though. 

With monty hall you choose the second door always, as it has a higher chance of being lucky. The rationale is that 

- you still know nothing about your initial guess (door 1) save that it is separate from monty's next statement, which is:

- door 3 (as selected by him) is stated to not have the prize behind it.


Monty's statement is the dividing line in the probability of occurrence. He is not giving information on a group of three, but rather the two left over from your first selection. He is going to tell you which door of the two leftover doors does not have a prize regardless of the door you chose initially. It is the hallmark example of an non-causal outcome having the illusion of causality (the non-causal outcome being his addition of information to the game). It happens no matter which door you pick, because there is always a door in the remainder group without a prize.

The notion of his not getting a fair shake is valid based on the regime prior.

He did nothing in his time here other than lead the Team in INTs when he was playing. You may not like him, but the guy can play and he produced when he was on the field other than when Lovie put him in as a last ditch resort.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm in my 40s, and I've been blessed with some great relationships with quality women who I probably didn't deserve. I've travelled the world, worked a lot of jobs, had serious drug problems, seen, shared, experienced many things, and been in love 3 times. 

Think is, the last time I was in love - over ten years ago - I felt that I'd met the right person for me. I'd been in love before, maybe twice, but this woman redesigned the term. I had no idea that this utter certainty and joy existed.

Bear in mind at the time I was not the sort of person you'd have expected this sort of sentiment from. 

I knew I'd met the one person for me. We got engaged, and I've never been someone who believed in the concept of marriage - why let the church and the law dictate the confines of your relationship? 

But it felt right. And for her, too. It took me a long time to work out that she really did feel the same. For a long time afterwards, I thought she'd been lying for some reason - must have been - but she really wasn't. She felt the same. It doesn't work otherwise.

All the rest is the same shit you can read in any reddit post about a relationship that fails. I didn't understand it and I still don't.

Almost fifteen years later, I can think about her without anger and pain, and be glad that I had the opportunity to taste something so unique. I guess I really was blessed. 

Since it ended, I've slept with a few women, had one or two six month relationships. I've actually come around to feeling that it'd be nice to meet someone I really liked.

But, ultimately, you don't mistake that feeling when you find it. I met the person I was meant to be with, and it fucked up. 

I'm okay being single, I've got friends, and as long as I have sex with someone nice every now and then, I can tick the sexuality box. It's healthy. I haven't seen her in over ten years, the anger and the love have both faded to something manageable. I don't think about her every day, not even every week.

But that's why I'm single. I've met the woman I was meant for, and - well, it went wrong.

Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. . ?

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Ah yes, only I could possibly be at fault, there's no way at all that you could have misunderstood or misinterpreted what I said.

Well, let's break it down and see.  Here is the comment you originally replied to:

&gt;Oh and those darn Bernie supporters, turned out they were right about the DNC scheming against Sanders. Who would have thought?!

So this comment is talking about the scheming that the DNC did against Sanders.  To which you replied:

&gt;It's almost as if they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.

Looking at this response in context of the comment it is responding to, there is no other way to interpret it's meaning other than it is giving justification for the action in the first comment which is 'DNC scheming against Sanders.'  You don't refute or deny the DNC schemed and in-fact give justification for it which is, '...they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.'

Your response says nothing of any positive/negative impact on the People and only indicates a concern for who gets to spend the Democratic party's money.  It's also said in a manner as if it's obvious or acceptable for them to scheme against another candidate and this is only emphasized by your little 'Craaaazzzyyyyyy' at the end.  

So to answer your question, no, there is no way I misunderstood what you said.  Now if what you said is not what you meant, that's not my fault for misunderstanding.  That's your fault for writing poorly and misrepresenting yourself.  

If what you said is what you meant, then you care more about the party than you do the People.  Since you are justifying the DNC corruptly favoring a known liar--that being Hillary, just in-case it wasn't clear--over doing what they are supposed to be doing, which is be impartial to all Democratic candidates regardless where they came from before.

"askhillarysupporters","t5_3ct1i","&gt;There is proof that Brazile sent emails to HRC's campaign about the debates.

Sure. That's not what's in question. That is something you and I are on the same page on.

What *is* in question is the extent of the Campaign's complicity in these leaks. 

Take three examples:

* Was Brazile acting alone and sent these question to the Campaign herself? Well, that's not a conspiracy. The Campaign can hardly be blamed for receiving ""help"" that they neither wanted nor asked for.

* Was Brazile acting as an Agent for the campaign and leaking questions to them to help them prepare Hillary? Alright, that *would* constitute a conspiracy, and would paint both Brazile and the Campaign in a bad light. It would raise questions about Hillary's integrity, but if there wasn't a direct link between Hillary and the campaign's decision to set this conspiracy up, it wouldn't be so bad.

* Was Brazile personally recruited as an insider agent by Clinton herself and promised monetary gain or political advancement in exchange for her help in getting debate questions? Well that would be something so completely shady it would likely tank Clinton's political career and make her completely radioactive to Progressives.

To me, without having any further proof of a conspiracy, I can only assume scenario 1 to be true. We only know, after all, that Brazile sent the e-mails. We don't have proof that she's a Clinton agent. 

Why do you feel so strongly that she is a Clinton agent?",1477958603

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","I actually do agree that gender is an arbitrary concept. In an ideal world, gender would not exist. But we don't live in an ideal world. And I think the way we approach this from there is vastly different.

I think labels cause people comfort in subconscious ways. From a linguistic perspective, ideas become valid when there is a word for them. They're also useful in a purely utilitarian sense, in the same way it's easier to say ""plane"" than ""big metal boat with wings."" And often happiness with gaining a label contributes to self-acceptance. The LGBT community for example is established entirely on the basis of sharing a label with others with common experiences, and rejoicing in that. Many people remain active members of such communities their whole lives, but the less willing we as a society are to accept these things, the less likely people will feel comfortable finding that solace. Maybe all of the Tumblr kids exploring and experimenting with their gender wouldn't feel the need to grow out of it if it weren't for the immense pushback from society at large.

&gt; who are you to say gender isn't binary?

Didn't we both just agree that gender is arbitrary? It would follow that the binary as well is arbitrary, but that doesn't and shouldn't stop people from defining themselves in relation to it.

&gt;This is why I chose to be a scientist, this is why I will not accept people should be left to believe their own imaginary version of reality. No matter how blissful it might make things in the interim. Allowing people to live in falsehood is immoral and corrupting to the progress of humanity

I appreciate that your motivation is so lofty and coming from a good place, but I just don't think it's your or anyone else's place to impose your beliefs on others. Of course your entitled to your beliefs, but it's only natural for people who consider gender important to them to push back.",1477958606

"swtor","t5_2qxih","&gt;Jugg (...) tend to take less damage and have the best single target threat.

&gt;Assassins (...) take the most damage since they have the lowest armor rating.

Neither of these statements is true. Over the course of a fight Assassin and Juggernaut tanks will take the same amount of damage on average. This is because the lower armor rating of Assassins is made up for by their much higher Defense Chance, Shield Chance and Shield Absorption. However, the difference in armor rating does cause Assassins to have a spikier damage profile when they get unlucky with defending or shielding large hits.

Did you sand by hand? What did you use to paint?  I sometimes use a Dremel for sanding and an airbrush with a layer of primer to get the paint to stick to the PLA; works well enough for my needs, but I'll admit I've never got a result so smooth.

As for popularity, I use Blender for my 3d printing needs all the time, along with Zbrush. I'd imagine it's just down to the fact that 3d printing is still a niche hobby, with equipment that is still (somewhat) expensive and requires some specialized knowledge, combined with the also fairly specialized CG market, in which Blender is already largely overshadowed by Maya, Max, Solidworks, for various reasons...

I guess it just comes down to people use what they know, and of those with skillsets in both printing and creating, many folks already know a different tool for the job. Possibly because they've picked up their skills in college or on the job, which tend to lean toward the high-end markets (Makerbot, Ultimaker + Zbrush, Maya, Max, etc) Just my guess.

Personally, I do often find myself wanting Blender to deal better with exact part units. It's workable, where there's a will, there's a way... but I have to admit it's probably more work than a CAD oriented software might present. And I lean toward Zbrush for sculpting. But on the other hand, Blender nicely edges somewhere between the more artistic, and the more traditional modeling.

For me, it's still the best I've found for readying and modifying models before printing. I almost always take it over Meshmixer, for example, just because of the level of control.  I'd welcome any tips you've picked up.

"Colonizemars","t5_3bh8d","&gt;  that's 2000m2 of panel area per person. 

Making PV, for anytime in the foreseeable future, wholly impractical for Mars. 

Edit: for some frame of rerence, 4046.86 square meters is an acre. That's an acre of solar panels for every 2 people. Actually more than an acre because you'd need room to walk between the rows. 

The cabling alone for an acre of PV panels would be staggering in weight. You'll need something that is shielded quite well, and it'll need to be 10awg minimum. It'll need considerable shielding due to a lack of a magnetic field, even mild solar storms could generate a lot of unwanted current. The Carrington Event here on earth set telegraph lines on fire, mind you that was a head on hit from a solar storm of moderate strength, but something considerably weaker would be a formidable force on Mars. This is of course, unless you intend to bury thousands of meters of cable per acre (probably half a meter to a meter deep). I'd also add, you'll likely want to try and keep the cable in a certain temperature range, temperature can very much change ampacity. 

1,000 feet of completely bare 10awg copper wire weighs 14.24kg, add insulation/shielding and a 10-20% increase is likely. That's 17kg per 305 meters of wire. You're probably talking 100kg of cable per acre of pv panels PLUS the weight of the panels, PLUS a framework for them PLUS something to insulate them from the Martian ground (just dropping them on the ground is going to increase the daily temperature change the panels see considerably, having them off the ground and insulated from the regolith will make a world of difference). So even a base of 10 persons, per your kWh figures, would need 5 acres of PV panels and would eat up their weight plus 500kg of wire, minimum. You'd also very much want to send extra wire along.

To be honest, a worthwhile chunk of the captured energy is probably advisable to pump right back into them, at least at night, to warm them to a certain point to drastically increase their lifespan.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The warrant I linked to is for Clinton's emails, a warrant for Weiner's computer had already been issued and the new emails are covered under the new warrant, and thus should be admissible.

They obtained that warrant only yesterday. They went snooping through Huma's account weeks ago searching for emails from Clinton's server, while ostensibly searching *Weiner's* accounts for child pornography. Whatever warrant they obtained to search Weiner's accounts for child pornography would *not* have covered searching Huma's accounts for Clinton emails.

A number of legal experts have analyzed this and agree that this search/seizure was unconstitutional:

* https://lawfareblog.com/did-fourth-amendment-require-fbi-selectively-seize-weiners-emails

* https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/30/was-it-legal-for-the-fbi-to-expand-the-weiner-email-search-to-target-hillary-clintons-emails/

[We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed - men, women and children indiscriminately."" A Māori conqueror explained, ""We took possession... in accordance with our customs and we caught all the people. Not one escaped....."" [20] The invaders ritually killed some 10% of the population, a ritual that included staking out women and children on the beach and leaving them to die in great pain over several days. The Māori invaders forbade the speaking of the Moriori language. They forced Moriori to desecrate their sacred sites by urinating and defecating on them.[21]

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I mostly work with product visualization and infomercials in 3D(Not much cinema/fiction business around my parts of norway). 

Hardest thing for me to animate is people/characters. We dont have mocap and also we're a Cinema 4D house. I was trained in Maya, which I found much better for character animation, because I felt more in control weightmaps, kinematics and general rigging and I like the animation curves better. It also seems to ""understand"" my models better by default, before I have to do any manual mapping, if that makes sense.

Hardest thing to model - thats a tough one. Except for the challenges that come with doing character models I haven't had that much challenging work, its more time consuming than anything - modelling products with every internal component in the right place, size and material. Sometimes we get CAD files they use for production to animate, we just have to assemble the parts. Other times we dont even get a blueprint, so we have to go in blind without proper ortheographic  references.

Favourite thing I've worked on.. At work, Probably my first project I did as an intern half a year ago. Got a client and a mission to solve on my own. It was just for a trucking company who delivers throughout norway, but it was fun to learn so much and to prove that I could manage on my own. I spent a lot of time modelling the trucks, making rigs that would automatically spin the tires at correct speeds as they moved along a path - doing materials and such. Unfortunately I had to make a lot of compromises near the end when it comes to environments and render settings, which led to my materials not rendering as intended. We dont have a lot of stock assets, nor do we have a lot of machine power in house (5 trashcan mac pros, which are all in use during the day, and a variety of weaker computers. I'm advocating for building proper workstations ASAP, and figuring out a cloud solution for larger projects).

These days I'm constantly learning new tricks with the C4D toolset to decrease both production &amp; render times while preserving as much quality as possible. From procedural landscaping &amp; modelling, properly baking light/GI into textures for static objects, to using the C4D Sculpt tag &amp; tools  so I can model a character with millions of polygons, then bake that data and apply it to a super low poly model which is super easy to animate. To top it off, I'm learning to do more ""procedural"" animations with the C4D MoGraph. It's really interesting, and I rarely, if ever keyframe an actual model anymore unless its a character.

Outside of that, just keep at it. Spend as much time as you can without sacrificing all connections to friends &amp; family at the studio if you truly dream of working there. I pretty much showed up at my studio when I heard of it, told my boss that I can do 3D and animation, then made myself invaluable by showing interest in not just doing things they already do, but improving their workflows and end products, taking on as much responsibility they would let me have and living up to it in any way I can. Its hard, but giving. It's definitely scary, but you seem to be in a good spot and as long as you work hard and learn as much as you can, things seem to work out.

For the Progressive Left to win, Clinton must lose.

Apparently this needs a tldr, because 7 pages about the political future of the country is too long for an electorate raised on 30 second sound bites. So, here's the summary:

Clinton is demonstrably corrupt, as is the DNC machine that got her the nomination, and electing her rewards that corruption.

With a corrupt and unpopular incumbent, the Democrats lose downticket elections in 2018 and 2020, as well as allowing someone even worse than Trump to take over the Republicans and beat Clinton in 2020.

The president's party loses seats in the midterms more than 75% of the time.

Democrats have lost 900 state legislature seats since the reasonably popular Obama was elected, and it'd be much worse under Clinton.

Republicans need 38 state legislatures to be able to overrule the Supreme Court and change the Constitution and its amendments however they want.

Currently Republicans control both chambers of the state legislatures in 31 states, and one of two chambers in 8 more.

If Trump wins, it will be a disaster for Republicans for the same reasons that Clinton would be a disaster for Democrats.

Trump isn't nearly as bad as he's presented, and his worst excesses would be limited by the leadership in his own party. He has a lot of rhetoric, but he will never be able to implement his “policies”. Remember, his SC nominees still need Senate confirmation. 

For these reasons, it is imperative that Clinton loses in November, because the alternative is 12 years of Democrat losses. A Trump presidency would be bad but it wouldn't be that bad, and it would lead to 12 years of progressive wins.

"raisedbyborderlines","t5_33d8b","Oh sister.

edit: I wanna make sure I also say, I am very happy that your mom has gotten help and is in a place where she can be more nurturing to you. This is amazing to me and I am proud of your mom for owning up to having a problem. That must be very hard for a pwBPD. I hope that you find a way to keep that relationship consistent - all my hope to you &lt;3

Let me first say, I just got here, too. [Here is my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/59ln6p/new_here_and_looking_for_other_weirdos_like_me/) if you want a read. 

Secondly, there is so much to say, I wish I could just talk to you on the phone and get it all out then give you a giant hug somehow.

My story is slightly different, but all my feelings and behaviors sound the same. I've been retriggered to some of my juvenile behavior since my therapist and I started processing all of this, and my I did the same screaming thing to my partner when he intruded into my hiding place a few months ago. I feel ashamed but I know it was just little me trying to feel safe.

The best advice my therapist has given me:

Me: ""But what can I do? Which books have the insight to help me know how to interact with her lovingly, now that I know her condition?""

Lady Goddess Divine: ""You could go that route. You could try to make adjustments to your behavior to try to find a 'sweet spot' where you feel safe and empowered around your mom, but it will be in vain. This is what you've done to survive your whole life. The bottom line of this disorder is that the symptoms make it nearly impossible for the person to change. Often times, it gets worse with age, especially in someone who continues to go undiagnosed. The *reason* it wouldn't work is because the pwBPD adjusts to you. That is the whole point. They are totally self-centered, but also look to everyone around them for hidden clues on how to feel and behave. The issue is that their perception of reality is skewed, so they cannot process the information correctly. Whatever changes you make, she will make the necessary ones to be the right person for you until she finally breaks. A pwBPD has no containment boundary. No external boundary. Every change you make, she will make the counter.""

I have no idea if this advice is applicable for you, but it helped me understand my role in her life so much more- and that's just it. If we are IC, I am filling a role in her life. My life is not going to matter the same as hers when it's a difficult moment. 

Also... hope is powerful, for good or for bad. Trust your instincts and come back here any time your inner mom voice makes you doubt them &lt;3",1477958618

"electronjs","t5_3fh1h","You certainly can do this. How you want to go about it is going to depend on the specific needs. An easy way to do this though would be to use something like [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/), a JS implementation of CouchDB. You could also instead set up an SQLite or other database system on the client end and then handle detection and synchronisation outside of that.

If I were doing this and wanted to keep it really simple, I'd have the client app check for a connection to the server, and if found, compare timestamps between the two databases and update whichever needed it. Without a connection you still have the client using the client's local database. The server side one only comes into play when you're online, and then only for the sake of keeping the client up to date or vice versa.

It's hard to give you specifics beyond that, but the simple answer to your question is that, yes, it's quite possible to do what you're asking.",1477958618

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","Volatile. The sociological component of the team now is very European whereas at the time there was a fair number of banlieue Frenchmen and Africans, so the dressing room culture was different. It was less united than now, and also the team was also much less mature in dealing with internal conflict. But we could also be spirited at times. There were a few fights like between Gallas-Nasri, Gallas-Toure, Adebayor-Bendtner. 

On the pitch, we were very talented but also very inconsistent and much more defensively fragile than now, although in 07-08 we were so close to winning the league with very good camaraderie that was short lived. In 08-09 we were found wanting mentally and defensively in those semi finals, in 09-10 we were poor defensively and got unlucky with injuries at the end of the season, and in 10-11 we completely bottled it after we lost the League Cup final.

To sum it up there were truly talented players like Fabregas, van Persie, Nasri, Adebayor, Sagna and even Bendtner..but no I think our guys now are much more likeable. Week in week out it was very much inconsistent, although we had very good patches (Sept 07 to Feb 08, Sept 09-Nov 09, and Jan 11 - March 11).. I think 10-11 was the culmination of that Fabregas generation; that season truly exposed the strengths and weaknesses of that particular group.",1477958618

Not only are dgpus cheaper, but you can fit way more power into a lot smaller space. So not only is apple deciding not to take advantage of this technology to make a more powerful machine (and instead focusing on making it marginally more powerfully but, for the most part, thinner), while costing way more than it should (the most expensive, the 460, is still like ~$100), and being unveiled after so long (only to disappoint), and at a time when competitors are only moving ahead of it.

Sorry if this is sloppy, but, to put it simply: beyond all the port/dongle issues, beyond all the settling for touch bar over touch screen, beyond ddr3 ram + 16gb cap, beyond the fact that we're getting last year's processor a year late, its that Apple isn't making its laptop nearly as powerful as it can be while pricing it so dearly.",1477958618

It's complete bullshit and he misrepresents studies and facts to sell anti-evidence-based medicine.  The way he frames modern medicine is horrendous, but it provides detailed insight into the pseudoscience of chiropractory.  He's the ultimate quack, but I think it's necessary to be aware of the bullshit he's selling since he has over 100,000 subscribers.  And I think it's necessary for anyone skeptical of pseudoscience in medicine.

I'd urge anyone skeptical of these snake-oil salesmen to check it out to see what chiropractors are learning and their views on medicine.",1477958619

"ockytop","t5_2v13w","I agree with most of your points...except the last one. 

If you have a few key injuries, that's bad luck, when you have consistent injuries on all sides and most position groups, that's a coaching problem. Not one you addressed, but something I feel needs to be said.

When you have a one or two players that have bad attitudes, that's a player issue, when it's only a handful that don't seem to have bad attitudes and consistently, year to year, you continue to have trouble with player buy in and effort on the field from multiple positions, especially your offensive line, that's a coaching problem. 

Regarding assistants, Shoop, to my knowledge, is the first guy that Butch hired that want someone that he either brought with him, or was someone that he worked with in the past. It's fine to want guys that you're comfortable with and know, but it seems like he's reluctant to pursue talented assistants outside of his coaching tree. That's fine if you're a cutting edge coach bringing in guys that are innovators, but when you're a conservative coach, bringing in his that, in one case actually had retired because the game had passed him up, that's a problem.

I'm not saying definitely fire him, but if the new AD doesn't come in and immediately put him on notice, I would be surprised, regardless of the results of this season, because of the product on the field versus the competition. ",1477958620

1) A slider and a curve are in fact breaking balls, so by calling them that, they are in fact, correct.

2) Just because someone calls a slider or curve a ""breaking ball"" doesn't mean they don't know what those pitches are. Jim DeShaines(JD), for example, uses that term a lot. JD pitched for 11 freaking years in the majors. You can't tell me he doesn't know a curveball from a slider. He can, like most people who watch enough baseball, watch a pitch and tell you what it was just by looking at it. It's not that difficult after a while. No offense to Stoney or Hawk, I think Stoney is a great commentator and Hawk, while he says really outlandish things(Frazier is better than Bryant) and is a complete homer, actually knows his stuff decently well, or at least he did. I'm just saying, if you watch enough baseball, you'll be able to tell the difference between a curve and a slider. And these guys watch 162 games per year.

3) You must not have watched many Cubs games, because Len and JD go through the pitches the opposing pitcher has in his arsenal EVERY TIME A NEW PITCHER IS BROUGHT IN.

My first few days playing, the very second I opened my mouth to say something I got rape threats, questions about what sexual positions I like, what size are my breasts, was accused of being a 14 yr old boy or being a man using a voice changer, told ""put the game down and take out your tits"", one guy told me he would continue to harass me until I left because ""grills"" can't play (meanwhile I'm in the top two or three best k/d's for most matches I'm in). This was the tame stuff. I love the game, and I have met a handful of decent players that make it more fun, but almost every game I'm in at least one guy has to make some comment. I know the best advice is to ignore, mute, block. But sometimes the things they say feel like such a violation, they make you feel dirty and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it.

Positives: one goal was a superb shot from outside of the box, the second one was the end of a successful chain of 7-8 passes, beautiful stuff really, and I guess it proves our team's attacking intent

Negatives: we were 2-0 up and still drew, referee awarded Astra a blatantly incorrect penalty in the 95th minute, there's growing frustration within the team, we're in 6th and we should be in 2nd had it not been for extremely bad refereeing during the past 5 games (in 4/5 the other team received a penalty which really wasn't a penalty)",1477958624

"wow","t5_2qio8","Just like in the original Karazhan there are [Sealed Tomes](http://www.wowhead.com/object=181768/sealed-tome#contains) throughout the instance. They are just books laying around on tables or on the ground which show a gear when moused over. Inside there is a chance of getting one of 4 tomes:  

&amp;nbsp;

* [Torment of the Worgen](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142051/torment-of-the-worgen) - Use: Break the seal on the book, granting you Torment of the Worgen. When striking an enemy that is below 30% health, you gain the Frenzy of the Worgen, increasing damage done by 15% for 30sec. This effect cannot occur more than once every 5 minutes.  
* [Wrath of the Titans](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142073/wrath-of-the-titans) - 
Use: Break the seal of the book, granting your attacks a chance to unleash a Titanstrike at your target, dealing damage that increases the further you are from your target.  
* [Redemption of the Fallen](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142052/redemption-of-the-fallen) - Use: Break the seal on the book, causing your heals on players below 25% health to summon a ghostly ally who will heal your party. This effect cannot occur more than once every 20 seconds.  
* [Legacy of the Mountain King](http://www.wowhead.com/item=142049/legacy-of-the-mountain-king) - Use: Break the seal of the book, granting you increased damage done and healing received when dropping below 25% health for 1 hour.  

&amp;nbsp;

These buffs persist through death, but you lose the items and the buff if you are outside of Karazhan for more than 2-3 seconds.  Some tips, they are unique so you can only carry 1 of each book. They can be traded if you are on the same server with someone else, so if you are in a PUG, make sure Auto Loot is turned off so you don't loot one that you can't use. If you find 2 of the healer ones then the healer can either have someone else that is from their server hold it for them, or use one of the books and then loot the second one, or leave it there and go back for it later.  

&amp;nbsp;

We found a couple on the tables in Moroes' Room, about 6ish in the side rooms on the way to Maiden, and a couple on the balcony overlooking Moroes' Room.  Sadly no tank ones spawned for us, but our DPS took full advantage of them.  

&amp;nbsp;

Redemption of the Fallen is obviously only for healers.  Wrath of the Titan's should be prioritized to range DPS obviously, but should you not get any, range can also use the Worgen book.  Mountain King is obviously for tanks, but other DPS can use the tank one as well since they likely will fall below 25% HP in that fight.  Just be smart about it, and if you are able to make it through the initial speed run, you should be able to make the right decision with each one and make sure you don't autoloot one that would be better used on another party member.  

&amp;nbsp;

Our Warlock said that the Wrath of Titans tome contributed about 15-20% of his DPS on the fight.  The Worgen one is going to straight up increase damage when the add in phase 2 is below 30% and during Phase 3.  Combining these buffs can be the difference of wiping at 10-20% to killing Nightbane.  Just look around for the tomes and best of luck.  

&amp;nbsp;

Also, there are about 10 tomes in the library before the final boss, and I believe we have seen them in Shade of Medivh's room, which can also boost people attempting those bosses. Just look around for them.",1477958625

He took advantage of my kindness and my love for him, and my willingness to trust him, basically to do what he wanted. I realized it was not about me, but about his own low self-esteem and terrible self-image. Being wanted by multiple women made him feel good, even though he really hated himself.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","That's fair. I stereotype eastern thinking as more taoist just because that kind of lack of individualty in things or kack of carving the world up into categories  as eastern just because that perspective is actually fairly different and unique to the region.

But there's obviously a lot of overlap. Obviously categorization is an intuitive way for humans to think and it shouldn't be assigned to one culture over others because one of them had the enlightenment.

Going to try it out on the ps4 later on and see if there is any difference. 

I think the 3rd Elder Kai training session for combos has stamina break practices but I am not sure. However in real combat situations I have been prone to press the wrong directional button for the correct stamina break hit. 

See what other people say about the situation. There is suppose to be a 1st November patch coming in later though I am unsure if this is an issue that may be fixed or just a timing matter for input.",1477958628

"guitarlessons","t5_2r8ca","Scales are a map of every note you can play in a given key. Chords etc., are comprised of notes from scales. Every musical composition your hear is using a scale. The root note of the scale determines what key that scale is. So, if you have a chord progression in A, you find the root note A on the low E string (5th fret), and all the shapes you're learning will be relative to that root note's position on the fretboard.

So you not only have to learn those shapes, but you have to be able to move those shapes to different positions on the fretboard. For instance, if the chord progression is in the key of E, your [minor pentatonic box](http://guitardomination.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pentatonic-minor-box-1.png) will start on the low E string of the 12th fret, since that's the E root note.

Get yourself some backing tracks. Preferably MP3s that you can download and play on loop. Find an A major rock backing track, and explore the A minor pentatonic scale wile it's playing. You'll recognize those notes from music, and you'll hear how they work together. The next step is to learn [licks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULPtr5PchM8) for that scale. You build up your library of licks and play them over your backing track and make them your own.",1477958630

"CompetitiveWoW","t5_35p2p","Your Havoc DH Gharius needs to work on a few things. Took a quick look at his logs and I have a few tips:

1. Looks like his go-to opener is Fel Rush -&gt; Throw Glaive x2 which is shit. In general he will want to open with Metamorphosis followed by a Fel Rush into Chaos Blades, then TG and Fury of the Illidari. In the Ursoc log I saw, he cast FR-TG-TG-FR-FOTI and then Chaos Blades after as his opener. This makes absolutely no sense as you want to cast Fury DURING Chaos Blades to buff its dmg, not casting them separately and outside of eachother's active windows. In the same vein, you want TG to be buffed by Chaos Blades for more bloodlet dmg.

2. His Momentum uptime is low. Without Prepared, Momentum uptime should be around 55%, but most of his logs show around 40% or lower. Maximizing damage output during Momentum is arguably the most important part of playing Havoc, therefore maximizing Momentum uptime is key. If he can't maintain at least 50% Momentum, he needs to practice watching his buffs and cooldowns, or switch to Nemesis. I also noticed some instances where he overlaps Momentum buffs, which should never be done and is a dps loss.

2. His crit% is extremely low. He has too many slots without any crit and this will hurt his dps as Chaos Strike refunds half its cost on crit, and CS is a huge portion of our dps. I believe a good amount to maintain is around 42% unbuffed, which is easily obtainable if he just swaps the non-crit pieces.

3. There's also the issue of no neck enchant,  no flask, and no food buff, but that's no mystery so I assume those will be picked up if you guys are actually serious about progressing. You don't even need the best stuff for heroic, but these are easy dps boosts.

Hope this helps.",1477958634

It might fill your hand just fine, but the price you pay is that it can negatively affect your wrist movement. Thankfully the main buttons are forgiving and can be clicked anywhere from the far back to the very top and it still has the same consistent feedback, i use fingertip grip but this mouse demands palming. Anyway there's much to love with the mouse (only had it for two days now), the free spin scroll wheel is heaven for my browsing needs ...i could never go back to a mouse without it.

more poetic feelsy metalcore : Underoath, Silent Planet, etc

hard hitting chugs with breakdowns and that ""pump you up"" feel - Wage War, Blind Witness, Beheading of a King's Quasar EP, Heart of a Coward, In Hearts Wake etc

bands that have an almost mathcore feel to them - Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, etc

bands that heavily incorporate electronics - Attack Attack!, The Word Alive, etc.

bands that are almost in the progmetal relm but still retain a bit of that metalcore feel - Erra, Elitist, the Afterimage, Circle of Contempt, Invent Animate, Northlane (not Node)

Her fingers grasp tightly to my tee shirt, her head rising and falling with my chest. In the tranquil darkness, with the duvet covering most of her and half of me, I lay listening to her deep breathing, envious of the peace she gets when she falls asleep on me.

She looks like her.

I try to push down the image of her. It's wrong to think and painful to see. Not a thought for a tired man with a sleeping wife to entertain in the middle of the night. The moon bleeding in from the windows reflects off her wedding ring. I cannot draw my eyes from it.

I remember giving her that ring, back when life was good. I remember giving it to her in that dump of an apartment, and I remember the bar we went to in celebration. I remember looking at that ring, and the IV needle above it when she was in labor. I remember every birthday, every vacation, every kiss. I remember all those years of pure, unburdened love.

She looks so much like her.

Stop it, goddammit, stop it. Do not think those thoughts. Not now. Not ever. You are here, right now, in this moment. Just go to sleep. I cannot convince myself. Not when I'm staring at her sleeping face. The face that looks like her.

I am powerless to stop the tear that falls from my eye onto her forehead. I pray it doesn't wake her, but it does. She sits up slowly, fuzzy with sleep. Her eyes meet mine. I can feel her concern.

""What's going on?"" She asks with sleep in her voice.

""I- I miss her."" I choke out.

She scoots up and wraps her arms around my neck, sighing painstakingly. I start to wail and I cannot stop. Gross, wet, ugly sobs and my wife holding me close.

""I miss our daughter,"" I cry out.

""I know. I miss her too."" She says between her own softer, calmer tears.

""I miss her, I miss her.""

I bought an old 1948 iron hulled houseboat from my grandpa for 2 grand, moved it on land (I want a yard and minimal rust), and am in the process of gutting it and re-building it as I see fit. The dimensions are 13 feet by 45 feet (not including the deck), and the entire area below the subfloor can act as storage. All told I've spent about $8,000 on it, and will spend about another $8,000 more to finish it.

I will be honest, it's a lot of work, but it's very doable! I am learning a lot by working with my old man, and the satisfaction of building your own house cannot be beat. Furthermore, I live in the country, and want nothing to do with cities...Many people feel the opposite. As a result, I cannot say for sure what tinyhouse culture is like in cities, though I am aware there are way more obstacles with property prices and inspections and licenses. 

But for me, and I would say many others living in rural parts of the world, tinyhouse is a really good option! =]",1477958640

The only reason why she is holding on to those words is because those words will have an effect on her if spoken. You have not proven how she is fully healed despite the fact that there is still conflict between her and her father, as well as minor conflict between her and Soma. 
&gt; 
&gt; About that image you showed me, let me tell what I took from it. Nothing. Nothing happened that didn't happen before. She tasted it, she liked it, and again she didn’t tell him the food was good. That is all that happened. The interesting aspect was her acknowledge the parts of Azami’s plan that she didn’t agree with. Which we already know. Nothing happened that changed anything. The only result we got was her now willing to help the other, which she was already doing before (when tasting the food they gave her). I get the context, I just don't find it applicable.

Souma's followingG HER LEAD BY FOLLOWING HER ORDERS AND TEACHING. How many times do I have to say it? Everyone is following both of them.
http://www.mangapanda.com/shokugeki-no-soma/172/14
http://www.mangapanda.com/shokugeki-no-soma/174/3
http://www.mangapanda.com/shokugeki-no-soma/174/4

In this manga cooking is everything. As chefs all it takes is one dish just like sabaru who was cold hearted but changed after eating souma's dish. It doesn't take long in this story because of who they are as chefs...

Shinomiya is putting action behind his realization as a chef after tasting megumi's dish. His coworkers already confirmed he changed during the stagaire. And it wasn't in need of healing but realization of his flaws. He wasn't hurting... but stagnated and frustrated. He already moved forward. 

Like I said you don't get it so i'll show you....... This was her conflict.... http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-1681?page=18 http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-1681?page=19 http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-169?page=3

This was her joy that came to her which was the same look she had when becoming free of the brainwashing after eating souma's food. http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-1681?page=14

That fear was released from her when she ate his dish like jou forshadowed correctly. http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-169?page=4 http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-1701?page=18 http://www.mangamint.com/shokugeki-no-soma-1701?page=19

That was her freedom....... The conflict between soma and erina has nothing to do with it like I told you because its separate from that because souma wasn't even around. Their bond is a different story then her with azami. And the fact that she likes the yukihira way already proved she moved on

The conflict between her and her father is the bond they share. Its not her that needs to be healed of her personal dilemma still but the relationship  between the 2. THat will be addressed later.

"Hawaii","t5_2qi3u","Generally, no it's not because you're white.

Generally it's because the islands don't have as much of the ""fake smile"" customer service most of the western world has come to expect. Without knowing which countries you've lived in I can't say if you've experienced customer service in places with non-standard ideas of customer service.

I've been going to a local restaurant fairly regularly for years. We get one waitress regularly. We just recently started to get a smile from her. Even with that, orders are more ""wha you wan?"". I love it. She's also great about getting our order right and food hot, it's just not filtered through Customer Service Fakery.

The more established the business/agency the ""worse"" the service. Komoda's here in Makawao gets openly annoyed at customers for asking too many questions and slowing the line down.

I've had many people come here (Maui) and clearly be thrown off by the differences. One analogy I use for different customer service cultures is going to some place in the South. Even in Wal-Mart the cashiers will just chat and chat and chat.... drives me batty and I consider it rude as well. It makes me and many others have to wait longer than we'd need to. Funny thing is, my relatives from the South find customer service lacking elsewhere and think people are rude by not taking the time to chat.

There's also the possibility you're a bit ""high-maintenance"" by local standards. If everywhere you go has terrible customer service and is being rude to you, it's possible you're rubbing people the wrong way. There's a strong culture of ""go-with-the-flow"" and ""don't rock the boat"" here. I've got friends who are very aggressive about making sure things are done ""just right"" for themselves. They did not enjoy the lack of appreciation such ""needy"" customers have here. 

I've never had what I'd call rude customer service even though I'm white, but there's definitely a difference in experience once they know I'm local. It takes a long time to be considered a full local, but once you do, customer service goes from being functional to warm. I'm okay with knowing that when I get a warm welcome it's because they know me.

1) On membership, the old bylaws stated  that members were considered those who provided the SLFS Secretary directly with their contact info, and were the only people eligible to vote. After realizing that this basically made 5/10 people the only ones eligible to vote, we changed the rules of membership to be the same as the AMS (ie: if you pay us the fee, which you can opt out of, you are a member and can vote in our elections.) In terms of rights as a member, it's the same as any non-profit: your right to run as a director, elect a director, vote on major motions that require membership approval, and receive our services. 

2) Yes, we do provide a subsidy for the legal referral service, however, there is a procedure for how to access those funds. We encourage most applicants to contact us first and discuss their case. If we feel there are more details that need sorting out prior to a full consideration of funding, we encourage the client to use the grant funding and use their session to get some clarity on case details, potential cost, etc. The reason we do this is that many legal needs that students contact us about are actually provided for free by LSLAP, and we care about directing students to the right resource depending on their situation. 

3) Great question. All of our directors have NDAs and privacy agreements that ensure from a legal perspective that we handle sensitive information appropriately. Full case details are only viewed by one director, and are anonymized prior to consideration. Paper records are stored securely on premises, and case details that are electronic are secured and backed up on site. In terms of the degree of information we need, we typically ask for a case outline in as much detail as possible with an estimate of cost and a statement on the impact to students broadly (per our mandate.)

A few other details that might be helpful:

- The SLFS focuses on larger cases of precedence, per our constitution, that have a broad impact on students (like housing accessibility, tuition, etc.) We aren't a resource for tenancy disputes or immigration situations; those would be better suited to LSLAP or AMS/GSS Advocacy.
- We aren't the fastest group on the planet when it comes to funding cases, and I say this to be realistic. Cases on average take several months to consider for funding (especially those where significant cash resources are going to be invested), and more complex cases can take six months or more to get the necessary feedback from our legal counsel and our Litigation Committee. We're working on improving our processes to make this quicker. 
- We manage a budget of just over $500,000, which has been largely unused in past years. This year, our focus is on increasing our service programming (similar to our Know Your Rights sessions that have been held with David Eby) and creating better internal processes.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to email us at support@studentlegal.org.",1477958644

"SeattleWA","t5_2vbli","What are you basing your argument on? Because the evidence in favor of carbon taxes is pretty compelling, and I can share several sources with you. For one, it's [textbook economics](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ101/herriges/Lectures10/Chapter%2017H%20-%20Externalities.pdf). If you increase the price of something, you will get less of it. If you're still confused on this point, you can check out [this useful Khan Academy tutorial, which explains the idea pretty well](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/consumer-producer-surplus/externalities-topic/v/taxes-for-factoring-in-negative-externalities). You can also check out economist [Ed Dolan's piece](http://www.economonitor.com/dolanecon/2013/07/08/why-progressives-should-love-a-carbon-tax-although-not-all-of-them-do/) explanation for why carbon taxes are effective. 

If you want a more detailed summary on the efficacy of carbon taxes, I'd check out [ch. 15 of the WGIII IPCC report](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf), which is even more briefly summarized on [p. 28 of the SPM](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf).

There's also [pretty wide agreement among economists who have studied climate change on carbon taxes](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf) (also true for [economists with expertise in resource economics](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.381.484&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) and [economists from all sectors](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220485.2014.889963)). To some extent, this idea has even made it into the [p](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2011/09/climate-policy) [o](http://www.pressdemocrat.com/opinion/editorials/4597101-181/pd-editorial-time-to-consider) [p](http://www.startribune.com/for-safety-s-sake-approve-keystone/289643371/) [u](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/06/28/196355493/economists-have-a-one-page-solution-to-climate-change) [l](http://host.madison.com/ct/opinion/editorial/editorial-carbon-fee-and-dividend-deserves-congress-consideration/article_a3b9a17a-6dd8-5e90-bc0c-28d12f046bc2.html) [a](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-09-14/there-s-a-simpler-way-to-fight-climate-change-california) [r](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/the-case-for-a-carbon-tax.html?_r=0) [media](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate).  

Just as important, some economists have argued [we can't solve climate change without a tax on carbon](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224). The big question is whether we can get the price [high enough, fast enough, to stay below 2ºC](http://www.nature.com/news/natural-gas-stands-to-get-a-boost-from-carbon-tax-1.17705) (or 1.5ºC, which is the first goal). To that end, we need carbon pricing sooner rather than later, and that's why people like [James Hansen](http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/washington-can-lead-on-climate-change-by-passing-i-732/) and [several other scientists](http://www.yesmagazine.org/nation2019s-first-carbon-tax-is-what-our-climate-moment-demands-20161029) are supporting I-732 specifically, and [carbon taxes more generally](http://bush.tamu.edu/istpp/scholarship/journals/ClimateScientistsPerspectives_ClimaticChange.pdf).

- As previously stated do not be stingy with Recall, use it as soon as you find yourself in danger, 150 hp always shreds faster than you expect.

- Focusing healers will distract them, and likely distract other members of their team, however it does make you a priority and can put yourself in danger very quickly.

- Practice using your blinks in abnormal ways that can often trick the enemy team, such as dashing through a tank to trip them up, etc.

- Never be scared to solo ult someone, it charges extremely fast and very rarely will you get big plays with it on your own. 

- Aim for the head whenever you can, it does massive damage.

- I personally find it easy to deal with Tanks, especially Reinhardt and D.va, but take caution when dealing with Winston and Roadhog. 

- I know I told you not to be stingy with your recall, but make sure you still use it wisely, like for a really quick reposition. (in a scenario in which 2-3 blinks cannot save you)

That's all I can think of off the top of my head, if you have any specific questions feel free to ask.

* Apart from Ubar parties and student group events, there's not much social life like that of the other Sydney unis

* The teaching staff are generally pretty helpful when it comes to understanding the content

* Content-wise (I'm assuming you're starting a bachelor's next year - correct me if I'm wrong), the majority of it is theory-based. 

* First year more or less introduces a number of psych fields and some background theories. Pretty content-heavy at times, but there's some interesting studies discussed. The good thing is that you only need to do one introductory psych unit each semester that year, so enjoy those random electives while you can

* Second year (which I'm about to finish) is fairly more intense.  There's a stats unit in sem 2, but again, there's some interesting content.

EDIT: Realised I haven't included stuff about later years - probably because I haven't gotten there yet but here's what I do know:

* Third year: there's a work placement (PACE) unit.

* Honours: you need to have, IIRC, a final grade of 70 across all psych units, and 75 across all 300 level psych units to get in. 

* Postgrad: 99% sure there's a clinical psych program at MQ. Haven't heard much about it but",1477958648

Also, I'm sure you have seen the statistics by now, that show that 9/10ths of the migrants are not Syrians fleeing from a warzone, and that is simply a guilt argument.

There are so many more problems than just ""anti-immigration folks across Europe are making reasonable, rapid relocation solutions politically difficult"". The political handling of the crisis is certainly the worst aspect, with the police selectively ignoring migrant crimes and arresting people who spoke out against migration. The same thing happened in Sweden for *years* before the crisis.

What I believe UKIP supports, even though I won't be voting for them, is to copy the Australian system. This is outside of the discussion of the crisis by the way.

Also, I like how you instantly attribute the reasons people dislike massive immigration, relocation and cultural integration policies as simply being racist. That's fucking dishonest, mate.

I also like how you bring up how republicans are blocking change in major problems. I'm going to assume you think the democrats will do anything to change this. Bernie tried, but the DNC fucked him, because he wasn't in their pocket like Hillary is.

Victarion is extremely good at a few things and is very aware of what he is good at; I'm sure if he had his way, he'd be perfectly happy to spend his days reaving for Balon. He's loyal to a fault (hence going along with Balon's revolt), superstitious, and a little dim, but that's not the same as Cersei, who constantly finds new ways to get in over her head/rip the carpet from under herself. 

I'd say the one potentially stupid thing he may be doing is attempting to rebel against Euron, but there are many fairly decent reasons for this (he has no idea how powerful Euron is, thinks that Euron holding power is an affront to the Drowned God, and above all, he absolutely fucking hates Euron, possibly more than any character hates any other character in the series)... plus (at least given what he knows of Danerys), he has every reason to believe it might actually work.",1477958651

But I'm still pleased to release a chapter today, namely, the new opening chapter I've been meaning to write for a while. There are still some decisions in this chapter that I'm fairly shaky about, and it was quite rushed, though, so feedback is appreciated. Let me know how you feel this serves as introduction, regardless of whether you're a returning or first-time reader; although I think it's definitely more engaging than the previous beginning, there's definitely still room for improvement. Also, please tell me if the formatting seems (unintentionally) off on your device. Further updates to come, some day. Thanks for reading, as always!

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Happy Halloween! Here's what I completed this month-

* **The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins** - The sub's Goodreads BotM. I continue to fail at participating in read along discussions, but I'm so glad I picked this up. Read it in one go on a day I had off. 	What an insane, gripping, imaginative, and weirdly funny book. It was so creepy in the beginning that I was questioning all the reviews that insisted this was a humorous tale. But the non supernatural POV's are quite funny, although admittedly a few of my giggles were a result of nervous laughter. A couldn't put it down type of book, and a perfect way to begin the October spooky reads. 5 stars. I'll use it for the Dark Fantasy slot.

* **Sorcery and Cecelia or The Enchanted Chocolate Pot by Patricia C. Wrede and Caroline Stevermer** -Read it on the same day alongside Library at Mount Char, and it was the perfect balance.An adorable, fun read. Sorcery and Cecelia is a book that takes place in a regency era where magic and wizards exist, and is in the format of two friends writing letters to each other - Kate is in London for the season, and Cecelia is in the country at their hometown. Lots of shenanigans and magical misadventures ensue. I enjoyed this quite a bit, and hope it is a sign that I should try more regency comedy, something I couldn't really get when I was younger. This book also reminds me a lot of Howl's Moving Castle, probably because I read it recently. 4 stars, to be used for a novel written by two or more authors slot.

* **Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo** - Highly anticipated sequel! I really loved this. Often you have to brace yourself for sequels, especially in duology's. because the magic of the first book might not be repeated. No such problem here - problematic magical teen criminals, cons, interpersonal relationships and banter, character growth, revenge, twists - everything I hoped for, Crooked Kingdom had it, including a number of quotable lines. The one sour note was a plot decision towards the end that I just couldn't agree with, and that's what resulted in 4 stars instead of 5. But what a ride. An excellent YA fantasy story.

* **The Hammer of Thor by Rick Riordan**-The usual lighthearted, mythology fueled, enjoyable lighthearted read.
That said, I really appreciate the diversity Rick Riordan is bringing in these books in terms of race/religion/gender/sexuality. The popularity of his series will assure that a lot more kids and adults are introduced to these, and its a bracing thought. 4 stars.

* **The Creeping Shadow by Jonathan Stroud**- 	Another solid entry in this excellent series. We now come around to the central plot that's been hinted at through these books, so this one's not as scary as the previous, but gripping nevertheless. I love these characters, the dialogue and humor is perfect, and honestly I wish I had more. 4 stars. If you're looking for an excellent spooky YA/Middle Grade series, this is it.

* **All the Birds in the Sky by Charlie Jane Anders**-Ugh this book was such a painful read. The things that happen to the protagonists as children and adults and the terrible people in their lives, (sometimes they themselves) made it a stomach clenching read for me. What makes it sad is, in the end I thought all that unpleasantness was unnecessary, unlike The Magicians, where it was way too close to what unpleasantness you can wreak on yourself in real life. Also, there are a bunch of things that annoyed me with how stupid they were. Honestly the only thing that made this worthwhile to me, and the reason it gets three stars, is Peregrine. Used for the protagonist that flies slot.

* **Hyperion by Dan Simmons** - I want to catch up on sci fi classics, and Hyperion also works as a creepy read for October. It was, simply put, amazing. 5 stars, and I need the sequel.


Great reading month, hope school isn't too crazy in November. There's so much great stuff to read out there.

"beermoney","t5_2s5or","You're still halfway misunderstanding me, lol. Let me break this down as much as I can.

1. Multiple websites like ebates and retailmenot have referral links to get cash back. You get **one** of these websites. So, you can use a single website with a referral link.

2. Many credit cards give you cash back for using the card. For example, my chase card gives me like 1.5% cash back whenever I buy anything anywhere. I also got a few hundred back when I spent $500 within the first few months. Many cards have sign up bonuses, so if you're planning to spend a lot - it's a good option.

3. Some **manufacturers** give rebates for buying their item. For example, say Company X says ""go buy my item at staples and mail me the receipt and I'll give you $30 cash back"". These aren't incredibly common, but they do happen for some purchases.

These three things **can** be used together. I can use ebates and get whatever percent back, pay for it with my chase card and get 1.5% cash back, and then submit my receipt to company x for a rebate. These things can be used together.

However, you still cannot use multiple website referral links. So, you cannot use ebates and retailmenot at the same time.",1477958652

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","Nah, I beat Origins once already when it first came out, but never got more than halfway through Awakening and never played Golems or Witch Hunt.

The sad thing is that I know it's not solely the mods because, even vanilla, the game crashes a ton in Denerim.

Mods Off the Top of My Head:

- Dragon Age Redesigned

- Improved Atmosphere(Buggy, but I consider it near essential personally with how ugly I find the base game to be...even back when it came out)

- Two-Spec Sten

- MADD Gift Guide

- Respec Mod (Essential, personally)

- Grey Warden Armor of Fereldan

- Combat Overhaul(Nearly Essential)

- Enhanced Shapeshifting(Still a useless Spec tree, but not *as* useless)

- Pretty much all the major character creation mods.  Vibrant, Pineappletree, Bella, etc(Cause I like making pretty, pretty characters)

- At least one of the Dialogue fixes, but I can't quite remember which ones.

- Whatever compatibility/secondary mods that are required to make most of these play nice with each other.

There's a few more, but I can't remember.",1477958655

**GSW gives** : Varejao, 2019 first round pick (lottery protected)

**Brooklyn Gives** : Chris McCullough

Looks like he isn't really in the plans for their future (only played 4 minutes of one game this season), so I would think that what most people would see to be an extremely late 1st round pick is enough compensation. Andy V is just to match salary.

Next trade is for Cleveland to also acquire some front court help. They really only have 3 rotation players who are nominal PFs/Cs, two of which are much better at Centre (Frye and Thompson).

**Cleveland Gives** : $4,803,750 Trade exception (acquired from the Dellavedova sign and trade), Mo Williams, 2019 second round draft pick from L.A. Lakers or Minnesota (less favourable), 2017 first round pick.

**Charlotte Gives**: Cody Zeller

I don't know why, but it seems like Zeller isn't thought of very highly in Charlotte, considering they couldn't agree on an extension and he has been benched in favour of Roy Hibbert and is playing less than 20 mpg. They recoup a small exception they can use in another trade, and a first and second round pick. Not bad return on someone they don't think is part of their future and who they may lose for nothing in RFA this offseason.

Finally, another trade involving Charlotte. They really need help on the wing since Jeremy Lamb hasn't been able to carve out meaningful minutes and they lost both Lin and Lee.

**Charlotte gives** : Spencer Hawes, 2017 first round pick (top 10 protected)

**Denver Gives** : Willson Chandler, 2018 second round pick

Denver's SG/SF rotation is already crowded, and with Harris' status downgraded to day-to-day they need to find minutes for him once he gets back. It was either Barton or Wilson, and Barton has started off playing extremely well so I doubt they would want to move him. Plus in interviews Malone seems to really like him. They pick up an extra big off the bench, which is useful considering Jokic isn't used to playing big minutes and Nurkic is coming off an injured year. Plus a first round pick. 
Charlotte picks up a very good two-way wing player for their bench unit. And a crunch time line-up of Kemba/Batum/Chandler/MKG/Zeller looks dangerous offensively with shooting and plenty of creation, and very switch/ defensively versatile.",1477958660

well valve rewrote the ENTIRE engine of dota2, created a complete game-editor able to provide the tools to mod the game in EVERY aspect supporting it fully in the game...

Birth Death Movies claims, for example, that it was the Creative Committee’s notes that caused Marvel’s highly publicized rift with director Edgar Wright.

I've been in your situation before; I wanted to break into modern without breaking the bank. No matter how many decks I built on a budget and no matter how much I upgraded them, it always felt like I wasn't even playing the same game as other people who were playing some of the better decks. During that time I learned two things:

1) There is a difference between playing a format and actually *playing* a format. No matter how much money I spent on budget decks, it never felt like I was even playing the same game as other people who were playing better/more established decks. None of the information I read in primers was relevant to me because nobody played the decks I did and nobody played the cards I had to resort to use.

2) If I had saved the $400 I spent on budget decks, I could have just bought a Burn/Infect/Merfolk deck and been in a much better and more satisfying position.

When someone says that they want to build a deck for Modern it's fair to assume that we need to take the whole metagame into consideration when thinking of suggestions, from the worst decks to the best decks. Unless you specifically tell people that you only intend to play with other people who are using budget decks, they will assume you are trying to build a generally decent deck.

People are also looking out for you as well. When someone says something like, 'this will never be competitive' or, 'you can't play this without X card', that's not a personal attack against you. They're just being realistic and giving you a heads up in case the deck doesn't end up performing as well as you hoped it would and therefore will feel like a waste of money.",1477958670

It wasn't even light out yet, and I'm sure it was another young journalist, a reporter to grab a headline sensation.  Perhaps a video documentary maker, a photographer trying to get the last magicks of the world recorded.  


""Hello?""


It was a small voice, high pitched, something out of a cartoon almost.  


""I need help. Please.""


I opened my eyes. It was a child.  Sitting myself up, I didn't dare move. Mumbling a few words, *krompi lrer*, my vision grew blurry, transforming into a mirror of the outside.  A bright contrast to my sleep my vision looked down at my cottage from a crow's nest, stealing the eyes of another.  


Looking down, a small boy with rustled hair and mud caked on his cheeks stood holding a toy. It looked to be plastic, the boy not yet a man but old enough to go through the rites.  As he knocked, my vision blurred.  My concentration broken, I shook my head out of the crow's mind, finally answering.


""There's nothing I can do to help you.""  My voice boomed throughout the cottage, giving way for a tense silence.


""I want to go home. Please!""  The hinges felt a pummelling, the boy's fist hitting the wood harder now.


""Go away! There's a gas station ten miles down the road. Away from here!""  Looking around, I quickly donned a thick winter robe and found my walking stick.  My joints ached as the winds swept through my bones.  Hearing quiet sobs, I reminded myself to whip more ointment. But the sobs were not my own.


Listening just outside the door, the boy was sitting down, clutching at his toy.   ""I just want to go home.."" he kept repeating.


I could see the gentle breathe of the boy.  His pale skin.  His face was covered in dirt, dried mud, his hair filled with leaves, twigs and filth.  Through the cracks of the door, his pants were wet around the crouch, his stench permeating his surroundings.  


Opening the door, the boy's full condition was revealed. As he looked up, his legs were covered in blood, his shoes glossy with a dark red stain.  ""What happened to you child?""


""I want to go home. Please help.""


In his front pockets I spotted a torn piece of parchment.  Bending down, I pointed slowly, my knees slowly giving into pain. ""What is that from child?""


""I found a book in the woods. Mama said don't touch it. On the front it said *hren-krompir*.""


I felt a flash of pain everywhere, my eyes suddenly holding back an immense pressure. ""The word of the Old.""

"aquaponics","t5_2rioe","Here's what I've learned from trying to manage both pH and KH in a way that keeps your fish alive. A lot of it was gathered from this page: http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/KH

* You need to keep your KH above four degrees KH (dKH). That's 4 drops of test solution when using the API test kit. It translates to a ppm amount, but I don't remember the conversion. If you go below this, your pH will fluctuate, which stresses your fish, and then they die. Ask me how I know ;)
* KH and pH vary depending on the buffer you're using. Calcium carbonate, for example, will stick your pH at 8+. Thus, you can't lower the pH much below 8 without removing all the calcium carbonate from the system. Potassium carbonate doesn't affect pH, and potassium bicarbonate raises it slightly. All of these will increase your KH.
* Tap water is usually at 8+ pH, and you'll want to kill that buffer with acid and replace with another one before topping up your system if your system's pH runs high.
* As your KH lowers naturally to around 4, you want to use buffers that keep it high without changing pH much, like potassium carbonate or potassium bicarbonate

There's a lot of trial and error involved here. Measure KH/pH, add buffer, measure KH/pH again, see what happened. Just do it slowly and don't kill your fish!",1477958671

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Which is exactly what people are doing, wasting an awful amount of time, resources, and interoperability.

Yes to gain the ability to use their own license terms. That's how this works.

Also these people are ""wasting"" their time and resources to gain an advantage in the market, not for the greater good or anything. They do it for money and if so they have to make their own shit, easy as that.

&gt; You don't seem to understand that the reason why we move forward is because we can be interoperable and reuse other's people code without fuss.

""without fuss"" means here using open source code without giving anything back. And if the license says ""no"" that's your problem. You only want to take and that is okay as long as the ones who made that library are okay with it. If not it is the same as proprietary software = you can't use it.

Also I'm not sure who ""we"" is in the ""move forward""? You? Your company? Science? Moving forward = bigger market share?

&gt; Because if I develop code that costs 150000 dollars a license, I certainly don't release it under GPL. Plus, other components may want to be encrypted, or have licenses that are incompatible.

So you want to tell me you develop software with a license price of 150k $$$ earning you or your company a shitload of money?

But oh my good this nice GPL library that would save me 100 hours of work and would gain me an enormous market share isn't free and I can't do whatever I want with it in my proprietary software that I want to sell , what a cruel cruel world ..............

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","I consider ""flashy"" in this instance to have a very high ratio of  spectacle to perceived substance. *Hulk* had minimal content and was mostly all about CGI action scenes. *Billy Lyn's Long Halftime Walk* looks to be a similar sort of pandering blockbuster from the plot description and poster. *Life of Pi* comes off as a blockbuster because all the CGI work (phenomenal as it was) made it feel bloated, and its message didn't sit well with either religious or nonreligious people (because religious people didn't get it and nonreligious people didn't agree with it). 

*Tree of Life* is surprisingly similar to *Life of Pi*, but I believe it diverges on several crucial points that change the public's perception of it.

* 1) It is vague and ""esoteric"" where *Pi* is decisive. Even though the themes of *Tree of Life* are pretty clear once pieced together, the deliberate discontinuity and obfuscation creates an atmosphere of mysticism, which resonates much more with audiences than the grand dogmatic proclamation at the end of the *Pi*. People like to have room to feign agreement on a deeper level; remove that and speak with certainty and they feel like they're being talked down or preached to.

* 2) The message itself is more populist than *Pi*'s. *Tree of Life* argues very esoteric but convenient things like the dualistic forces of ""grace/nature"" and some sort of environmental ancestry we can all connect to. Those are very noncontroversial and pleasant ideas (and imo somewhere between grossly oversimplified and flat-out wrong). *Pi*, on the other hand, is not only stating that religion is a fiction, but that the fiction is preferable to the truth. The former claim offends religious viewers, and the latter claim offends rationalist viewers. Even I can't fully say I like the theme, because my interpretation (that Pi serves as an existentialist metaphor for the willful ignorance of religion) is directly at odds with the author's interpretation, as he himself is very religious.

* 3) Gorgeous practical effects and cinematography feel realer and more defensible as ""art."" Even the best CGI still feels manufactured, plebian, and needlessly expensive to many cinemaphiles. *Pi* was the cutting edge of CGI animation, but it didn't really transcend the medium. *Tree of Life* set out to be more than great CGI, some of the best eye porn of the century, and it succeeded. Not to mention on a much lower budget.

So combining these, *Tree of Life* is objectively more pleasing and constructed loosely enough to facilitate its themes of ""grandeur,"" while even Lee's most ambitious film is mostly confined to what is expressly portrayed on film. And in this case the obvious happens to be unattractive to most viewers.

But, going back to ""flashy,"" it seems to be the best reason I can think of for *why* Lee isn't as popular, and seems to contribute to the deeper reason that I also think he's just an inconsistent director. His character pieces aren't as tightly scripted as P.T. Anderson or the Coen Bros., his action films aren't as strongly stylized and plotted as Tarantino or Nolan, and he doesn't have a real cinematic ""identity"" like W. Anderson. The difference is that Tarantino and Nolan are *always* flashy; they own it and they appropriately pair spectacle to the substance (generally). I believe switching back between arthouse and big budget, Asian and American, has prevented Lee from developing a consistent reputation as a filmmaker and becoming the best at a particular genre. As it stands, for every film *except* Crouching Tiger, I can think of several directors who did substantially the same genre but better. And it seems like his opportunities are becoming more limited, since every new genre he tries hinders his attractiveness as a director for other genres.",1477958674

One time (actually... waaay more than just one time now that I think about it), I was in a bar talking politics and some dude started talking about how there should be a rule where people have to write a short essay explaining why they are voting a certain way. I see the purposed testing scenario as very similar, here are my issues with a general competency test, or ""voter certificate"" test: 

1) Who grades the papers? Who writes the questions? Who is responsible for this process? It seems like something that can easily be taken advantage of, and I am definitely not comfortable with that. 

2) It reeks of elitism. My 48 year old father voted for the first time in his entire life a few days ago. I can assure you, than he probably cannot go into details about how a bill becomes a law. He educated himself on his choices the best that he could, and I think that's good enough. Requiring some sort of test isn't fair to people (like himself) who work basically all day. Not everybody has access to a solid education, and yes, ideally we want a radically informed citizenry, but this is not feasible. They'd have to set aside time to go to their testing facility, study for it, and pass. This is not fair, and quite frankly it's undemocratic in and of itself.

3) Comparing voting and motor vehicle licenses is a false equivalency. (Not to be rude, but it makes me call in to question the OP's grasp on how a democracy works). Driving a car and having a drivers license is a privilege, it is not a right. Voting on the other hand *is a right*. I wonder if the OP is aware that they are proposing a reduction of rights? As I said earlier, it's inherently undemocratic. 

I am completely for beefing up civics education in our school, and I do worry about how voters are easily duped. However, by having a test or exam serve as a gatekeeper will ultimately dissuade people from becoming involved in the democratic process, and they will probably end up being dissuaded from educating themselves on it. Overall I think we should be focused on how to make voting more easily accessible, not more difficult.  ",1477958676

And this might be a bad example just because it's about transguys, but like [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/5ae069/trans_men_what_is_your_sexual_orientation/) is exclusive, but in the text part, OP gives a reason: we see a lot about mtf sexuality, but it doesn't come up as often about ftm (by virtue, likely, of there being more mtf folk here, and ones who share their sexuality). Not only that, but mtf and ftm sexuality isn't strictly speaking a transgender issue. If it was something like ""trans guys how did it feel the first time you were correctly gendered"", that would be wrong because how is being a transguy and gendered correctly any different to being a transgirl and gendered correctly?

[edit: (wow doin that a lot) you know I absolutely don't mind seeing mtf-only posts. some things only affect mtf people, just like some things only affect ftm people. it's when the post is *unnecessarily* exclusive. it could be exclusive by omitting mentioning a group, or exclusive by only mentioning one specific group. but it takes so much more effort to do that. why not just... include everyone?)",1477958681

Firstly it can be pretty costly to invest in a new product to test if its making your problems better but secondly I'm just scared I can make things worse. I understand one must patch test, but after 1-2 weeks you decide to slather it all over, it can cause issues on your face that you didn't try etc.

like I wanna try this new moisturiser but then I found out it has Algin which on CosDNA says is a 4 &amp; 4 in Acne and Irritant.

I have no idea if this will effect me but how can I just look past that rating and take the plunge? 

Can anyone offer me some words of sympathy/consolation ?

I'm hesitant because everything seems so easy, and I don't have a lab environment. I have a pretty small office, so it's not a huge risk, but I'm wondering...

I have 20 users running Win10 in my HQ all joined to on-prem AD server (2012 standard). Those users also are O365 E3 users. Obviously they have two passwords for each.

Is it as easy as following these steps, users then log on to their machine with the same on-prem password they used before? Then Outlook logs them in, and the password for OWA(O365) is now the same on-prem password?

I'm a little leery about just turning this on.

Alot of her plans sound great on the surface, but most are incredibly idealistic and don't go into how she plans to accomplish the impossible in most cases.

Prime example is her idea that you can wave a magic wand and make all student loans vanish. If your research it in the slightest, you realize she has no idea what she's talking about.


She's also weak whenever she's approached by people with fairly insane ideas or opinions. Her stance goes from ""no i don't believe in these things"" to ""ok maybe there's something there, I think we need more information"". Normally that's great, but we're talking about the wifi, vaccines, and 9/11 conspiracies.

"GaryJohnson","t5_2rxc8","I just think it's interesting that Gary Johnson takes a lot of heat for Aleppo (granted, inexcusable for someone running for POTUS) and for not being able to name a world leader (that he admires.)  

That's it.   When people in my office talk about him, it's ""oh that guy's so dumb - he can't name a world leader and didn't know what Aleppo was!""  (Again, it was name a world leader *that you admire* but I digress.)

Trump has said some of the most vile things a person can say and he gets celebrated for his honesty.  He still has yet to lay out any type of coherent plan for how any of his batshit ideas will actually happen, and still throws temper tantrums on Twitter when someone hurts his feelings.  

Clinton is under criminal investigation for, among other things, **treason.**  She has been recorded suggesting using a drone to murder Assange.  She bullied and harassed women who were sexually assaulted **by her own husband** while at the same time championing ""women's rights"".  And that is just the tip of a big fuckin iceberg.  And, like Trump, she doesn't really have any type of coherent plan or strategy for how she will make even 5% of her campaign promises a reality.  Even if you buy the Clinton camp's story about the whole email scandal and give her the benefit of the doubt, then it means, **by her own admission,** that she was literally too stupid to understand what classified means.  AND YOU WANT HER RUNNING THE WHOLE FUCKING SHOW?!  

THIS is America now. A successful 2 term governor, who leads the polls among active military and veterans, is in second among likely voters under 35, and *isn't currently being accused of or investigated for a crime,* is laughed off as a joke either because he's ""unelectable"" or because of *one* error and another minor error that gets repeated as gospel even though it wasn't really an error and the question was ""name a world leader you admire"".  And, days later, Gary said that even after some thoughtful consideration (something sorely lacking in today's political arena) he still really couldn't come up with a world leader that he admires.  It's not because he's ""stupid"" or because he doesn't know world leaders, it's because he's a libertarian.  There aren't any major libertarian world leaders.  Most of today's world leaders are corrupt pieces of shit or beleive in a system of government that Gary (and most libertarians) disagree with on a fundamental level.  

It's like asking a classical jazz cellist to name the U2 album he admires the most and being shocked when he can't.  Sure he *knows* U2.  He could probably immediately rattle off 6 or 7 album names.  Shit; *everyone* owns a U2 album or two, at least from the days of Columbia House and BMG, but that doesn't mean he admires any of them because, although most of them might look good, after listening to them you realize that they're nothing but pretentious puddles of shit. 

And then the public has the audacity to shame the pianist.  How dare he not know any U2 albums!  What an idiot!  I can name my favorite three right now off the top of my head, ""War"" ""Joshua Tree"" and ""Pop""!  Fuck this guy, he's not smart enough to be *my* musician.  

Your musician is a fucking war-hungry sociopath with enough ego for all 7 billion of us.

I think you're thinking of the Veolia ISDS case against Egypt, which was represented as Veolia suing for 'lost profits' when Egypt raised the minimum wage. 

But Veolia had a contract with the Cairo city government to run two experimental waste-heat plants at cost, and the contract pointed out that the costs would go up if the minimum wage was raised, so Veolia's charges for running the plants would go up. The Egyptian government raised the minimum wage but refused to pay Veolia's resulting extra costs as agreed.

Yeah yeah good and evil, right and wrong are always subjective.

However I think we can agree as a basis of human objectivity, imposing your opinions on others is bad.  Me saying your wrong was applying to that foundation.  Yeah Its a bit hypocritical, but I think you probably see what I'm saying here.

I love and respect that you have an opinion and I'm not saying what you like is wrong or how you think.  What I'm saying is.  YOU telling ME I'm wrong because of what I accept/criticize in art is nonsense.  That may not have been your initial sentiment, but like with art, after you put something out there.  It's open to interpretation.

Better understanding the usual time table for turn around would help me draw an end line to the immediate push.

Most of the time with those episodes it feels like the balance is wrong, and that the things they are referencing are so new to them that they don't have enough of a grasp on them to properly find the comedy. They do of course get most aspects of social commentary down pretty well most of the time, Washington redskins was a particular favourite of mine, but I've felt like they've missed the mark a lot more frequently in recent years.",1477958700

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; In June, the former Western intelligence officer—who spent almost two decades on Russian intelligence matters and who now works with a US firm that gathers information on Russia for corporate clients—was assigned the task of researching Trump's dealings in Russia and elsewhere, according to the former spy and his associates in this American firm. This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project's financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) ""It started off as a fairly general inquiry,"" says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, ""there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit.""

We had to use Chux because the Pt was responsible for dressing costs, and refused a Vac dressing because the pump hindered his movement.

It was disgusting not only because of the nature of the wound, but also because of the way we had to deal with it, and while I'm all for a Pt's rights to decide how they are cared for, I could not understand why he would refuse a Vac that he wouldn't have had to pay for, simply because the small pump would have ruined the line of his shirt.

*edit* DOWNVOATS? REALLY REDDIT?!

*Edit2* Why do you downvote? Are you really that sad of a person that you have little fits of spite and have to reach out through a medium that has nothing to do with validity? You do realize karma is worthless right? And that downvoting a comment doesn't do anything to the legitimacy of what's in the post right? Or do you just ignore all of that because you're butthut and have to lash out like a baby in need of a circumcision? I mean seriously! You can't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button? Do you feel like you've had vengeance on me or something? I personally don't care about downvotes either way (by all means, call your silly downvote brigade on me, it means nothing at all to me), but I just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points. Reddit really is all you have, huh? Damn do I feel bad for you. But you know what? I don’t care! I’ll rake in the coal! You’re logic is flawed, kiddo. Don't like what people are doing with it? Downvote me, that'll show 'em! Go ahead and press that down arrow, I know you're itching to do it. Think you're contributing to the community? ""Doing your civic duty""? Nope. You're just decreasing a meaningless number on the internet. You just want to hop on the bandwagon. Well POUNCE! O can hear you as your feet land on the cold real steel of the inside of the wagon. You know what? Enjoy the ride, for now. Maybe even stick your head out the window and feel the breeze while you reflect on the importance of your downvote to me. I'll even give you my word, this isn't even my primary account, kiddo. Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that we allow free speech and the truth to be shared. I don’t care about the karma. Hell, I’ll gladly rake in the coal! But we must remember that free speech and opinions are key to our society and, more importantly, reddit.

"badeconomics","t5_2wbw4","Utility functions have as their domain a binary preference relation.  To that end, utility has no cardinal meaning.  Utility only matters inasmuch as it is a way of comparing bundles.  Here's a technical explanation:

#A Brief Note on Ordinal Utility

We say that if preferences are complete, transitive, continuous, and locally non-satiated then they can be represented by a utility function.  Those are the necessary and sufficient conditions.

Let *X* be the consumption set containing all possible vectors (consumption bundles) available to a consumer.

Let x^0, x^1 , x^2 ∈ *X*.

**1.)  Completeness**

∀ x^0 , x^1 ∈ *X*, either x^0 ⪯ x^1 or x^1 ⪯ x^0

This means for every bundle in the set of all possible bundles, either x^1 is at least as good as x^0 or x^0 is at least as good as x^1.  This basically means that I can form an opinion between any two choices.

**2.)  Transitivity**

∀ x^0 ,x^1 ,x^3 ∈ *X*, if x^0 ⪯ x^1 and x^1 ⪯ x^2, then x^0 ⪯ x^2

This means that rankings are preferred across bundles.  If I prefer one steak and two potatoes better than one steak and one steak and one potato.  And if I prefer one steak and one potato better than one steak and one chocolate bar, then I prefer one steak and two potatoes better than one steak and one chocolate bar.

**3.) Continuity**

There are many definitions of continuity, so if you want the technical one, I'm happy to provide it.  Otherwise, here is the non-technical one:

the ⪯(x) set and the ⪰(x) are closed.  This is a mainly technical assumption that just happens to hold in almost all cases (except in the bizarre case of lexicographic preferences, etc).  This is basically saying that as you move from the ""better than"" to the ""worse than"" set in *X*, you will cross the ""indifferent to"" set, which is the intersection of the ""no worse than"" and ""no better than"" set, and as such, is itself a closed set.

**4.)  Local non-satiation**

For every x ∈ *X* and for every ε&gt;0, there exists some x^0 in an ε-neighborhood of x, such that x^0 ⪰x.

This means that no matter where I am in X, there's always some more-preferred consumption bundle.  This rules out ""fat"" zones of indifference or oddly-defined ""bliss points.""

**The Function**

I really don't want to go into the proof because it's long, but the gist of it is this: there exists a utility function u(x) such that for all x^1 , x^2 ∈ *X*,   u(x^1 ) ≥  u(x^2 ) if and only if  x^1 ⪰ x^2.

That's it.  Note that ***the real-valued ""utils"" don't matter--the only thing that matters is the ranking***.

That's why it's important to not forget that the domain of a utility function isn't the real line, but rather a binary preference relation, so ordinality is preserved.",1477958711

Just because they're casual players doesn't mean they're bad deck builders, they just force themselves to use more creative cards than what the pros are playing.

One thing that a lot of people don't understand is that it's hard to be right in Magic. There are so many variables and most people are awful at card evaluation and considering all the possible interactions out there, not to mention not having an understanding of your meta. People don't want to take risks and end up being wrong, so it's safe to recommend a card that a pro is playing in a similar deck. Others have mentioned that competitive magic is cutthroat and playing a sub optimal card costs you points when your goal is to win, but something to consider is that we may not have enough information, or knowledge ourselves to give you the help you're looking for.",1477958712

"cars","t5_2qhl2","&gt;I think its fair to compare Lexus and Acura because they're fighting for similar customers. 

I don't agree with this. They're not fighting for the same customer. The Lexus buyer probably makes more money and values a nicer customer service experience. This is reflected in the price tags. The NX costs much more than the RDX. The IS costs much more than the TLX, etc. The MDX doesn't have a direct competitor yet (The 3 row RX is coming.)

The Lexus buyer is probably cross-shopping Mercedes, BMW, and Audi, whereas the Acura buyer probably isn't because their cars are sold for less than the Germans/Lexus. 

&gt;Acura/Honda took the easy way out and are now trapped in a cycle where the Accord so good it doesn't make sense to a lot of people to pay the premium for the Acura variant.

This is an issue across their entire line. The Honda cars are probably just as good or even better than their Acura models for a less money. ILX vs Civic, RDX vs new CRV, Accord Touring vs TLX, MDX vs Pilot

&gt;I think they'll continue to languish living off the MDX until it too is uncompetitive.

The MDX is a great car, but I can't help but think that a Pilot Touring Elite is a better car for less money. It has all the same technology and is more practical. Not to mention, for ~$55-60k for a loaded MDX, the jump to a Volvo XC90 or Audi Q7 2.0T isn't that much more. There is a significant difference in quality between the MDX and an Audi Q7.

At its core, it's a high-stakes negotiating gamble. It ties California's hands, making it *illegal* for California to pay more than $x (whatever $x is); this allows California to hold out for that price while creating absolute certainty in the minds of the drug companies' negotiators that California's negotiator can't budge.

That's great in theory; the absolute certainty means that the drug companies know California isn't bluffing and increases their incentive to make a deal at California's asking price - because California's asking price is actually non-negotiable; the choices are 'make a deal at this price' or 'dont make a deal at all'.

This will work *if* the drug companies prefer a deal at that price to no deal at all, and will not work if the drug companies prefer no deal at all to a deal at that price.

So: how can we tell which it is? 

That's why this is a gamble. It's a legitimate negotiating tactic, and it's very helpful to achieving California's preferred price *if that preferred price is tolerable to our negotiating partners.* I don't know if it is. Do you?",1477958717

I am pretty sure the majority of women would oppose going back and living under such a system. They want ""freedom"" and ""liberation"" from male's control and domination. Although, I agree that such a system would be ideal for men, it is not ideal for women. Many women actually got abused under such a male guardianship system. Not all men are good guardians of their women.

What we need is a modern day solution because we can't reverse back to ""pre-sexual revolution"" without major fight between the sexes. I think if Asian men shame each other for letting their daughters and sisters to marry White. And shun the sell-out AFs, that would be a good start in reversing the trend.

after that it became more like 6 days of heavy-ish but tolerable bleeding with only 3-4 days of painful cramps.

post-undergrad, i don't even keep track. i keep tampons on hand, but usually i have 3 full weeks respite between cycles, and cycles themselves are 4-6 days with only maybe 2 being legitimately painful. it's terrific. i'm not even on the pill now.

when i was on the pill it was similar timewise but i had zero days of cramps as long as i followed the schedule rigorously.  i only got off the pill because of an insurance turnover taking longer than anticipated - i'll probably pick it back up as soon as i get to the gyno again.",1477958721

"RATS","t5_2qnh3","This is just a guess but was Camarattery your breeder? If so, she posts the recipe for her mix on her [website](http://www.camarattery.com/main-diet).

She claims; *""I prefer to use a grain diet. One made by a man with a degree in animal nutrition. My mix has a guaranteed analysis I do not know of any other mixes made by breeders that can say that.""* ...but she cites zero sources. Who is this man? What is his degree? What is this ""guaranteed analysis"" and what does that even mean? She also claims that feeding rats Harlan Teklad blocks (the food trusted by the medical and scientific communities in research facilities) can reduce rats' lifespans by 50%.

Also, it appears her diet calls for raw peanuts. Every [""forbidden food"" list](http://aboutpetrats.com/nutrition/dangerous-foods) that I've seen for rats cautions against raw peanuts.

I would have a hard time trusting this person and her rat diet. You could substitute the raw peanuts with roasted peanuts (unsalted) but, as you've been dealing with, grain mixes just encourage selective feeding, which means that your rats aren't getting all of the nutritional value of the mix.

I would recommend feeding your rats a staple diet (80%) of a quality lab block like [Oxbow](http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=6067+10381+11253+16965&amp;pcatid=16965) or [Harlan Teklad](http://www.theratshop.com/store/c3/Harlan_Teklad_USPS_flat_rate_with_DOMESTIC_Shipping.html) and supplement their diet (20%) with fresh food and extra grains.",1477958723

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You really just need to keep telling yourself that girls will not define your life.  The big problem that a lot of us guys have (myself sometimes included) is that we get so attached to a girl before even dating that if we get rejected then it feels like we just lost something.  Just try to get in the habit of talking to girls without the sole purpose of dating, and see how it feels.  Do things you enjoy, make good friends, and acknowledge all the great things in life besides relationships and sex, and all of this will both directly and indirectly help you.

Another thing to consider:  How many times have you been rejected?  For most guys who have self esteem issues and feel inadequate for dating, the number is often very small, or maybe even as low as 1 or 0.  It sucks, but for most people we will have to go through our fair share of rejection unless we are just super hot or super lucky (but even then, it happens to all of us).",1477958724

The placement of the bottles on top of the bar doesn't really make sense to me.

i never said anything about being overpaid and neither did you in your previous comment. both of us were talking about salaries of engineers compared to doctors. you now seem to be using 'overpaid' in the sense that engineers get paid more than they deserve. What one deserves is a very difficult question and in any case, no economy works according to the principle of deservedness.

&gt;For a person like you cardiologist is also a doctor and MBBS is also doctor.

we were talking in general terms. if i clubbed all medicine people, then you too clubbed all engineering people - a civil or textiles engineer's salary is no where close to a CS or electrical engineer's. in any case, general physicians too earn a lot of money in cities, though of course not as much as specialists.",1477958730
"buccaneers","t5_2rd5c","It's the consequences of impatient, knee-jerk coaching hires and a team that lacks direction.

Now I'll concede that both prior coaching regimes had to go.  And Raheem was promoted too fast (though I still think there's something there).  But sooner or later we need to commit, long-term, to a vision of what the Hell we want this team to be or we're going to just stay stuck in this quicksand.  Pittsburgh, for example, has never *not* had this, and that's why they're always a great team.  They never get the miracle high draft picks everyone loves to pretend change franchises, they never have to swap out coaches and GMs, nobody ever talks about stupid and nebulous crap like a ""winning culture.""

The Patriots always know what they need, because they're always building toward the same end goal.  They don't change direction every two years because they can't find the right guys to hire to begin with.

When we had McKay, we had that.  We always knew what we were doing then, even when it didn't work (Mike Shula).  And we were always worthwhile then.  

When we fired Dungy, we lucked out.  Gruden was the perfect guy for that specific moment.  But it also led our owners to believe that coaching changes are a little bit like Cinderella's fairy godmother.  When Gruden pushed Richie out, it was all over.  There's your winning culture, Coach Underwood.  Got replaced by Bruce Allen, and a bunch of directionless decisions.

We landed a franchise quarterback.  Awesome.  But it seems like the Bucs just decided ""well, we have a franchise QB, time to win now"" and that's never how football worked.  

I'm all for giving Coach Underwood time.  Dirk's new to head coaching and his prior experience was in college, and is therefore meaningless in all NFL contexts period.  He's going to need time to grow, and grow a pair of testes with which he can call more creative plays.  He's going to need time to realize ""that guy I used to work with that got fired because his defense gave away fourth quarter leads all the time"" isn't the world's best DC choice.

But we're never going to give it to him.  It's either 9-7 next year or welcome to the Hot Seat.

And that's where we started going wrong, and it's where we *keep* going wrong.",1477958730

If we get to the point where wars are waged by sending unmanned drones to bomb fully automated factories with automated defenses, then we will have functionally achieved world peace, even if we're simultaneously involved in an eternal war. It won't work if there are actual ideologies at stake though; people who believe in their cause don't fight fair. But it might be viable for one-sidedly ideological conflicts like those the US is fond of recently, simply because our enemies do not have the level of power to effectively dictate the terms of engagement. If we leave nothing but deathbots in the Middle East, then all they can attack are deathbots (alongside terrorist attacks within our own borders, but those are hilariously ineffective at actually killing people).",1477958730

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Hey u/Man-alive,
No no I love the feedback, and the criticism!! The input is so helpful, and as this is a learning curve, it can only help. You are teaching me!!

It would probably be over £100, but under £300 kinda of area...we really aren't there yet, this is more ironing out wrinkles!!

I know a lot of people that don't own expensive contractor-style push mowers.....but a surprising amount of other people do, and some of them have a lot of garden..and I guess we are targeting them more, this isn't a product would appeal to everyone, and it is good to get an idea of what everyone thinks. 
I was surprised to see that there are as many mowers that cost over £1,000, as there are movers below £300, like here http://www.irishmowers.com/petrol-lawnmowers.html 

We are also working a new concept into our system, based on circular economy, where each part is fully replaceable so we can try and get away from the wasteful throwaway culture. 

different mowers for different folks.

thanks for your time, your points have been noted and will be pondered   ! :)",1477958732
"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","that sucks dude, If you can look into freelance work, where you can work at your own pace. It will take some time to train yourself up tho, especially if you are ill. something like graphic design, programming, writing or something. anything. ",1477958732
"ShingekiNoKyojin","t5_2we2n","Thanks for the feedback!

1) I agree with the diagonal attacks being possible/useful, the upward/downward ones are trickier though due to how unusual it is to approach from above or below. I do want more diverse animations regardless, however.

2) Hmm, it shouldn't surge you forward, no extra force is applied when attacking, but it does automatically release the hooks and does the animation. I agree with you though that it's irritating that you can't change your mind after the attack is pressed, but I couldn't think of a quick programming solution to this. I will keep thinking of one though!

3) Yeah, it will not be similar to fengs. In fengs you can continue to accelerate, and you reach speeds that you simply cant reach in this game. You will never swing with more speed than you had going into it. You should be able to swing around (relatively) quickly though, and the angle you swing up or down at is dependent on the angle you enter the swing at. But yeah, the physics is not very similar to fengs so things like this end up feeling quite different compared to the tribute game.

4) Nice, I'm glad to hear that!

5) Yep I intend to improve them as I go. Also, I'm just not that great of an animator! :D

6) This is already a feature. Perhaps it is hard to notice because the trees are small, but the character will run up or along walls and jump off, and you can trigger the jump early by pressing the jump button. The sideways run is pretty lacking right now (needs new animations and better jump), but it is there.

I really appreciate the feedback, it helps me out a lot so thank you!",1477958732

"3d6","t5_2wkux","I'd only add that you *can* of course multiclass if there is some concept that is cool. But you have to be aware that it'd put you at a disadvantage in mechanical terms. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the GM needs to take your relative strenghts and weaknesses into account anyway when designing encounters. It's not like in a videogame RPG, where if you're underleveled, things get harder.

Do what feels right, but do so knowing the pros and cons.

Aside from that, read the above comment, adding to every ""don't"" ""never"" and ""shouldn't"" an ""... if you want to have a mechanical advantage"". Which isn't the be-all, end-all of everything.

My recommendation: Talk to your GM. If he's good, he'll likely warn you of possible negative consequences and if you're still set, encourage you to do it if it makes you like your character more. Because *that's* what it's all about in the end. Make cool concepts, like your character, have awesome adventures with him.9",1477958736

I love this idea. And it's a nice surprise to see people in /r/minimalism discussing this. Let me explain.

I define myself as someone that strives to simplify everything because my ultimate goal is quality. And I can only achieve quality if I stick to few things I know and I understand completely. That is, if I am a minimalist.

I never achieved software happiness in my desktop computer till I implemented a very simple setup where I have very few open-source applications (less things that can break and if they break I can look inside), all configured with dot files (thus reproducible) and mostly text-based (except browser and document viewer, so easy to compose-they do one thing and they do it well).

Next step is to move to a package manager like [Nix](https://nixos.org/) or [Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/) that allow complete reproducibility to avoid dependency issues and malware in binaries.

Mobiles are tricky. Most manufacturers won't give you drivers for their platform. Not even binary ones, apart from those for the kernel they choose. So once Linux kernel gets updated, your mobile can't be easily updated. That's what happens with most Android devices.

Furthermore, mobile radios are treacherous. They are closed and likely peek into your stuff when sent some commands. So as you pointed out, you need an isolated design like what [Neo900](http://neo900.org/) is slowly trying to achieve.

Probably Neo900 form factor is also the best route if you want to go with a pure Linux distribution. Also look into what [Pyra](https://pyra-handheld.com/boards/pages/pyra/) is doing. Both have QWERTY keyboards.

Also, IMHO Android is not something that should be discarded. With the [correct setup](https://guardianproject.info/2016/03/28/copperhead-guardian-project-and-f-droid-partner-to-build-open-verifiably-secure-mobile-ecosystem/) ([CopperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/) + [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) with [Guardian Project applications](https://guardianproject.info/) and others) it is a very good environment.

Possible, but Square hasn't said anything about the future of the game's servers, for better or worse.  Just no way to know.

&gt;Hm yeah, that much I expected, but I mean... in the series there have been a few levels in which you cannot be seen in the default suit because you're in such a hostile enviroment, every NPC would instantly turn hostile if they spot you.

&gt;But then there're also levels in which you can basically walk around casually in the default suit and everyone just treats you as a guest or civilian or tourist or whatever. (as long as you don't trespass or do shady stuff of course)

Lemme give you a super specific example.  In the first Paris mission, you have to infiltrate the secret auction upstairs.  If you find an invitation, you can just wear the suit and have access.  But if you wander into the security in the attic, they all know one another and it doesn't matter if you're wearing one of their suits, they'll shoot to kill.  I didn't find this version of the game any more or less limiting than Blood Money, and never felt like I was forced to play any specific way.

&gt;Would still be nice if the first episode was on sale now that the game is complete, to ""lure"" in and convince people like me who still sit on the fence.

I'd take the plunge, honestly.  Unless your strapped for cash or whatever, this is such a worth it expansion to the series.  The ""Intro pack"" which is the Prologue/tutorial levels (*two levels that are ICA ""recreations"" of a previous agent's hardest missions, including a yacht assassination with a party atmosphere and infiltrating a KGB experimental airstrip hanger with a ""hostile territory"" feel to it, both levels play like normal but as done in a big warehouse-style and you can tell the yacht and airstrip are made out of cheap plywood for training purposes, the game explains that it's populated by ICA agents playing parts to train you*) and also comes with the Paris level in it's entirety.  That costs 15 bucks, then you can buy the remaining season upgrade for 50 if you like it, ultimately, you waste five bucks if you like it and buy the entire thing though, which kind of sucks, but it gives you a chance to experience the first level with less on the line.",1477958739

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","THE UNIVERSE (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings.

From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable.

Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest.

To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities.

Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances.

...

These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to observe that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: In the vast Library there are no two identical books.

From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite).

Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.

We know of another superstition: that of the Man of the Book.

On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium of all the rest: some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist.

Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him?

Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity...

I bought the game after playing someone else's copy, and we played full game + the Dahlgaard's Gift expansion so was crazy complicated! I'd say jump right in with all the rules and see what the game truly has to offer: it'll be an insane ride. You can always play the base game if it's all too much.

With the base rules the only contention is over the locations, and you're only going to realistically get up to fame 16 stuff in the time frame. With the Dark Alley you've also got the problem of collecting the cards to be able to send your guys where you want them to be (you have fewer cards in the DA rules). Plus the fun of having to use your DA cards for their bonus action rather than special power when you end up on the crap spot at Downtown and don't have the actions to do anything other than reroll the dice, lol.

The expansion is well worth getting too: the power cards for the Trickerion shards are just crazy, plus the cards to improve the two player game are really great, especially the ones that randomise which spots are available. Plus you get another packet of shards: can never have too many!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think being in a relationship, or even dating, is abit different (in terms of happening) for guys then it is for girls. Putting yourself out there is different for guys and girls. As a girl putting yourself out there ushally means allowing you to be approached by men. Where as putting yourself out there as a guy means you have to approach women. Obviously that's not always the case, I've had girls strike up a flirty conversation with me (maybe once or twice...) and it's relieving when they do.

Every serious step forward taken comes with a question:

  Is she worth the risk?

The more interested you are in her, the more worthwhile she is to peruse.  However when you become more emotionally invested (ie she's more worth the risk) WHAT your risking becomes greater.

Sometimes us guys are single because the really big jumps we have to make, the riskiest questions, are just to risky. And yes, while that's all in our heads, honestly... what isn't in our heads? 

It's easy then move into the realm of shouldent, as excuses to remain single are a dime a dozen (I'm busy, I don't wanna commit, maybe someone I'm more attracted to will come along, I don't know where il be in 12 months...) from here we falter and ushally give up.

If it's clear that our interest likes us, and most guys can't tell that to save our lives,  then the risk becomes easier to take. But there are a whole bucket of reasons why girls might also be cautious with their feelings.

The librarian had the books we could choose laid out and gave some quick summaries as to what they were about. The book was ""A Mango Shaped Space"" and she talked about the girl having synesthesia and seeing words in colour, tasting words, seeing music, etc. and I remember my friends going ""whaaaat"" and I was sort of gobsmacked because I didn't realize it wasn't a normal thing! (Someone above asked how I never knew it wasn't normal, but it's as natural as however people picture letters or words without synesthesia and you don't have any questions about it because it's always been like that.)

If you want to get serious about pursuing music as a source of income and you want to do this via college, you need to start thinking of it as a business now.

From the business side of things, take those business classes. As many as you can fit into your schedule. Learn about what it means to be an independent contractor. Learn how to write your own contracts for gigs and other performances. Learn about negotiating your rate and absorb as much as you can about presenting yourself professionally. Some of this stuff you won't learn in class. Try and take some courses in finance if you can. You'll be doing a lot of your taxes independently. You'll need to learn everything you can learn about filing as a contractor or small business owner.

Take PR classes, too. Learn anything you can about advertising and writing press releases. If you're even slightly artistically inclined, take a graphic design course so you can make your own fliers if you plan on doing solo work. This is the stuff I wish I had learned in college.

Take those music classes and learn some really in-depth music theory so that you can be as versatile as possible. A lot of the money you'll make as an artist will be as a studio musician. Get incredibly good at playing to a click. Read ""The Music Lesson"" by Victor Wooten. Learn to sight read. If you can't sight read yet, start learning now. Church gigs are invaluable and if you can sight read and play piano you'll be able to find work that way.

Network. Network like crazy. Meet every single musician on your campus. Get well known for your musicianship and your drive. Go to your professors during office hours and ask them what books they would recommend for working on your music during the summer months. Start doing gigs locally. Perform your stuff at open mics around town and get really good at performing in front of people. Ask for feedback from artists you look up to. Collaborate with them. Start a band in college. Jam with other artists constantly. Jamming is a great place to improve your technique.

Find yourself a city that has enough music work to get you by. That could mean recording studios, churches, or just enough kids that need music lessons. Get good at teaching.

Oh, and don't move to LA. For the love of God, don't do it.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Over an arbitrarily large series, you will approach averages.

But if you create 1,000,000 series of 36,000,000 rolls, some of those are going to randomly vary greatly - maybe in one, double-6s only show up 500,000 times.

But that's all completely irrelevant to the chances for independent events. Past rolls cannot affect the next roll. There is no mechanism for this to happen.

&gt; Hence the contradiction- either the combinations DON'T come out (about) 1 million times each over the 36 million rolls, which violates the idea of a '1/36 chance', OR they do, which means (6,6) needs to come out at a statistically higher rate during the second half of the rolls, which also violates the idea of '1/36 chance and the dice have no memory'.

Dice have no memory. This is fact. Chance is random. In an arbitrarily large series, you will approach averages very closely -- but if you create an arbitrarily large number of arbitrarily large series, some (a tiny minority) of those series will vary greatly from the averages.

If I roll a die 6 times, it's not very likely that I'll get a series of 1,2,3,4,5,6 (in any order), because the result is random. As the number of rolls increases, we'll get closer to an even distribution, but the odds of each individual roll never change.",1477958752

It's this jungler that was getting double kill bot instead of helping me 1v1. I am now validated, it couldn't have been all me.

Oh look, I won, so therefore I must have the skill - otherwise I would not have won. I am now validated as a skillful player. All me baby, I took the kills that someone ~~set up~~ tried to take away, so all glory to me.

1. Any sort of job will offer some level of monotony. I feel this is less true for CS jobs given the rapidly changing/advancing nature of the field.

2. Welcome to the club. Being asocial goes hand in hand with being able to sit for hours on end and crank out code.

3. see (2)

4. The field is very broad. Don't like systems programming? Try front-end design. Don't like coding too much in general? See if the more theoretical side of CS/Math is for you. Like acting out? Try security ;)

5. A competitive nature obviously bodes well with the field. 

If you have an internet connection and a working computer, your motivation is the only thing stopping you from learning CS nowadays.

Good luck, and great to hear that you are doing well!!! 

Source: fellow fucked-up guy who took a shot at CS. Still fucked up, still doing CS.

EDIT: Just realized all that sounded a little uppity, so this is purely my experience here.

When I was 15 years old, I weighed 118 kilograms and I had, and still have, a crush on the prettiest girl I've ever seen in my whole goddamn life. To impress her, I visited a nutritionist and lost 50 kgs in a year. My body started to pile up because of the loose skin, but who tf cares ? It's not like I'm getting naked in front of her.

Weighing 68 kilos, I had the guts to ask her friend, who was also a friend of mine, to help me ask her out. Her friend then told me how much she liked me and she's very sad that it was not mutual. I felt bad for her and asked her out, I mean dating the girl I had a crush on was too good to be true.

Turns out that the girl I dated was so jealous of the pretty girl because everybody in our school wanted to date her. She dated me just because she wanted to prove to herself that she was worth something to a guy. Even I, the nerd who didn't smoke like the cool kids, was enough for her. 

I'm 18 now, studying medicine foundation at Manchester University, and I still can't get over all of this. ",1477958755

&gt; Manchester Orchestra is an American indie rock band which formed in Atlanta, Georgia in 2004. The group is currently composed of rhythm guitarist, singer/songwriter Andy Hull, lead guitarist Robert McDowell, keyboardist and percussionist Chris Freeman, bassist Jonathan Corley and drummer Tim Very. Former drummer Jeremiah Edmond parted ways with the band in January 2010 to focus on his family as well as running the band's record label, Favorite Gentlemen. The band has released four albums - 2006's I'm Like A Virgin Losing A Child, 2009's Mean Everything to Nothing, 2011's Simple Math, and 2014's Cope.

&gt; Manchester Orchestra originated in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia. They are named after the English city Manchester, a place rich in musical history (The Smiths, The Stone Roses, Joy Division, Oasis, New Order, Happy Mondays). Feeling increasingly alienated at his ""small-town-Georgia, Christian high school"", Hull became so frustrated that he spent his senior year studying at home. Early in their career, the band recorded an album entitled Nobody Sings Anymore. However, it was never released due to the shift in the band's musical direction and personal changes undergone following its recording. The band stated that ""the band that made the record was different to the band now."" Some of the tracks written for the album were released instead on the EP You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor.

&gt; Following  You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, but Brilliance Needs a Good Editor, Manchester Orchestra recorded and released their debut album I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child. This album gained the attention of the music industry, and eventually led to their signing with Canvasback. The album was released nationwide July 27, 2007. Guitarist Robert McDowell did not appear on this album. The song Wolves At Night was featured in the video game NHL 08.

&gt; In October of 2008 the band recorded their second EP, Let My Pride Be What's Left Behind, with producer Dan Hannon and engineer Brad Fisher. It was released October 7, 2008.

&gt; In early September 2008, the band announced on their Myspace blog that they had begun recording their second album entitled Mean Everything to Nothing with producer Joe Chicarrelli (The Shins, My Morning Jacket). On February 4, 2009, the band posted a link to a free download of the single I've Got Friends and performed an acoustic version at The Fly’s In The Courtyard Sessions. The album was released April 21, 2009.

&gt; On January 26, 2010, the band released a digital split EP with Kevin Devine entitled I Could Be The Only One. Following the release of the Manchester Orchestra/Kevin Devine split EP, it was announced that Kevin Devine would record a full-length album along with the members of Manchester Orchestra later that year, with half the album written by Devine and half by Andy Hull. On April 10, 2010, it was announced the new project's name was Bad Books, and that the album would be released under that moniker, and not ""Manchester Orchestra + Kevin Devine"" as previously speculated. The self-titled full-length Bad Books album was digitally released on October 19, 2010, and on CD on November 9, 2010.

&gt; On March 2010, in an interview with the Dallas Observer, Hull mentioned that the band had begun work on a follow up to 2009's Mean Everything to Nothing tentatively entitled Let Go of Your Sorrowful Groaning. He also said that the band have around 34 songs they are demoing and that in writing this album he was imagining a ""spiritual miscarriage"". Later that year in an interview with Rip It Up magazine, the band announced that they were in the middle of recording their third full-length album. Although without a title, they explained that the album was completely different to anything they had released in the past. The album was being recorded with Dan Hannon and balanced between Blackbird Studios (Nashville, TN) and their own Favorite Gentlemen Studios (Atlanta, GA).

&gt; On October 23, 2010, during an appearance at Radio 104.5 in Philadelphia, following a Bad Books show in support of their recently released self-titled debut album, Manchester Orchestra debuted an acoustic version of the title track of their new album, Simple Math. Originally scheduled for release in March 2011, the band announced in January of 2011 that their third full-length studio album, Simple Math, would be released on May 10, 2011, as well as announcing the album's tracklist and revealing that the album was set to be a concept album.

For the sidewinder, the splash is so minimal you'd do your best to get lots of direct hits in my experience. Good for spectres/stalkers i find. (IMO hardest to use).

EPG deals medium damage from splash, but better off getting those direct hits. Requires the most target lead because of the slow projectile speed. However the hitbox for the projectile is large. I feel like this one will get better with experience, as you'll learn to predict enemy movement into your shots.

Cold War is best when above your target, the 4 projectiles in quick succession and generous splash means that you generally just need to saturate the area where the enemy is rather than get direct hits. Great for farming minions.

Softball, get a feel for the curve of the grenade. I feel like the projectile is pretty fast all things considered and is the one gun out of all these that I prefer shooting from a grounded, but elevated position. (Just my preference, not too sure how you'll find it). Groups of minions are ez prey and for pilots, get yourself a good lead and aim slightly higher than their projected path.",1477958758

Music On Vinyl, for example, try to get the original metal parts (i.e., Alice in Chains and Rage Against The Machine re-issues) or they get the highest quality digital files before it was mastered for vinyl/CD/digital from the original labels they obtained the licenses from (usually 24-bit, 96KHz at the minimum but some are on 24-bit, 192KHz).  Other labels use the original digital files before it was mastered for certain formats like CD's or tapes and then master for vinyl, which is the case for Blood Music.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","No. Of course not. Those are just roots. I was just saying the correct way to properly dispose of a body so there is nothing left to investigate. In a way it's simple and easily done with easily obtained chemicals. It's not a difficult process. Most criminals mess up for a variety of simple reasons. Many are disorganized and panic. Then they actually believe that random disposal will clear them. Many times it does work out that way if detectives are not extremely creative and resourceful. 



One of the hardest crimes to follow are random killings. You can have the body and a slew of evidence. But unless you have some DNA or fingerprints to match to a criminal database you are going to be pounding sand in frustration.  If the killer is just some guy who never had a brush with the law he won't be on a database in any way. 


If he is a repeat offender like a serial killer then he will develop an MO and eventually can  be tracked by the trail of bodies. 



The dedicated criminal who is in it for financial gain is often the most ruthless and methodical offender. Here's where your sewage system can come in handy with dumping the sludge left over from decomposing with lye and acid. Just remember, lye for the soft tissue, and pool acid for the bones. Then the metal can be dissolved by some harder to get acid from a chemical supply house. Or just dumped around town in various dumpsters. A good method if you are familiar with an area is to drive by right before trash pick up in the morning. Just dump stuff in random trash bins set out in alleyways. The stuff will be gone to landfill in less than an hour. No body to for dogs to sniff out at the dump. Just some clean metal parts.

Werewolves didnt promise aid BUT I think if they think its good enough of a prey they will join BUT finding them may be a problem since the shifting feywilds. (They should be able to planar travel to the forest but I think they said they were scattering)

Garmelie seems unlikely since Archfey just like to play around with people I think he would take more fun in watching the coming battle rather then actually joining

Ahn'Karel they have the flute for (But I think dude said he was gonna fly so they need to call him ahead of time) BUT with planar travel on the way back from Synghorn they could hit up Ahn'karel to inform him then tree home.

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","Dorfman is a Senior Fellow at the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a right-leaning think tank that is [formally connected](https://spn.org/) to other state-based groups with the same pro-business, limited government agenda.  These think tanks work hard to promote state policies that align with limited government and free market economics.  Their mission statements are nearly (if not exactly) the same, and their donors often interlock, as well.

Take what you will from that, but one of the main reasons I shifted from this school of thought when I was a younger person was while working for a similar group.  There was a lot of smug arrogance leveled at government and toward those who tend to propose policies that will help middle and lower income people.  In every single case I observed, they only liked policies that would help business flourish.

While this may seem okay on its face, there can be a grave fallout from the world view that glorifies business and the private sector to the exclusion of individuals and government.  Dorfman's opinion piece makes sweeping generalizations about the ineffectiveness of the fine, yet he turns and makes a grand prediction that ""eliminating the local business income tax"" would likely lead to a two-percent increase in employee wages.  That flawed logic is one of a large handful of problems with his piece.  But remember, we're not his audience; he is preaching to his choir.",1477958761

"EmDrive","t5_32vrh","&gt;Pretty light on theory myself, but a unit of energy that exists as both a particle and a wave plus carries no mass yet exerts a force seems like we haven't classified nor understood all of its properties yet.

That's a highly speculative statement for someone who's ""pretty light on theory"" and it's downright incorrect. Your argument is essentially ""this sounds strange to me, so clearly nobody fully understands it."" It's a fallacy to think that way.

&gt;I'm no multiverse proponent by any means, but there's a universal question to what a photon really is.

Multiverses have nothing to do with the EM drive. And even QED and the theory of photons is not directly relevant, since we're well within the domain where classical electrodynamics applies. Even if you insist on brining QED into the mix, QED is very well understood, and so are photons. QED and quantum mechanics are not free passes to say ""we don't know anything."" Even if that were true, that argument doesn't hold any weight for the reasons I mentioned above.

&gt; multiverses

&gt; Higgs-bosons

&gt; event horizons

None of these have anything to do with the EM drive.

&gt;admitting we have a device that somehow enables photons to exert an asymmetric (opposed) vector of inertia is not much of a stretch for my imagination.

Despite the fact that ""asymmetric vector of inertia"" is complete word salad, QED conserves momentum. It has done so since its inception decades ago, and it will continue to do so forever.",1477958764

The space shuttle actually flew every landing deadstick. The only thrusters in use were the RCS system when the thing was still high enough up that control surfaces didn't work in the thin atmosphere.

I could swear they even jettisoned all their leftover fuel after the deorbit burn, but I can't find any sources about that. I'm sure mission planners included only just enough fuel for emergencies, so that it wasn't a concern during landing operations (you don't want to fire an OMS engine in the atmosphere anyway, it wouldn't work very well).


Not that any of this really matters to SC. I personally would love to see decoupled atmospheric flight being realistic - in that it basically doesn't work and IFCS should do it's darndest to prevent you from doing it, unless of course you are making extremely liberal use of your maneuvering thrusters.

---

&gt; We're at a point where enough time has passed that there are people who will have grown up on anime and committed their lives to creating more of that content on the same professional level ... and they might not be allowed here because they're gaijin?

I'll get to the root of this in a moment, but it's important to note that if they were working for a Japanese studio, then their presence as a non-native wouldn't disqualify the studio or anything.

&gt; What's important to the idea and content of anime does not require Japan.

I agree that the globalization of the anime industry is a challenge that we have to face, but doing away with the Japanese aspect of the rule at this point would open us up to all kinds of content that we're not looking for, and I'm not sure how we would then be able to limit it without imposing a rule based on style. This is what we've been avoiding the entire time, because it opens us up to even more subjective moderation where users don't know what's acceptable until it's reviewed and we will inevitably make mistakes in judgement because the definition isn't robust enough.

---

&gt; ... Though is it really necessary to forbid those?

Upvotes/downvotes aren't all that's necessary to keep the sub on-track in terms of allowed content. The voting system is far from perfect, open to abuse, and is highly biased towards certain forms of content and against others. For these reasons, I don't see up/downvotes alone as an effective moderation mechanism; in fact, I might even argue that the voting system is effective only in combination with appropriate moderation.",1477958767

Had his comment not been there, I would have posted my reply to whatever comment of similar ilk came next. It wasn't specifically a response aimed at him, but at the popular theme of the comment section (i.e. ""this looks shit"")

And absolutely I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of Nintendo fans, yes. Browse /r/Nintendo, /r/3DS or /r/wiiu and you'll see the hypocrisy in spades. You'd have to be blind not to see it! ""Graphics don't matter"" has been the motto of the Nintendo fan since the DS, and repeated ad nauseum for all arguments involving the Wii and 3DS. It was briefly retired for the Wii U, which could compete graphically with PS3 &amp; 360, but made a comeback when PS4 &amp; Xbone arrived. Personally I think that motto should read ""Graphics don't matter *(except when they do)*"". That's much more honest.

The rabid lack of self-awareness isn't just limited to graphics, either. The same old list of 8 or 9 Wii U exclusives is rolled out every single time the console is slated by critics. ""Who cares about [big modern AAA game], we've got the best exclusives!"" has been the sermon every week at the Church of Mario, but the congregation lost their fucking minds over at /r/Nintendo when they saw Skyrim HD  on the new Nintendo console, and they are currently wanking themselves silly over the FFXV director's nice words for the Switch.

Now obviously, I cannot take the time to personally verify and cross-reference every user's comment with every one of their past remarks on the topic. I can't give you any data, nor cite any scientific paper. But considering the volume, the high frequency with which this occurs, and the upvotes which act as endorsements for the prevailing popular opinion, I feel confident saying there is some significant overlap in Nintendo fans who shit on games like this one because of the crap graphics, and those who will defend a Nintendo game to the hilt despite the comparatively crap graphics, simply because it is a Nintendo game.

This doesn't mean I'm declaring all Nintendo fans to be hypocrites by association. But by and large, these Nintendo-related subs are cultish to a high degree and the blatant hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness is rampant. Tribal mentality ratcheted up to 100.",1477958767

And some more. 

&gt;Also, adding to what I said before, going through people's post comments and find everything goes through your own narratives then reach the conclusion you wanted is nothing but what Gestapo would do, like you did. Therefore, learning from you, I went through your history, and what I found is that around every other posts or comments you made, are involving calling others ""nazis"", ""antisemetic"", ""conspiracy"", etc, and you are accusing me of a single comment I made yrs ago being so called ""antisemetic"", then what does your doing makes of you? A even bigger tinfoil hat?The Like I said before, you are nothing but a conspiracy believer yourself, like the imaginary counterparts you want to fight. Truly pathetic for this morbid obsession. Sad! In the end, before I block you and your nonintellectual and unhealthy thoughts, here is something I want you to read. It's from German philosopher Nietzsche, which I hope that didn't trigger your paranormal mind, ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.

This guy proposed a mathematical model to test whether or not it was possible to seed MORE aggressive cancer cells in the center of an existing tumor and have the new strain outcompete the existing one and eventually cause both strains to starve to death.

The premise is: A major landmark in when cancerous tumors get really bad is when they learn how to send signals to your body requesting new blood vessels. Prior to that, it's just a bunch of cells growing without any real pattern or form into this giant sphere of death... quite literally. It gets to the point where the tumor is necrotic at the center because the cells all around them are denying them food and oxygen. BUT if your tumor gets smart and learns how to create it's own blood vessels, it suddenly has a bottomless supply of nutrients and can now grow completely out of control. (Another major landmark in the progression of cancer is when these tumors learn how to metastasize...) 

Basically the researcher was creating a mathematical model that looked at what would happen if you put 'dumb' aggressive tumor cells in the center of a tumor that was learning how to create its own blood vessels. In theory, there might be a specific timing where the 'dumb' cancer cells consume all of the available nutrients and cause the 'smart' cells to starve to death before they get a chance to grow their own blood vessel network... then the dumb cells starve to death as well. 

Note: This was all theoretical and he was running simulations to see if it was possible. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the results :(",1477958768

If I was to make a penalty for quiting early prior to completing the next boss wave,  it would be three things.
1) lose all credits and points accumulated after last boss wave
2) lose 100 credits
3) half the rate of credit accumulation for 1 hour. with the length of this penalty doubling each time  you quit when the penalty is still active.

I'm single because I had the bad habit of latching to the first girl who liked me or whatever, and they we're always batshit crazy.

Girl 1: Told me I didn't love her after I was T-boned (ruled not at fault) and nearly died in the crash. Apparently I wasn't comforting her enough after I was the one who almost died?

Girl 2: Cheated on her boyfriend with me despite me not knowing he existed at the time, threatened to kill herself multiple times if I didn't have sex with her, attempted to kill herself when I told her I couldn't have a normal relationship with her after her ex broke up with her because she would just harp on how much she misses him and how monstrous and terrible and pathetic I am for letting her do that because ""What kind of friend are you to take him away from me."" She ended up sleeping with my former best friend the first night the three of us hung out, kicker is that they were in the same bed as me for some saucy foreplay so that was awesome. /s

Girl 3: Was addicted to Cocaine but ""she only did it once or twice at parties"", massive mental health issues ever since she was a kid; including but not limited to: sexually assaulting a peer of hers in the 3rd grade, abusing animals, attacking her mom in bursts of rage and then subsiding almost immediately. So at the end of our relationship she had: Become addicted to Cocaine, Molly(MDMA), Acid, and was apparently tearing herself apart and I was the only cure. Furthermore she stabbed her mom one night with a pair of scissors, broke into her best friend's house to hide from the police where they found her and locked her up for 3 days, attempted to stab me, she knew I would try to leave her but anytime I did she would say something like she'd kill herself or just start cutting again or any plethora of nightmarish things.

The kicker behind Girl 3 is that I learned all of this from a single text from a mutual family friend of hers and mine, wherein i was also told she stopped taking her birth control while we were dating, so that was sweet.

Overall I'm just burnt on girls and am open to suggestions as how to find something because I'm kinda sick of being a ""crazy chick magnet.""",1477958775

SPF (sun protection factor) is the numerical rating that denotes the extra time a product will allow you to stay outside before you start to burn. A sunscreen with a rating of SPF 15+ would provide a fair-skinned person 15 times more protection for their exposed skin than if they didn't use a sunscreen, says the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. So if a person starts to burn after 10 minutes in the sun, correctly applied SPF 15 will provide protection for 10 times longer or 150 minutes.
 
The above chart compares how the skin receives the sunburning dose of sunlight without the protection of a sunscreen. and with SPF15, SPF30 &amp; SPF50 sunscreens. 

* Unprotected skin (SPF1)  received 100% of sunshine after 10min of sun exposure
* If protected by SPF15 sunscreen, it will receive 
 * 6.7% of the sunburning dose in 10 min
 * 20% in 30 min and 
 * 100% in 150 min.
* If the same skin is protected by SPF30 sunscreen, it will receive 
 * 3.3% of the sunburning dose in 10 min, 
 * 10% in 30 min and 
 * 50% in 150 mln.
* Skin protected by SPF50 sunscreen, will receive 
 * 2% of a sunburning dose in 10 min, 
 * 6% in 30min and 
 * 30% in 150 min.

However, sunscreen is rarely applied in real life as it is in lab-testing conditions, and it sweats and rubs off, so never assume you're safe for the entire period. Your best bet is to re-apply a high-factor sunscreen every two hours.
 
Avoid the sun during peak hours, seek shade and wear your protective hat/sunglasses/gear.

I don't know why you find it so dumb that someone would find value in breaking down the game beyond the box score stats, but that's exactly what makes this sub so enjoyable to a lot of us.

You can call me and others football dumb for digging into the context of individual QB play all you want, but I guarantee you  Bill Belichick isn't just looking at the total yards gained when he's game planning every week. I guarantee you he's paying attention to whether that 20 yard play traveled 20 yards in the air or was completed behind the LoS. And I guarantee you he doesn't look at those two plays and see zero difference in them. But I guess he's probably pretty ""football retarded"" too, right?",1477958779

"askMRP","t5_39iug","Initially her reasons for cheating were: we weren't having sex (true, not very often), she was lonely (true, I was working my ass off trying to keep a roof over our heads and my kid in private school), I was distant (read: exhausted). This one isn't as true because when I came home she was constantly on her phone looking at Facebook or texting. I would ask her repeatedly to put her phone away. It would go in her pocket and then be out again in a few minutes. I think most of these reasons are rationalizations. 
Last night her reasons were: she was being selfish, she was living in a fantasy world, she liked the attention, she had compartmentalized everything so she could enjoy her affair and the come home to be a wife and mother. I think there is more truth here. But I am concerned she is just telling me what she thinks I want to hear. Repeating my own arguments back to me. 
She tells me she is really sorry. That what she did was horrible. That she will do anything to make it up to me. That she wants to put our family first. She says she will open up about who she is talking to and where she is etc... She says she wants to stay together. 
She lied to me every day for 9 months. On good days. On bad days. She spend the morning making out with this other man and them come home and kiss me like she was Carol Brady welcoming home Mike from a hard day at the office. I never suspected a thing. 
Now all of a sudden she has come to Jesus? Her tears are real. But she can conjure those up a wave of her hand. Her words sound nice. And it would be so comfortable to just slip back into that warm place called home and pretend like nothing happened. 
But what about next time? 
What about 6 months or 2 years from now? When that handsome, flirtatious client walks through the door and chats her up? Will I be back in this place?

When I say that she says that they're no different, it's actually very problematic to me because I have not seen her look at a single IEP, nor consider the specific needs of ANY of our students since she printed them out and threw them in a folder. My program REQUIRES me to, of course, consider these things when planning lessons as well as to design activities that meet the needs of all learners. It's hard to do so when her class is VERY much structured around worksheets. According to her, whether I'm in a 12:1:1 or placed as a special ed teacher in a full classroom, I will still be teaching all of the students WHICH IS TRUE, BUT requires a lot more thought that I have ever seen her put in, and which I need to put in as a requirement for my program, as well as just... for the sake of the students. I don't know what to do. I know I need to tell my program directors and just do my best, but I'm really afraid that she's going to freak out or try to like shift the narrative (I fucked up, and I admit that, but I don't think that I am a ""bad"" teacher because of one bad weekend/day at the start of my second week in front of the class...?) or just retaliate by rating me horribly when it comes to that part.

Seeing a constant litany of ""never, ever buy if you don't have 20%+"" and ""20 somethings should be renting and not buying"" and so on is just disheartening, and I think it discourages some people from moving forward for whom home-buying actually is a doable and good decision.

But then when I got back, he texted me a bunch asking about how to let this girl know that he likes her. She had a boyfriend at the time and she and Dan were also sleeping together. It was all messy. Anyway, I realized how shitty he had been and how he had essentially recognized my feelings and let me be strung along. Also, it's a massive turn off that he was sleeping with someone whose boyfriend was overseas and didn't know any of this was happening. I slowly distanced myself from that group and he's been with that girl since around July-ish, I think. As soon as I made a decision to stop spending time with him, I felt so much relief.

If you just ""took out"" the x's like you want, you would just have a ratio of ~0.66 no matter what value of x you put in.

The more fundamental reason it works the way it does is because when x gets really big (like in my first example) it contributes the most to the ratio. If you put in 999,999 or 1,000,001 into the equation, the ratio changes very little because x is so large. On the other hand, when x is 0 it contributes nothing to the ratio is you get the ratio you expect ~0.67 out.",1477958784

"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","This is going to be a matter of opinion. Although, there are some logistical considerations regarding certain titles depending on the order in which you do them. Cartographer can be trickier on classes like monk with nearly no increased movement skills running skills and low armor. If you do your vanquish as you do your cartography, then it doesn't matter because you are killing everything anyways. 

Assassin's are incredibly versatile and can run virtually all melee weapon builds effectively (some better than primary because of critical strike). They can also be an effective caster with assassin's promise and other deadly arts (plus PvE skills). They also have the medium armor rating making them more defensive than most casters. 

Mesmers can be fun, but IMO have the worst aesthetic overall (visually). It's more like normal clothing for armor and personally I'm not into that as much. That being said, Mesmers are crazy powerful and have the ability to brutally punish both mobs and bosses. 

Ritualists are often recommended for their ease of play. Generally they are very effective in most aspects of gameplay and have great team support and high, steady dps. 

Dervish is my favorite because scythes are badass and they have crazy high dmg output as well as overall game capability. Teardown enchants (apply then remove for effect) are incredibly powerful and pious assault abuses the hell out of them. They have bonus HP and medium armor making them great frontliners. 

As you can see, every class has something completely unique to offer. Keep in mind that you are likely to be spending 700-2000 hours for Gwamm, so choose wisely. Alternatively you can start maxing some titles on a couple different characters to see what sticks and see what you like best. Alts are always fun too!

Rick is tough, but he's not cold blooded the way Shane was. Also, when Shane finally confronted Rick at the end of S2, he actually said, ""You come back here and just DESTROY EVERYTHING!""

Corvo's powers are reminiscent of the darkness and chaos in Dunwall during the rat plague (Rat Swarm). They also showcase his innate fighting ability. He was described as a ""whirlwind"" capable of taking on multiple enemies in the training yard (Bend Time and Blink). He hails from Karnaca, a city known for the ferocious wind that causes dust storms and fuels windmills (Windblast). Finally, he and he alone is the arbiter of fate, his actions dictate whether or not the city suffers or thrives (Possession).

Emily, on the other hand, has powers that show her power and influence as empress (Far Reach, Mesmerize, and Domino), while also revealing the darkness that has split her soul in two, constantly making her decide if she will succumb to it, or hold on to the light (Shadow Walk and Doppelganger).

Im also not comfortable with his explanation of lonely people, some just dont have the neccescary skills to deal with social situations. Another problem I see is that he ascribes general human phenomea to paticular situations, such as humans getting nervous and self concious in front of the camera. This isnt even limited to media, people get nervous when dealing with large amounts of people in general, even if it is a ""two way street""

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yeah but they have no chance of getting matching funds. At this point the realistic scenario is that Clinton most likely wins, and Johnson either does or does not garner 10%.

I said the libertarian party would ""fill in the gaps."" I think their economic and domestic policies are poor, but better than the GOP. And I think their foreign policy platform and social issues platforms are substantially better than the GOP.

I would love a true left wing, but we also need to marginalize the far right. If you talk to most young Republicans their views are much closer to the Libertarian party than to the GOP platform. Conservative on economic policy issues, limited government, but very progressive on social issues. Unless there are unprecedented structural changes to the government, we'll continue having 2 parties regardless of what they're named, and I think a future with a libertarian-esque platform on the right and a green type platform on the left is the best outcome. I think that for the Dems to be able to truly shift left the GOP will have to shift left first, not the other way around.",1477958795

I don't treat them like kids, basically. This one is dependent on age but I make it clear that I value their opinion, I consider them an equal, and nothing they say or do is going to ruffle my feathers. 

Most importantly, I don't try too hard. Kids can sense that lack of genuineness. ",1477958798

Being a black character for Halloween is okay (so long as it's not culturally appropriative) but the blackface part is not. This looks to be his interpretation of Papa Legba, where the makeup extends all the way down the face instead of the half-mark where the Real Papa Legba's skin could be seen, only this person has a small patch of facial hair.

On one hand it's just a majority white county, my high school had the largest minority population and it was still 55% white, so there are no schools that are 90%+ black/latino like the ones talked about in the video.

 On the other hand my neighborhood is 99% white, and the high school with the least diversity in the county is 95% white, which is in a small town with a large KKK chapter. So I know segregation and racism is a problem, but I don't know that this would help much to solve it.",1477958800

However, I can't imagine ANY actually good coach that is trying to instill a winning environment doing that ever.  
  
Additionally, I seem to recall that the draft picks with the highest value per dollar seem to be in the late first through mid second round. This explains Bears picks like Forte at #44, Tillman at #35, and Mike Brown at #39. It also partially explains the Patriots success, because they're consistently drafting their first picks in that window, which means they arent spending piles of cash at the top of the draft. I would be happy to look for a source for this if y'all are as google-lazy as me.

It's not at all unfair. We do not always use all of the services we have  available however those people that do use those services are served by them and are more likely to not become a burden.

Also, how do you figure the kids are getting a free ride since they will be paying taxes on the higher wages they secured by having the proper education.

Well, the church is just an assembly of followers and disciples of Christ. This means that we are not an organization, an entity, or a corporation (it exists). So, if you have two individuals that follow Jesus congregated in a house, then there it is the church. If you have someone that's in prison for the sake of Christ, then there you have the church of Christ in jail, because even among inmates you have sons of God. If you have some native that speaks an ethnic tongue and lives in the jungle but follows Christ, then there it is the church of Christ in the jungle.


This is what the 'primitive' church looked like-- Just people gathering in homes and listening to the word and revelation of our God. The book of acts recalls some events of this nature; for example: Cornelius, who had a vision of God, ended up hosting Peter, and Peter himself spoke about the truth of God to the family, servants, friends, and neighbors of Cornelius to a grade that everyone in the house received the Spirit of God. Then we also can appreciate other apostles staying at homes, and preaching to christian jews who congregated near rivers. Then God used Timothy and Paul, and the church of Ephesus, who were crucial to get the message of the Lord in all corners of the world, who God used mightily and filled the stadium of the city of Ephesus, reaching even the sorcerers of the city who burned their books and forgot their practices for the sake of Christ. So the church of Christ can be small or large-- size doesn't matter.


The truth is that God breaks through, and we see this when Stephen preached to the Ethiopian eunuch who took the message of salvation to his home and community.


So, when you say how can we reconcile the fact that the church was wrong for a long time, we just say: ""I don't know what you are talking about."" Why? Because Jesus started the good work, and keeps working at it, and keeps perfecting it. The church has always existed, and it's never been wrong because it's God leading it. Perhaps for a long time it seemed dormant, or hidden in the shadows due to oppression and persecution, but it's been alive all these years. We might not know each other completely, or its true size, but we all do and move as God sees fit because he maneuvers the ship, and he is the one that knows each one of our hearts.

Welcome to /r/relaxedpokemontrades! Your post has **not** been removed. This is a friendly reminder to follow [the rules of the sub] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relaxedpokemontrades/wiki/index), especially Rule 2. 
    
**Full disclosure is required. No exceptions! You must state:**

- Where you obtained the Pokémon (trade, GTS, hatched, etc)
- OT (Original Trainer) name &amp; TID (5 digit Trainer ID)
- [hacked], [cloned], or [legitimate] status.

If your post does not include those details mentioned above, please edit your post to include them. This rule provides transparency between traders *before* trading so both are aware of the Pokemon's legitimacy.

Thank you and happy trading!

My guess is that you won't be able to change batteries on the Switch — at least not easily on the go. The reason I believe this is that it is now atypical to be able to swap batteries on smart phones, and especially tablets. Batteries can be made to take up more space in the device, and thus last longer, if they are made to be permanently built-in. The extra screws, latches, housings and connectors all take up space, restrict cooling, increase production costs.

As people have said, if the Switch uses USB-C then a power bank will be your friend if you're running out of juice. I'm sure someone will quickly design a clip-on power bank so you're not left with it awkwardly dangling from your device if you need a charge.

Even if it uses a proprietary connector it won't stop someone from quickly making a USB adapter so you can use any power bank. For example I have a third party USB cable for my 3DS so I can charge it via my computer at work.",1477958815

Iranians who learned I'm not religious were very cool and level headed with me, they wanted to discuss our differing viewpoints in a civil manner. On the other hand, the Turks and Arabs who learned I'm not religious were seething and looked at me as if I had murdered their kin (hell, a Turkish family member pulled a knife on me). Regardless, I've come to realize that the both of us are using anecdotes to prove what we view Iran to be and I apologize if I insulted you. I'm just trying to say that saying ***x*** country is ***y*** is just a real shitty viewpoint to take. It's ignoring entire sections of a country and cuts out any nuance in your argument.

I was very active back when IOC was ""the deck"" to run(pre ban list) I ran a gran maju removal deck. And was considered the most ""skilled"" player in my area due to winning 90% of the tournaments with this deck. 

I returned about two months ago to play a magician deck(not the most meta, but always my favorite) it doesn't win, but I have fun. 

In terms of skill in the current meta, there is more needed out the gate. Things like xyz summons, pendulum(whoever made this was on crack) and syncros, never existed in my time. And my god, some of these players are doing 7-9 xyz summons in a turn. While the mechanic is simple, the fact you need to think 4-12 steps ahead was unheard-of in my time. It was, remove one light, one dark. Blow the field - yata.

So those who say there is no skill. Need to look back, at a time where mechanical chaser was an op card.

I find the sport disinteresting for these reasons:

* It is difficult to consider it a sport when it's just people flying on brooms. I think the same of NASCAR or Formula One.

* The point values included are massively skewed, so much so that in my headcanon most quidditch matches look like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEZVGM1679s) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-aiWqjVDxk) until one seeker or the other notices and catches the snitch.

* There are apparently only six contests throughout the entire school year. That's less than one per month. There's no way players can remain sharp without actual competition on a regular basis.

* Only seven students out of a house of dozens get to play. 

* The concept of a full time professional league in a population so small that it can't fill Hogwarts seems rather unlikely, given that such a population seems unlikely to sell enough tickets to make player payroll and pay for upkeep on the venue.

* There's no standardization of equipment, or standards for referees and enforcement of the rules.",1477958822

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","1. I'm not too familiar with tax advantaged accounts from Canada, but from my understanding the TFSA allows you to invest without paying capital gains or dividends tax while the RRSP lets you deduct from income similar to a 401k. While your tax rate wouldn't go down further past $4500, you still don't get taxed on the additional money until you withdraw. I would max out the RRSP and save an additional $3100 on taxes after the $4500 you suggested. I would then put the remainder in the TFSA.

2. Paying a 1.5% fee for a mutual fund is ridiculous, look into your plans options and see if there are low cost funds available. If the TFSA acts like a Roth IRA (from the US) like I think it does, then you should be able to choose a provider. Personally I would choose something like Vanguard Canada. You can pick mutual funds that capture total stock market or other asset allocations that provide great returns while having low costs. Picking individual stocks can get dicy and I would avoid doing that unless you know what you're doing.

3. However much you're willing to lose. In your case I'm guessing that would be $5k.",1477958823

"RimWorld","t5_2yjxo","Bionics can absolutely be shot off and torn out, they just don't bleed when damaged. The benefit of power armor is full coverage without sacrificing the mobility you normally would cased in inch-thick composite plating. The cost in materials might not be worth it to the generals and commanders, but to the soldier facing gunfire, full coverage means he can be bold in assault, retreat after normally crippling injuries, or just stay in the fight longer. 

The other consideration is that cover in Rimworld doesn't protect your body parts, it just adds to the miss chance of the enemy. Your guy could be hunched behind a sandbag with only his helmet and eyes popping over, but the guy shooting at him from across the bags can still blow his leg off. So while IRL a helmet and vest could be considered adequate protection for a soldier in most situations, in Rimworld your arms, legs, pelvis, etc... are hanging out, all the time. 

That being said it's overkill for many situations IRL and the game addresses that, in the game it's described as special gear for assault troopers smashing through enemy hulls and engaging in close quarters combat.

For context, we each a one-syllable surname paired with a three-syllable first name that could be nicknamed down to one-syllable, for a total of two-syllables. Nicknames are important because the twins will eventually be called by ""x and y z"" where x &amp; y are the one-syllable nicknames, and z the surname. 

So, if you have Lillian and Anthea An---n, it'll be ""Lil and Ant An---n"" or ""Lilly and Anthea"" if your kid starts rejecting the nickname. I had a friend named Anthea and she didn't like Ant much...

Also consider that they might like the opportunity of a nickname as a passive mechanism through which to differentiate themselves from their twin: e.g. from teen years, my sister has rarely used her her full first name, while I have rarely used my nickname, somewhat as a function of our trendy and classic personalities, respectively, but also as a way to say, ""It's not THE TWINS, it's ME and HER.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think I am similar to you, but i'll elaborate on my experience. I was raised christian but I always felt so disconnected from the whole thing. Everyone around me was so enlightened and pumped about God but I felt like I must have been doing something wrong cause I never had the same experiences others had. As I got older, I began to reject the notion that things like premarital sex, being LGBTQ+ or anything but straight and cis were wrong. I lived in a really diverse area and knew all kinds of people from all walks of life, and never for a second believed any of them were wrong, so I rejected christianity. I had this idea in my head that I couldn't be a christian without guilt. I tried really hard to get back into christianity in highschool, but I was having sex with my boyfriend at the time, and I was so guilty that I actually told him I wanted to stop till we got married...and we did, for about 6 months before I gave up again lol. Around that time I just decided I could not be christian. Years later, I got more into the philosophical side of things, and started to meet other ""liberal"" christians who taught me about their faith and how it differs from what we know as orthodox christianity. I realized I can believe there is a God without buying into the literal translation of the Bible. I realized that what was most important to me PERSONALLY was my relationship with God, and following Christ's examples. I think the only way I differ from many ex christians that I know is that I still feel like I have a relationship with a higher power. I still pray. Maybe it doesn't mean anything, but it's meaningful to me, and I believe in an afterlife, and I believe we exist for a reason. I don't have all the answers and I never will, but I am ok with that now. I dont have to feel guilty for just wanting to live.",1477958827

"NarutoFanfiction","t5_2yhj6","I read all the way up to the latest arc in the story before I stopped since really wanted to give it a proper read to see if it would start clicking.

I'll start with what I think the author did right: the story is obviously VERY well written in a technical sense.in general the world building and everything was well thought out. They did a great job at avoiding clichés and making Naruto powerful but not OP. There was a great balance of humor and seriousness which I enjoyed. 

Now to what made me not enjoy it. With everything that goes on in the story, for some reason it failed to seem all that important to me. There was never a moment where I cared what was happening or dying to know what happens next. The plot points just didn't grab me at all. I was just rolling with the punches until 300k+ words in I realized I was forcing myself to keep going out of wanting to see why everyone loved the story so much. 

Just like with the plot, the authored never got me care about Naruto himself either. Something about his characterization was just odd and I still can't figure out what exactly was throwing me off. He felt kind of..forced? Idk if that's the right word. It was like he had some of Naruto's traits but was a mere shell of the character himself, like...a robot programmed to be him instead of him feeling like a human character. I fully understand that an ANBU version Naruto won't be the same as the Canon Naruto but there was something about him in particular this story that somehow made him uninteresting, even though the mere premise of his life in the story him SHOULD make him interesting. I just can't truly put a finger on it.

As I've said in a previous post I'm a bit hesitant to say negative things about this fic because I know how lots of people try to be contrarian just because something is popular and that's not what I'm tying to do.",1477958828

Not only does he not just call enhanced interrogation not torture (as the Bush administration did), he removes all pretense and says we should waterboard ""and worse"" and he does explicitly say we should torture because it works, and even if it didn't, they ""deserve it.""  

[“Don’t tell me it doesn’t work — torture works,” Trump said during a campaign event at a retirement community here Wednesday morning. “Half these guys [say]: ‘Torture doesn’t work.’ Believe me, it works. If it doesn’t work,” Trump said, “they deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-torture-works-backs-waterboarding-and-much-worse/2016/02/17/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html)

Trump just lies about literally everything. He supported the Iraq war, he supported Hillary Clinton before he ran against her, HE WANTED US TO ATTACK IRANIANS JUST FOR FLIPPING US OFF.  

That Trump wants to sell himself as an isolationist and then advocates maybe using nukes and explicitly advocates torturing prisoners/enemy combatants makes him not just unqualified to be president, it makes him an unhinged and amoral individual.  

You don't even have to get to the sexual assault for him to be disqualified for his horrible moral values. 

It's one thing to prefer Republican policies to Democratic policies. We can argue about that all day long. But this man goes far beyond the partisan divide, which is why Republicans have had to disavow him because he's literally a know-nothing, mean-spirited jackass who would make the entire world hate us more than they did under Bush.  

I mean we JUST got done convincing the whole world we're not evil idiots repairing our relationships under the Obama administration. Can we not undo everything by electing the guy who campaigned on a premise of committing war crimes?

My biggest concern was (and is) long-term memory problems, of which I found a few anecdotes. If you might be interested in Lamictal, I'd suggest you do a little research, but not too much.

First thing, Joseph Stalin. Stalin was a Marxist. He studied and used Marxism Utopian idealogies as the 'honeypot' to enable/justify things like the *Purge of Intelligentsia*. The same people you were inclined to state would turn into reality the modern Marxist Utopia, actually were more compatible w/ the elements of the Marxist Utopia -- both bc the environment of a capacious Russia and the fact there wasn't inventions and services like there are today -- and they were round up and killed. Stalin used that notion of a Marxist Utopia and killed people for speaking out against him and by extension that ridiculous notion that such a Utopia could ever exist, thus proving the notion a Marxist Utopia is not possible. 

Second, again, you've taken out of context so it's like you're not even trying -- the definition of quality of life as defined by psychology, 

&gt; Quality of life is a complex, multifaceted construct that requires multiple approaches from different theoretical angles.

[Europes Journal of Psychology](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.299.4629&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf)

Also, find me when I said these things,

&gt; According to you, what the population ""desires"" is the current endless cycle of wage slavery, laboring for rich men 50 hours a week, while slipping into poverty and not able to raise a family? Last time I checked, that didn't sound much like ""freedom""

I never did say nor allude to that, in fact I am sub'd to this place to try and gain some enlightened view point, as well bc I can relate to being educated and realize I've not had the financial wealth or personal growth experiences of the peoples who have come before me. However, I did want to clear up the notion that Marxist Utopia is something 'smart' people should strive for; not an oppinion, a fact proven by history.

Personally, I don't believe in breaks and just end things. Turn off my phone, hit the gym, and just move forward. It's not worth putting that type of faith into someone who is willing to throw everything out because they're confused about some shit.

You as well should be a priority, just as much as you have put her as a priority. Where you even convinced yourself that you're willing to be patient with her. Don't give her that complete control.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; a.k.a. **The Piano Teacher (2001)**

Drama, Music, Romance [[USA:Unrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings), 2 h 11 min]  
Isabelle Huppert, Annie Girardot, Benoît Magimel, Susanne Lothar  
Director: Michael Haneke

**IMDb rating:** [](#movieguide_stars)**&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;** **7.4**/10 (38,348 votes)

&gt; Erika Kohut is a pianist, teaching music. Schubert and Schumann are her forte, but she's not quite at concert level. She's approaching middle age, living with her mother who is domineering then submissive; Erika is a victim then combative. With her students she is severe. She visits a sex shop to watch DVDs; she walks a drive-in theater to stare at couples having sex. Walter is a self-assured student with some musical talent; he auditions for her class and is forthright in his attraction to her. She responds coldly then demands he let her lead. Next she changes the game with a letter, inviting him into her fantasies. How will he respond; how does sex have power over our other faculties?
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 73% approval rating based on 81 reviews, with the site consensus being\: ""Though it makes for rather unpleasant viewing, The Piano Teacher is a riveting and powerful psychosexual drama.""

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm not telling you that. Seems your favorite thing is to put words in people's mouths.

Firstly: the government ain't a monolith. One politician doing something wrong doesn't indict another simply because they are part of the same institution. 

Secondly: the existence of one wrong doesn't prove guilt on every other charge into infinitum. Bush lied about WMDs? Sure.  That doesn't prove any other charge. 

You must provide proof of every individual charge you hope to make. If you cannot,  the accused are, in practical terms, innocent. This is the fundamental of our legal system.  Because it's very easy to correlate your animosity towards someone with wrongdoing.  Just because you're convinced in your deepest feelings that your annoying neighbor is stealing your Internet bandwidth because their kids have trouble in school (or WHATEVER) that doesn't make it true. Just because you think your coworker was sick with something doesn't necessarily mean they gave you what they had.

can you prove everything you know? does that mean all those things are automatically false?

as for the morality of abortions, the way to argue that it's immoral (like murder) is to point out that you are *intentionally preventing human life*. some argued this from a christian perspective (Thomas Acquinas, the man that did the work basing most of the anti-contraceptive stuff the catholic church holds.) others will argue could argue it from a Kantian perspective of not respecting the humanity that fetus will have once it becomes a baby. others could try to go a utilitarian route. Hell, even the chinese might use Daoist thought and say you're interfering with a natural process.

and before you come back with some response about subjective morality,  99% of people know when certain things are wrong. it's the things that cause suffering to others. you know that you don't like watching others suffer *without cause*, that or your moral sense is broken in the form of sociopathy or psychopathy (or whatever the proper terminology is).",1477958850

Sigamos.

Sigo sin estar seguro de si estoy de acuerdo. Estoy de acuerdo en algunas comunidades, sin duda. No estoy convencido en la situación general. Esta charla estuvo tan embarrada de boludeces  que ni hablamos de cuántas mujeres están en esa situación, qué otras desventajas suelen tener contra los hombres, y qué ventajas suelen tener. 

&gt; claro que no, yo estoy haciendo un esfuerzo enorme en tratar de mostrarte mi punto original: la balanza no está equilibrada. 
acordate de sofovich, la prostitución y todas las implicancias... sin mencionar ejemplos mas modernos como el salario, el derecho a voto, la ultima ola de asesinatos de mujeres... en fin..

Cada una de esas cosas que enumerás dan para rato. 

El tema del salario, no concuerdo. 

El derecho a voto, huh? ¿Estamos hablando de países musulmanes? Porque si es así, entonces sí estoy 100% de acuerdo con vos.

Ola de asesinatos a mujeres. Las cosas se ponen de moda en los medios también. La situación real es, por lo menos, compleja. Por ejemplo, hay 5 veces más asesinatos de hombres que de mujeres en el país.

* Fewer vermin in the bed if they have to climb a few feet to get there
* It's a little harder to climb out of bed if it's lower (but you're young, so no big deal)
* In a room with cold exterior walls, the drafts are stronger near the floor

Why are you helping them delay you?  Would you delay if they said *""We are having financial difficulties ... so can you not hassle us about this money we owe you for about a month?""*

You can be 100% guaranteed that they didn't contact a lawyer who advised them ""Tell them that you will give them the money - but then let's not do it for a month because we are going to have a longer conversation about it"". 

Don't be put off just because they told you that they didn't want to pay you what they owe you now.  If they are this disorganised that they stuffed you up they probably have stuffed up other things to.  

There is a good chance that the company is going under and that they are just saying 'wait' to everyone they owe money to.

Consider contacting the owner of the new company **NOW**.  They are the person running the company that owes you the money.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","EDIT: My Terms are apparently all used wrong when it comes to newtons/work/force etc

Not sure exactly what you are asking but maybe this help, I am no physicist though so this is how I interpret it?
Newtons is measuring work performed or energy used. Not either or, both are the same thing, work performed and energy used are the same thing.
If you work hard for 5 minutes you may be expending the same amount of energy as not working hard for 15 minutes. You get the same done, the same amount of energy is used to perform the task. What matters is the work being done, not how you did it.

Torque is energy expended rotating something. Look at the animation on the right side of the wiki result for torque. The force on the rotation is being applied at the outward most point. The distance from the center of the rotation to the point the force is being applied matters which is why you have to measure it.
Think of it like this, you have wrench and you need to loosen a bolt/knut/wtever. the wrench is X long. The amount of distance the end of the wrench travels is the distance being measured in torque. If you use a longer wrench, let us say 2X, the distance traveled is going to be longer for the same amount of rotation happening. The same amount of energy, but different distanced being traveled. Also, you will notice it is easier to turn the longer wrench than the shorter wrench, but the amount of work being done is exactly the same. You are just using less force per distance on the longer wrench which makes it seem like it takes less work. You are measuring the force applied turning, how hard you are pushing the wrench. It matters because turning the longer wrench takes less force than the shorter wrench, even if the same amount of work is being done.

Momentum, a heavier ball rolling is harder to stop than a lighter ball, no matter how big either ball is, as long as they are traveling the same speed. If the lighter ball is traveling much faster than the heavier ball, it will be harder to stop, no matter how big it is. Mass is basically weight, weight is not dependent on size.
So how much force does it take to stop the ball from rolling in X distance. The longer the distance you have, the less effort you need to apply per the amount of distance traveled. But the same work is being performed, you are stopping the ball. if only the distance it takes you to stop it changes, than the newtons does not change, only the distance. And that is what you are measuring and why.

I went in expecting some kind of Rocketeer/Chronicle-like science fiction romp; a bunch of hack magicians come across top-secret/sufficiently-advanced alien technology that allows them to perform physics-defying feats of illusion and other tricks.

Inevitably, the government/mega-corporation/aliens get wind of this and decide to intervene while the main characters struggle and clash over their newfound fame and the morality of using the tech in their offstage lives. 

After the death of a side character and a betrayal (maybe the tech-savvy guy who originally figured out how all of the tech works wants to sell it off to the highest bidder or rat them out to the bad guys.)

Final showdown: team has to come together and rely on their tried-and-tested, though ""mediocre"" street magic to foil the bad guys and save the day (think Willow's disappearing pig trick).

Sure, they are a lot faster and far more physically able than the Tau. They're roughly slightly stronger than an equivalent human, but have poor depth perception and reflexes.

You've gotta take into account that even if the pulse rounds don't penetrate the Chieftains armor (I really don't think their armor is going to protect them very much), they'll be at the least staggered, but will likely be knocked over.

So instead, I'll just laugh at you for thinking that mechanical keyboards on laptops are a good idea. They take way too much travel to register, and have way too much of a 'valley' between keys for your fingers to get lost in, which means it's less efficient moving your fingers around the keyboard.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","No, you can't do that with two weapon fighting. The rules specify that you have to attack with a weapon held in *one hand* (dual wielding allows non-light weapons but doesn't remove this limitation). If you're attacking with two hands, the attack can't trigger the TWF bonus action. And no, taking the bonus action first doesn't change that; you HAVE to use an attack that would trigger the TWF bonus action or you can't use it at all.

You could, however, do so with extra attack. Either by using one attack for the throw and one for the swing, or making one one-handed attack to trigger the TWF bonus action and attacking two handed with the other attack.",1477958861

I tend to play him in the Jungle because regardless of what they choose in lane nobody ever expects Teemo to be Jungle so it gives your top laner a counter to your counter. 

But honestly if you want to rank him, just learn every counter, how to play against them, build more of a style you are comfortable with carrying. 

**FULL AP BURST** is a good option, very strong easy to build.
**ONHIT** is another option, good sustain, great AOE clears, great team support, though I feel it lacks in terms of damage to carry hard unless you get fed early, this is just me I tend to keep ONHIT in the Jungle.

I'm sure there are many other personalized builds like Tankmo, ADCmo, Hybridmo, you just have to find what works for you, and what works in every scenario. 

But you can't go wrong with **FULL AP**

I can see how making it clear that something is a link rather than just an underlined word would be hard, though, as changing the colour enough to make it a distinct value would probably make it blend into the background regardless of the values you're working with.

I've been there and I've fixed my social anxiety. I assure you, life is immeasurably better. You just need to reach the point where you understand, deep down, that you would rather do anything than continue like this. At that point you will be willing to put in the effort and endure the discomfort to fix your anxiety.

The worst thing you can do is continue to avoid social situations. Think of it this way, you're only in school so you've only missed out on X amount of social interactions and the subsequent social learning. What happens when you graduate and you've missed X+3 years more? Or 10 years later when you've missed X+10 years more? It only gets worse and it starts to affect your career, your relationships with people, and your life.

The best advice I can give you is to start working on it asap. It might suck now but trust me, it will suck more later. At least you have friends now so you have a starting point. I didn't even have that.

So being healthy isnt a thing?? He told her he wants to change a little bit and be healthier. And she threw a fucking tantrum! So your spouse to be doesnt want you to not be out of breath from taking 5 fucking steps and somehow he is a jerk for that. If he didnt care, and was just using her for a green card why wouldnt he just pretend to be not bothered about it? Look at Danielle and Muhammed. You know he wasnt attracted to that idiot cow one bit. But he went along with it and didnt say shit. I think he is also sick of her complete disrespect of his culture. She acted like a child when he pulled away. And even though she said she was ok with it she still was clingy as fuck. She acts like a fucking child half the time. ""Shed a tear for me! Im leaving. Wahhhhhh"" Some men dont show affection. And that might also be a cultural thing for him. She talks over him, and expects him to change for her but she wont change anything about herself. Marriage is two people changing and growing together. So again...i dont think it has to do with him not being into her, but maybe he is just sick of her selfish stupid ways. ",1477958863

A solid first episode leading into a poorly animated, poorly choreographed, poorly written, just all around poor show with a stunning lack of redeeming qualities. It's an action show with very little action, and what action there is looks horrible. I know Studio Wit can do better than this. I've seen them do it before. Shingeki no Kyojin was nothing short of brilliant from a choreography perspective, and Kotetsujou no Kabaneri was a bad show, but at least it looked nice.",1477958864

"dishonored","t5_2sn3m","I honestly do not believe that Dishonored 2 will be bad at all.
The only gripe I even have with this game in general right now is the title. I mean, Dishonored 2? C'mon man. Why not something like: Dishonored: Bloodlines or Dishonored: Emily's Revengeance.

Think of something better than just: Dishonored 2. Other than that, I do not expect Dishonored 2 to be bad at all. As a somewhat hardcore fan, doing 50+ Easy/Normal/Hard/Very Hard runs on the normal campaign, and at least 20 runs of each DLC campaign, I have the utmost certainty that Dishonored 2 will be a masterpiece. From gameplay we've already seen, they've payed attention to the smallest details possible, reinvisioned their game, and brought the spotlight onto EVERYTHING in the game. This is astounding for Arkane. I would have been fine with Dishonored being a single game, but they've already made their choice to make it a franchise. I just don't want it to be milked away for cash like these other companies have done. I don't ever want to see Dishonored have this fate. ",1477958866

The best way to do this, is take a medium sized cucumber, peel the skin off with a potato peeler, then shred it with a cheese grater. Put your cuke shreds on a dish towel you don't like (thinner is better) or even a cheese cloth, and think of making a ""burrito"" with your towel/cloth as your tortilla and your cuke shreds as your meat.

"NoMansSkyTheGame","t5_325lr","Like many on this sub I fully supported HG before launch by preordering their game. I even supported them when I realized things might not be exactly what we were told after the leak. Then, the issues of ""network overload"" came up the day after release and I started to realize that SM/HG might be purposely misleading customers. Then, the silence.

When I am still experiencing a game breaking bug (at least if I want to complete planets 100%) and I am not even getting an ounce of feedback from the developer I no longer feel sorry for them. They made this sub toxic by letting things play out the way they did. Like I said, many of us were 100% behind Hello Games and wanted them and NMS to succeed beyond any other game in the genre.

Just because SM/HG decided to remain silent does not mean that we have to do the same and go hide in a corner. I think some people take things too far but without the vocal people that were let down HG and other developers would have no reason to not do the exact same thing. So, excuse me if I want to voice disappointment in a game and developer that let me down. ",1477958867

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;You need to reserve resources for 4MB blocks though, just in case the multi signature transactions become much more popular.

That's true, SegWit *does* allow up to 4MB blocks, so the minimum-requirements for a node are going to increase accordingly. But I wouldn't say this complicates scaling in any meaningful way. There's still a hard upper bound of 4MB for block sizes. 

&gt;Pretty terrible solution just to avoid hard fork now

Au contraire, SegWit is an exceptionally *good* solution for scaling purposes right now. It's the *only* solution that is currently ready for deployment that doesn't suffer from potential quadratic sigop vulnerabilities. It's also been tested and peer-reviewed, fairly thoroughly, for about a year now. No alternative solutions are even *close* to SegWit in terms of test coverage, nor in terms of benefits across the board, nor in terms of code availability and readiness. 

&gt;Core should be fair and say no hard forks changes possible in the future as well

Honestly, I don't see what you mean here. Just because Bitcoin is not hard forking *now* doesn't mean that it should *never* hard fork. The current policy is ""Hard forks are fine if there is near-universal consensus on the change(s) in the fork"", which you might argue is a bad policy, but it's certainly a lot more reasonable of a policy than an absolute one like ""Hard forks are never fine under any circumstances"". 

&gt;That's why its better to wait for better solution

Agree to disagree on this one! I think it's better to implement the solutions that we *do* have that we know are ready for mainnet, as long as they are safe and well-tested, so that we can scale Bitcoin intelligently over both the short-term and the long-term. I don't think we should let the perfect be the enemy of the good here. We have SegWit, and we know that it solves a lot of problems (as well as increases transaction capacity significantly); it's time to deploy it and start working on other solutions to scale Bitcoin!",1477958869

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I spent a lot of time and money traveling in my early to mid-20s and only really started a ""real job"" at 26.  I have absolutely no regrets about this -- sure you can travel when you're older, but it's not going to be the same (energy-wise and ability-to-hostel-wise)Also, family, pets, house, accumulated stuff are all anchors that come most people's way in their 20s - 40s.  

That said, yes, the money you invest now will be more ""valuable"" financially later.  But it likely won't break you.  And as you've learned how to save aggressively, you'll likely be able to make up a lot of lost ground.  Also, not to get too philosophical, but nobody is guaranteed another 20 or 30 years.  

Depending on what you're interested in, you might also think of ways to make it really cheap.  Spending large amounts of time in inexpensive areas, wwoofing, couchsurfing, housesitting, these can all cut your costs.  Credit cards with miles bonuses will get you pretty far.  (Or like $500 towards a ticket).

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","Hey OP of the thread here, thanks for bringing it to light to Reddit even though it's already been locked, It really seems to be a ""war"" of the user vs the moderator out there. The amount of bias I see from f mods and community helpers is unreal, it's clear why the RSOF is a dying medium but the code of conduct states a lot of outdated rules for today's runescape community. 

My points being made in the thread were the amount of hypocrisy and favouritism is given towards f mods by other ""community helpers"" and jagex moderators giving the power of a large medium to a very limited group. 

Another point was just how outdated the forums are in comparing to other mediums like Reddit and Twitter, have you been on a forum in the past 5-10 years that doesn't allow even YouTube links and only within the past year allowed posting images. 

There's a clear amount of unjustified actions made by f mods pointed out in the RSOF thread and the Reddit thread (ty to the poster) =) in which f mods are being extremely petty over things such as having two threads in two different forums advertising the same thing to boost signal or another example I have is the infamous f mod with the blue phat locking an old warband FC thread known as ""Latino Unit"" a Spanish based FC for having their thread in Spanish the primary language of the fc in the pvp forums.

I hope I got my points across well, very ironic that this got attention on Reddit rather than the RSOF right ;).

What if Bungie got rid of the passage altogether? Removed the losses and only kept wins. With the current format that ToO has now, a team would let's say win 4 matches in a row and they lose the next 10 matches, which doesn't matter, just accumulate 9 wins to get to the lighthouse. On the next game they win and they are now at 5 wins, they would have to play another 5 wins team to keep going so it's not like everyone will get there, because the 8th and 9th match will still be hard as fuck.

I think it would be very forgivable for the larger part of the community that can't get to the lighthouse week in and week out. But it will still be very hard to get there since the teams are still matched based on wins per weekend.

I think that would also help making carryings harder, since a lighthouse streamer will not be able to reset their passage to carry someone.

You might have to repeat yourself a few times whenever it comes up, and you might have to explain exactly what emotions you are feeling, but it will usually get through. You can do this even if you laughed it off before.

""It's hurtful that you'd tell a neighbour that I'm a bad housekeeper. You know that it's difficult for me to keep up with the house and that I'm trying my best. I feel self-conscious about it and it makes me sad that you'd share something that I feel ashamed of and worry about.""

""It hurts my feelings when you talk about my period panties in public as it's a very private issue that's making me upset.""

""I appreciate everything that you do for us, but I hate it when you do my laundry, and I've asked you several times to stop. It really bothers me that you haven't listened to what I've asked.""

The estimated cost of the Gigafactory is around $5B, give or take. Hell, let's give it another $3B cushion and say $8B all in.

$8B x 100 factories = $800B. That's a lot of money, but not an insurmountable amount by any means.

For comparison, the US has spent over $2T on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the 2015 military budget was $600B.

Obviously it's not just money we need to get these things going (additional infrastructure reqs, updating networks, labor, etc), but it total it is POSSIBLE that we can make it happen.

A. No only the president has veto power over CIFUS actions.

B. so much collusion now it is hard to tell. for example.. the secretary of commerce (another group that had to approve the deal) Penny Pritzker's brother is J.B.

Ironically, I think it has to be *easier* to publish papers in reputable journals.  The number of figures need to be restricted, the size of the paper has to be restricted, and editors have to check on reviewer comments on whether the criticisms are actually reasonable.

The thing is, the same way an ultrawide cuts off the *sides* to imitate 16:9, a 4K monitor can imitate a 1440p UW by cutting off the *top and bottom*.  4K is all te pixels of a 1440p UW plus more, but of course now you need a 30% taller monitor.  Now we're looking at 40"" 16:9 panels.  That's a bit big

Eventually it'll become the new big thing.  4K will beat 1440p, for those with the budget to drive it. And 4K ultrawide will crush that.  But right now with the size of the monitors required and the terrible HUD:Text support for 4K, it's not the time to upgrade.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;You're creating a strawman about funding because the ""government money frees up money that MIGHT COULD POSSIBLY MAYBE pay for abortions"".

Which is actually a good argument. Money is fungible. If a gun store sells both 1911s and AR15s, it is foolish to argue that funding one does not fund the other.

Example.

Lets assume for a moment that AR15s and 1911s were the same price (they aren't of course).  Lets also assume that you own a gun store and that you had budgeted money to stock 0 1911s and 30 AR15s for the month.  Lets finally assume that you have received a government grant to purchase 15 AR15s.

In this scenario, there is nothing stopping you from taking your initial AR15 budget and using it instead to purchase 15 1911s. When the order came in, you would therefore now have your initial plan of 30 AR15's in stock but also 15 1911s that you would not have otherwise been able to afford.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","here's some advice brother - ask.  If she says no, then that's ok.  The whole purpose of asking is to see if they feel the same way.  And if they don't, then you should just stop hanging out with that girl.  You can be friends, but you need to find another girl to hangout with.  

There's a lesson in here too - You cannot be best friends with women, if you want to have one on your arm.  It will just lead to a lot of jealousy issues.  You can only be a mild friend, and you must not worry about ruining friendships.

There are 7 billion people in the world, and friends will always come and go, and your life is limited to so many years.  Don't feel like you have to maintain friendships forever.  Real friends will always be there and keep talking - but true best friends, the ones you marry, are only a simple question away.  You'll never find out unless you go out and start asking a LOT of questions.  You can't be timid about it because you think it'll ruin things.

"EnoughTrumpSpam","t5_39usd","&gt;&gt; She was a senior adviser to her husband during his administration

&gt; With some expertise as a senator? That doesn't seem like a very good combination.

No, she didn't become a senator until late in his administration. She was just a knowledgeable lawyer, former PD, left-of-center activist speaker. During his election, they touted her abilities and labeled the campaign, ""Two for the price of one."" Smug? Perhaps. The Republicans called it a ""co-presidency."" But Bill won the election, so...

&gt; But she was against a single-payer healthcare system even into the primaries.

Yep. And I didn't support her in either of her primary bids, but I can still recognize that we're in alignment on about 70% of national issues, is my point. She's a politician. She doesn't lead the party, she follows the base. She talked Bill into vetoing bans on gay marriage *twice* and then came out as neutral/opposed during her first primary bid. It is what it is, which is to say, it's par for the course.

&gt; First lady as a diplomat? That's like something out of House of Cards. How does someone with no foreign diplomacy experience get into such a position?

She was a senior adviser to the President and an extraordinarily high-profile figure, which is very valuable in diplomacy, just in and of itself. She had no problem speaking to the issues she'd advocated for; you seem to perceive her as a housewife-cum-policymaker. Not so. She'd worked for Mondale during his career in the Senate. Carter appointed her to the board of a charity that deals with the right to counsel and access to representation.

She played a very active role in the policy areas she was familiar with while Bill was the governor of Arkansas. She wasn't coming into her role in the White House blind; she'd have been just as qualified to serve as a senior adviser if she *hadn't* been married to the boss. Which is basically my point (that and she's not a criminal.) Don't have to like her to understand her role.

&gt;&gt; The Clinton Foundation ships drugs to poor countries and raised money for Katrina relief along with GHW Bush at the behest of Dubya Bush.

&gt; The cynic in me sees that as a business deal disguised as charity. But no proof there, unless he prices were exorbitantly high.

Price tag: $0.00. I don't see how you turn a profit on donations. People assume the Clinton Foundation is corrupt because people assume Clinton is corrupt. Consequently, even far-left Democrats are inclined to take most allegations against her at their word, even though it's almost entirely bullshit. This woman has been the target of a nonstop smear campaign since Bill first ran for POTUS. Of *course* you should take most of the tabloid shit with a heap of salt. Clinton watched Benghazi go down from a camera on a drone and did nothing? Are these people illiterate or do they simply refuse to check their facts?

Which brings me back to my main point - most/all of the allegations of *criminal* misconduct are bullshit. Cronyism, extraordinarily dirty politics, misplaced allegiances, misguided faith in a watered-down version of trickle-down economics, war hawk... but she's not a criminal - people who are bound and determined to become president don't open themselves up to felony charges (which would disqualify them) or to (legitimate) impeachment - and she *has* done plenty of good.

I'm not *thrilled* with her candidacy. In fact, I'm fairly unhappy about it. But we've always swallowed the centrist, compromise candidate or the smarmy, wheel-and-deal candidate who's weaseled their way onto the ballot. And, personally, if I can't have Sanders or Biden, I can't think of another high-profile Dem who'd be *more qualified* in the strictest sense.",1477958882

EDIT: Let's say you took a player who spent a lot on the game already. Before the update they would have spent a lot to get the Cheer Umi strategy. If they have maxed URs they likely already have maxed Cheer Umi. This doesn't change much for them as you said since now the other stuff they got while doing Cheer Umi goes up in power too. No real change for these people other than getting the overflowed support members.

General populace: Most people I know have never ever pulled from the support BT scouting, let alone to make a difference. It's going to come down the exp reduction for these people. If it is large enough we may see the general bar raised. In the grand scope of things I don't think this changes much.

People aiming for Cheer Umi: These are the people it affects the most. The first limited for the card is coming up soon and depending on the exp reduction they may or may not continue with the plan.

Second: You do have legal rights to not be sexually harassed at work, even by customers/clients/patients. Just because it's customer service does not mean that the customer gets to assault you. (yes I understand a lot of places are still permissive about this, but they're breaking the fucking law.) You have rights, and your work is expected to operate within the scope of said rights.

All of that said. There are some things that you can do to help yourself if you are stuck somehow with his creepy behavior. For one, most creeps don't handle assertiveness well. So a simple ""Don't make comments on my body"" while maintaining eye contact and a deadpan face can often do the trick. Also, refrain from *any* emotional expression. Messed up people enjoy watching your discomfort, so don't let him see it. After you state your boundary don't argue it. He may say things like ""oh, but you're too sexy for me to not say something."", ""wow, you're feitsy"", ""now don't be like that."" ect.... Just don't say anything, look at him directly allow for the long silence, and you make him uncomfortable. Most people can't handle a long silence or a lack of responsiveness. If you withhold saying anything to justify your point and refrain from any reactive behavior, he'll likely leave you alone since you're not giving him what he wants. 

Fair warning, the guy will probably go out of his way to be dick in the future, but either he's nice to you as a means to treat you like shit or he just directly treats you like shit because you won't give him what he wants.

but yeah, even if i'm not doing anything new, i think my own nuances add some kind of originality to it. i think if you sing in your songs, that's enough to make it original because nobody else will have the same voice as you.

Hopefully these experts actually make sure the mother actually should breastfeed, because it's not always optimal to do so.

As far as I know the only benefit breastfeeding gives is this immunity factor and maybe more appropriate nutritionally, formula might have too much or too little depending on the quality of the mothers milk.

Edit; While there's a lot of data concluding on the whole breast milk is ""better"" those studies are reported as an average overall statistic. Not every mother will provide the same benefits.

This is looking like a year where 9-7 is good for a WC in the NFC, so we want the Packers, Cards, Eagles, and Redskins to lose as much as possible.  We also have wins against the Saints and Rams which is super useful in tiebreaking scenarios, so at this point in the year closing down the stretch 6-3 should be plenty to see us into the playoffs, especially if 2 of those 6 come against the Eagles.

Your example for The Flash is a parody of the sentiment your poinitng out, and the snark and entertaining action sequences we have seen with films like Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and Scott Pligrim can translate well into a character known for that sort of thing (Deadpool)

Pixels definitely feels like a film that's core concept (aliens using 80's video games to invade) could be done very well with Pegg and Frost or translated well with Scott Pilgrim's sensibilities

A new Ghostbusters by Pegg would have followed a rule that Max Landis pointed out to me: It is a scifi drama with a lot of funny characters in it. He did this in the Cornetto Trilogy (taking straightforward concepts of zombie Apocalypse, evil town leaders, and aliens who take over human bodies and adding in funny characters) and it is thought he could do it well

While it is a bit of a circlejerk, he is a director with enough cred and skill to get almost any film and do it well. It doesn't mean I want him directing Aquaman, or Batman, and Superman, but Green Lantern could definitely work. I wouldn't want him to helm an Uncharted or Mass Effect or Bioshock film, but he could probably kill in a Portal or Five Nights at Freddy's film (I don't do video games much)

Today America's bell curve is more flat than usual, with extreme ideas gaining ground. You probably find that the political center is hopelessly far to the right of your position. But the system is designed from the ground up to promote compromise candidates. Strategic voting produces the best overall candidate, in that they are the candidate that is closest to the collective interests of the voters - the President of America, not the President of Liberals.

Centrists are meant to win. Two parties that are nearly identical is the actual objective of first past the post democracy. Highschool civics really needs to incorporate more math to help people get this (it's not normally taught before college).",1477958893

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; it's the neurons in their brain firing in the same way they would upon receiving the same signals from their ears 

and just in the same way that the experience being phenomenologically real does not, indeed cannot, prove experience of anything divine, the experience having a correlated neurological event does not disprove it either. Do you think saying that would dissuade someone who was already convinced they experienced a vision? I mean, all experience has neurological correlation, would anyone - skeptic *or* believer - have the expectation that religious experience *doesn't*? You implied you do believe there are real objects outside of experience that influence our experience in some way. When you see a tree, your optic nerve is stimulated by light radiation incident upon it, gets excited into transmitting a signal along the nerve cells and synapses, forms this image constructed by structures of the brain as having colour, shape, etc., categorised by higher-order processed as having this name ""tree"", belonging to this category of ""plants"", being related to concepts like ""photosynthesis"". Well you probably think of none of that when you see a tree, you probably just think ""there's a tree over there"", or "" I should be careful I don't crash my car into that tree or I'll be killed"". 

a person who underwent a religious experience might be no different from you when you see a tree. You could explain the neurochemistry, you could show them pictures of their brain activity from an electroencephalograph. And that wouldn't be their concern, their concern would be that they believe they had an experience caused by something outside themselves, or a communion or an interface between them and something outside themselves. And they would be concerned with the nature of the thing rather than the nature of the experience (I think they would. I haven't had one myself).",1477958894

Trump needs to run the swing state table or turn a blue state red. Polls and forecasts often don't take the ground game into consideration. Clinton has a robust ground game and GOTV. Trump does not.

Trump needs to win it and colorado, Nevada and North Carolina.

let us pretend that these are all coin flips. Trump needs to get heads all four times. That is unlikely and in reality Colorado is leaning well to blue and Nevada has a history of underpolling dems.

You say you are worried about foreign nationals relations to Hillary. Why dont you have those concerns about Donald Trump? While i personally dont necessarily think that arguments about his businesses using chinese steel are a good argument against him, it is a business after all, there are many suspected ties and rumors about credit relations to banks and specifically russia. Do you regard those as pure speculations and rumors? They could be potential leverage, used by those parties just as well dont you agree? And if you think those are merely suspicions without truth, why do you think he didnt counteract by being more open about his business background, such as the infamous tax reports.

What do you think this is the difference between both cases of foreign relations?",1477958898

"DC_Cinematic","t5_2ykm6","You're really cutting the studio a ton of slack here, especially bringing up the Hobbit films which were artificially made into three movies instead of two just to increase box office revenue, and honestly I think there was a lot of interference on those. WB is not an auteur company like you think, if they are forcing the directors on these films to cut their movies down by such a momentous amount (1/6th!) or in the case of  Ayer giving final say on a cut of the film to a trailer company.

They also didn't give Nolan complete freedom, he had to work within certain story boundaries (although I'll admit the only major one I can think of is that he couldn't kill Batman off in TDKR, they told him he could do literally anything else, though, so that is a fair amount of freedom).

And I don't think Snyder could just say no to Roven. There had to be a consensus because Roven was not operating as an executive producer but a full-on producer and was involved in day-to-day production of the film, along with others.

I think the big difference with Nolan's way of directing is he treated the script as king. It's similar I think to Ben Affleck's mindset. Snyder created a three-hour cut out of probably 3 hours+ of final footage, adapted from a 4 hour screenplay. Nolan would not have done that if he were directing, he filmed exactly the script, no more, and no less. He never filmed anything that wasn't in the script and he filmed pretty much the script 99.9% as well.

If BvS has to be 2.5 hour theatrical, that should have been tackled at the script stage in my opinion, and that's the fault of not just Snyder but all the producers as well, and the studio. They should have settled on a 150 page or so script and then started shooting, instead of trying to cut out major parts of the story so it was shorter.",1477958899

"science","t5_mouw","There are mechanisms, but nothing is perfect... even withregard to computer memory to continue on that analogy over time random bits can get changed due to a variety of arbitrary reasons. These changes may be harmful or they may not and while there are mechanisms in play to cross check for such changes and errors things do get missed... since again nothing is perfect. 

So, as long as those changes are inconsequential in nature, or small in number you like wont even notice that they are there. However, the longer the time interval you want to look at the more cumulative changes are likely to occur in any system. Thus we have things like cancer, hereditary things etc... add in the potential impact of viruses, environmental exposure etc and things can compound on eachother really quickly to lead to undesirable outcomes.

Refresh rates therein can work as you described in the short run, but in the longrun they can also make things much worse as seems to be the more common case withregard to celldivision and biological systems.

edit: a word.

Edit 2: A lot of stuff in biology and the way things work is not that ""this thing is the best"", or anything of that nature.. rather most things are ""just good enough to work"" allowing an organism to survive just long enough to reproduce, or be slightly better at something than the next thing over due to some arbitrary/random factor. Its all very arbitrary in nature and nothing nearly as efficient as say computer systems operations.(certainly no design with intent involved for the most part) The problem with much of evolution and hereditary issues related discussions is that people project intent, or assume that mutations and evolution are a directional process when in reality its all kind of random as shishnits even within the frameworks of its own rules.",1477958901

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Other people in this thread have touched upon looking at other Brazilian or Latin bands, and that's a good start. Bossa nova was basically the fusion of samba music (generally a heavily percussive genre with loud drums) with jazz instrumentation and sensibility. The samba music that bossa nova is based off of is in its own way bombastic, though not really similar to heavy rock. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgJD0tGYV0M) a good example of samba music, sharing the same harmonic and rhythmic DNA of bossa nova, but much more kinetic. Classy is a very subjective term, but I'd say that samba music is classy in its own way – it's an interesting mixture of the highbrow and lowbrow, and it's not uncommon to see performers wearing sharp suits.

It's also helpful to think about the musical ingredients of each style. Bossa nova is based off of complex jazz harmonies, and that's a huge part of its sophistication. Try playing some of those jazz harmonies in a metal style and see if that fits the bill for you. Hard rock and metal, on the contrary, tends toward neo-classical stuff when they want to incorporate complexity. Both bossa nova and metal feature ample use of diminished chords.

As for rhythm and instrumentation, there's not too much that heavy rock and bossa have in common. I suppose that you could incorporate some Brazilian syncopation with distorted guitars, but I'm not sure how that would work. To expand the horizons of your search a little bit, it's good to think about how other Brazilian bands have integrated rock instrumentation with traditional rhythms. Look at [Chico Science &amp; Nação Zumbi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVab41Zn7Yc), for example.",1477958904

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","&gt; I guess the reason id believe in it is because I'm scared of hell and I was raised a Christian, ingraining these beliefs into my mind, then when life got tough my minds reaction was to go to those beliefs and the Bible.

It's a hard reaction to get over, because you were probably taught that these things are true before you were taught how to tell the difference between true things and false things. I know I was.

Think about it though. It only makes sense to be afraid of Hell if it's a real place. What reason is there to think Hell is a real place? Because the Bible says it is? Why should I believe the people who wrote the Bible have any idea what happens after you die? They didn't even know where the sun goes at night.

Basically, just keep following this trail of asking why and you'll discover that there's no reason to take Christianity and its claims any more seriously than you take Scientology, Mormonism, or any other religion. The only difference is that you were taught the one was true before you were given the mental tools to see that it actually wasn't true.

Does anyone know the background of Halloween Town and its relation to the ""normal"" world in the NMBC universe and if it's supposed to be the underworld or something or am I totally overthinking this or did I miss something regarding character backstories?

"MultipleSclerosis","t5_2s23e","I just did a round of PT, it worked out pretty well. They should tailor your session to what you want to get out of it, &amp; if you don't want to run you won't have to. So don't worry! 

Initially I visited a neuro-specialist physiotherapist, &amp; aside from costing a fortune, he didn't do a lot for me. Spent two sessions asking me questions about fatigue, then we did 10 mins of Feldenkrais. (""Think about moving your leg, feel your leg moving"" If I could think my legs to move properly or even feel them, would I be here?) I didn't go back.

The other PT went much better. It was a group session for MS'ers at a local university. $5 a session, yesss. Everyone went at their own pace, &amp; we moved through various exercises for stuff like balance, proprioception, strength, coordination, etc. There were HEAPS of breaks for water &amp; fatigue management. 

To finally answer your question; Heel/toe walking between the parallel bars, high-stepping in place, one-foot step-ups onto a small step, calf raises, standing on one foot, breathing properly, catching a ball while standing on one foot, leg press machine, walking without a gimpy limp (very slow &amp; frustrating at first), progressing to walking limpless with obstacles, walking with a weight in one hand (shopping bag practice), eventually culminating in walking on a treadmill for time.

Know what you want both long-term &amp; from each session, &amp; ask for it if they don't ask you first. My long-term goal was to walk well unassisted, &amp; short-term goals included stuff like 'just make it through this session' when fatigue was high, or a higher step-up when I was feeling tough. They should offer you a ludicrous amount of breaks, take them. And once more, don't worry about it. It's a fantastically positive thing, &amp; I hope you see some real improvement. ",1477958914

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Rollo's hamster is spinning to blame natural female tendencies on feminism.

&gt; wife whose late-life competition anxiety sounds like nagging most of the time, or else it’s a possessive Frame grab with the latent purpose of keeping him focused on “her needs” rather than coming to understand he’s in the best position to capitalize on his SMV in his lifetime. This is actually part of the Blue Pill, feminine-correct plan for maintaining an optimal Hypergamy (or at least the impression of it) for women.

Men have always been resource/protection providers in LTR. 

The majority of RP and even MGTOW has this fantasy that they can marry some dumb bitch who will cook, clean, fuck them when ever they want. The reality is, even if she is legally/socially obliged to do all these things, the woman on some level always nags and throws out shit tests constantly. 

Why do you think Saudi men spend most of their free time in some Arab coffeeshop smoking their water pipe ? Because when he gets home, he has 4 nagging Arab bitches there, they then will take turns nagging him. Its like tag team wrestling, except 4 against 1. One bitch has a go at you, then when she gets tired, she tags the next bitch and away they go, until they wear you down.

Even when being submissive, the bitches have ways of being aggressive, banging doors, the way they bang the food on the table when it is served, double edged remarks which can be taken either way. 

That is the RP truth. 

Edit - in more traditional cultures, the woman has the ability to cause drama. Feminism has only affected the elites for all practical purposes in India. Yet, a lot of Indian men are going MGTOW, they no longer want to follow the traditional role of getting married, producing kids and being a resource provider. 

Asian women and from what I heard middle eastern women take nagging, manipulation, shit tests and drama to an Olympic level. 

Example - Indian woman won't eat or feed the kids till husband comes home. It appears on the surface she is oppressed. Basically she is doing a hunger strike to control the husband. If the woman and kids get sick because they didn't eat, the man will be publically shamed.

* **Deferred spending**: holding off on a purchase until it's actually necessary in order to get more use out of the item and push back the moment when your new item starts becoming an old one.
* **Strategic luxury**: indulging in your favourites less frequently to heighten their joy and impact.
* **Gamified spending**: using discounts and other numbers to make a game out of stretching money
* **Against-the-grain spending**: avoiding trends that don't matter to you; buying out-of-season; measuring value in terms of personal satisfaction rather than prices

Each of these focuses on the simple concept of introducing mindfulness into the activity of spending (and saving). [Here's](http://www.ryanmelsom.com/blog/2016/06/16/mindful-spending-as-an-antidote-to-mindless-consumerism-part-1/) an article I wrote that goes into a more detail about this idea.",1477958919

Then you've also got the constant stream of new readers that are dipping their toes into the water after watching all the superhero blockbusters that have come out over the past however many years now, and they've got their own ideas about how the stories should be presented based on how they were introduced to the medium.

-----

It's the difficulty of infinite storytelling.  You can't give these characters endings, so you're forced to either reboot them or take them in new directions, and either choice is going to bother a certain group as they either don't get to see any progress in their heroes' lives, or progress to the point that the character isn't the one they fell in love with.

And when it comes to the notion of representation as you mentioned, people are constantly in disagreement over what constitutes organic change in the narrative versus what's just pandering for sales, as well as whether or not either of those things even *matter*, since historically comic books have often been on the forefront of tackling big issues in society, regardless.",1477958919

- It's the only deployable that can be destroyed by the payload.

- Each pillar has 500 health, and DVa self-destruct does 1000 damage, yet never manages to destroy the whole wall.  Do their hitboxes overlap or something?

- Symm's beam locks onto them, even friendly walls, and she can use enemy walls to boost her LMB damage (unless they fixed that??).

That being said, Skyrim is probably just the superior choice. It's less of an RPG than Fallout 3 and certainly New Vegas, but there's so many excellent quality of life changes, and an easy game to spend 100s of hours being immersed in, and multiple playthroughs with different builds is awesome; I am under the impression you probably couldn't do that in Shadows of Mordor.

My suggestion though, would be to just pick up the original Skyrim GOTY. From what I've seen of the Steam reviews so far, the SE is basically for people who will want to mod it super heavily in the future, because it uses a 64-bit version instead of 32, causing a lot less crashes and instability issues.

They require a lot of special care and they are grown on hills and mountain sides. So they are already expensive because of this. The trees themselves are pretty fickle. They're also really hard to cut down and get rid of if you decide you want to grow something else. But because of where they are grown, the side of mountains, it's unlikely much else will grow there. Avocados also don't last very long once prepared. They turn brown pretty quick once they're cut open  and guacamole doesnt have a good shelf life. Now you need to factor in the drought that California has been in for a long time. There's a shortage of avocados and I'm actually surprised that Chipotle has not raised their price for guacamole.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

You remember that one quidditch game that held the record for longest match? Something like three days. You can't play quidditch with a broom that physically can't catch up to the snitch, so it follows that either the players were incompetent or the snitch was legitimately harder to catch.

My headcanon is that the snitch has difficulty levels charmed into it. There's the training snitch, like the one James constantly played with, the amateur snitch, that Hogwarts uses for school games, and the professional level snitch, that is used for high level play.

Both Harry and Draco have brooms that are used for high level play; they can simply grab the amateur snitch easily because their equipment is not matched up with the difficulty level.

Also use Snap transformation and rotation if you want to align objects like crates, barrels etc. evenly.


If you are aligning some smaller objects like beds/counters set Snap transformation value to anywhere from 0.25 to 2.

If you don't like materials (grass colors etc.) on your current map you can copy them from other maps like Russia, Washington or Halloween PEI. If you do so make sure to also copy details (foliage, rocks etc.) and roads (so some gravel roads match your gravel in material file). Those are located in all map folders like environment, terrain etc.

You can copy ambience sounds from other maps if you want. Halloween PEI has nice wind sound which is good for more apocalyptic maps.

"iranian","t5_2s9nc","&gt; It's not so much that minority languages are banned in national public schools, but more so that the primary language taught in such schools is the official language of the country. Arabic is also taught in school since it is a very important language in our region. With Persian and Arabic, all Iranians can communicate with the rest of Iranians and most of the region. English is also taught at a higher level, which is the global lingua franca.

&gt; If you live in Iran with a minority language as your mother tongue you can definitely practice your language at home, in your community or take optional classes for that language. However a national education system needs to generally teach with a single national language to build an effective national scientific community.

Again, this is your nationalistic point of view. Having a language class for Mother Tongue will not heart such big language as Persian, as it doesn't mean not learning Persian.

Aside from that, I would actually have no big problems with your argument, if it wasn't coming from an Iranian. You see, when actual nationalists (unlike me) who want to close the existing minority schools make a similar argument in Latvia and Azerbaijan, they at least say: ""well, you can study your language in a private school if you want"". (I think it's a wrong argument, as minorities also pay taxes, so they should be allowed to have public education in their language)

But the thing is, you don't even have that option in your country, so you lack any argument worth disputing. When I dispute about this with Azerbaijani and Latvian nationalists, there's at least have a point there (I don't agree with it, but they at least have something). But you lack any point in your argumentation.

&gt; Also, I find it ironic how Azeris feel so nationalistic and proud of the Turkish language, which is itself imposed on them by former pillaging, raping and overall oppressive Turkish regimes. If anything, Azeris learning Persian is bringing them closer to their roots than the other way around.

Azerbaijani language is not Turkish. It's Azerbaijani. There are international registers of languages which give language codes to each language/dialect. They classified Azerbaijani as a language, not a dialect of Turkish (in contrast, after some academic disputes, they took away the language code of Moldovan and announced that it's a part of Romanian language). In so many years since these registers exist, no one was able to successfully argue that Azerbaijani is not a separate language. If you're a linguist, you may try. I bet you lose your case.

And we are Turkic people. We come from Qyzylbashs, who were overwhelmingly Turkic from the beginning, so no one imposed our language on us.",1477958926

They won't play the game the right way (safely) with your attitude and if people like me go away, we leave your line of thinking to validate the cavalier attitude towards player health.

- She's a fucking drunkard (Wikileaks said she had to be sobered up at 4:30PM)

- She's delusional about her support (Why aren't I 50 points ahead!?)

- She won't be awake to answer a 3AM call about US aircraft shot down over Syria

- Her policies will further globalization and hurt Americans

- She maintains a ""public"" policy and a ""private"" policy that she tells her banker friends

And some reasons for Trump

- Nationalist, not a globalist

- Literally everyone in power hates him, which is a sign he's doing something right (just ask Kennedy)

Eventually yes. But even then there will most likely still be wants/needs unmet, in that case humans will fill the gap.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I think Trump's job was to play spoiler in the primary and generally make the other candidates look bad. 

The Republican primary has become a game of ideological-extremity chicken, wherein the trick is to pull exactly far enough right to win while still leaving yourself room to credibly pivot back to center in the general (the Democratic primary is becoming increasingly like this as well but that is irrelevant). The thing about having a candidate provocateur running in the other team's primary is that they don't need to win the general, so they are free to crash to win the game  of chicken, so to speak. 

If Trump had not won the primary, his presence would still have meant Ted Cruz or a similarly extreme candidate winning, which still improves Hillary's chances immensely versus having to run against a more average Republican.

As far as quid pro quo goes, I'm guessing Trump's primary motivation is the continued concealment of any documentation of him and Bill hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein. I'd bet there's a whole box of ammo lined up, and ""grab 'em by the pussy"" was the warning shot. We'll get another one if he catches up in the polls again.

"Anglicanism","t5_2uk8h","1) I think the GOP has changed a great deal. TEC was always more dominant with WASPs of the Northeast. I think a lot of them simply left the Republican Party. Also, with (2) below, I think probably the growth of the GOP with Evangelical Christians corresponded to an increasing sense of incompatibility regarding the Christianity of the right wing with mainline denominations. (see, e.g., a similar change in the PCUSA which was also strongly identified with the Republican Party at mid century).

2) Persons in leadership tended to come from a more progressive educational background starting in the 1950s. Protestant seminaries in general became more ""liberal"" fairly early on (some like Union Theological Seminary even earlier). This change can also be seen in the Southern Baptist Convention, which turned strongly to the right in the 1970s and 80s in response to a perceived lack of orthodoxy in its education institutions. 

3) I'd also argue the decline in membership favored those who were at the top (leaders educated after the war). They were able to gather more institutional sway as demographics in church membership went in their direction since they were increasingly in positions of power.

4) Finally, trends like continuing Anglicanism probably also contributed to (3), since those who would otherwise identify with the current GOP left. This is especially important if we consider that a lot of those from more conservative educational backgrounds (like Trinity and Nashotah House) formed the backbone of the groups setting up these organizations, instead of continuing on in TEC hierarchy (which, admittefly, was growing increasingly less amenable to their positions). 

I don't think this is exhaustive, but I'd argue that these reasons were important. ",1477958938

The story of Skyrim could very easily be molded into a D&amp;D campaign though, minus an element or two. But it's hard to compare the two as they're very different kinds of games as far as design is concerned.

TL;DR: Look up Skyrim first and see if it interests you before you buy. If you're expecting a D&amp;D-like game, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for a game that evokes a D&amp;D feel, you could do worse.",1477958938

"worldofpvp","t5_2wbvb","It sounds like you are rotating CD's quite well. Since the calming waters nerf I have been using swelling waves a lot as it makes it so much easier to top yourself. 

But what dakkoott said is correct, it really is on your partners to keep you alive and with your comp you really have alot of CC so there is no real excuse for them being able to train you in to the ground. But also make sure they are not just spaming cc for the sake of it. Shockwaving the DPS when they are not doing a lot of damage can ruin your DR's for when they are doing damage. 

My suggestions are just make sure you are spacing your CDs, EG avoid overlap where possible. Juke early, even if it means your health ends up low, you can use a CD to stabilize and can then freecast to top yourself. Also be very careful of where you kite as this can make it hard for your mage to peel.

So while you should continue to honor the way you bond and empathize with people, you should also work towards giving yourself permission to stop caring about people that don't appreciate it.",1477958941

Now, I don't want to say that Trump is a Russian puppet, but that's what these sources are saying. And I mean, he did want to take a [Pro-Russia stance in Ukraine] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html) and he does [have strong financial ties to Russia!] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-trumps-financial-ties-to-russia-and-his-unusual-flattery-of-vladimir-putin/2016/06/17/dbdcaac8-31a6-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html)

Also, it looks like Donald Trump might just have donated to a Russian organization, found in the same black book as Manafort's pay stubs! It looks like Trump is a donor to САММЛА, and that's what the best sources are saying!

"PSVR","t5_3102i","I'm not sure there's a magic answer for everyone on this. My first VR experience (on day one) was Loading Human. If you haven't played it, it's a very slow paced first person environment. You use your hands to pick up and investigate stuff and more or less walk around this sci-fi installment solving puzzles. 

I was too lazy to set up my motion controllers on day one, so I just used the DS4. I could only get through the tutorial. I was so seriously nauseated that I had to quit. I was also super pissed and disappointed because I instantly thought VR is not for me. I hung it up for the night and came back several days later. I decided to try some other demos before jumping back into it. I think they helped me gradually get over the disorientation. I tried Loading Human again, but this time with the move controllers. It felt much better the 2nd time around. 

At this point I'm no longer worried about any of the games. The trick for me is just to take them slow, and the second I start feeling disoriented, I stop playing and take a break. If I return 20-30 minutes later, I'm usually good to go.

A final thought. I have serious concerns about the quality of VR games. Leading up to VR, I think everyone kinda fantasized about ""oh, how sweet would this game be in VR"". At this point I realize that gaming as we've known it for a long time might not be able to make it's way to VR because of motion sickness, and if it does, it'll very likely be accompanied by wonky controls that help alleviate it. I'm not saying great games will never come out for VR; I'm just skeptical that my personal fantasy for VR will ever be realized. ",1477958944

You need to be able to trust their judgment on what medications will work for you. You need to be confident that you can bring your concerns to their attention and have a discussion about them. You need to trust they have your best interests at heart and truly want you to be the best you can be. 

That's no lt what you have going on and you aren't going to have a better relationship with this person. You should look into someone else, even if that means starting all over. This is your health, your future at risk here. You wouldn't put up with crap service at McDonald's so why put up with it for a prescription? 

I've had a variety of doctors and psychiatrists. I had one like you who often compared my issues and concern with other people's lives. I was stressed about not keeping up with chores and she went into how she managed to do it with 3 kids, husband and a full time job. When upset that I didn't think I could handle going back to school she said people have it worse than I did and make it work. I hated seeing her, dreaded my appointments and never really worked on anything suggested because I hated her. The next one was amazing and listened, suggested meds, responded to messages fast, valued my input. It was great. Then she retired.

Whenever you are driving and you encounter an idiot (someone cuts you off, doesn't use their turn indicator, refuses to drive at an acceptable speed) you press the idiot button and identify the car.  That driver gets a -1.

Whenever you encounter a good driver (gives you a safe following distance, allows you to merge, uses their turn indicator) you press the saint button and identify the car.  That driver gets a +1.

When I signed up for my IDC, it was from friendly neighbourhood LDC and while I liked the person who would be teaching the course, I was sceptical and was only doing the IDC to facilitate a crossover to my clubs agency - it was going to be much faster than getting the planets to align and get it done outside of PADI.


As it turned out, my IDC Instructor was perhaps the best instructor I have met - outside of myself that is! - and she seriously sold me on good sides of PADI.

If you're using the Cross Hotbar (i.e. a controller) you need to use the /crosshotbar command instead.  However, in the case of using a controller, there's an additional bit of functionality you can put onto it.  Because the /crosshotbar command only affects the *current* Cross Hotbar, if you slot the macro into your Double Cross Hotbar, it won't change what Hotbar the Double Cross Hotbar is set to, instead changing the currently-selected normal Hotbar.  This allows you to place in it the two macros (since it needs to actually be two macros, rather than one) that change to, effectively, your ""below 54"" and ""54+"" Hotbars, instead of using a slot on those specific Hotbars to swap to the other one.",1477958948

"sportsbook","t5_2s3v4","From a page I follow on Facebook, good read:


Somewhat of a precursor to the big writeup, the rules of winning the Melbourne Cup.

1) Eliminate any horse 7 or older.

If we go back 50 years to when Light Fingers won the Cup, and started a 3 year streak for Bart. Only 4 horses 7 or older have won since then (all of them 7). What a Nuisance in 1985, won on a bog which he loved, and most of the rest hated. Vintage Crop in 1993 (who will appear again soon), he was a dual Group 1 winning stayer in England, and they are a lot better at that caper than us. Rogan Josh in 1999, who had won the Herbert Power and Mackinnon on his way to the Cup. And in 2005, the mighty mare Makybe Diva won her 3rd Melbourne Cup as a 7yo (She will also feature later).

So who does that rule out for this years Cup?

2. Our Ivanhowe
3. Curren Mirotic
7. Who Shot Thebarman
8. Wicklow Brave
9. Almoonqith
11. Grand Marshall 
13. Heartbreak City
14. Sir John Hawkwood
15. Excess Knowledge
17. Almandin
21. Secret Number
23. Qewy
24. Rose of Virginia

2) Eliminate any horse carrying 57 or more.

Since we went metric in '72, there have been but 3 horses to carry 57 or more, Gold and Black in '77, who was runner up in '76, and a horse that would have a far better record if he remained healthy, Think Big in '75, to complete his Cups double, and the mighty mare again, carried 58 when winning her 3rd in 2005.

Gone are

1. Big Orange
2. Our Ivanhowe

3) Eliminate any horse without a lead up run in Australia.

This is the big one, takes out a lot of the field. Not sure why a lot of overseas trainers refuse to give their horses a lead in, when year after year this rule rings true. In fact, in 153 runnings of the Cup, only 1 horse has won without a lead in, one that was mentioned before in Vintage Crop. I couldn't tell you the exact number of horses that have tried and failed on this, but it is somewhere near 100 just in the time since Vintage Crops success.

1. Big Orange
3. Curren Mirotic
4. Bondi Beach 
8. Wicklow Brave
13. Heartbreak City
16. Beautiful Romance
21. Secret Number

4) Eliminate any horse paying more than $21 (Fixed price)

Typically the punters are pretty on to it for the big race. Going back to 1988, only Tawriffic, Viewed and Prince of Penzance have won paying more than the above quote. Green Moon did pay $26 on the tote, buy you were getting a touch of overs there.

2. Our Ivanhowe
3. Curren Mirotic
7. Who Shot Thebarman
10. Gallante
11. Grand Marshal 
14. Sir John Hawkwood
15. Excess Knowledge 
16. Beautiful Romance
18. Assign
19. Grey Lion
21. Secret Number
22. Pentathlon
24. Rose of Virginia

So who does that leave?

5. Exospheric
6. Hartnell 
12. Jameka
20. Oceanographer

LOL. The US don't need a drop of Iraqi oil. It only needs Iraq to sell oil in the world market at a steady rate, so prices are stable. I guess you believe that the US presence in the middle east is because of the war of terror. LOL We have presence in the middle  and we invest billions in aid and military because we need to maintain oil producing countries as stable as possible. The war in Iraq positioned the US to do just that. Strong military presence smack in the middle of the richest oil region in the world.

The US must, by any and all means necesary protect world oil supplies. Hundreds of billions are spent on this, directly and indirectly.  Those hundreds of billions must be added to the price of oil, but it won't be added. The forces involved are too powerful.",1477958951

I also certainly empathize with the folks who are jaded with the system and think no true progress will be made by supporting corrupt/entrenched bureaucrats, though I disagree personally. Basically comes down to whether you think a major political/cultural revolution would be possible to root out the corruption in government, and realistically I think slow, incremental change under the current system is more likely to succeed.",1477958954

I think once we have several hundred people, we won't have problem with complex structures. We probably can make metal sheet and glass out of martian material by then. It's all a question of civil engineering and architecture.

the big problem is at early stage, a hundred people or so. large enough number that temporary capsules are not sufficient, but not enough manpower to build proper structure.

I have never seen a report trying to answer how exactly we are going to build a small settlement from first person up to 200 person or so.  At that number, they have to build rudimentary farm, water supply, hospital,  machine depot, and probably machine control room. A meeting room to fit 10-20 people are probably a must.

all those has to be flown from earth. in tiny 10-20 tons package. (or whatever carrying capacity of future rocket would be.) SLS probably can do 150 tons per trip with low orbit assembly.

I'm not sure how realistic it is for me try again to raise my GRE scores considering how much time I put into studying for the first two tests (half a year all together) and still fell short of my goal, but if there are no other options I'll definitely look into delaying another year, paying for some serious tutoring, and applying during the next cycle!

I wish to work at one of the aforementioned companies as they, combined with the auto industry (I'll never work within this industry), account(ed) for many of the jobs everyone I grew up with in the Midwest used to have and I therefore find the most interesting. From their supply chains to the variety of products that they sell and people consume everyday without even knowing it! It's my own opinion, but I feel there are way too many people within the halls of Washington making policy that have not for one second in their life worked in the private sector, and I would not like to add to their ranks. 

I would like to gain the business skills and acumen within the industries of one of the companies I named so that I can gain a deeper understanding of how some of the larger companies that employ so many Americans truly operate. That's why I would like to do a rotational program (gain a large degree of exposure and learn as much as possible before choosing a specific role) and why I'm not aiming for something like MBB/Google/etc.

I would then like to take this experience and work in DC (Treasury, Commerce, USTR, Ways and Means Committee, etc.) or within an economic development organization, state legislature, or other related nonprofit within the Midwest. 

In addition, on a practical note, there's also the thought here in DC that you should always have a backup career (law, finance, whatever) that you can go into if you're an appointed official as administrations come and go in the blink of an eye and you still need a job (unless you're independently wealthy) while you're waiting for the next administration or round of appointments.

"JudgeMyAccent","t5_2ufiq","""I'm also not sure **about** the **pin** versus pen...**might** have **caused** them to blend together...what I might **have**...The banker wrote down my bank **pen** ""

**about** Canadian raising on the diphthong.  Usually only found in Canada, and states like North Dakota, and Montana
**pin** You used a vowel close to the pen vowel, although you did distinguish the vowels this time.
**might** Canadian raising on the diphthong.  Found in Canada, but also a very large region of the US.

**caused** Vowel sounded very unrounded.  No Canadian or California shift, which indicates that your accent is very conservative (sounds like how everyone talked many decades)  Nowadays many young people in Canada and the Western US would use a more rounded vowel, but many male speakers still do not have the shift.

**pen** You said bank pen, instead of pin.  This is either the Canadian and California shift, or a transitional merger of pin and pen, which means that sometimes you merge them, and other times you don't.  More evidence for that is the fact that you don't perceive yourself as merging them, so it is not a complete merger.  It is very noticeable to people without the merger.

If I were to guess where you were from, I would guess Canada, and if that wasn't correct, I would guess that you are from somewhere in the Midwestern US not far from the border, or perhaps Montana, and if that was not correct, I would guess somewhere in the far Western US.

I am basing my guesses on the word ""about"" and to a much lesser extent on the word ""pin"".  The rest of it sounds completely generic American newscaster accent to me.

As for social class--North America doesn't really have class accents, just regional accents and some ethnic accents.  If you don't believe me, listen to a recording of Bill Gates, who is from Seattle, and compare your accent to his.  It would be virtually indistinguishable.  There is nothing stigmatized about your accent, and it doesn't sound uneducated.

As for ethnicity, you don't have anything in your accent that would indicate it, it just sounds like a neutral Anglo-Saxon accent, but since you specifically asked about that, you probably identify as something else.",1477958964

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","&gt;  On top of that, once the infrastructure is installed you've paid for the majority of your ""bandwidth"" costs. All that's left is electricity, maintenance, and occasional upgrades. 

And I'm guessing the only reason the idea was tenable in the first place and why they went forward with it is because of this pricing model they knew they would deploy.

This is like saying a pharmaceutical that spends lots on R&amp;D for a drug and then wants to charge $100 for it should charge only $1 for the drug because they already spent on the R&amp;D. In fact, they invest in spending on R&amp;D expecting some payoff in the future. It's the same idea here.

&gt;Facebook is in it for the money. Period. They see a new revenue stream. They're going to get a major wealth of information from the people using their service, and they'll have a captive audience for targeted advertising.

Totally agree. But that idea is not mutually exclusive with the idea that the users will also benefit from having Free Basics.

&gt;They'll become the sole channel of Internet access for millions of people, and will have the ability to utterly control the medium.

Here's where you lost me, because you're projecting evil onto the company and their intentions. They don't limit what's on Free Basics as long as new services/content abide by their technical requirements. And as far as I understand, they don't limit what's on the ""full internet"" mode at all.

1) We can't get a save. Team SV% right now is below .900 so yes, any defensive gaffe is in the back of the net. Presumably Andersen and Enroth will be better going forward, but this is not a factor in what is traditionally considered ""Team Defence"".

2) So having said that, imagine the same defensive zone coverage with 3 or 4 fewer goals against. All of a sudden it isn't so hard to understand how they could be pushing play and winning scoring chance percentages. There's always a weird mental block when the number say they're getting more chances but the team is losing. It *looks* bad, but it isn't! They are actually getting more and better chances than the teams they are playing against. They aren't giving up more chances or worse chances, Andersen just hasn't made a save.",1477958968

"pokemongo","t5_34jka","Hi. Even if I'm ""a poor man"", I understand your position. I have rejected any hatch or catch bellow 80%, even if they are rares or favourites of mine, and I have a bunch of Arcanines which are stronger than anything on my team but I won't use for the same reason. The 82% Dratini I hatched the other day? I would have just kept it as no more than a trophy if it was a 3% less, but now I have a nice Dragonair instead. So, yeah, perfectionism can make a bit off sense to a ""poor man"".

So, you could, for example, rest a J-Ruler and draw a card, or draw two cards, or rest two resonators.

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","Here's my take:

A problem with asking a question like this is that you're getting very generalized answers. There's no single, average graduate school experience that's worth noting. Every school has a different culture, as will every department, and while there are certainly a lot of things in common, the differences really, really matter. For that matter, your own individual disposition plays a huge part in how you approach graduate school. In other words, you'd be wrong to follow the ""average"" advice in a certain sense. (As a test of this, if you'd like, I bet I could play devil's advocate to all the other advice given in this thread; it's not that other people are wrong, it's just that there's two sides to every story--especially in graduate school!).

But here's some advice about graduate school that I don't think you'll hear: don't think about ""you time"", don't compare yourself to other students, don't worry about how much you are publishing or not publishing, don't stress yourself out when you don't know where to start or where you'll end up. Don't *think* about what you should be doing; just *do*.

Graduate school is, for many people, the first time in their lives that they will *truly* generating *new* knowledge. That's not easy. It's not trivial. It involves a lot of mistakes, a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of doubt. My advice: accept the discomfort. Don't fight it. Don't complain about it. Don't set strict rules for yourself. Just take each day as it comes, do the best work you can, and be honest with yourself; any graduate student who begins to rationalize their lack of productivity is going to struggle. 

Of course, success in graduate school involves some luck, as well--and that's part of the discomfort you'll have to accept. Because, in my experience, the students that fail to accept it just fall farther and farther behind. 

For what it's worth, the discomfort of graduate school never really goes away--and it shouldn't. Academia is tough because the sky's the limit in terms of one's potential productivity. It's not a job your signing up for; it's a lifestyle--one that comes with a lot of discomfort. The experience *will* be rewarding at the end of the day, but you've got to be ready to accept the discomfort in the meantime.

If the design you're looking at is just line work, if I was doing it, I would expect roughly an hour for a palm sized cactus. 

For your very first try, my advice would be to do one or two pretty simple, small designs on the top of your thigh just to get a better feel for what you're doing before you do an openly visible tattoo. It took me 2 or 3 tries to start developing my own rhythm and feel comfortable with basic designs.

Damn, that game was just amazing.

Thanks for saying this, this game has one of the best driving mechanics in a First Person Shooter. I remember at the time Black Ops 2 was bragging about how it will have good driving segments, which turned out to be you hitting the accelerator and the player barely having to do anythin else, it really disappointed me how scripted they were.

But Medal of Honor: warfighter? I really enjoyed the driving parts, it just felt way better. More realistic fights. I really hope for a sequel. But that's too much to ask for, since EA is focusing on Battlefield and Battlefront for now.",1477958972

Debatable. You don't *have* to live in whatever country you live in. You can move to some piece of shit, empty island if you want and pay no taxes. Hell, you could even move to the rural Canada or something and live off the land. Your life will be miserable and bleak, but the government won't bother you.

Also, the Brazilian income tax laws are probably going to apply to the money he makes while he's here too, and that is factoring into his decision not to participate.

I would have done the same, but seriously watch touching kids even as a guiding motion. 

I had a kid a few years back burst into tears in the after school program I ran. I helped her to her feet, calmed her down, mentioned that my setting may not be the place for her and I would help her find something she would be more engaged in and sent her to the bathroom. 

Well, she had to tell her mom something about why she couldn't go to my setting anymore. So she told mom I yanked her to her feet and yelled at her. 
Three interviews with student witnesses later and I escaped from that school. Despite all of the evidence, witnesses, former background of lying and behavior problems in class, my principal gave me a nice big push under the bus. 

I can't walk into that building without bursting into tears. I'm still in the same district and we have trainings there sometimes. Hell, I even still have nightmares about the principal.

Cryomancer is really good as well huge nukes. 

Thief of hours has a 4-second damage reflect which, if timed right, can kill your opponent without you touching them. Same goes for Chrono Assassin except Chrono assassin hits faster and dodges more, if you are a member you can farm for this class.

"GrowCastle","t5_3ey9r","I agree that not a lot of people seem to utilize this tool too well.  BUT I want to offer a couple of **imperative** points to do with the video and the Battle Result and why you should ALWAYS be skeptical of the results as they will not give you a REAL result but only a 'general' idea:

-  It has been proven that the Battle Result does NOT take enemy HP into account for its total result unlike the Total Damage counter for Hell Mode does.  Instead, it seems to take into accout the total Potential Damage a unit could have done.  If you need to see an example for this, run against a super easy Dragon (I use Black Dragon), and fight with only 1 or 2 Heroes.  Black Dragon only has 440,000 HP but my Voodoo does over 1 million dmg and my Ranger does 350,000 dmg on the Battle Result.  Oh also, theres only 5 other enemies who show up whom have super low HP (less than 1000) of course.  I kill the Dragon in less than a second when he lands so you can obviously see where the results make no sense here.  Quite simply, lets say you have a unit that hits an enemy for 500 dmg but the enemy only had 100 HP, the Battle Result will say 500 dmg on it and NOT 100, thus taking into account ""overdamage."" It can be even more skewed with 2 units:  if X does 500 dmg, Y does 200 and an enemy has 300 HP and both X and Y hit once, the Battle Result will say 200 for Y and 500 for X, at least this is what has been theorized to this point. Another and even more obvious way to do this is run Hell Mode with only your Town Archers then some high base dmg unit who is bursty such as Flame Ogre or even better, Fire Sorcerer with the other 2 Wizards to his side.  I just ran one where my Total Dmg for Hell was 14.4 million dmg but my Fire Sorcerer did 24 million dmg alone on the Battle Result while my next best did 6.3 million.  So as you can see, you have to look at it skeptically (especially if using units that deal tons of damage over time like Voodoo and high bursty dmg like Fire Wizard).

- another thing is not to sweat too much the placement of most towers.  The range does not change if you move them closer or further away and elevation will not have an overwhelming impact on the dmg output.  The only minor (and very minor at that) difference you will see is travel distance of a projectile.  But i have tested it in my afk builds in the past and have seen next to no difference in average dmg outputs.  The only one that showed any real importance of position (minus Gold Castle) is Barracks.  They do lose about  2 - 3 seconds of running to the enemy if Barracks is placed on the left and not the right which is that much more time they are not attacking or that much closer melee enemies are getting to you.

Anyways, a good video and thank you for posting.  Just make sure to keep these in mind though.",1477958977

"Seahawks","t5_2ryle","Lynch was not voted into any Pro Bowls until he was paired with Wilson.  He always went as an alternate - and pretty deep down the list.  Prior to being paired with Wilson, Lynch averaged 3.99 YPC for his career (2007-2011) which ranked 36th in the NFL among RBs with at least 500 carries during that time frame.  With Buffalo (2007-2009+), Lynch averaged 4.02 YPC.  With the Seahawks before Wilson, Lynch averaged 3.96 YPC (most of 2010 and 2011).

Remember, too, that in 2010 and 2011, the NFCW was regarded as the NFCWorst.  Lynch was not producing yardage while playing bad defenses regularly.  In 2010, the Seahawks played a schedule of opposing rush defenses with average Football Outsiders rush defense ranking of 17.8.  Lynch averaged 3.65 YPC in 2010, 40th in the NFL among RBs with at least 100 carries that year.  In 2011, the Seahawks played a schedule of opposing rush defenses with average ranking of 14.7 and Lynch averaged 4.22 YPC, good for 31st in the NFL.

It wasn't until the next year with Wilson at QB that Lynch exploded.  He averaged 5.05 YPC in 2012.  By 2012, SF, Arizona, and St. Louis all had excellent or better than average rush defenses.  The Seahawks schedule of opposing defense got harder, and Lynch did better than ever.  A significant portion of that had to be that defenses had to respect the threat of Wilson on the edge, opening gaps on the interior for Lynch.  Wilson had a profound effect on how we all perceive Lynch.",1477958978

Man I hate that. When I was young I wanted to play Streetfighter with my brother but the women were wearing such skimpy uncomfortable-looking outfits, it put me off so bad. I always played as Vega because he had long hair and a mask and I could kind of pretend he was a woman.

I am a lesbian but I feel a sort of affinity/empathy with other women first and foremost which overrides attraction. Meaning that I look at a character like Cammie's uniform - a tiny leotard that shows her butt cheeks and gives her a front wedgie - and all I can think is ""Bleeeg that would be so uncomfortable"". I can literally feel myself getting a front wedgie.

However, gradually, he has grown on me.  I started to appreciate his good work in the ring (definitely underrated), and I'm starting to enjoy his personality.  He has a good but subtle sense of humor, and he downplays stuff in a way that leads to interesting interactions.

I still dislike Cesaro (he's a dork, and his moves are way too gimmicky/fanciful), but Sheamus is really growing on me, and this storyline is generally interesting (New Day gradually turning heel, Shaemus/Cesaro morphing in to a legit powerhouse face team).

&gt;...If an entire community, which **can** consist of up to millions of people...

Didn't say anything about the SMITE community. If you're going to twist my words, please make sure it's something I **actually** said.

&gt; More like the Reddit community where 90% of the people think Loki should get removed from the game

See: shitpost.

&gt; dam who knew No its not wrong you can miss KKK 1 as easily as Ullr 1 sure they have different travel speed but the skills and prediction is the same shit

First of all can you please format your rambling so my eyes don't bleed? Secondly, while prediction is still used (who woulda thunk?) if you were to lead a target with an Ullr axe at the exact same degree you would lead a target with KKK 1 you **will** miss. Prediction is required with every god, not arguing with you there but the slower travel time **does** require a greater degree of prediction and leading the target. **Period**.

&gt; Ullr axe is not harder to hit then any straight line ability.

See my previous answer.

&gt; Oh yea I forgot he has a physical power buff too thanks and lets not forgot about his axe stance life steal

... you **did** read my response right? Y'know, where I specifically said

&gt; ...just as how he has extra lifesteal in melee

It might be nice to read an entire comment in future, rather than just filtering to see only what you want to see :)

&gt; Ne zha is a god I really struggle with but just because I suck with him doesn't mean he is hard to play now is he:/

I'm just gonna change a few words here

&gt;Ne zha is a god I'm really amazing with but just because I steamroll with him doesn't mean he is easy to play now is he:/

see how ridiculous that point is? or how about:

&gt; Neith is a god I'm really amazing with but just because I steamroll with her doesn't mean she is easy to play now is she:/

No two men are equal - in a given scenario people with perceive differently, think differently and respond differently. How then do you think using subjectivity such as ""I'm good with *x*"" or ""I suck at *y*"" will help you win an argument? If you want to argue with me, use **objective** points, use **facts** and **then** I'll take you seriously.

&gt; People are just intimated by Ullr stance changing because some ""special"" people think their god should be the best out there and are quite vocal about it

Ullr's not the only one who can get intimate if you know what I mean ;) 

(the word you're looking for is **intimidated**, please edit your response before you post it)

Back on topic, I wouldn't say people are *intimidated* by his stance switching, it's the versatility that comes *with* the ever-present stance-dance. No two engagements are the same, and as such the most optimal stance and ability use will (very rarely) be the same. It's people who (imo) can't read a situation quickly enough to react with the proper stance switch or ability use.

Also sure, who doesn't want their favourite god to be OP, I've joked around on numerous occasions about giving Ullr damage immunity during his stance change animation (see: shitpost) but that's irrelevant (subjectivity and all that).

&gt; Ullr is not mechanically challenging in no way.

Formatting, and considering his greatest strength comes from correct stance-dancing and use of stance passives I'd say that he is. **If** you're referring to his abilities alone then yes he's easy, but SMITE isn't *about* looking at one ability alone, it's what that ability does in relation to a god's kit that makes it challenging; Ullr has multiple skillshot abilities, a stance switch on a 1 second cooldown and any abilities used in one stance will reduce cooldowns on the other stance. Anyone can use those abilities, but min-maxing them for the greatest effectiveness (**outside** of the famous A1-4-B3-B1) requires a high degree of mechanical skill.

&gt; Just because he has 6 different ability doesn't make him ""harder"" to play or master then any other hunter

Play? I'd agree, his abilities are straight forward and simple. Master? no. It takes time to understand all the very subtle nuances of his kit and how abilities can be made to flow into one another, not just *anyone* can do that.

&gt; in fact I think Ullr has a advantage in boxing 

I agree with this completely. Ullr is an amazing boxer with AA's alone, weaving abilities in at the correct time can make him almost unstoppable in a 1v1.

&gt; because of his extra **6** ability

**2**. normal gods have **4** abilities, not zero.

The result you suggest should be discounted because it does not fit the evidence given. If worker coops could pay better by cutting out the owner, or w/e, then they could also lower prices instead of paying better, and pay the same amount, and thus put all capitalist enterprises out of business entirely.

The fact that this doesn't happen is a major problem for people pushing coops as a higher-paid or more efficient structure. It must be explained, because workers generally don't care what structure a company uses, they care about the wage on offer. It's very hard to argue they've been brainwashed into only taking a traditional job therefore, etc.",1477958983

The FBI is pursuing the Russia investigation and some serious charges are coming against Trump or people in his campaign. It's going to be a bombshell and people are going to prison, stuff like that. Because of the national security implications this investigation is being held closer to the chest; a lot fewer people internally know about it so they can better control leaks.

Comey and the FBI have been heavily criticized for not recommending charges against Clinton in July. If that was followed up with bringing down the hammer on Trump there'd be tremendous partisan backlash. ""Comey's in the pocket of the Clintons and sending their enemies to jail"", etc. Comey perceives this and worries the FBI will be seen as a partisan actor. There's tremendous pressure and that's manifested as this sloppy decision to announce the investigation of more emails of Clinton's. Comey knows it looks like shit but thinks it will provide some insulation to the coming bombshell, which is the important thing.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt; and the people Jimi apparently named as the greatest were numerous.

For the record, the two references that I've heard the most in this context are

1. That Jimi called Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top ""America's best young guitar player"" on the Dick Cavett Show

2. That Jimi told Walter Parazaider (saxophonist for Chicago) that ""your guitarist [Terry Kath] is better than I am""

Everything in his life points to Jimi being one of the most humble and introspective artists in the history of rock and roll, and he gave major props to everyone he met along the way. 

Selfishly I want to defend Terry Kath's inclusion here because he was in a horn-based rock band and didn't have the same chance to showcase himself as most of the other oft-mentioned greats. And as far as the legions of guitarists inspired by Jimi, no one has ever played Hendrix-like-Hendrix the way that Shawn Lane did.

If you didn't know better, you'd think this clip of him playing [""All Along the Watchtower""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkjp4r8wINA) at a Target reunion show was a dude given the fucking Pick of Destiny or some shit. Plays the first half of the solo as a tribute to Jimi then the guitar just fucking melts in his hands.

Lots of Goodwills has no idea about what's actually valuable, lots of stores that I've been to usually mark up mall brands like Tommy Bahama, Lucky Brand and True Religion really high, while they left tons of Tellason, Gant Rugger and Brioni on the $5 rack.

I usually look at the ""boutique"" section first when visiting a thrift store for the first time, as an indicator of their brand knowledge, if you see a lot of Banana Republic and J.

As it was, she was a total write-off. His *Griffin,* a precious family heirloom from before the Fall of the Star League had survived all four Succession Wars, the 4th Andurien War and the Word of Blake's Jihad. But it hadn't survived him. 

The Grif's main weapon, a Fusigon Longtooth ER PPC was a charred lump of metal and wire, its capacitors and energy banks torn apart by autocannon fire. Its shoulder mounted LRM-20 had absorbed a burst of fire meant for his cockpit, while the torso and limbs were crisscrossed with laser scoring and deep hatchet wounds. Its leg actuators had seized up forever, joints and myomer melted as one. Only its left arm still functioned... of sorts. But the gore and dried blood which caked the hand actuator made efforts at moving each metal digit laborious and time-consuming. A few would-be hijackers had learned the hard way not to mess with Deshler. They hadn't survived the lesson. 

He knelt there before the smoking remains covered in sweat and grime, feeling as battered and battle-worn as his 'Mech. He had piloted her since he was a young boy pretending to be a man, and as a young man pretending to be a leader. He'd poured countless hours into her maintenance, slept in her, fought in her, and almost died in her numerous times. It was more a home than anything else Deshler had. And now she was gone.

Most successful test takers put in at least 200 hours worth of study time within a 3-4 month time frame. So while 100 hours may seem like a lot, you need to put in your even more hours and double your study time each week. A lot of the progress comes near the 200 hour mark (for me I saw significant progress at the 250 hour mark) so you just need to keep pushing.

Other than putting in the time, you have to study correctly. I can't point to any specific GRE website/resource since I studied for the GMAT but I'm sure there is a GRE equivalent to a site like GMAT club. Look up studying and test taking strategies written by successful test takers and you'll start noticing a pattern.

True, but OTOH SF2 involves using...Specials and normals. And supers if you're playing a ""new"" enough version :)

I like the V system because it introduces a small specific thing for each character without having a wide mechanic that potentially breaks a lot of things. FA breaks convetional footsies. Fortunately enough, SFIV's behavior allowed for its specific footsies to develop. I think parries break footsies a little less because at least you're still guessing low/high, so you can't just parry at the proper distance and be safe like you'd be with an FA.",1477958996

&gt; SEOUL The woman at the center of a political scandal that has cast the South Korean presidency into crisis was detained late on Monday, Yonhap News Agency reported, hours after she had arrived at the office of local prosecutors to answer questions.

&gt; Prosecutors are investigating allegations that Choi Soon-sil used her friendship with President Park Geun-hye to influence state affairs by gaining access to classified documents and benefited personally through non-profit foundations, a prosecution official said earlier.

&gt; In an interview with South Korea&amp;#039;s Segye Ilbo newspaper published on Thursday, Choi said she received drafts of Park&amp;#039;s speeches after Park&amp;#039;s election victory but denied she had access to other official material, or that she influenced state affairs or benefited financially.

"canberra","t5_2r584","Every state uses a modified coat of arms on its state flag. Only the Northern Territory uses the floral emblem instead of the coat of arms. So I guess you've got consistency going for you.

I can't agree with you that changing it to the flower is going to provide the benefits that you claim it will. Has use of the floral emblem in Northern Territory created accessible iconography that demonstrates ""Northern Territoriness""? The flower doesn't represent any more ""Canberraness"" than the coat of arms does. It was chosen in 1982 and is also found in NSW and Victoria. If we surveyed Canberrans about iconic Canberra imagery, how high would this flower be on the list? I don't think it is iconic now and I don't think it would come to be with a flag change.

Looking at the Canberra coat of arms and how the states' flags have been designed, I can see Ivo Ostyn did a poor job of simplifying the coat of arms in the first place. Other designs have taken a single aspect of the coat of arms and chosen to use that. In my opinion, the most successful state flags which create 'accessible iconography' are WA and Tas, both of which use the coat of arms.

I think he should have chosen to focus on the gum tree from the coat of arms to use on the ACT flag. An argument to focus on that iconography might be more persuasive, as at least that has some symbolism behind it: ""Behind the portcullis is a gum tree which represents the growth and progress of Canberra, and the fact that it is garden city"". This represents far more compelling and accurate iconography for Canberra than the proposed flower.

Unfortunately, he did not do this. And to win my support to change something as important as a flag, the change must be a meaningful improvement. Looking nicer is not a good enough reason to change a flag and I don't believe ease to draw is a pertinent issue for a state flag. I also reject the assertion that a coat of arms that heavily references government is inappropriate for the flag of a city which only exists because the seat of government is here. While the city obviously has much more to it than politics, you cannot deny that the presence of the government forms the very core of being for the city. (As an aside, I think Canberra locals sometimes have a bit of a chip on their shoulder over this fact.)",1477959001

Whereas the sorcerer at level 3 functions as a great force multiplier and can be had for about 150 points (170 in termie armor)

A general rule of thumb though is that if your army can take a psyker, and is playing against psykers, then you better bring a psyker. 

Even if I'm looking for a closer combat character I like to choose the dark apostle first because atleast then I'm guaranteed hatred.

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","On the bottleneck, yes. The X8SIL-F has a pair of PCIe 2.0 x8 slots, and a PCIe 1.1 x4 in an x8 slot. Which means max throughput on the third slot is 1GB/sec, which is about 250MB/sec short for the 10G card, and way WAY short for the NICs. 

I would not get that card. There's nothing wrong with it; that's an LSI 9211-8i rebranded as an IBM. The Dell H200 is the same thing just Dell branded with Dell firmware and you can pick it up for [$45 shipped](http://www.ebay.com/itm/191853176051). There's a [Guide to crossflashing them to LSI firmware](https://techmattr.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/updated-sas-hba-crossflashing-or-flashing-to-it-mode-dell-perc-h200-and-h310/) done by /u/techmattr so you can go to IT mode. The only problem is the cables might be short for getting to the ports - I had that problem - so an [H310 might work better](http://www.ebay.com/itm/371774366976) and can be had for the same price. Both are functionally identical to the one you linked, and way way cheaper.

For a cheaper motherboard, I'd still be looking at something from Supermicro or Asrock just for the IPMI, but beyond recommending you stay away from the X8SIL-F. The X9SCM-F seems to be a good choice, but check CPU costs before you jump on one; it's an LGA 1155 motherboard.",1477959002

Kakeru's shadowy routine remains undisturbed until one day, when a diminutive girl from his class, Aya Kitahara, almost discovers him. Their meeting begins a coming-of-age story dealing with blackmail, bullying, revenge, heartbreak and ultimately, redemption.""",1477959003

I don't get it. You go into a sov system where you could literally use only ceptors and bombers, but you fuck that up. You then blame the game for being tilted against you, as though it's somehow CCP's fault that after however years of blobbing, you get a taste of your own medicine, that it's not right that you have some pride in what you've built, and want to defend it?

BoB did some amazing shit before they 'died', it's why they're still talked about with admiration.

You're saying that BoB should have just cowarded out, because that's what's 'good' for them.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","That would make sense but that doesn't seem to be the approach they're taking. Instead, not drinking for a month is seen as a difficult challenge and the people doing it get their friends to donate money. If you need to have a drink during your sober month then you can donate £15, which lets you take that day off from sobriety.

As an almost-non-drinker, it's quite strange to see how normal heavy (to me) drinking is for most people here. The website for the campaign says

&gt; No one said that being a Soberhero was easy. Only the bravest and most fearless heroes will see it through to November without any alcohol touching their lips. You’re doing something amazing – and we salute you.

... and talks how you need to gradually slow down your drinking during September and how you can look forward to hangover-free weekends. This isn't something aimed at problem drinkers.",1477959006

_____

Mario Batalli, after the war, led multiple rebel factions in the Fertile Crossant and the Leavening area during the 70s-80s. The most notable rebels he was familiar with were ""Al-Kebab"" and ""Daesh of Salt"" groups that would later rise to the top again in the 2000s and 2010s. 

These rebels were truly a ferocious force. Multiple villages have been caught in the zone which we call the ""350^o"". Funded by the Libbyan Pie Council, the French-occupied Silk Confederacy, and most surprisingly, the Worcester Shire Elders. At its peak, the joint DoS-KB military featured an impressive North Carolina Class Battleship that was recovered from a dried up basin in the Hershey Sea, 4 F10 Fighter Jets, 2 F51 Mustangs, 1 B29 Superfortress, 30,000 enlisted militants, 100 M4A2 Shermans, and 10 M2A2 Stuarts, all baked in ovens of Mario Batalli.

These militants were nothing to be joking about.

As these factions were rising up, so was Mario. Back home in Italy, Batalli was showing quite impressive skills with his knife, slaughtering innocent heads of lettuce by the dozens, and ripping out hearts of artichokes by the thousands. Being a vegetable was something that you would not want to be during this time.

His weapon of choice? The T.E 30cm Parabellum Chopping Apparatus, Stainless Steel variant, or, in simpler terms, a one foot chef's knife. 

His knife skills and influence in the Fertile Croissant and Leavening Region were his keys to success. Together, the 3 unstoppable forces rose up with the help of the Yeest Collaberteurs, a mercenary spy group consisting of fearless fun guys. They formed the Rete Cibo, (or Food Network in English) with Mario as the Supreme Duce.

Over the years, DoS-K militancy went down, and they eventually laid down their arms and created the Fusilier Omega Olive Defense Aliance or the **FOOD** Alliance if you're the type that favors acronyms.

As the FOOD Alliance grew more and more peaceful, so did Batalli. Batalli eventually stepped down as Supreme Duce and hired others to brainwash his audiences with enticing views of food. You might know some of them, like Bobby Flay, ~~Paula Deen~~ [Has since been terminated by the Duce Secret Police], Alton Brown, and the intimidating Guy Fieri.

Although Food Network still wasn't the ""Food Network"" that us Americans are familiar with. This one was shown exclusively in Italy, in fear of American audiences not understanding the complex humor of Guy Fieri. Eventually, the ban was lifted on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day on the eleventh month of 1999.

Food Network truly has an interesting history, from a Baking Joint Force, Italian Propaganda Network, to the Food Network we know today.

Havok, Cable and Hope have all done their own takes on what is required. Havok as hopelessly naive and assimilationist, Cable as downright utopian in Cable and Deadpool or a realist IR actor after that, and Hope has youthful idealism about saving mutants while retaining Cable's methods. Magneto and Quentin Quire, from the Morrison runs on, experiment in various ways as to what the hard edge of mutant activism requires. Both go in for individually villainy at times and for being part of a stronger mutant group at others.

And he's personally a very flawed man with not much to gain or lose. All he has is the X-Men by now. He has no reputation, no civilian life unlike almost all of his peers. His family is dead, alienated, off world or in much the same position he is. All he has is the fear he can inspire and a handful of loyal supporters. Really, by the end, he just had Emma, Magik and a few kids. Magik had nowhere else to go and Emma was his ex who was entirely complicit in all he had done. Magneto was an ally but plays the same game without trying to be a superhero.

His main story arc along those lines is from Morrison's New X-Men, into Whedon, into Decimation and in Uncanny from then all the way until Bendis's run ends, with Death of X and IvX ending that very long arc for now, presumably.  The question is whether Cyclops was right and will he be vindicated. The answer looks to be yes and yes, and he'll still be hated and feared in universe for it.",1477959008

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not me, but the worst thing I've ever witnessed someone do on Halloween would be committing murder in a public space in front of a ton of families attending the annual Halloween party at the nearby theme park.

Basically, a couple years ago there was a 20-year-old involved in gang activity who pretty much got slashed and stabbed to death outside a shopping mall while lots of people were streaming in and out of it, to and from the theme park. The worst part is that, because it was Halloween, everyone thought it was another Halloween shtick that was part of the festivities until the kid who got attacked just collapsed on the ground and stopped moving.

The cops had to shut down an entire section of the mall to start investigating. My dad, cousins and I would have witnessed the entire thing happen if my dad hadn't realised something was wrong and made us leave the area immediately. We spent a couple hours at the theme park then walked back the same way we came to get to our car.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; All that is to ask... With such disdain for (what I see as) a broad spectrum of fantasy literature, what fantasy literature have you gravitated towards? What works of fantasy do you like? Or are you more of a Sci Fi person?

I *am* more of a scifi person. My father got me started on it more or less from birth. (My parents were trekkies.) 

I wanted to like fantasy more. Really I did. I just haven't been able to read much of it that was good. You're right, there was Tolkien and then a lot of derivative books that got more and more tired as the years went by. Then there was Jordan, and clearly I hate his work. And Martin, who, I haven't read, I think I will like him better from the distance of a TV show. 

I remember Larry Niven wrote a fantasy book I really liked a lot - I think before Jordan's time actually. I'm sorry I can't recall the title, honestly I had a stroke in December and my memory isn't what it used to be. However if you google it I'm sure you'll find it, he has written a lot of books but only one of them was pure fantasy.

He also wrote (IIRC) a series called Dream Park which are scifi where the characters are playing a fantasy game, and it was very good. More SF than fantasy, but good.

And I was gaga over Terry Pratchett's books, which, despite their surface of humor, actually had really good stories, in a fantasy setting. They start out with the first few books packing in as much humor as he can, and then as they go on they become more and more about character and story (still with some humor), until at some point they're really moving and I cried a lot reading. He set out to be ""the douglas adams of fantasy"" as he put it when I saw him, and I think he more than succeeded. He certainly left a much larger body of work behind, and he will be deeply missed by all who met him.

&gt; I see Sci Fi as more open from a story perspective.... Certainly with all of future time and any pseudo science a person could cook up there's no limit to the fantastic things you can do....

As you pointed out there was Tolkien and then decades of derivative works. Meanwhile in SF there was the Lensman series (EE ""Doc"" Smith), then a few derivatives, then people went off in 80 different directions. There's just more variety. A lot of it is crummy, but there is some gold among the chaff. 

&gt; Well, without Tolkien, Narnia might have cemented the Fantasy genre as being just for kids and not adults.

Without Tolkien there would be no Narnia. The authors knew each other, and Lewis wrote the Narnia books as his christian answer to LOTR. Without LOTR, he probably wouldn't have bothered. (He also wrote three books of some of the worst SF I've ever read.) As an adult I've come to see Narnia not as a work of fantasy, but as a series of books of christian propaganda, written in a fantasy *style*. (Mind you, I *like* them, but as an adult I see them more for what his goal was than the surface of fantasy.) 

&gt; But fantasy, perhaps because of its relatively narrow scope, allows for a deeper look into the self. Into the characters. Fantasy, to me, is able to be introspective without distraction. That's worth something, and is in my opinion a big part of why people still read it.

The only reason any novel gets me to read it is that it's *fun*, which is why I assumed people read fantasy. And more power to them! I actually wish I liked it more... and for that matter I wish I liked more SF authors. Many of the authors I loved have died (I have autographs on my theremin from people who have died. :( ) and I find myself searching for new authors to like. So far I like John Scalzi, but not a lot of the other new authors that are coming up. Maybe David Chiang - I just got one book and so far I've read one story, and it was brilliant, but I don't know yet if it's a fluke.

You can recast your function in a few forms, but none help. For example

y(x) = log(1 - alpha)/log(1 - beta) for alpha = iax and beta = ibx (I think anyway, may've messed up some algebra. Point is, your function is as simple as you get.)

I myself have questioned hit-reg, but Im awful with FPS PC shooters atm, so Im blaming personal skill first. Watching Frothy, Darkness, those high-end streamers, I cant ever see a problem with Hit-Reg from there end which leads me to believe its fine. Keep in mind that Origin was having some DDOS issues over the weekend, and my ping has no settled back down to the ~30 ms it was at launch. Now its ~60 could be a factor. 

I'm not entirely sure which elements of the GUI that youre talking about. UI seems pretty clean and clear, I dont think theres anything that I ask myself ""Why is this being shown to me?"" Got any examples?

I've not had any issues with Titan Executes yet. That sucks to hear though. Also not sure what you're referring to with ""as well as not telling the player that many things can't be used interchangeably, just because of awkward animation swapping that sometimes seems to last way too long."" Using actual in-game examples instead of ambiguous statements would go a long way here.

As for the game being casual, I have no idea what you're talking about, no offense. lol The game has an extremely high skill-ceiling. There's tons of ways for more advanced players to showcase their skill. I absolutely do not agree that this game is for casuals. If your reasoning is because theres no Ranked Mode, then I agree, it would be very nice to have. But, it could be a future feature.

No, but letting yourself get pissed at every asshole you meet will only make it worse.

If you only look for assholes online that's all you'll ever find in the online world. You only need to mute their VOIP on the scoreboard, and all chat if they decide to take it to chat. You'll never get better if you purposely not support the team or him if you let it get to you.

My issue with Valve is that they still haven't implemented individual chat mute (I think you have to actually go into the profile of the person and block them in Dota/steam). And they haven't implemented a better ping spam system, or a block pings/drawings. ",1477959014

"stevenuniverse","t5_2viyl","Yeah none of the votes were close lol. 

**Lars and the Cool Kids** vs Steven the Sword Fighter: Ahhh both good episodes. I have to give credit to Lars and the Cool Kids for making Lars not too annoying, more relatable, and having him learn a lesson. It also introduced Sour Cream, the best secondary male human (yeah that's a bit specific), and some more Rose backstory. The pacing is the only thing Steven the Sword Fighter has over Lars and the Cool Kids (fight me OP). 

Rose's Room vs **The Answer**: I don't like either episode, and it hurts me to vote for The Answer, an episode I don't believe deserved an emmy nomination. Ocean Gem is better and it got eliminated first round because it was against Jailbreak, for example. But alas, there is no good way to order the bracket. The answer lives another day.

Coach Steven vs **Lion 3: Straight to Video**: Another tough one, I love the music in Coach Steven, the pacing, ect but Lion 3 is just too adorable and hits too close at home for me to not vote for it.

Barn Mates vs **Full Disclosure**: Full Disclosure is better paced, deals with a lot of questions about the aftermath of the invasion, has a really underrated song, and is just in general better than Barn Mates. But it's going to lose because Lapis and Peridot. I'd love to be proven wrong though!

Back to the Moon vs **Earthlings**: How odd that the two episodes next to each other are versus each other. Earthlings is better. I didn't like the premise of Back to the Moon. Honestly I think the ending to Season 3 was a bit underwhelming minus the whole ""rose killed diamond girl"", and Back to the Moon is part of that reason. Earthlings just in general was a great way to tie multiple sub plots together and its only obvious flaw is that it needs to be seen with Beta.

QotD: Other than getting it pinned quickly (i don't like having to stalk your reddit history to find the post), I'd say daily polls if possible would be amazing instead of the inconsistency right now (not sure if it's possible though).",1477959014

It will work as in the drive will physically work however if you put a ""new"" HDD in a Ps4 it autoformats it.

I.e. Ps4 has standard HDD (HDD1), you can take this out and put it back in as many times as you want (as long as it's not been in another ps4.)

Now when you put a new HDD (HDD2) in there it formats it. HDD1 can still go back in no problems, and now so can HDD2.

If you get a 2nd Ps4 (Pro or otherwise) as soon as you put HDD1 or 2 in there it will wipe it and format it to be used on that machine. It then would be reformatted if it went back into the original Ps4. 


The easiest way to do it is back up all personal stuff (saves and screenshots) to a usb stick and just reinstall and redownload all your games and dlc. Obviously this depends on your download speed / any caps. This is what I'm doing when I put my current 2tb Ps4 hdd into my Pro. ",1477959016

Exploration/Free roam survival mode

each rover/explorer becomes a robot in a bay and can be used in simufights like TDM and BA

Exploring the game is fun, fighting will show strengths of robots.

Exploring the game will also let you add blocks to the edges of your  maps which will have random regions from other players added - blocks are not pulled from your inventory or controlled by money - your imagination is everything

Random chance of map squares becoming battle zones, decided by AI fights unseen by players

Buy new things like color variations or color schemes. Each theme you buy will be in a gallery and others can buy it too - profits go 60 for freeJam/40 for player who created color scheme

workshop - share your entire planet and choose some squares to become battle grounds

Leagues/Comp play based on biome/theme of map

small map set for comp while mm games can be anywhere and you can add maps you like to your favorite queue - which gives them a chance to show up in future matches you play

Sandbox mode for mm play - bypass the exploration mode and make what you want - level with money or free xp which takes longer",1477959024

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","You should look at the Lilitu from 3.5. It is basically a pokemon-evolved succubus who feeds on/relishes in perverting religious worship rather than sheer charm/lust. It has access to cleric spells, and can appear to be an angel, complete with triggering Detect Good instead of Detect Evil when she's in angel form.

I've used one extensively as a recurring villain but not the core BBEG, and my players really fear her. She regularly adopts new ""prophets"" and grants then great strength and charisma to convert entire towns to worship her, then she dumps them if they let her down. My players have never actually faced her. At this point they could definitely kill her without too much issue, but she's never without minions, and is always on her own turf, and they never know when she'll show up. They're paranoid of all religious figures.

It would make sense for her to appear as a divine message in dreams, but to lead them astray. The Lilitu already had most of the abilities you wanted to give your succubus, plus divine trickery, the ability to mark a prophet with powerful buffs, and powerful telepathy, which she uses to appear as a divine messenger.

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","First of all, canon is not real/stupid/a ridiculous concept/a spook.

Ace travels with the Doctor in Big Finish after the Time's Vigilante and Gallifrey stuff - see The New Adventures of Bernice Summerfield and The Prisoner's Dilemma. All the Hex audios have to be after the New Adventures, in fact. So there's no reason for Ground Zero to not be the end of her life, after however many years she spends with as Time's Vigilante, on Gallifrey, and with the Doctor again. She doesn't have to age anymore at all - Leela didn't.

The Doctor Who wiki is *very* flawed a lot of the time, and missing a ton of stuff.",1477959025
"FalloutMods","t5_2s6oc","Nope. There's like one other person insisting this is an issue with UFO4P installed but we have not been able to reproduce it.

Chances are Bethesda simply botched something that doesn't happen very often so nobody can get a handle on what's going on.

I've even taken saves from people who say they have this only to find out they work fine when I load them up and can assign people wherever I want.",1477959025
