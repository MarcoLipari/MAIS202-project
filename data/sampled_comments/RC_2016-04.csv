Now, I know this only applies to those who have watched multiple seasons, but I think it's something to take into account if we are going to compare the type of hate AHS gets to the type of hate that something like TWD gets.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I agree that public health is very important. I think it's imperative to offer education on good nutrition and access to healthy food for all. The problem with public health efforts is that by the time research is being translated into actual messaging the research  is changing. Nutrition is a relatively young science. The first vitamin wasn't discovered until the 1930s. The advice that has been given, low fat diet mainly, has been highly detrimental to public health including the invention of industrial trans fats and our processed food system replacing fat with simple carbohydrates. Hello diabetes and weight gain. Hi, insulin is released when the body senses sugar in the bloodstream. Insulin is an anabolic hormone, read fat storage. Replacing fat with carbs makes people fat. 

I'm ranting. Focusing on weight has led us to the assumption that consuming a diet high in fat, 9kcal per gram in a lab, will make us fat. You hear people say it all of the time. ""Eating fat makes you fat"" this is simply not true. The association of fat with heart disease has led us to believe that eating a diet high in fat causes heart disease. (Fat from an avocado is different than fat from a Big Mac) Dr. Nissan, cardiologist at Cleveland clinic- one of the top hospitals for cardiology in the US, is back pedaling on this once accepted advice to limit fat to fend off heart disease. I guess I'm just spouting all of this to show that what we think we know about nutrition is not fact. It's theory and so far our theories haven't been very good. Notice the increasing obesity epidemic since  we started focusing on fat and weight?",1459468818

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","I totally agree with the spirit of the argument here, that HIllary does and has taken money from the fossil fuel industry.

What she would argue is that it's not directly from the fossil fuel industry, ie through a super PAC or direct from company, but from individuals who have worked there.

Unfortunately, for that argument, one would, in spirit, have to separate the money made in a company versus the money paid by that company to its employees. So, HIllary accepting a donation from a pimp does not reinforce prostitution, because no one is directly having sex for money from her. She's just benefiting from it.

It's a thin defense and that's why vitriol is its standing argument. #IMSOSick of points made on minutiae and not in the spirit of logical causality.

There was also some ruling, or policy decision, and I tried to find it, but can't, from maybe middle of last year, in which lobbyists were able to not call themselves lobbyists, even as they worked for the company for which they were lobbying. It was a rhetorical challenge to proposals against lobbying. Back to pimp argument, ""pimp"" becomes illegal and he becomes a ""companion,"" something like that.

d. I pay about the same as I did in Canada. Some things are cheaper and some are more expensive. But because I have less space, I buy more fresh food and generally waste less.

e. Speak. It really is that simple.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","If you aren't attracted to trans people, then presumably you would never be in the situation of even considering having sex with a trans woman.

If you *are* attracted to a woman, and then discover she's trans, evidently you are attracted to at least some women who are trans.

Imagine you meet the girl of your dreams. She's absolutely stunning, has a personality perfectly compatible with yours, she's the kind of girl you have waited your whole life to meet.

Then she tells you she's trans, and suddenly you lose all attraction for her. Lets assume for the sake of argument that this woman is physically indistinguishable from a cisgender woman. Absolutely nothing that initially attracted to you to her has changed. But now apparently you wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole, when previously you would have crawled through broken glass for a chance with her.

Is that wrong? I don't know, but I will say it isn't exactly an admirable trait.

Replace ""trans"" with other demographics that are or have been despised and considered. What if the ""dark secret"" was that she's bisexual? Or Muslim? Or has a Mexican grandma? Or that she was raped as a child? Or had an abortion six years ago? 

What would you think of a man who was suddenly repulsed by a woman they had previously desired after learning she's a member of a demographic they hold in contempt?

These aren't hypothetical scenarios. I have elderly relatives, white southern men who in their Jim Crow era youth would have been furious, likely even violent if they found out that a woman they had been intimate with was Jewish, or had a black grandma. They would have felt deceived and violated. Nothing about the woman they were with had objectively changed, but now they knew a detail of her personal history that made her repugnant to them.

Do you think people with non-white ancestry who could ""pass"" for white in the mid-20th century had a moral obligation to inform any potential partners that their grandma was black? Or that they're Jewish, in an environment where that could be a dangerous piece of information to disclose?

Were my uncle and his peers wrong to think that these women had a moral obligation to ""out"" themselves to anyone they flirted with, regardless of how much danger that might put them in?",1459468825

"treeofsavior","t5_2y7hb","Problem is these days every game thinks it can be league of legends with their business model. Launch f2p in hopes to attract a bunch of people but fails to deliver things people want to buy from the cash store, here is a good example i mean, you got these borderline p2w RNG scrolls fro the 3 hair slots and then what? Unless you're a whale and want to keep rerolling your decent rolls into better ones there's hardly any incentive to buy anything outside of the token. There's like what 2 costumes per class and a couple overpriced hairstyles, that's it. Cash store needs to be solid from day 1 with a bunch of cosmetics people WANT to get, and i'm not just talking about this game, pretty much every f2p out there.

Then they wonder why nobody buys shit so it goes to die off at gameforge or similar shady hosts and in comes the full blown p2w disguised as not p2w. (gamble items, currency exchange, sellable items, etc)

I kind of drifted away from the point, but what i mean is they can't even make solid f2p models that can sustain the long run and then on top of this it is a gold seller paradise which spoils the experience for everyone involved.

Niche games like this need to be b2p with an interesting cosmetics only store to generate extra $. Has side effect of keeping most bots and spam away.",1459468836

The search by option is no different than the sort by option of legacy. It was renamed to avoid conflict with actual sorting methods from HIT Scraper--sorting based on TO.

Legacy used actual browser-level dialog boxes, locking the entire browser interface until they were closed, while this version doesn't.

The SEP has pretty good protection against runtime attacks, but it is not tamper-proof hardware: on a ""cold"" (powered-down) iPhone, the SEP is off and can't monitor anything for tampering. Real tamper-proof hardware has things like battery-backed SRAM and tamper-detection meshes.

The Secure Enclave has a burned in UID key just like the main CPU does on all iPhones, and extracting both should be about equally hard (nobody has ever extracted a UID key from any iPhone as far as we know; it's designed to be unreadable by software). So really, the SEP doesn't buy you any real extra security against this attack scenario. On current iPhones, it's aimed squarely at protecting against rogue software on the main CPU, but it doesn't really have any features against hardware-based attacks, particularly any ""cold"" attacks like the NAND replacement (AIUI it does have encrypted memory to protect against a ""hot"" RAM attack). This could change in future chips, of course.

The other team stumbled upon them, causing a huge fight that resulted in my team getting aced, and the enemy losing no one.  During the fight, Baron healed to full hp.  After they started, I came back up.  I tp to the ward my team had in the river bush and pop ghost for that sexy move speed.  My q one shot Ezreal from full hp, I shot spirit fire into the pit, allowing Baron to finish off Ahri for me.  The Yi was dumb enough to alpha strike right over to me, only to be one shot just like Ez.  Riven and Leona had the right idea in running, but a flash q finished Riven who was half hp from the previous fight and Baron.

Haha, I know this more than you think bro. I've left corporate America and I'm doing my own shit because I don't want to deal with shit like this on the daily. What I'm seeing from you are the real issues that plague us, yet no solutions on what to do about them. You disparage negative stereotypes, but what do you propose needs to happen to dismantle them? Are you waiting for white people to change the way they think? Is Hollywood going to magically start representing us fairly? I'm a bit hazy on this. You're mad (justifiably) because white America doesn't treat you the way you want to be treated, and you blame the media. All valid. And I get you more than I think you appreciate. But what's next?

I'm saying we need to change the way we think and who gives a fuck about what white society does or doesn't think about us. Yes, we'll be penalized for breaking stereotypes as the article you referenced pointed out. But how many Asians defer to whites now because of Study 3 and Study 4? That's the crux of the issue. Those stereotypes will exist - so do we submit to them? Shit man, that's all I'm saying. Excuse me for feeling disgusted by seeing capable Asians taking a back seat because they buy into that shit. I guess I'm coming from a place that accepts this as my shitty reality but I refuse to let it stop me (anymore).

You have a shuffled deck with all the portraits, you pick one, use it (which automatically gives you the phenotype), discard it; if there are no more portraits (which, with ~40 starting civilizations, plus minors, shouldn't happen, but let's take it into account just in case) you reshuffle the discard pile (which now contains all the cards), and use it as the deck (at which point you *can't* avoid repeats because you've run out of portraits, but at least you'll avoid having *three* of a kind).

"MortalKombat","t5_2robf","Like others have said, I enjoy watching tournaments to watch &amp; learn from my favorite characters being played at a high level. I find pools and top 32 are really where the magic happens in this regard, and I tend to pay more attention to those streams than I do top 8. That's where you're going to see people rocking characters other than the established top tiers. I do watch top 8 for most majors, but seeing the same cast of pros lose to SonicFox has become boring, so I don't pay as much attention to that portion unless there's new blood or underdog characters in the mix. Watching Pnut take out Sonic with Kotal at Final Round was hype, but Dragon's Tanya vs. Sonic's Cassie in grand finals is a good time for a nap.

Going to tournaments is far more exciting than watching them. I've been to a handful of locals, and I went to KIT in January, and all were very helpful to me as a player, and a ton of fun as a gamer. KIT was everything I could have asked for and more, and I learned a ton of things and played with lots of great players, both recognized names and unknowns, and I made a lot of friends (and got to meet some fellow /r/MK posters). Almost everyone I interacted with was friendly and helpful, and I recommend that everyone try to attend a major at some point. 

As for the ESL announcement, I'm kinda meh on it. Online tournaments aren't as exciting as real ones, and I'm not good enough to stand a chance at making it to the big leagues, but I may enter anyway now that it has PS4 support.

If you are trying to lose weight while building muscle and the scale isn't moving over a period of a couple weeks, you are probably spinning your wheels by eating too much or not working out as much as you think. Either that or your body has just temporarily stalled. I know for me, and it appears it's not uncommon to many people, that you can be on a cut, stay at a weight for a few days, then suddenly randomly drop weight. Actually, for me, when on a cut, it's not uncommon to maintain around a certain weight for about a week, then suddenly wake up one day and be 2+ lbs lighter. Sometimes, you can even gain weight back, then lose again. This repeats until I reach my goal weight, and is quite normal for most people.

It is my understanding that people are still assuming a flat 1% drop rate for all featured relics, with ~4% drop rate for off-banner items.

There is likely some underreporting going on but to that extent?

Also, the cloaks for Infil that allow SMG's are more visible than the Stalker cloak (Which is what people use the flashlight for). So   
  
1.) don't worry about the flashlight so much as SMG infil and 2.) Assume people can still see you at all times. Think of cloak more like REALLY good camo, not invisibility.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","Not OP but figure I might as well brainstorm a bit because at the end of the day I agree that no ore should be added without a reason.

One thing we are missing is a way to craft chain armor, which would act as the ""gateway"" armor that we really do need. We have stone tools to bridge the gap between wood and iron, but no ""stone armor"".   
As it stands wood is obtained from the surface, stone just below the surface. Thus, whatever we use to make chainmail should be located above ground or at least close to the surface.

This would open mining up for early game above ground, and allow  for armor tiers to be more in line with tools. This ore could also be used for insulation and other crafting utilities - imagine redstone wires that can be in the air, but also carry a signal twice as far. Perhaps make a furnace with the metal around it to make a higher tier furnace that cooks items for 25% longer or does not lose heat without an item to cook.

Can make it something like ""crude iron"" or ""aluminium fragment"". Make it show up in lower depths too be be a sort of inverse diamond where it's rare but much more common the closer to the surface you get.

That would make the mining meta more interesting while bringing a bit of usefulness to the game.",1459468842

-Always be having 20% more fun than the crowd.  Nothing can kill a vibe like a DJ who looks like he would rather be watching Netflix.  Dance your ass off and don't worry about fiddling knobs every second.

-You aren't and shouldn't be the center of the attention.  Read the crowd and play what gets people moving.  People aren't coming to see you spin they are coming to just have fun (not trying to be harsh) so remember you are providing the soundtrack for the night, not the entertainment, ya dig?

-Have a few 'blocks' of songs you know mix well together.  It is always good to have some fallback tracks you know you can rock.  The way I improved my mixing was to find 3-4 songs that mix well together and learn those tracks inside and out.  Keep adding those 'blocks' of 3-4 songs and in a while you will be able to bust out a killer set without having to plan shit.

-Easy on the effects.  Should be subtle vs. big filter passes (unless you are rocking a big club or festival ha).  I do subtle reverb &amp; delay effects on big breakdowns or vocal bridges, so it sounds more 'epic' but doesn't feel unnecessary

&gt;fanaticism (which he defines as having an overwhelming sense of identity based on a common cause or a community, and a tight and exclusive bond with other members of that group). 

I always thought fanaticism was a negative thing, but this literally makes it sound like loyalty and group bonding. HOW IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS? Jesus if women actually think this group identity and bonds is inherently bad, I can see why there's so much pathological altruism coming from Western women nowadays. 

And for the swipe at low status men, lol typical blue pill. Of course low status men enjoy the structure and opportunities of tribes. Should they not? Should they stay as an individual and likely never advance out of low status? Once again putting the boot into low status males because they make you react in disgust.

The conclusions made from this study are laughable and so obviously done to push an anti male agenda. Couldn't someone turn it around and talk about how women are relatively unloyal, and that if you want a group to have devoted members, then you'd be much better off sticking with men?",1459468851

If they add noise to the line, does that mean in general that the packet loss would/should last for about the same amount of time that the device is powered on? For example, if a microwave was causing the issue (I specifically checked and from what I can tell mine is not) and I heated something for 30 seconds, would that result in packet loss occurring for about 30 seconds? The periods of packet loss have greatly varied in how long they lasted -- from less than a second to 30+.

I haven't actually had any problems since early this afternoon (when I posted my original comment) so here's to hoping it magically fixed itself. Otherwise I'll definitely be doing some appliance-specific testing tomorrow.

538's identified demographics which favor Clinton:

 * High percentage of African-Americans
 * High percentage of Hispanics (though only slightly and varies by state)
 * Voters who support gun control
 * Southern states

Demographics which favor Sanders:

 - Voters with liberal attitudes on social policy
 - Districts with major colleges
 - More voters in labor-union households
 - Caucus state

The point in the article you linked only looks at racial demographics and doesn't take into account any nuances between ""white"" and ""non-white"" voters. 

African-Americans are the only major minority group that Clinton consistently does well with. 

He blew her out in Idaho, Washington, and Hawaii maybe because [all of those states have &lt;5% African-American population](http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/16,53,15,00) and all three were caucuses.",1459468854

You can't smoke indoors at any bars/pubs/clubs. Even at a big venue, you might occasionally spot someone light up a fag, but they'll almost always get spotted and thrown out as security generally look out for it and any smoking indoors these days is super obvious. 

As for smoking weed in a club, see above but you'll probably also get arrested.

Smoking it outside at any club/bar/pub will also be very obvious due to bouncers/door staff/security.

But let's just put this out there, if your  team is very far behind, when morale is low, when enemies are super fed and their carries can 1 shot anyone who isn't a tank, you're not going to prolong the game for 5 minutes. That's probably going to end in the next minute or two regardless if you surrender or not. And realistically those are the type of games that actually do make people want to surrender. So if you really think about it, 20 x (1 or 2), you're really only spending in the upper 40s by trying to elongate the game. With upper 40s in the minutes category sometimes you can't even finish a game let alone trying for 2, so even with a 50/50 shot at winning but only playing 1 game, you're still better off just playing it out those 20 games and getting that one extra win.",1459468855

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","My favorite character in the series has always been Goku, in fact he's probably one of my favorite fictional characters period. I guess it just comes down to multiple factors. For one, I've always felt the series in general was all about Goku's life. From his beginnings as a child finding the dragon balls with Bulma, to marrying Chi-Chi, becoming a father and ending the series with him as a grandfather is something that resonates with me.

Another factor is just because he's a hard worker who always tries to push himself to be the best. I know a lot of fans feel Gohan is the most relate-able character and that's fine, but I've always related to Goku just because of his background. If you think about, Goku is a low class Saiyan who at best was only meant to reach Raditz's level, but because of the sheer efforts he put in towards bettering himself and facing all these challenges throughout the series, he manages to become one of the strongest beings in the universe. He never had gifts like Gohan did nor was he an elite like Vegeta, he was just an average Saiyan who worked his ass off to become the best he could be. 

The third biggest factor to me is just his character development in general. Like I know most people say Goku never really develops as much as Vegeta, Gohan or Piccolo, but I feel like he really did develop in subtle ways such as social skills (Remember when he had to touch people's crotchs to tell if they were a guy or a girl), morality (effectively goes from having no regard of enemy lifes, to sparing all of them unconditionally, to finally sparring enemies most of the time, but knowing when to draw the line) and maturity (went from being the student to the master, and is more effectively able to lead and make rational decisions for the most part) but at the same time maintaining who he was throughout all these adventures.

"matlab","t5_2r4xn","Before I answer, I'm going to make sure I understand what you have.

You have four sets of xy data that you want to plot on a scatter. On top of that, you have a 370x1 array of indices of points in the scatter.

This is where I'm confused. I have no idea what your data represents, is it 4 people with 370 points, or 370 sets of 4 people, or what?

The 370x1 is a array of indices... so wouldn't you have **FOUR** line plots on  top of the line scatter data? If you had 370 indices, they would just be points (not lines) because you're dealing with the length of your data array. That or the same person's nth row would be consistent along your 4 matrices, making each line 4 points and you index array deals with your chronological order.

With the first idea (4 lines, 370 points) you can plot a scatter and a line at the same time with this:

    % a,b,c,d are the four 370x2 matrices
    % ind = array of indices
    hold on
    figure(1)
    scatter(a(:,1), a(:,2), 'r');
    line(a(:,1), a(ind),2, 'b'); % or line(a(ind,1), a(ind),2, 'b');

but this doesn't make much sense to me at the moment.

With the second idea (370 lines with 4 points), this is how I would do it: 

    % a,b,c,d are the four 370x2 matrices
    % ind = array of indices
    hold on
    figure(1)
    for i=1:size(a,1)
       new_point{i} = [a(ind(i),:); b(ind(i),:); c(ind(i),:); d(ind(i),:)]; % Create a cell of 4x2 matrices for eacch x,y point between the four 370x2 matrices
       line(new_point({i}(:,1), new_point({i}(:,2)); % Make a line plot for each line iteratively
       text(new_point({i}(1,1), new_point({i}(1,2), ['Data pt' num2str(i)]); % Try to make sense of the incoming data
    end

and keep in mind, this is gonna get real messy really quick.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","In my opinion the body itself is what makes a guitar a guitar. Everything else is modding. Replacement necks are actually not that uncommon; a lot of people swap necks for different profiles, different nut widths, different scale lengths - things you can't adjust easily. For example I have a True Temperament neck on one of my guitars but I definitely don't consider it a different guitar now.

While it's less common to replace the bridge itself, lots of people replace pickups, replace pots, replace knobs, replace trem springs, replace pickguards, etc without it transforming into a whole different guitar, philosophically.

I would say you have a cheap guitar that's been upgraded INTO a medium-quality guitar all around. 

If you ""replace"" the body (move all the parts you have now onto a new body) you will have a different guitar, in my humble opinion, unquestionably if you also replace the neck.

Do you dislike the current body? I wouldn't bother to replace it unless there's really something *wrong* with it. It would probably be worth it to replace the neck though, if you want a better neck. You will notice the difference much more versus replacing the body.",1459468864

I mean, that's as direct as it gets, and I trusted it. And why shouldn't I? I've never encountered online shopping before that expects you to be okay with whatever final amount they charge without you confirming that you're okay with it, at this point I haven't even seen the shipping fee.

Silly me. MoL has reiterated their ""no cancellations"" policy (even though they didn't offer the step of confirming the charge as the Rakuten site does) but has not addressed any of my concerns about the extra transactions. And no, I contacted my cc company a second time about the charges and they said all three have gone through and are authorized by MoL. 


I've never bought the Rosette gel and saw someone mention it here with a link to the MoL, and I wanted a genuine product so I went to Rakuten. Next time I'll definitely stick with Ebay. 

But seriously, what a terrible company. I'm sure they're not hurting for sales (as you've just done a bulk order and I'm sure others have too), I wanted a cancellation less than 24 hours of ordering (their first email says they'll ship in 5-10 business days after), and they refused.

I'm using an i7 4770k @ 4,6ghz + AMD 295x2.
But while in-game with the Rift, i have everything set to low. Still i can not achieve a constant of 75FPS. Usually its around 60+FPS, but in some situations where there are lots of action or complex scenery, i can easily dip down in the 40's.

&gt;Neville wakes in a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him. Ruth attempts to present a facade of indifference to Neville, but is unable to maintain it during her discussion with him. After discussing the effects of Neville's vampire killing activities on the new society, she acknowledges the need for Neville's execution and gives him pills, claiming they will ""make it easier"". Fatally injured, Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become heartless. Ruth kisses him and leaves.

&gt;Neville goes to his prison window and sees the infected waiting for his execution. He now sees that the infected view him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for the vampires; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection. He recognises that their desire to kill him is not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he thinks: ""[I am] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever. I am legend.""",1459468870

You could argue ""go to a library or an internet cafe"", though this is very diminutive due to many rural areas not having these places. Also to argue internet is not a right because ""we did not have it in the old days"" is flawed too. Society was engineered to not have internet at that point and thus was easily accommodating; today those without internet get left behind.

I mean I am seriously surprised they didn't add an end game encounter where raiders flee in terror when they see you. The level of fear your character should be capable of inspiring in people should be equivalent to deathclaws or the institute. Considering you are capable of killing dozens of the former single-handily and burning the latter down to the ground.

Oh: Raiders operate on a hierarchy of ruthlessness; this is why you can't pacify them, they either don't believe there is one man/woman capable of the destruction and death you've caused, or you've left so few people alive no one can tell the tale.",1459468874

What's amusing is that almost before they put the plan into action it went awry. They had intended for Omar Shaek Sayad to be the 9/11 paymaster..The media had reported he was (according to the government) with certainty. But d'oh! Those damn reporters! First some indie paper in the UK states that Omar was part of the ISI (Pakistan intelligence), and then a huge nightmare happened a week later when Indian intelligence reported Omar was given instructions to wire money to the alleged hijackers by Musharraf... And President Musharraf just so happened to coincidentally have a breakfast meeting with two senators on the morning of 9/11 (both senators would also coincidentally go on to be part of the 9/11 commission).

But the government just frantically made some changes to their ""legend"" and the media dutifully reported the new developments and the new patsies...And everything would end up ok. 

But if you had been a sharp eyed observer during 2001-2003, you would have seen how really poorly it went and how transparent it was. But aside from so many morons in this country, the fact was that we also were a lot more trusting of the government (I know I was back then), ",1459468875

In other words, the similarities between us and pigs are sufficient but not necessary to infer sentience.

Things with radically different physiology might be sentient, or they might not be. In the example of artificial intelligence, I fully expect there to be a heated debate about whether early A.I. is sentient or not, and whether we have any moral obligations to it. For a while it might be significantly more controversial than animal sentience because we will simply have less confidence about the existence of the A.I.'s sentience. ",1459468875

1. Who the leader in the group is (if there is one)
2. On which  energy level is the group? 
3. What can you bring to the group?

So,one by one
1. If there's a leader in the group, it's usually the person talking the most, telling jokes or fun stories etc. He/she is the one setting the pace and topic of the conversation and you just have to follow him and say something related to the topic when there's a pause.
2. If a group is high energy(everyone is hyperactive and excited,you have to be even more energetic. Same goes if the group is low energy(chilling in a cafe,doing some small talk...),you have to be just a bit lower energy than they are. It's actually going to feel natural and people in the group are going to feel like you're totally following ""the flow"" of the interaction.
3. If you have nothing to say, don't. You can ask some questions if the topic is something you don't know a lot about and people will feel good because they have an opportunity to pass some knowledge onto you(a good example of this are sports). If you have something to say, say it. Anything you say to advance the conversation in new ways is ok and useful.

If he tells us the state we would be able to drastically narrow down the medical schools in that area.

What matters is the point differential between yourself and the other player with the *most* points.

To put it another way, I could argue that by taking option A you are giving up 5 points on Player A.

And contrary to your expectations, I win games more often than statistically expected for the number of players, possibly *because* I never play with the assumption that winning is unattainable.

&gt; Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. 

[More on Ferdinand Waldo Demara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Waldo_Demara#Founded_a_college)

&gt; During Demara's impersonation as Brother John Payne of the Christian Brothers of Instruction (also known as Brothers of Christian Instruction), Demara came up with the idea of making the religious teaching order more prominent by founding a college in Alfred, Maine. Demara proceeded on his own, and actually got the college chartered by the state. He then promptly left the religious order in 1951, when the Christian Brothers of Instruction offended him by not naming him as rector or chancellor of the new college and chose what Demara considered to be a terrible name for the college. The college Demara founded, LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine, began in 1951 (when Demara left); in 1959 it moved to Canton, Ohio, and in 1960, became Walsh College (now Walsh University).",1459468882

But nothing changed. Death and suffering existed as much before as after - it's only human artifice that's cured disease, eased suffering, and provided for billions. What did Jesus' death actually accomplish?

This explanation doesn't add up. If this was a stronger pressure than that to have a family, they wouldn't need to convince anyone of it. I hear red pillers talk about women forgetting to have a baby and being sad about it a lot but pretty much all my friends talk about wanting kids and when they are going to have them. The woman who says she doesn't want kids at any point in her life is a minority, in my experience.

&gt;Society functions fine enough with them not being self aware, being flippant about positions and beliefs, dropping a man when he is no longer providing to her standard, etc. 

I do agree with TRP on many issues about society favoring coddling women, and I also have said before that I think my experience has been largely with an atypical group of women. If women do have these tendencies, I believe that it is *because* society allows it from them, not because of some inherently female way of thinking, and that any coddled male will show the same habits.

&gt; Blue pill thinking works on paper, but not in reality, primarily because people are not purely logical.

The argument that James is making is that works should accompany faith, and he (obviously) is correct. But there is a divergence of interpretation in the scripture. Catholics believe that he is saying that works are a part of salvation, and Protestants believe that works are a result of salvation. Now if there was one definite answer to this problem we would not be having this discussion for the past hundreds of years.

The distinction between Christian and not Christian? No that is made by history. Two thousand years ago there were multiple groups who can be described rightly as Jesus Cults and these groups had different teachings... and they had different names. Those different names didn't add any great authority or credibility to the adherents but were merely use to distinguish them from each other. It is not compliment to call a person a Christian but rather a simple fact about their beliefs. To be a Christian doesn't mean you are a good person or even that you are right about God, it just means you believe certain things about God.

"blackops3","t5_2tl1c","I'm gonna take a wild guess but the only way I could see this being useful of any sorts would be ""stealing"" an enemy players specialist before they use it. Very few people pop their specialist weapon or ability as soon as they get it. Also I thought the glowing lights you see on enemies means their specialist is charged and ready to be used? I think this is where and how the the ""thief ability"" would be used. For example: Once Blackjack's specialist meter is full, he could ""steal"" an enemys specialist if theirs is full, or he could steal the power an enemy has accumulated to add to his own unique ability/weapon duration. Either way, it would be extremely useful and potentially exnnoying (borderline op if no significant balance is present), as I always wait to use my ability or weapon for a time where I'm going to get a great return on its use. So I end up holding it for a minute or 2 if nothing presents itself immediately or forgetting about it completely. That would make me a prime target for an ability like the one I described. 

Now whether you need to initiate something like a melee kill to ""physically steal"" my power that's builtup (or actual Specialist ability), get a regular gun kill, or be within a certain proximity to execute a steal of some kind will be interesting to see. ",1459468887

If you have used a PC where the Windows was not installed by the manufacturer you will have seen the windows logo with the ""swirly"" thing below. Most manufacturers these days replace this with their own logo. But befor windows even gets started your PC loads the BIOS/UEFI wich also has the logo of the mainboard manufacturer on it. In the case of your notebook both manufacturers are the same therefore it seems like the logo never changed, but it always did when the swirly things appeared.

So your Problem is that your Computer dosen't recognize Windows.

Also your elaboration just says it starts but just shows that logo, whereas your title suggests that it actually reboots. Does it give you any error messages? If so what does it read? If not can you get into the BIOS/UEFI and does it see your Hard Drive? ",1459468887

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","This sounds like a TOTALLY unbiased description of the two groups.  Look man.  BP is coming from a ton of different angles.  Many of us disagree on many different levels about what's right or wrong with TRP.  Me personally?  I think there are many fundamentally troubling issues that men these days have to deal with, and I don't think they're being properly addressed.

Here's the one place that BP does agree.  Whether there really are issues or not, BP agrees that TRP is a fucking terrible philosophy for dealing with those problems.  If they don't exist then it's just being a dick.  But even if the problems done exist many of us feel that TRP is filled with false prophets and lies about how to actually deal with these issues.  

Me, I see TRP as very little different from a cult.  They've taken a disenfranchised group that is uniquely marginalized (because in this case it's hard to talk about male issues without losing everything to ""priveledge""), but they take this group and prey on their insecurities and teach them very self destructive philosophies.  Why? Why would they perpetuate it? Because it's a feedback cycle.   

Let's say you spend some substantial time in this.   for the sake of argument let's say it me not really working that well. Gives you some confidence, but burns some bridges.  But you start justifying this by digging deeper into the sidebar.  For every failure there's an explanation.  After a while though you really start needing some validation.   Well you don't get it by succes, the best way is to get it by recruiting.    This, right here, is very similar to how cults work.

But wait you say!   What if it really does work?   Then they're just out there spreading the good news.  A few problems with this.  First off, women are a neutral sum game.  For every high value woman you pull off the market that's one you can't access.  So why would you chose to build competition?  Well, because it helped you get out of a bad place, you want to help people feeling the same.  Maybe.  Except that's the same thing you would think if you're looking to validate your own waste of time in this philosophy.   

People who come up with real game changers, they don't often give it away for free.  Think about all the financial seminars you can go buy your way into.  Do you think Warren Buffet is setting those up?  It's not the really successful guys who give it away.  It's the ones who are either trying to scam you or validate themselves.  TRP is just the Trump University of relationship strategy.

There are other reasons why I know this is all bullshit, and it's a long conversation.  But here's the reason it matters to me.  TRP hurts vulnerable men.   That disgusts me more than anything else, and I think that's true for many BP.  We laugh or whatever, but at the heart a lot of BP is like that.   ",1459468888

"BudgetAudiophile","t5_300we","Thanks for your response. It was a lot of questions and you did a lot to clear up my confusion/questions. Very helpful. I plan on renting a house (with a buddy) so sub noise/size should not be an issue. Real estate where I am moving is incredibly cheap (think like $600-800 rent for a 2-3 bedroom house). I do not necessarily need a strong sub sound (and have read that I may not need a sub with the  Fluance XL7F).

I am an audio guy first (don't even own a television) so the actual surround sound will come last in what I buy (after a nice TV) I just wanted to make sure if I bought more speakers for my set up (Kenwood Receiver+Turn table+Cd Player) that I would not be buying redundant speakers.

You have been extremely helpful. I may go ahead and plan to get the Fluance XL7F speakers first (I can have front speakers + back speakers for my audio set up).

Then as I transition more to movies (my best friend lives in an apartment with his wife and he is the movie guy... he may end up having to be at my place to watch movies at night) I will research surround sound receivers more.

Thank you for your time. Your response is what I was after.",1459468891

I ask because your boss could lie and say you never worked the time? Are you tracking the hours on your own and then submitting them?  Does someone have to approve your hours?

Also, do you have an e-mail or memo that documented her being out of the office, and her hours falling to you and your coworkers to pick up?  Who does the scheduling? If they want to avoid OT, then someone should've been on top of the scheduling and ensuring that coverage was appropriately spread across remaining staff. But someone should've spoken to you before you received your paycheck. That seems shady, like they were counting on you not paying attention and not questioning that the money wasn't there. 

IANAL so I can't speak to the statutes or laws. But you should communicate ALL of this via e-mail (CCing your own private Yahoo or Gmail account for reference) to your boss - NOTHING by telephone or in person. Get her to admit/commit in an e-mail.

Both books are written by Canadians and cover the basics in an easy to understand way. 

And if you want to start investing right away before doing any reading, the balanced index fund is probably a good choice. And after you understand more, you can easily switch to other funds if you don't feel it's right for you.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Staying up extremely late for 5 days in a row :'D

No, but actually, here's the pipeline:

I created a Java application to parse through the /r/animethemes wiki. They had a great index page setup with links to each specific anime's information that they compiled. From there, it was just a matter of getting the data (links, names, tags etc) and associating it with its ID on MAL (which, thankfully, is also compatible with other anime list sites if support for them is needed someday)

Then, when the user searches their name, it gets their animelist from MAL. I filter out unnecessary details (such as rating, tags, comments etc) and cache this information. Removing the extraneous stuff saves a lot of space too - my ~250 completed animelist went from about 200 kilobytes to around 15 - about a 93% reduction. 

Then, I take the info from MAL and basically match it to the animethemes wiki and display it all through a nice Bootstrap-styled table.

tl;dr: Got op&amp;ed data from /r/animethemes, user inputs username, match between the two and display.",1459468893

It'd be one thing for the show to have planned as 4 cours and abruptly changed to 2 cours mid-production, but it seems rather that while the original conception was a 4-cour show they had already changed that to 2 before they had actually made any significant progress in the writing/storyboarding/composition and production, so it works just fine the way it is. 

I think a lot of people get hung up on Ema, Shizuka, Misa and Midori not getting a ton of screen-time and thinking that if it had been 4 cours they would have, but I don't think that's true. Shirobako to me looks like it was always planned as having Aoi (and only Aoi) as the primary, central character and everyone else being secondary or tertiary characters. Her four friends provide non-work-focused interactions with Aoi that can highlight Aoi's internal struggles and personal development, they offer a separate set of secondary characters so not *everything* revolves around Musashi (which would be boring the viewer), they can educate the audience about other aspects of the animation industry that the Musashi employees don't cover, and they can provide some minor but dramatic side-plots (as do many of the Musashi employees, as well) ... and they do all those things very well, as good secondary characters should! But I've never seen any indication that they were ever supposed to be primary characters on par with Aoi if the show had been made per the original 4-cour plan!",1459468895

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","There are two important different types of discrimination, direct and indirect. Direct is when you specifically target a class e.g. ""all black employees will be paid less."" Indirect is when a measure happens to disproportionately affect a specific class e.g. ""all part time employees will be paid less"" when it turns out that 95% of your part time employees are black whereas they only make up 5% of the full time workers. 

In law (and my opinion) direct discrimination is not OK. If someone sues you for it, you will lose. Indirect discrimination can be OK if it is a proportionate method to achieve a reasonable aim. As you can see from the language they have used in this case, they are being very explicit that they don't think it breaks the law. 

Whilst you may be unhappy with this particular contract, I hope you can accept that indirect discrimination is not always wrong. If it was outright banned, you couldn't achieve your reasonable aims and any time you wanted to create or change a policy you would have to perform a detailed analysis to make sure it didn't affect any protected class disproportionately even if who it affects has nothing to do with the intention of the policy. 

A better way to opose this is to explain why the method in this particular contract is not proportionate or the goal is not reasonable. Essentially, in order to convince people this is wrong, you should explain why it does not lead to better outcomes to penalise people for taking time off. 

I have no idea whether the measures are good ones or not but I just wanted to make sure you are thinking about whether it is discrimination in the right way. ",1459468897

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;Right I forgot settlers weren't dominated by the interests of France, England, Spain, The Netherlands ect for generations, with many wars fought in the name of European interests.

Sure they were. But that's not exploitation. Countries always use their land for their own benefit. By your own faulty logic, anything a government does with its land is exploitation, since countries pretty much always develop land with their own interests in mind.

&gt;Canada was signed over to the British in the Treaty of Paris. They considered Canada worth some factories in India, some fishing rights and an island called Guadeloupe. All those people that lived in New Frnace were not consulted, their European lords just handed them away! Canada existed to be exploited by both powers. The French only had the land to gather pelts and raw materials for Europe, and when it became hard to keep it they just handed it away for some sugar and fish. REMEMBER THIS ISN'T EXPLOITATION THOUGH!!!11!!

No, literally nothing you mentioned is exploitation. Yes, the colonies were around to provide economic benefit for the homeland, but that does not equal exploitation. Exploitation is the manner in which the action is undertaken, not the action itself.

&gt;Oh yeah in the open fucking wilderness of untamed North America the streets were paved with gold! Everything was pretty much set up for them and they were rich!

&gt;England essentially dumped its excess population onto North America (and religious fanatics), and France sent soldiers and traders that tried to go home the second they were done their jobs in the new world. North America was an ashtray for the powers of Europe.

You conveniently neglect that most migrants to the Americas were not forced (although many people were certainly forced to come here), but came here because the New World of their own free will. Why? Because it had plenty of land to spare, and up until a bit into the 19th century, working land was the primary way of making a living for the vast majority of people. In other words, a lot of time it was economics that motivated people, not the government dumping tons of people against their will.

The French settled Canada for entirely different reasons, however. The Fur Trade, as the European Fur Trade had essentially collapsed due to its inability to keep up with demand. Canada was settled in part because it was extremely lucrative for trappers who would often go there of their own accord because it gave them economic incentive.

Hell, just compare the standard of living between American/Canadian colonists and the indigineous people in the Indian and Asian colonies. There's a gigantic disparity between the two. Similarly between them and the the Middle Eastern colonies.

&gt;Oh yeah a world war, state genocide and industrial scale slavery is so much better than redrawing maps and placing western-leaning leaders into power, the horror!

Barring slavery, all of that same stuff happened under European colonization, except colonial exploitation was often even harsher and unlike the Ottomans, they didn't bother developing infrastructure since they were only used as sources of raw goods.

&gt;Nope it can't be looked over, but it does not excuse Africa from being a shithole for all of history, long before Europeans got there.

...except that Northern Africa and the Middle East (including Anatolia) was more developed than Europe for most of human history? Seriously, it wasn't until after the Middle Ages that Europe in general started outproducing Africa.",1459468901

&gt;What would YOU think of when you think of a Canadian?

I already fucking answered that if you knew how to comprehend what you fucking read. 

Please before you do ANYTHING else stop and go and read every comment over again.  Now stop and think for a second and hopefully the following things will come across that alcohol damaged brain of yours (hey a twofer stereotype, one for canadian and one for ""indigenous"" and just pointing that out so if you are too fucking retarded to pick up on it). 

1) Someone says a name isn't canadian. 

2) I say what is a canadian name since it's filled with people from every fucking where. 

Those two should make you release that I am saying there is no one sounding name for the country since it's filled with a bunch of different types of people.  Then 5 months later because well your a fucking troll who revives dead posts:

3) You say your name is canadian because your a retard cunt. 

No fucknut, go back to 2.  The country is filled with a bunch of different people from different cultures so your fucking name is not fucking canadian.  Or are you going to sit here and claim no one has the right to be called canadian except your specific tribe?  So what about Inuit names? Are their names not canadian? Or what about the Métis?  Are they not canadian since according to your fucking post a sioux name is the definition of a canadian name?

Also I find it funny that you have a sioux name yet call that canadian since the only tribe that used the sioux language in Canada was the Assiniboine which were called Hohe by other Sioux tribes as they were actually enemies with the Sioux.  So much for being Canadian when your recent ancestor came from the Mississippi valley which is where?  Oh the fucking US which isn't fucking Canada.  So honestly you have no fucking claim to Canada at all.

&gt;Why? You still generally think of black people when you think of Africans or Islanders.

"Reno","t5_2qsfi","I think transit improvements are the biggest thing. It's not too bad now but the population is projected to increase by a third over the next decade. We should start now before it's a huge problem. 

First and foremost(like right now). Make the left lane of 395 north an express lane that you cannot enter or leave from Moana to McCarran. Also close the 2nd street entrance from 4-6 and route people to Mill. 

I know there are some things underway, the southeast connector will be helpful. I know there was a plan to turn pyramid into a freeway and they did tear down some of the houses along pyramid around the McCarran intersection. Not sure where that really stands though. With the growth of the spanish springs/pyramid area I don't think not having a freeway out there is going to be an option. 

A road across from Stead to the Robb area would be kinda cool but I don't think that's really feasible with the geography.

Add more mass transit. A tram along Virgina in the downtown area and maybe down 80 to vista would be super useful though I don't think we have a population that can support that yet. Designing with that in mind for the future would be good though. ",1459468901

I don't know if the people saying skip Legoland have kids, but I kind of see the parks through my kids eyes so to speak. And Legoland is made for kids much more than adults. I know my son loves Legoland and am glad We tried it. And like I said in my other comment, if you think they might like it, this is the time to go otherwise they may be too old to really enjoy it in another year or two. 

On the other hand, despite what some Disneylhiles say, it is hard to get everything done in US in one day. So that is a great choice too. If you do a split stay and go to one of the deluxe universal resorts, you get two days of express pass. A one night splurge gets you into everything you want quickly. Might be worth it if it is a busy time of December. But if the kids are not into the thrill rides you could probably get by without it. ",1459468902

Also, if the surgery causes pain, should we stop the surgery? If you need heart surgery but it causes you immense pain, should we stop any surgery and stop trying? If you think from the perspective of Mao, that China was sick and that he needed to cure it, some deaths would be seen as a sad occurrence, but something necessary for greater progress and prosperity.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;Can't we just refer to them all as jihadi's to avoid confusion?

Absolutely not.  Groups like the AKP in Turkey and Ennahda in Tunisia are religious conservative democratic parties that happen to be Muslim.  They're like Christian Democrats in Europe and Latin America or perhaps like the Republicans in the U.S., in that their base is in religious social conservatism (and generally being pro-business development).  If there's ever going to be a stable democracy in Middle East, it will include these social conservative parties.  Now, some disagree with calling these parties ""Islamists"" since they do *not* want to install Shari'ah law in their countries, but it's often a continuum from them to parties that do want ""Shari'ah inspired"" or outright Shari'ah law. There was much ink spilled in Egypt, for instance, whether Shari'ah was going to be *a* source or *the primary source* or some other formulation of Egyptian law.  

Anyway, assuming this was a good faith question, you should check out Charles Kurzman and Ijlal Naqvi's article ""Do Muslims Vote Islamist?"" which not only goes into Islamist vote shares, but also discusses how Islamist parties broadly defined have, by pretty much every measure, generally moderated (slowly) as they participate in elections.  You can download the [a pdf of the article here](http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/do-muslims-vote-islamic).  It's an academic article, but it's written almost like a magazine article so it's not *super* boring (I'm linking this article because the moderation over time, quantified in this article, is important to realize).  That was published before the Arab Spring, and Kurzman has a follow up (Didem Türkoğlu) called ""Do Muslims Vote Islamic Now?"" from last year ([link](https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_democracy/v026/26.4.kurzman.html), but unfortunately I don't think it's freely available--you can at least read the abstract).

But the short answer is, if you're serious about fighting jhadist terrorism, it's an important distinction to make since these ""Muslim Democrats"" are willing and necessary allies in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda (and eager, even, because the countries they run are persistent targets of jihadist terrorism).",1459468908
"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Varian is not trash. Control warrior with Varian isn't as well-rounded as more fatigue-oriented lists, so he's not very popular, but he is extremely powerful and certainly wins games. And he's fun to play. 

A list like this probably isn't quite as strong as more typical control warrior, but it's still a good deck and it's fun because you get a lot of draw, Emperor, and you often run over people with more threatening plays than are expected from CW these days:

2x Execute

2x Shield Slam

2x Fiery War Axe

2x Slam

2x Acolyte of Pain

2x Bash

2x Shield Block

1x Big Game Hunter

2x Death's Bite

2x Brawl

2x Sludge Belcher

1x Emperor Thaurissan

2x Shieldmaiden

1x Baron Geddon

1x Dr. Boom

1x Grommash Hellscream

1x Ragnaros the Firelord

1x Ysera

1x Varian Wrynn

I think this style will have a place in Standard (with some cards replaced, of course), especially if BGH gets nerfed, since BGH and Boom are the only two cards where you lose value if pulled by Varian.

"NoMansSkyTheGame","t5_325lr","From the 18 minute gameplay video from IGN, it looked like the ship had several stats that varied. I assume those stats could be increased/changed by adding Technologies to your ship, but there's also been times where Sean has said you ""can't upgrade your ship"" and if you want a better one you need to buy a new ship. He said that earlier in development, so maybe things have changed. There's also been mentions of ""better ships"" that can be found at better space stations (apparently space stations can be good/bad too?), or closer to the center of the galaxy/universe. 



It would be really nice to get some info on that stuff though, I wish some people who attended the press event would've asked about specifics like that.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I've heard the premise before, but not the direction you took from there. The question I heard based on the premise of children below a certain age going to heaven was this:

Given an age below which all children go to heaven (admittedly not accepted by all Christians), and given that the afterlife is all-important and this life is basically just a prelude or otherwise meaningless, wouldn't the most selfless and beautiful act of any parent be to kill their children while still below that given age?

Of course, the parent who does so goes to hell for eternity.

But, how selfless and wonderful would it be for a parent to make that sacrifice to ensure that their children go to heaven rather than hell? Wouldn't making sure that the children never reach the age where they might commit a mortal sin and thus go to hell be the ultimate selfless act on the part of a parent? By accepting hell for themselves, they would ensure eternal bliss in heaven for their children.

Of course, I do not advocate this and am not trying to convince Christians to kill their children. My motive as an antitheist is to oppose religion.",1459468909

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Before you say that grilled cheese can't be improved upon, please try this:

*** 

Get your slices of bread and butter them on one side, and put them in a frying pan. Take them out once they're lightly browned, and use that side as the inside of your sandwich. Now add a semi hard cheese of your preference – something like gouda, or port salut. 

Next, you get a parmigiano and cut some very thin slices (it helps if you own [one of these](http://mittkok.expressen.se/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/osthyvel-636x358.jpg)) and spread them out evenly on top of your other cheese. Add a dash of olive oil and a few twists on the pepper mill, and assemble your sandwich. 

Finally, you add some olive oil to your pan and fry each side of the sandwich golden before putting it on a plate, and cutting it diagonally. Enjoy.
***
Notes:

• If you want herbs on your grilled cheese I'd go with thyme or fresh basil over any of the ones you mentioned. 

• I like to toast a handful of walnuts to garnish with, but that's not really specific to grilled cheese – toasted walnuts just make everything better. Try it!",1459468910

Wages stagnate for multiple reasons, there's no solid proof that it's trade's problem. Plus with less trade you'll run into the problem of a negative supply shock means goods are more expensive this buying power goes down. Buying power matters more than just number of dollars earned.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Clearly you are talking about his vote on H.R.629 - A political compact which stated it was IMPOSSIBLE to store LOW-LEVEL waste in Vermont and Maine, and was instead delegated to store it in a secured waste site in Texas.

H.R.629 was authored by the representative from Texas, not Sanders. Over 80% of the waste was already coming from Texas, and a site was needed already, this bill was simply to authorize Maine and Vermont to add less than 25% to the total amount, which ALREADY NEEDED A SITE. If you are going to build a site, is it not proper to only build a single site instead of 3? In addition, the location at the time of voting was not established.

To Quote Representative Sanders at the time:

""No reputable scientist or environmentalist believes that the geology of Vermont or Maine would be a good place for this waste. In the humid climate of Vermont and Maine, it is more likely that groundwater will come in contact with that waste and carry off radioactive elements to the accessible environment.

There is widespread scientific evidence to suggest, on the other hand, that locations in Texas, some of which receive less than 12 inches of rainfall a year, a region where the groundwater table is more than 700 feet below the surface, is a far better location for this waste.

This is not a political assertion, it is a geological and environmental reality. Furthermore, even if this compact is not approved, it is likely that Texas, which has a great deal of low-level radioactive waste, and we should make the point that 80 percent of the waste is coming from Texas, 10 percent from Vermont, 10 percent from Maine, the reality is that Texas will go forward with or without this compact in building a facility to dispose of their low-level radioactive waste.""

In addition, the following quote can be found.

""The last point that I would make is there is nowhere in this legislation that talks about a specific site. Nowhere will we find that. We are not voting on a site. That decision is left to the authorities and the people of the State of Texas.""

The community in question has a population of 553, and the actual location of the waste was intended to be placed at a location that effected the minimum possible population.

This bill was rejected, and instead, the waste was later legislated to be moved to a different section of Texas, which still has proximity to a similar population.",1459468913

It depends on whether you believe buildings or people are the most important factor that makes up the character of a city.

And honestly, there haven't been that many 'historic' buildings torn down.  

Most of what was on Williams/Vancouver was either empty lots or shitty warehouses.  Same with most of Division.  Most everything happening in Buckman/Kerns is the same way.  The goat blocks was an old warehouse and restaurant that burned in 2001 or 2002.  The OBT building they just tore down was a shitty old bank. 

If you didn't have those thousands of new units of apartments, the demand would be pushing out even more of the long term Portlanders that can't afford it.  

To me, it's worth saving some people over a couple crappy warehouses.

All of the offensive material? What do you mean? Ammo? Particles? 

The problem isn't that pyro doesn't do enough damage to kill heavy, All classes do. Its about if pyro has enough dps to kill heavy before he kills you.

And thats means pyro will need a dps of at least 200. Is that fair, to kill a 300 health class at its strongest range, only requiring an ambush and strafing with a super easy to aim weapon?

And 200 dps on any enemy other than heavy leads to almost no time to react.

150 dps is a good balance between killing light classes as quickly as other combat classes but killing combat classes slowly enough to give them time to react and retaliate. Otherwise, pyro becomes a cheap ambush class who just runs at you when in close range and gets kills because of ridiculous dps and high mobility.",1459468915

First off, I'm not too big on Leonard Floyd myself. I consider myself more of a Noah Spence, Andrew Billings, and Coby Whitehair type of first round guy, but quite honestly, I wouldn't be too upset with Floyd. I think Spence is better than Floyd, but I can respect the pick, I suppose.

Now, passing on Nick Martin after avoiding line in the first round is a BAD IDEA. I know that there's a chance he will stick around until our pick in the third round... but I wouldn't gamble on that chance. Realistically, he's a late second, early third center. While we could in theory trade back our second rounder to grab him later, I wouldn't avoid picking him outside of the second.

That being said, 2 pass rushers seems okay. Calhoun would be a valued addition to our team. I'm just concerned we wouldn't get Martin later if we took Calhoun now. Maybe use your third rounder on another pass rusher, if you really want 2.

I've never been too big of a fourth round RB pick guy. I've always advocated picking a running back in the fifth round for this draft, and the reason why is that the drop in talent from 2016's fourth round RBs to 5th round RBs is almost unnoticeable. That being said, Keith Marshall is still a good pick up, but... I'd stick to the fifth round to check out RBs this year.

Now, Javon Hargrave is an interesting choice. And I like it. If you are dead set on drafting a fourth round running back, Hargrave would be an interesting 3rd down DT who we could possibly develop.

I'm not too high on your seventh rounder though... at all. I mean, I agree, most end up being busts in the 7th, and if you get a good player from it, then it was a good pick, regardless of the position, but we have a lot of blocking tight ends now. Doyle, Allen, and now our free agency pick-up that I'm too lazy to search the name for. Grabbing a fourth seems... excessive. If we got a speedy tight end, this would be less of an issue, but blocking, at least to me, seems excessive.

For the seventh rounder, I would check out my two personal favorites, Cleveland Wallace (CB) and Malcolm Mitchell (WR). They seem like good developmental projects, at least to me.

All in all, it's nice to see a unique draft once in a while. Looking forward to the next one!",1459468915

Their behavior shouldn't affect you unless you get a roommate(s)/floor mates that do that. If you let their behavior bother you, it will, but if you find your own group of friends that do other things, you won't notice it's a party school.

Chances are, if you've done your research on the school and a co-worker (probably a stranger) with less knowledge about the school thought it was a party school and you don't, I would say your intuition is much more likely to be right than there's is.

"RSChronicle","t5_33z58","&gt; Not math average as in mean, average as in general. By ""average"" pack, I mean general pack. I just chose to use the wording I chose to use.

So I get in a layman sense you could almost take ""average"" to mean this, but it's really the mode. I get that calling it the ""mode"" of the packs is awkward, but conflating the terms muddies the conversation. Even using the most common is better.

&gt;  By ""average"" pack, I mean general pack.

To go further, what is even meant by ""general"" if not in the mathematical sense?

The average pack in terms of pure recycle value works out to be a tad more than 4S+1E not only in terms of pure shard value (because we know almost for sure that some of our packs will do better than 4S+1E and no pack can do worse), but also in the sense of building a collection that you will use.

To say that **all** cards that you pull will be useless is just dishonest unless you only open packs to hoard shards and never craft them. Thus, some cards you pull will be worth their whole shard value in crafting cost.

You can't simply ignore all cases that you actually pull a card that you need just because the ""average"" pack won't contain them. It's just a needlessly pessimistic and nigh statistically dishonest way of analyzing pack openings.

It's the same as saying in HS that every pack you open is only 40 dust when we know for sure that's not the case.",1459468918

&gt; One by one, Yoshida brought basically every stage of the zipper making process in house: A 1998 Los Angeles Times story reported that YKK &amp;quot;Smelts its own brass, concocts its own polyester, spins and twists its own thread, weaves and color-dyes cloth for its zipper tapes, forges and molds its scooped zipper teeth&amp;quot; and on and on.

&gt; In the end, the secret to YKK&amp;#039;s success is equally uncomplicated but equally impressive: YKK makes incredibly dependable zippers, ships them on time without fail, offers a wide range of colors, materials, and styles, and never gets badly undercut on price.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Though that's not an in-game story..

I was introduced to League of Legends from my ex girlfriend 2 years ago.She was like mad with the game,spending over 12 hours a day.At first,i didn't like the game at all.She insisted a lot though and there we go.

I was playing exclusively top lane until i reached 30 and i kept playing top and adc for a very long time.I made a lot of mistakes and bad plays throughout the year,and stayed in low silver elo for a very long time.She was always making fun of me(she was high gold),and never trully tried to make me actually see me mistakes and help me get better.I used to tell her that since she got me into the game,she should help me further.

Anyway,last year she broke up with me without even telling me the reason.I loved her a lot and was really broken for a long time,couldn't eat or sleep properly.I later found out that she met a guy who's Challenger and is really into the domestic scene of League of Legends here(writting on sites,playing on a semi-pro team),and she became overly-attached with him,and that was the real reason she dumped me.

My very close friends and League of Legends were here for me through the hard times,i started taking the game seriously,realising my own mistakes,turning to a support main and climbing.I managed to forget,and LoL was the reason.

A few months later,we had this 5 man ranked team with my buddies were we played for fun,skyping etc.And all of a sudden,in our 5th and last game before the placement,the loading screen shows that enemy team's botlane is my ex and her Challenger guy.I was playing Shen top that game,and I immediately went anxious cause i felt i had something to prove here,and Shen wasn't even in my favourite 30 champs.
Our botlane lost to them cause the guy was really good.I stomped my lane but what can you do with Shen?

50 minutes into the game,my team was 3v5 mid(our jungler got caught before the actual fight happened) i was taking down the 3rd top turret.They start a fight,i ult our mid after i took down the inhib,we lose the fight but i escape with sth like 100 hp.Their botlane are the survivors,and push through mid to end.I TP with 100 hp top,were i push with one and a half wave(with a super cannon),while our jungler respawns as Gragas and interrupts them of ending the game/recalling to stop me.I take down nexus and GG.At the end game screen,while everyone left the lobby,my ex was waiting to see if i say something.We were both still standing in the lobby for like 5 minutes before i decided to exit without saying a word.

It's just unbelievable what life might have in store for you sometimes..",1459468920

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","Turtleologist checking in here. 

As someone who is a scientist who studies turtles, I hate to tell you that ""asexual epidermesis"" is a little different a process than you describe. Reptiles like these do not use their ""skin as a vector for reproduction."" If you want to be specific, these reptiles use more than just their skin to reproduce. Much more. 

Turtles in particular are able to reproduce using their shell, also, when organized in the spiral pattern shown in the post. The shell itself is covered in a material similar to fingernails, only thicker. It's much harder and more dense than skin. 

The process also depends on other environmental factors such as mood lighting and background music. They don't use one or the other, that's not how asexual epidermesis works. They use both. The right Kenny G album can really hasten the formation of these spirals, and the shell plays probably a more important role than the skin alone, given the geocentric advantage.

This fact is most evident after germination: when the turtles crawl out from its spiral nest, they can reach the surface much faster than bananas, giving them an evolutionary advantage.

What's disturbing is the detail she puts into her lies. She fabricates these stories with such amazing detail.

My sister also has a lying problem. When you confront her, though, she just continues to lie. Sometimes she will also start to cry as she shrieks that she isn't lying. You could present to her concrete evidence of her lies and she would become hysterical and start shrieking that she isn't lying. She will ignore the evidence.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Well, Canada's approach, of Notice and Notice would be a start.

The US's Notice and Takedown part of the DMCA is extremely one-sided in favour of big copyright holders.  It's the reason why YouTube is forced to take down any videos it receives notice for, it must comply with these requests, no matter their validity, in order to maintain its safe-habour status and not be sued. This has led to all the abuse we've been seeing with studios censoring reviews, trolls stealing monetization, etc. They hold all the power and crush anyone they wish.

Basically Notice and Takedown: Shoot the messenger if they don't comply, and users are guilty, often still guilty even when proven innocent, all without a court ruling.



With Canada's Notice and Notice system, Youtube wouldn't need to do anything to maintain its safe-habour position, it's a free given. They would only be required to pass along the notices from copyright holders to the users, acting purely like a messenger.  YouTube wouldn't need to perform any instant takedowns; the only takedowns it would be required to do would be after they receive a court order.  This system would be much more balanced in removing the abuses currently being committed.

Basically Notice and Notice: Messenger isn't affected, users are innocent until proven guilty in court, so copyright holders will need to make damn sure their notices are valid.",1459468932

I am, however, pretty sure that your nav bar at the top is supposed to be fixed to the top so you can always get to it.

In my opinion, your about me section needs just a touch of work. Lose the full width. Lines of text shouldn't be wider than 80ch (or 2-3 alphabets wide) and lose the centering. Just do one column... maybe two columns 80 characters wide (the css for that is just p { width: 80ch } )... I say two columns because if you have a lot of stuff there it might be okay to do two side by side columns depending on how tall you want that section.

Oh now I look and it's div #b2. I would also recommend putting all of that text in a p tag within the div. Because semantics. And it's easier to target #b2 p {}. Increase the font size a touch to make it easier to read and then center that whole paragraph (maybe just use col-md-4 col-md-offset-4 since you're using bootstrap. it's okay to make a row and columns right there just for that text)

Anyways... just my opinion about that one paragraph. Really like the font choice and the color (or lack there of!)",1459468932

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","&gt; What model do you use and why?

I use the Fitbit One. I primarily bought it because instead of being a bracelet, you clip it to your bra or inside of a pocket. I wanted to keep my Fitbitting private from colleagues.

&gt; What do you mostly use it for?

Only steps. I was already using MyFitnessPal to track calories and RunKeeper to track walks and bike rides, and I was pleased with both of them and didn't want to learn a new system. So I just linked both of those up to Fitbit. I never log exercise through the Fitbit, I just let it track my steps. My bike rides still go in Runkeeper, but I stopped using it for walks since I figure the Fitbit captures it and it's not strenuous exercise.

&gt; Do you find it helpful and accurate?

I'm very competitive and a bit of a perfectionist, so I find it very motivating to see what my steps for the day are and to try to beat friends or myself. I try to hit 10K steps every day, even if it's just marching in place while watching TV at the end of the day or running up and down the stairs for a little bit. Being aware of my activity level has definitely made me more active.

I also find the calories burned *surprisingly* accurate, even without a heart rate feature. This is helpful since I allow myself to eat at maintenance on the weekends (and will one day be eating at maintenance most of the time!). I use Libra to track my weight and I weigh myself every day. Libra tells you what your deficit every week is based on the amount of weight you have lost. The calories in/calories out tracked in MFP/Fitbit are usually within ~50 cals of my Libra deficit calculation.

I love my Fitbit, but it also hits all the right buttons for my particular obsessive neuroses. Honestly I struggle a lot with perfectionism so it is probably not always the most mentally healthy thing for me, but it is definitely a huge improvement to my physical health -- which in turn helps my mental health so net gain, I think.",1459468935

I would say that this belief doesn't originate from a particular ideology ( traditional or feminist) but from a moral asymmetry inherent to all hierarchical power differences.

* It is considered morally worse for a rich person to steal from a poor person than it is for a poor person to steal from a rich person.  
*  It is considered morally worse for an adult to lose their temper at a child, than it is for a child to lose their temper at an adult.  
*  It is considered morally worse to punch a person in a wheelchair, than it is to punch a person not in a wheelchair.  
*  It is considered morally worse for a celebrity to insult a waiter, than it is for a waiter to insult a celebrity.  

The common theme is that is is generally considered morally worse to hurt someone with less power than yourself, than it is for that person to hurt you. That is why it is considered worse to hit a woman, because a woman is considered to have less power than the man.  ",1459468941

Are you saying that the mere existence of homosexual and transgender individuals is an ideology? I don't think it is. Perhaps there are ideologies among LGBT people, but being transgender is not an ideology. It is a psychological and medical fact that transgender individuals (like homosexual and bisexual, etc.) exist. 

And I still want to push you on the fact that being a white supremacist is making a stand *against* an enormous group of people (essentially all non-white humans). Being transgender does not make a stand against anyone or anything, and transgender individuals come from all walks of life - various races, nationalities, classes, and religions. 

Sure, you could argue that some Christians are transphobic. But being trans or being pro-trans is not in any way an anti-Christian (or even anti-religion) ideology the same way that being a white supremacist *is* to be anti-nonwhite.

"ColoradoAvalanche","t5_2rqi4","Brad Stuart - Coming off the playoff elimination at the hands of the Wild the biggest weakness on the team was a.) defensive depth and b.) lack of veteran experience to guide the youngsters, especially in the playoffs. So the UFA market opens up and he publically goes after Stralman and Orprik, both players who address those weaknesses. Both players say they want to stay out East, so Sakic goes after the Western Conference version of Orprik in Brad Stuart who is also significantly cheaper and all it costs him is 2 draft picks (he ultimately gets them back anyways). And of course in order to get a veteran player to commit to the program he gives him a 2 year extension with the expectations Stuart plays 3rd pairing minutes and teaches the kids a few tricks at a fraction of the cost of Brooks Orprik. **Without knowing that Stuart will be forced to play top pairing minutes due to roster injuries, exposing his regression, this move is a B+ at its worst.** Unfortunately the gamble didn't pay off, thems the breaks. Sakic did exactly what he should have done.

Stastny - As we all know by this point Stastny told Sakic not to trade him before the deadline, that he planned to re-sign and at a discount and then changed his mind. It wasn't about the money, in fact Sakic publically admitted to matching St. Louis' offer simply because you don't let a guy like that walk to a division rival. But what a lot of people seem to do on this sub is paint the memories of Stastny gold. Before that magical playoff run everyone was calling for him to be traded for depth because he was (and still is) woefully overpaid, a classic example of a player never fully living up to his talent after demonstrating it for 2 amazing seasons on a shit team. I mean he even fucked up landing the Captaincy after Foote retired. It was his for the taking and they decided to transition with Hejduk. For not throwing a dumptruck full of cash at him or not blowing up the roster to make Stastny the centerpiece I give Sakic an A-. He'll never make that mistake again.

PAP - was regularly getting benched because of poor play, was getting beaten out by Jaimie McGinn and had developed a reputation for partying. He wasn't fitting the plans so he got swapped with a draft pick for Briere and alleviating 1 year of term from the salary cap. Briere was just brought in to be a 3rd/4th center and by the halfway point he wasn't even good enough for that. This move is meh and I'd rank it as a C+ because it just removed a problematic player from the locker room.

O'Reilly - we all know the story, it's been talked about en masse. I think Sakic handled it appropriately given how ROR held out after 1 good (not great, certainly not spectacular) season. Given how public the rift between the two was, the fact that he got a GREAT return on him from Buffalo without being bent over the barrel is amazing. At its worst, that trade was a B+. (Random thought: had he not traded ROR before the DUI incident this whole situation would have played out differently, I think ROR would have lost most of his leverage).

Berra - a hot goalie coming off an international tournament performance that made him highly coveted for a second round pick? That's a wash. I don't doubt the trade had Allaire's fingerprints all over it. He was rough at first but before his injury he was stealing games for the Avs. He's obsolete now that Pickard stepped his game up. That's just hockey. It was a gamble with the keen eye of Roy/Allaire guiding it, I'll give him a C+ for it.

Iginla - He lost Stastny to the Blues and needed to get someone for the top 6 who also could bring leadership. He signed his old friend for a reasonable cap hit but had to add term, which follows the golden rule of contracts in the NHL: players can make a lot of money or get long term security, very few can get both. I'm only stating this patronizingly because the armchair GMs in this sub can't seem to get this through their heads.

Beauchemin - An improvement on the back end with a veteran Cup winning defenseman who can teach the kids some things while hopefully not being leaned on for 18+ minutes a night due to his age. But as we've seen he's made the blue line better and he's currently helping Zads develop. This move also had to tack years onto the contract in order to sign him for $1m less than he was asking Anaheim for. I give this move an A.

For the sake of brevity, and because I don't think I need to explain all of these moves:

Comeau - B

Matthias - B+

Skille - B

Bodnarchuk - C- because he was trying to do *something* to improve the blue line mid season. Unfortunately this wasn't the answer.

Redmond - B-

Soderberg - B+, maybe even an A-

Boedker - B+, and even if Boeddhisatva didn't show great chemistry with Mack just the fact that he dumped the Tanguay anchor immediately improved this team.

Gormley - C+

Gelinas - kinda hard to tell but we didn't really pay anything for him, so at least a C+

Drafting - kind of too soon to tell, Bleackley withstanding. The organization as a whole doesn't have the best track record drafting so hopefully this improves.

Potential deals - Surprisingly, Sakic is very vocal about what he tries to do. He went after Stralman, Orprik and Sekera. It was known he called about Drouin (but what GM didn't). He went after Dougie Hamilton. Yet, he's not going to handicap the salary cap structure by overpaying for outside talent while being patient enough for our blue chip defensive prospects to mature. This is where he gets my highest praise. Solid A.

TL;DR - Sakic hasn't made any huge splashes, but that's okay. He turned a Nama$te shit sandwich into a great return when he easily could have been fleeced. He's turned Colorado into a FA destination again and while he's often had to sacrifice term for cap hit he's made shrewd moves to address needs without sacrificing too much to do so. At this moment I'd give him a B+ with lots of room to get better, especially if we can start drafting regular talent.",1459468944

Susan and Martin were astronauts that encountered a Buck Rodgers/Planet Of The Apes type event where they find themselves in a very unfamiliar future. At some point the following events occur (sequence unknown): They seek refuge underground where they meet what they at least at first think of as the last tribe of humans. Finn is born, possibly conceived as a repopulate the species type plan. Susan gets janked.
At this point Martin tries to fix her and only kind-of succeeds. Not happy with the new Susan he bails with Finn but then decides that raising a baby alone isn't his thing and ditches Finn.
As i was typing, I had an even more speculative thought. Still going along with the out-of-time people scenario, the tech in Susan is some sort of adaptation device. Smart setting, strong setting, etc... where you can be one but not both and it just got stuck on strong (Martin's doing?). It could also just be a computer enhancement that has failed.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I'm going to give you my answer while wearing two hats: my hat as a person who identifies as queer, and my hat as a researcher on issues of gender &amp; sexuality.

Queer can be seen as a ""reclaimed"" slur, meaning that while it was used predominately as a derogatory slur in the past, those who it was used against have sought to make it less toxic. This is the way that I use it when referring to myself. I once wrote:
&gt;[. . .] Being “in the closet” to most, it came as quite a shock to be called, at work, a “fucking queer”. To have someone use such language in that context forces one to the introspect, to question whether labels applied are validly representative, and test oneself.
[. . .] I felt that “Queer” was appropriate most of all as the tension that the community’s experience of it, being of whether it is a reclaimable term after such a toxic use, reflected my own inner tensions regarding my identity [. . .] 

Others may still view the term as offensive and derogatory, regardless of who uses it, as did ""[lgbvoice](http://lgbvoice.org/outrage-as-huffpost-gay-voices-changes-its-name-to-queer-to-placate-transgender-agenda/)"".

QMUNITY, an LGBT2SQ+ resource centre in Vancouver, BC, offers [this definition](http://qmunity.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Queer_Terminology_Web_Version__Sept_2013__Cover_and_pages_.pdf): 
&gt; A term becoming more widely used among LGBT
communities because of its inclusiveness. ‘Queer’ can be used
to refer to the range of non-heterosexual and non-cisgender
people and provides a convenient shorthand for ‘LGBT’. It is
important to note that this is a reclaimed term that was once
and is still used as a hate term and thus some people feel
uncomfortable with it. Not all trans* people see trans* identities
as being part of the term ‘queer’.

In responding to the part of your question (""not lesbian, gay, bi, or trans""), sometimes yes, sometimes no. I identify as non-binary and trans. Some non-binary queer-identifying people I know, though, don't identify as trans. This may be due to several reasons, sometimes dealing with medical procedures, etc...., however it is incredibly personal and I haven't felt it appropriate to ask any of them exactly why.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","**The Hlistosese Church** an ancient religion which claims to have existed even when humans were bound to a single planet, the Hlistosese worship Hlistos, who they believe was impaled upon a stake; stakes are the symbol of this religion, with many of the peasants using tiny stakes as symbols of their worship. The leaders of this faith are known as Shepherds, all save for he highest ranked shepherd, referred to as the Mason. However, due to the widespread nature of the Church, it has difficulty enforcing its orthodoxy on far out regions, where the church often picks up local beliefs, creating a constant struggle for the missionaries who strive to overcome heresy, sectationalism, and varying denominations, who themselves are seeking to proselytize. In the worst case scenarios, these heterodoxies become other religions. The Church is heavily involved in the politics of the EHE, but not as much as in earlier days, as many recent emperors have (perhaps foolishly) forgone aid from the Church's fleets and funds in effort to become more independent of it. They might, however, have picked a better time to do this...

Okay, I must cease this in-universe monologue to explain what follows hereafter. **The Church of the Three** is the belief of most of the Khymeragh tribes, who, rather than believing that their older pagan gods never existed, believe that they were defeated in combat and slain by the Three (note that when referring to the Three doing something, the verb is conjugated as singular i.e. ""The Three *is* good,"" not, ""The Three *are* good""). Though the religion emphasizes sacrifices, and makes constant metaphors to war as a comparison to the daily struggle of the faith, the Druids of the Three are actually a stabilizing influence on the naturally violent Khymeragh, but not for the reasons one would think. 

The Faith of the Three might be an offshoot of the Hlistosese Church, which would suggest that their ""prophet"" was actually a human missionary, but this could never be confirmed. I designed the religion as a combination of Celtic Paganism, Celtic Christianity, and Presbyterianism (three guesses as to which culture they're based off of), however I have realized that some might make comparisons to Islam due to it being an offshoot of another monotheistic faith, and it being largely based off of the teachings of a single ""prophet"" in an inhospitable landscape. Or Mormonism.

(Riddle: If highly genetically modified race has a religion based of off Presbyterianism, what does that make them?)",1459468951

Level 1(basic brain chemistry), you have generalized anxiety, which is illogical, unreasonable feelings of dread, fear, and angst, that have little nothing to do with your real circumstances. 

Level 2 (subconscious) the brain wants consistency so you try to **explain** the dread by creating beliefs about your self-worth. ""I can't. I'm not good enough. I'm a failure. Other people secretly hate me, etc.""

Level 3 (conscious) again, to avoid cognitive dissonance you go looking for information and narratives that **confirm** these beliefs.

Facts and information that don't conform to these beliefs is discarded by your brain without you being aware of it.

My driver's license is expiring soon, so I'm getting a bazillion copies of he current license notarized, then going for my Motorcycle endorsement. It's something I've always been meaning to do, but put off because I'm too lazy to take the class. I'm going to put off my concealed carry for now- another thing I've put off for too long.

I'm going to drink a lot, and I mean a lot, of beer.

I just addressed this in my reply to someone else, lol. Yeah, in philosophy ""reality"" means the absolute nature of the universe regardless of anyone's perception of it, so in your case, you would have to say it doesn't exist, which is where the contradiction comes from later.

&gt;The statement ""there are no absolute truths"" could assume that even that can be potentially be falsified

Yeah, but that's the thing: if ""there are no absolute truths"" can be false, then you can't say ""there are no absolute truths."" It would essentially be like saying ""2+2=4, but sometimes it might equal 5."" It doesn't work like that; either there are absolute truths or there are not, but the latter is impossible because in order for there to be no absolute truths, that would have to be absolutely true.

Essentially, you'd have to accept that there is at least one absolute truth (that there are no absolute truths), in which case you'd then have to accept that there could be more absolute truths, which renders the entire statement inaccurate.",1459468958

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","The ""paranoia"" about the fbi and other agencies like the NSA, is that they slowly creep power and authority during times of fear. For example the entire backbone of the NSA's ability to record data and track citizens was partially created by the FBI. They abused their authority during the fear following 9/11 and without any public knowledge tracked citizens. You can argue for or against this but the fact that we learned about it after they had done it is worrying enough. During the latter half of the 20th century the FBI also abused their power with their cointelpro projects, in which they tracked ""radicals"" such as MLK and feminists. This isn't even touching upon all the shady shit that goes on with secret courts. 

I think it's fine for them to be able to open phones. The problem is that the checks and balances system has been entirely bastardized, especially considering the fact that citizens were supposed to be an external check on government, yet we don't know half the shit they do or even how much power they have. It's obviously complex because of security issues but I think having a ""paranoid"" attitude towards the government is a good thing especially in this day and age, since it can create a block against power creeps.

It keeps their startle under control, but allows them to use their hands for soothing. I can't link ATM on mobile but if you Google there are some decent vids. We used basic aden+anais muslins as I found them bigger so could get a good tight wrap.

Edit to add: another thing I noticed about this swaddling technique as opposed to other arms up ones is that the fabric at their legs is left loose. My guy likes to kick and stretch his legs and I think he found it less comfortable to have his legs bound up in the swaddle. I know the recommendation in the US is no blankets in the cot, but we do a tight sheet tuck over the legs here so it helps to give them that secure feedback for their legs pushing into something, without it being part of the swaddle.",1459468961

The gist of the MRA position seems to be ""let the chips fall where they may"" with regards to these roles. In other words, you are free to operate outside the roles without repercussion, but it is expected that most people will generally conform to them and therefore general statistics are expected to fall into these patterns.

Consider the MRA positions on the draft and women in combat. They want women to be drafted into military roles, but many don't want them in combat for fear of a reduction in combat effectiveness.

Remove some of the weapon parts from mission rewards and rework the blueprints to not have parts. Right now you either need to farm for weapon parts or invest heavily in clan tech to progress your archwing arsenal at all.

To refill the drop tables that are now lacking drops because parts have been removed, add archwing mods to the mission drop tables and increase the drop chances of the mods already there. I have put a decent amount of time into archwing (couldn't say specifically how much), and I only have 3 of the elemental damage mods for arch gun and 2 of the elemental damage mods for arch melee. I have 1 Shell Rush, an uncommon mod, while I have 4 Automatic Triggers, a rare mod, and they are on the same drop table.

"Yogscast","t5_2sg86","**Lewis: (A)**  Lewis is seen with only 6 total ships, of which some are probably civilian ships like colony/scout/construction.  Lewis is starting to pull ahead in terms of cash/planets/population/tech but isn't defending himself... but because he's Lewis no one will ever try to attack him.

**Sjin: (A-)** We don't see much of Sjin.  He learns about custom ship designs, but the fact he didn't know before probably means he won't be quite as adept at it as Ben/Duncan.  He still has a large military.

**Ben: (A-)** He teaches another class in how the game actually works.  Everyone is amazed.  In the preview of next episode we see Ben max'ing out his ship count and storing up a huge surplus of cash (either because he's afraid of ""the glitch"" or because he can re-max out his military instantly after a few loses using that cash).

**Duncan: (B-)** Thankfully the planet the pirates are nuking was terrible anyways.  Although parv'ing it right up is a drawback.

**Pyrion: (C+)** Pyrion might be behind in tech and planets but at the start of this episode he has 10 ships.  That's enough to matter. Come on Pyrion make the plays.  Duncan really is a bully in these games. He's settled so that Pyrion has half as much territory as him, then starts crying when Pyrion tries to do something about it.

**Note:** One of the biggest measures of power in this game is total population and total number of worlds.  We're not really getting updates on either of these. Although we see Lewis has 18/6 it's hard to say where everyone else stands.  Sjin is behind Lewis on tech and so is Ben.  This might just be because they spent their population's time on building ships though (not any indication their population is lower.)  

**Science:** Lewis don't worry we don't even need rockets on those asteroids.  There is already an asteroid taxi that travels between earth and mars (most of the way).  That is why it was such a big deal to land a rocket on an asteroid last year.  That's a real plan.  IIRC the asteroid isn't just a cheap means of transport, it's bulk will create a tiny gravitational field sufficient to block solar radiation.  Radiation is one of the main reasons we cannot simply fly a rocket to mars.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; The gut feeling isn't that naturalism is unsatisfyingly unspooky, but that the mind, math and so on are curiously unnatural and that there is an explanatory gap between those things and the naturalist account of them.

But again, it's a gut feeling, one with which many people, particularly naturalists, disagree.

&gt;Now I can simply deny the existence of those things because the gap is scary, which is what I consider to be dogmatic materialism,

That's a strawman.  No naturalist denies the existence of morality or mathematics or minds.  We aim to provide, and partially have already provided, naturalistic accounts and explanations for them.

If you refuse to accept those accounts *because they are naturalistic*, then I don't see any ""explanatory gap"", I see you being unsatisfied with non-spookiness.

&gt;If you are honest and open you must concede that Plantinga and others have a point when they target the self-defeating characteristics and the lack of power that materialism and naturalism have. 

I don't see any lack of explanatory power, nor any self-defeating characteristics.  Could you explain further?

&gt;Now when it comes to natural theology, that is actually the area of theology where I consider theology to be completely misplaced. We have better tools to explain the material world than revealed scripture. It is not the place for religion to offer us valuable answers. 

No.  Blatantly incorrect.  That is a *rationalization*.  Nobody said this *until* it turned out that miracles could not be observed empirically, that naturalism provides complete explanations for the observable world, and in fact that basic archaeology largely excludes revealed scriptures from being accurate accounts of history.

Until then, everyone thought scripture was *actually true*, to the point that the first archaeologists were deliberately using the Bible as a reference text to look for remains and artifacts of Biblical events.

The material and the religious are not pried apart that easily!  Either Christ rose from the dead, or he did not!  There is no third sense in which we can say that ""materially"" Jesus of Nazareth died and remained so, while ""spiritually"" he rose, broke open Sheol, and granted his believers eternal life.",1459468968

"Forex","t5_2qhmq","Just a few tips man:

1) Money manage. 2% per trade. At this point with forex don't expect to make money for 1 year+. You're still learning. The most dangerous idea is: ""Look at all this wasted time, If i was using 'big' money I could've made $XXX by now!"".

In forex starting capital barely matters. If you're actually good at it, and practiced. You can take out a loan or borrow from friends and family and get started. The important thing is actually getting good at it. With money management you can atleast be sure your account doesn't explode in one big bang. Worse case it will slowly bleed out, which gives you time to plan/re-consider.

2) Trend following is a losers game. (That doesn't mean it's not profitable though). I just mean if you're following trends: expect to set 50 pip stoplosses and expect to LOSE more than you win. (Just that you ride the winners out and make money from how far they go). You can see this is one of the worse strategies to over-leverage on. (some strategies aren't so catastrophic, but all will eventually be detrimental).


3) That trade you put down was batshit insane. Not just the leverage but it NEVER would have worked out unless a nuke hit the US, and Canada found that their young prime minister shat gold.

http://imgur.com/997Ds9k

If this is the trade you took. Just look at where it's positioned on a bollinger band. It's been stretching the lower bound (5 minute 100 period 2 and 3 deviation) for a good while there. It can't keep doing this. Why would you choose to SELL at such a low point? Forex price is like an elastic band. It can stretch and wave but it rarely goes in one direction and stretches the band like that for more than a few bars. (Unless ofcourse there's a major news catalyst, not a small difference in the job figures).

You should have BOUGHT at that point, thinking hey this price is so low. Or, more sensibly you should have waited until it bounced up out of that lower bollinger hug, and then shorted it again at maybe 1.28991. You still might have gotten stopped out, but the trade makes much more sense. It's eased off the bollinger band and you're betting the down trend will continue (It doesn't, but if it did you would've made money).

4) Assume that forex price always zig zags. It never goes in a straight line.
You have a massive LOSING trade. THis means price has gone one way for a long time. Why would you at that point in this zig zag market bet that it's going to keep going that way? The longer price moves in one direction the more probability it's going to turn around atleast a little bit. 

5) You're not waiting for trades to play out. The market moves in 50-100 pip zig zags. You're putting trades down and then getting upset about them when they move 3 pips the wrong way.

I did stretching and epsom salts all the time too and none of them helped nearly anywhere NEAR as much as the foam roller. I used to sit there and attempt to foam roll but nothing was really happening &gt;.&gt; Once I started really getting in there, it helped.

Here is the key thing to keep in mind. PRESSURE. Don't roll with only your bodyweight and keeping the weight all on your arms, too. Push down, and try your hardest to get the weight off your arms/whatever is holding you up, and down into the spot. If you're tired and sore after, probably a good sign. 

First, I roll out my hamstrings a few times, a move like this, first with both legs flat then one leg raised like this on each side:
http://i.imgur.com/S5mzmn4.gif

Then I sit up, and move to my upper butt, like this. I do this for a while, then sit up even more with my chest leaning forward to really get into the muscle. My piriformis/butt area was hurting the most at first and this really let the pain up. Push down, roll in small increments, really get in there. This is where it's really important to take the weight off your arms, lean in, and push down on where it matters.
http://furthermore-media.equinox.com/cms/images/e97c0511-84f7-4882-8be8-d29685eb3899/en-us/foam-roller6.gif

In all these positions, try to turn slightly at an angle to get your inner thighs too, not just the bottom. Turn however you can to roll in there too. Lift your left leg out of the way, for example, and roll left a little and get in the inner area.

Then, I turn over and do this on both sides. Don't just flop around, push :) In this position, if you move the bent leg up even higher to your shoulder if you, you can twist in different ways to hit different spots.
http://www.mundofitness.com/wp-content/uploads/cuadriceps.gif

Finally, I sit up and straddle it and move back and forth on both sides, like this pic:
https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/inner-thigh1.jpg

First things first, I gotta get the hype from the CSGO major outta my system. NA &gt; EU!!! LIQUID ARE DOING IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NA PRIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Played more Resident Evil 4 so I could finally 100% the game (in terms of achievements). I am super glad that I was using the special costume which gives Ashely a suit of armor. I could completely ignore her for the whole game and even use her to lure enemies, which was great. I managed to make one of the boss fights super easy by making the boss attack her instead of me. It was a fun ride, and now I can move on to Resident Evil 5. I heard that 6 is pretty bad though, which kinda sucks since I was thinking about getting it when it is on sale again. 

So I beat Resident Evil 5 already on veteran mode. I enjoyed it about half as much when compared to RE4. The story felt a lot cheesier, bosses felt really off since they were mostly big set pieces, and the AI partner is horrible to work with. Plus the inventory system isn't that good, since I would often find myself full on items, so I couldn't focus on stocking up on anything. I also wasn't a fan of the enemy encounters in the game, felt too fast paced for me, which were also the sections I hated in RE4 because it just made no sense to have endless enemies that spawn outta nowhere. On the upside, weapon upgrades are persistent, so that'll make pro mode a lot easier. 

My most memorable achievement would be one that I never even got. It was Halo 3's Two for One achievement, where you had to get a double kill with the spartan laser in a free for all playlist. I tried for weeks to get this achievement, since it was the only one I was missing in Halo 3. The closest I got was when I lasered a ghost that was getting hijacked. But instead of killing both of them like I thought it should, it just ended the hijacking. I still fucking hate that achievement to this day, and it also makes me hate most, if not all multiplayer achievements.

So technically, they are the same product but with different versions, sort of like how Windows XP and Windows XP SP1 aren't the same thing but aren't a completely different product either.

There are laws for delivering a different product than promised without explicit permission of the consumer, which could potentially be applied to it because there's no interchangeability of the licenses and each of the three major versions has stuff that is missing compared to other versions, but because the OS you have is being licensed to you rather than sold to you those laws may not actually apply; I know they do where I am but it varies from country to country and I think in USA they don't.

And as for the updates, for as long as it's only the product version that is changing there's a lot of leeway for them, a whole lot of it. Mostly because by accepting to the terms of the EULA and leaving the updates on automatic you gave them your agreement to tinker with it, as far as the legal side of it is concerned. This is why they actually got to adding the option to disable auto-updates in Windows 10, as without that being a thing there would be no way to not give your agreement which made it legally wonky.",1459468981

"PvZGardenWarfare","t5_305ov","If there's a bias for the zombie side it's not really balanced.

I have the same experience as OP on all accounts. There's always games where the plant team has good synergy and the zombies slack a bit but those are not the norm.

* Gnome bomb: in the end it comes down to hectic close range fights where zombies are king. Since this is always a chase after the bomb carrier the plants can't set up a long range defense. Definately easier for zombies to win.

* Turf Takeover: this is like the holy grail of the game modes, it's challenging and fun, BUT plants are heavily handicapped when they have to attack. When defending I think small character tweaks such as Elektro brains and the three OP scientists could be enough to balance it out + some buffs on the weaker plant variants. We'll have to wait and see on this one. You have to agree that mechs / scientist insta kills and spinning brains are a lot better for capturing AND defending in this game mode.

* Vanquish confirmed: can go both ways. Zombies are better close range which gives them an edge in collecting orbs, but it's not as bad as the other modes.

* Suburbination: Basically the same as turf takeover. The fight takes place at the middle base where chaos reigns so it's easier to come out on top as zombie side. Although it's not as bad as turf takeover. You'll know right away if you have a team that has a shot at winning.",1459468982

"Albuquerque","t5_2qxoe","Just hiked it a week ago (week and a half?) and the top two miles were still ice and snow. Impassable in regular hiking shoes. If you're not a regular hiker, and don't have [crampons](http://www.amazon.com/mountaineering-and-ice-climbing-crampons/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=3402711) for the ice, definitely don't start at the top and try to head down.

If you heard the bottom section was hard, it's because it's mostly switchbacks through sand. Skip a couple miles by not starting from the Tram parking lot, but from the actual trail head at FR 333 instead (right off Tramway). Still count on several miles of sandy exposure to the sun. Bring more water than you think you need.

If you're new to hiking, that may not be the most rewarding trail to begin with (I consider the first few miles boring hell). Check out the Pino Trail. More foliage, less well-used, and significantly fewer sandy switchbacks.

As a side note, I recommend going up over going down. Elevation changes will be more gradual and affect you less if you hike up rather than tram up, and going down the whole thing will be very hard on your knees. 

You can also decide X miles was enough thank you very much and turn around whenever you want.",1459468985

I agree that communication CAN have benefits. Where I disagree is that communication is necessary. A lot of my favorite games had absolutely no communication with fans whatsoever during the development process. And there are examples (like the recent kerfuffle with Overwatch) where open communication just enrages the community for no good reason. Because sometimes the devs are going to make decisions you don't like or do it for reasons that you don't like. AND THAT'S OKAY. Because we don't own the game.

So, hypothetically, Valve goes in and removes one of the sexist lines from Left 4 Dead 2 that Nick says. I and the other addicts launch it immediately and play for hours. Teamkillers go around and continue teamkilling. Noobs continue seeking out the hardest difficulty games to fuck up royally in. 

I don't know shit about Overwatch or whatever, but how isn't that the same? Why are people so pissy about it? Stop crying and play the game. Or don't. Nobody cares, honestly. Seriously.

Yeah, a lot of it is dialogue, even if it is a very interesting story that I would really enjoy reading in its final form. The dandelion was impactful and carried weight, but it just would've meant that much more if his death was unavoidable (to me). It's definitely something you should continue.

As for the narration, I kind of liked how it was from his perspective. If you continued it and made her the main character of the series, it would set an interesting precedent if you started this way. You could even make it so that it started with the perspective of one person and continued from the perspective of the person who killed him/her the next issue.

As for re-scripting, everyone has a different format they like to use or that they use. It's almost completely subjective, so I just write it the first time how I like it and re-format it for wherever I submit it to.

Wood, paper, oil, etc already have a tendency to react with oxygen, but normally this is dampened by the fact that the Earth's atmosphere is mostly inert nitrogen gas; in a medium of pure oxygen, the reaction is less 'diluted' and tends to run faster and hotter. Essentially, things are *more* flammable the more oxygen they're touching. But the oxygen *itself* isn't flammable.

That said, the temperatures on the surface of a white dwarf are very high, possibly high enough that the substances there exist in a state of thermal plasma and cannot undergo any chemical reactions at all due to being too hot. If that's the case, a normally 'flammable' substance like wood, if thrown onto the white dwarf, wouldn't so much 'burn' in the traditional sense but rather just immediately disintegrate into its constituent atoms from the intense heat.",1459468991

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","I run solo as well, unless I'm with friends. Or when I do the challenge modes. I've had more irritable experiences than good with random groups, when it comes to VOIP in this game because of the default open mic and lack of region specific matchmaking. (the language barrier and all). Although I did end up in a pretty good group with a couple Brits and another American last night on Russian Consulate challenge mode. So at least I was with people who spoke English and had PTT on.

I just don't get why PTT isn't on by default in this game and there's no hint or ""tutorial"" for it that lets people know about it. There's a tutorial for everything else. I think half the people don't even realize that open mic is default. (Which baffles me because I'm sure everybody has been in the settings menu to tweak and set things up to their liking. How could you miss it?) And I think the other half just don't care. Common courtesy, man.....turn PTT on. Or if one prefers not mashing a button to speak, at least adjust the threshold and the levels on your mic so it doesn't pick up every single little noise and blare it at ear piercing volume.

In the meantime, the group management menu and mute button sees a lot of action over here.",1459468994
"AbandonedPorn","t5_2sh6t","I would imagine. Those old jets were loud as hell. 

Just for fun- Anything on a modern airliner now uses a ""turbofan"" which has a high volume of ""bypass air"" that is not actually directly accelerated through combustion. Instead the air is accelerated around the outside of the internal combustion jet by fans connected via the main drive shaft. This greatly reduces noise.

Theosophy took this idea and ran with it, comeing up with a whole bunch of mythology based on the existence of the lost continents of Atlantis and Lumeria. By the time the theory of continental drift came along they where committed and could nolonger adapt to chaning science.  Theosophy is still around, and todays Theosophists still maintain that Atlantis and Lumeria really existed, even though this is nolonger scientifically pluasable.  ",1459468996

But nah, Joel is NE because I had to pick between 8 people and 1 plastic man and assign them to each role. They aren't all 100% L/N/C and G/N/E. 

My reasoning was that Joel has no compulsion to listen to others when they call him over to play GTA and be made fun of, but he sometimes helps if he chooses. Joel does stuff for Joel. He could save his time and be more productive by making uncreative comments but he doesn't, making him neutral. And with him vs Omar and Peake, he got evil as I haven't seen Omar's personality yet and Peake is more good than evil. 

The only ""evil"" thing Joel has ever done is argue or insult anyone on camera. But that's not 100% evil or something only he does, nor is it his behaviour all the time.

"thedivision","t5_2xiqd","&gt; Again, it doesn't really matter how much time you've spent in the game,

It very much does matter. If you condense 200 hours into even 3 or 4 weeks then yeah, you're going to run through everything in the game knowing that more is coming soon. That is an astronomical amount of time compared to what almost everyone else will be putting into the game in the same timeframe.

Your ""two end game activities"" aren't going to matter when the majority of people aren't even at that point yet and if they are most of them are just starting them, just two weeks before the further end game gets dropped.

You can't say that time spent has nothing to do with it when time spent has everything to do with it. If you spent 30 hours in the game, I guarantee you that you aren't going to be anywhere near the same position as someone with 100 hours in or even 200. It's like eating all the food in the house in two days knowing that you won't get more for a couple weeks. If you dumped that much time and dried up the content in the game then that is nothing but your choice and problem and how much time you spent on the game.

And you bring up Destiny. Literally the only thing Destiny had as remotely arguable end game at launch was pvp, which wasn't even really end game. Strikes weren't end game.

Another thing, carefully push on the nib and feed - make sure they feel like they are pushed all the way into the grip section. If some reason they are pulled out slightly that can cause the ink to flow. And then might also try making sure that the converter or cartridge is pushed all the way onto the feed.

Take u/asdfjlk55's advice and find comparable salaries and start high, but not unreasonably high. You want to start your new job with the highest baseline possible. Not only does this mean more money now but it also means:
1. A higher baseline for calculation of your incentive comp (if you're entitled to it).
2. A higher baseline for any raise you get in the future, since they're almost always calculated as a percent.
3. A higher starting point in case you're offered a job at a differnt company and they want to know how much you currently make. (ps. always be honest in this circumstance in case they ask for proof. lying would be a stupid reason to lose out on a good job opportunity.)

You eat food, take showers, and sleep in a bed.  They don't sound self-serging and you certainly don't sound oppressed.

I know you're asking for financial advice but take it from someone who is bipolar and at 18 years old also had the same cavalier, ""rule the world"" attitude...  I used to think everyone was out to get me at that age.  Now that I've moved out and joined the real world, and more importantly had children of my own, I'm confident in saying that you probably won't have an appreciation for your parents until you go through it yourself.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","RE: C

&gt; Dangerous. If you mess around with C without knowing what you're doing, you can really mess up your computer. It usually won't go further than having to reboot, but C won't stop you from doing things like accidentally fork-bombing your computer or overwriting memory that doesn't necessarily belong to your program.

Totally wrong.  All modern operating systems isolate your program from other processes on the computer.  You can't overwrite memory that doesn't belong to your program.  You cannot mess up your computer.  You won't have to reboot your computer.  Yes, you can fork bomb, but you can do that in *any* language.

&gt; You need GCC or an equivalent to compile it. Basically, C is a language that is best used in a Linux environment, so much so that getting C manual pages for built-in functions in C is a built-in command on the Linux shell! It's possible to get something in Windows that you can work with, but it's really just so much easier if you have access to an Ubuntu VM or something, so you can just install GCC on there.

I wouldn't put this under the ""downsides"" category.  It just is.  Just like you need the Java compiler for Java or a Python interpreter for Python.  Also, MSVC is a decent-enough C compiler and IDE, so while a Linux environment is a great way to do C programming, I don't think it's fair to say ""It's possible to get something in Windows that you can work with.""

RE: Java

&gt; VERY slow. In order to stay as high-level as it is, Java needs to run a bunch of background stuff that significantly slows down your program. This is why it's seen as kind of bad practice to make games in Java (see: the backlash against Notch for making Minecraft in Java).

It's not as slow as it's reputation claims.  And it's certainly not so slow as to factor into a choice of first language.  It's absolutely faster than Python, which is backwards from the way you've worded things.

I would add the disadvantage that Java programmers like to use design patterns to a fault.  If I have to deal with one more AbstractFactoryFactory I'm going to tear my keyboard from the computer.",1459469007

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","&gt; I loved defense missions in Radiant Dawn!!!!

Conquest seems like a good fit for you: it has a few defense maps, a few ""arrive""/""escape"" maps, lots of side objectives in maps, and a bunch of new nifty mechanics that make it more tactical than most FE games (a new Pair Up system, ""Dragon Veins"" which can alter the landscape, new skills, etc).  It has some interesting team compositioning, uses ballistas, etc.

&gt; I also loved the character interactions of Radiant Dawn. Most of the characters were pretty well done IMO. So, it does sound like Conquest will suit me better at first. 

Personally (as another super-Tellius fan who loves RD), I found Conquest's cast to be very enjoyable and very interesting.  There are lots of characters with supports that help provide some world-building or backstories, and Nohr is an interesting country.  One problem with both Conquest and Birthright is that this world-building is never fully expanded on the way it has been in past games, so it will pale in comparison to the Tellius games.  That said, Conquest does have a lot of characters that feel reminiscent of how many Tellius characters were created, written, and developed.",1459469010

"WingChun","t5_2qkn0","On the flip side, there are just as many things about modern MMA that favor strikers too. The fight starts from standing - The grappler needs to close the distance and take the opponent down to be effective. We've also seen many refs stand fighters back up if there is too much inactivity on the ground. Also, that whole soft floor thing works both ways - It may soften striking power a bit, but it softens trauma from takedowns (especially throws) a whole lot more. There's a reason why judokas train on mats and sprung floors.

I don't really see the anti-grappling bias in modern MMA. I reckon it's become more of a game of strikers who know just enough defensive grappling to keep the fight standing up.",1459469010
"The_Donald","t5_38unr","I'm a woman and here are my thoughts on abortion.

First I'll give my hard ""yes"" answers. 

Abortion because of medical necessity (for mother or unborn child). - Yes. It's a sad difficult, but necessary choice for the mother to make.

Abortion because of rape and/or incest. - Yes. Again, it's sad, but the life of the mother matters and something like that could completely destroy them and I believe it's a choice for the mother to make.

I think it's important here for me to address a reality. The vast majority of the time, a fetus is not grieved over the same way an individual outside the womb is. There is a reason for that. Because we really don't yet ""know"" them as a separate individual. I think everyone knows this is the reality and it shouldn't be overlooked and we need to address this issue with the logic of that knowledge. 

Depending on when someone believes life begins, the question of abortion to me is, in a way, like the question a friend asked me as a child during a game of ""Would you rather?"" when they said ""If you could only save one family member from a fire would you rather save _________ or _________?"" How can you even answer that?

By having a child, an individual is entering into a contract of sorts. They are either binding their own life to the care of that child or someone else's life. I'm not willing to take on the burden of caring for someone else's child, so why should I be involved in this?  

I do have problems with abortion for a number of reasons. One is that I do value life. Another reason is that I think there was some racist motivation behind pushing for abortions.  

On the other hand, even as a person that values life, I can't logically ignore the reality that I value the life of my husband more than the life of a stranger. People can say they value all life equally, but you have to admit that the life of a person closer to you is more highly valued by you than the life of a person you don't know. 

Emotionally, I think it's profoundly sad and an unthinkable choice.

Logically I think that it's the choice of the individuals closer to the situation to make this already difficult choice of who to save. 

Realistically, I think it is settled law and even if it were somehow overturned it wouldn't change the reality that people are going to continue to be impregnated, there's not enough people willing to take on the burden of the result of this and people will still find a way to deal with this situation. 

So they always want to push everyone to label themselves as either pro-life or pro-choice, but I don't believe it's always that clear cut.


Here's the bottom line. 

I think abortion law is settled as it should be. 

I think realistically it must remain legal, but I don't think people morally opposed should have to pay for it. In other words, I wouldn't be opposed to removing tax funding of abortions (as far as I know, it's not that much anyway and could be picked up by privately ran charities). 

I do think birth control education is important and should be continued and expanded upon. ",1459469010

The reason why blacks are more often in prison might of corse be a racist justice system for example.

That is retarded. 

That's like ignoring credit rating and incomes of black loan applicants and using the fact that they're black instead.

You have a resume. You have an interview. You have references. You have background checks. You can get a very fucking detailed view of your applicant. One that doesn't require racist assumptions.

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","Game I thought was overall disappointing. It was fun to explore and do all the probes, and some of the sidequests, but after that it felt very boring. The game overall felt very much like it wanted you to make your own goals and do what you wished since its so open world, and there's very little to do other than those quests and making skells end game. The worlds felt dead compared to Xenoblade Chronicles. Maybe its my preferred genre to play Xenoblade Chronicles, but the characters and the story kept me interested. I felt like XCX would have been better if it wasn't mission based and a bit more linear. It made the story feel so disjointed. Honestly at some point the affinity missions became more interesting than the main story.

Overall I prefer the ease of exploration in XCX, but in Xenoblade Chronicles everything else I enjoyed more. I felt that the combat was a bit better in the first one. And skells I felt ruined the game in that it made the world smaller and skell combat overall wasn't too enjoyable.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;But fossil fuel interests are also sending checks directly to her campaign. Clinton has take in nearly $268,000 in contributions from individuals employed in the oil and gas sector this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who does not have a super PAC spending on his behalf, took in just over $35,000.

I guess sanders should be taken to task for that 35k from EMPLOYEES of oil companies and should be asked to return it?


its a bit specious to include individual contributions and claim that if any employee of any business donates to your campaign that means the entire business did. AT THE VERY LEAST.. they could prove it is executives and not just rank and file employees.

or ""investors linked to the oil industry""..  they are two fucking hedge fund managers. Wow, they buy stocks in oil companies sometimes. you do know what a hedge fund is? and why they exist? you get two different stocks that are counter cyclical to each other, to protect yourself from massive crashes. meaning when one goes down the other tends to go up.. you hedge your bet. meaning they will have investments that go up when oil goes down. its overly simple but thats basically it. But really you take high risk, high potential for reward or failure and make it low risk, lower potential for reward or failure. Fuck i figured they meant some VC that funds oil exploration.. or some investors internal to the industry, but just to hedge fund dudes? yawn

&gt;As well as holding substantial assets in oil and gas, Shaw is also an investor in solar energy projects and an ambitious offshore wind project in New England

wow its almost like he likes the energy sector. weird.

employee contributions mean nothing. Executive and pac mean more. and unless you can define the investors, thats a very suspiciously vague claim.

tell me, all you sander supporters who donated to him. Do you have a job? did you boss influence you at all? do you think your donation influences Bernie to support the business you work for?

both sides do this each election.. and you just got to learn, unless they are talking executives and pacs(unfortunately the pacs are too opaque and really make this all useless, being anonymous you cant tell if anyone is getting massive oil money.), its nothing but political spin. me donating to bernie has nothing to do with my job but then again, I'm not the boss.

The Sye notes have already been added to the timelines as CG's notes of his testimony on direct and cross.

I call bullshit. 

[ETA: The timelines aren't *why* I call bullshit. I would have done that anyway. I'm just trying to highlight how crazy it is that people are now arguing that chunklunk's mistake born of a mistake is a fact.]

The Nisha notes are an exact summary of the key points of her testimony, down to the words used.

Coach Sye did not testify that Adnan was going to receive a varsity letter. He did not testify to his home and work numbers. There is nothing in those notes about football, sprints, Sye's work at the Epilepsy Association, and the content of the conversation he had with Adnan, nor is there even any reference to it.

I could literally go on for another 750 words without reaching the end of the differences **because the notes are obviously not notes taken during testimony**. The way you can tell that is that **they do not summarize the testimony**.

Of course they coincide, ffs. Track was when it was. Ramadan as well. Muslim students did attend practice but didn't run. OBVIOUSLY those things are going to be the same in every iteration.

/u/chunklunk made a mistake that was based on a mistake and it's now enshrined over at SPO for **no reason** apart from bias. I can't even say ""wishful thinking,"" because the thinking isn't there in any form more elaborate than ""UD wrong, lying, concealing proof of Adnan's guilt, always."" 

Nothing happened except that Colin Miller said he thought there were PI notes on Nisha, then discovered that in fact they were notes of her trial testimony.

I seriously don't know how the visual similarity can even be construed to mean anything. They're notes taken by the same person, using the same note-taking method. What part of that isn't normal and expected? It would be weird if they looked *different*, ffs.

I'm kind of young, so my earliest memories of following Madrid I think are from right before Mourinho started coaching us. 

Barcelona have dominated since then. 



I remember the 6-2, I remember that 5-0 under Mourinho and I remember lots of anger from the other Clásicos since then. 


I also remember the joy of winning the league with record breaking points and I remember winning the Champions League. 



The joy I felt when Real Madrid won the Champions League was incredible. 



I remember thinking ""this is it, this is where OUR dominance begins, this is going to be OUR golden generation (obviously it didn't turn out that way). 



My point is, I celebrated this teams victories.  I was rooting for them when they were at their highest, your dam sure I will be there for them at their worst.

I'm not saying they don't break it on a regular basis, because I'm sure they do (who doesn't?),  but they aren't going to do that in front of someone under a year in on the job. They don't trust people in general, let alone someone they don't know. Do you blame them? You don't trust anyone, either. 

To assume anything about me based on what I do for a living makes no sense. I have never seen an officer forge anything on a report, because I never saw any other officer's report unless we were on a call together. Again, ignorance on your part. Regular patrolmen do not get involved in anyone else's case. They have their own cases, and they don't have access to other officer's reports. 

I can also tell you, without any doubt at all, that none of my coworkers have ever smashed some ""perp's"" face into a cruiser, shattering his nose and cheek bone. I don't know where you think I live, but I worked in very small towns. These things didn't happen. This isn't L.A. or New York. Everyone knows everyone. And I mean that. If I don't know you, I know your brother or your mother or your cousin or someone else you're related to, who knows someone else, who knows people on the board of selectmen. These things don't happen here. There's no way they could get away with it. 

You're just plain wrong if you think every department in the country is corrupt. I've worked in 4 small towns and I grew up knowing people in each department. I suppose I'm also lucky I live in a good area with low crime rates.

You can't possibly know that. Why discredit yourself by making such ignorant statements?

The objective is clear. If Iran wants to join the international arms trade, they need to make agreement with the US, Russia, Chinese etc..

You would also still be buffing the damage of weapons like the sledge because you could jab more often in scenarios where charging isn't going to work. As it stands currently the sledge can't even jab for good damage since it attacks so slowly.

Lots of women have had vaginal surgery. Illness, injury, and childbirth can all cause damage that requires reconstruction. 

They don't have an obligation to spontaneously divulge private medical information to you. 

If you have a deep, personal need to confirm that all your sexual partners have never had vaginal surgery, that's your problem and your responsibility. You need to tell your partners your needs, and then they can either accept them or leave you. 

And if they do leave you, they don't have an obligation to tell you if it's because they have had surgery, or if it's because they have friends who are trans and they don't want to have sex with transphobic men.",1459469027

As we were throwing away our trash and leaving, one of my friends accidentally spilled his drink. Before this happened, I noticed a couple of McDonalds employees heading our way to perhaps tell us something. I interpreted this as if we were going to get in trouble, so after my friend spilled his drink, I started running towards the car we had arrived with, and my friends immediately followed. As we were leaving, I looked back at the McDonalds to see that one of the employees had his phone out (maybe to film us leaving?). So when we finally left, we were all uncontrollably laughing at the whole thing while at the same time thinking about what had just happened. I thought that employee was going to call the cops on us for some reason, but of course I was wrong. So in the end, we all got a thrill out of the incident.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

i do understand the idea of publishing purposefully bad gameplay when teasing a game or even a DLC (it makes you feel like you can do better and a lot of physiological effects that i will not get into). but common!!! this is a part of the game that in every bit of its core plays as the hardest and most challenging aspect of the game.
i really hope that it's not how the real incursions play out.

A rough guideline is to look at the values of a 4 man party against a medium encounter (they can be found on Kobold Fight Club), divide those experience totals by 4 to work out how much Kynan would get from a baseline medium encounter, then work out how many encounters it would take to reach each level.

* To go from 2 to 3 may take 6 medium encounters.
* To go from 3 to 4 may take 12 medium encounters.
* To go from 4 to 5 may take 19 medium encounters.

These numbers could be substantially less with harder encounters, but even if we assume the number of encounters is halved because all of them are deadly, that's still 37/2=19 (rounded up) encounters just to get to level 5. Consider how many combat encounters Vox Machina typically have in an adventure and you can see why that may take a while, even if Kynan had a DM giving out good RP experience.",1459469032

"wow","t5_2qio8","A copy-paste of a comment I made a couple days ago about this guy: 

For those who don't know preparedWOW is a wow player who controls over 80 multiboxing accounts. Sure, multiboxxing is shitty but this guy goes above and beyond. One thing he's famous for is whenever he's losing a fight or anything like that he'll spam tons of toys and items that lag the entire server for everyone on it. He also gets pissed at someone for using the Lightning wand during a fight in Stormshield and said it was hacking because it ""wasn't in Ashran"" (which Stormshield and Warspear are for the record.) He was also banned from twitch because (if I remember correctly, I can't find the video) he freaked the FUCK out swearing and screaming because he kept getting killed while trying to defend Grommash Hold from some attacking Alliance. All around not the nicest guy. I'd like to state also I'm not hating or anything, just from a completely neutral standpoint explaining who he is.
To answer Op's question, the reason he hasn't been banned yet is most likely because of money. Let's assume for all 80 of his accounts he has a recurring subscription set for every 6 months, or $77.94 every 6 months. this would mean in 1 year Blizzard is getting $12,470.40 dollars from this guy every year. If you were Blizz would you get rid of someone giving you SO much money? Sure Black Desert did it when he tried to Multibox there because it's against their ToS, but for some reason I get the feeling Blizz will turn a blind eye for that kind of cash.



I just wanted to add to this too: I forgot to mention he got that guy who used the wand during a dual auto-temp banned because he reported him with 40 accounts at the same time which told the server ""This guy is doing something really bad if 40 people are reporting him"" and immediately removed him from the game. He then went on to say ""Yeah I have the power to get people I don't like permabanned""",1459469034

To the point where I'd be up for days (the maximum I've had was 8 days...shit isn't fun in the least). Anyway shortly after I graduated high school I was back to not sleeping for days sometimes. All of my friends knew this so sometimes when they couldn't sleep they'd hit me up to talk or shit. One day after not sleeping for days I eventually fell asleep. Ended up sleeping till around 10AM (I hate sleeping in, 8AM is my norm and even then I feel like I waste a bit of the day). I wake up and my phone is ringing. I answer and it's my best friend. First thing I hear is him sighing and saying ""hey dude, check your phone and check Facebook"". After he hangs up I check my phone and I have like 35 missed calls from my girlfriend at the time and like 6 of my friends, and hundreds of texts. My inbox was already full so I didn't have any voicemails. Okay, I'll check those in a minute and see what's going on on Facebook first as apparently I need to see what's going on. Anyway I get on and I have like 30 notifications from people posting on my wall. Weird, i look on my wall and I see like 30 people saying ""RIP anxietyattack2013"" and shit like that. Okay...what the fuck? I call my girlfriend and all I hear is ""YOU'RE ALIVE!!!"". Apparently she tried calling me at like 4AM and since I was usually up at that time she assumed I was mad at her for some reason. She had a few of her friends call me, and then had my friends call me and text me and when I didn't respond she assumed I had relapsed and OD'd (I was a week off cocaine and opiates at this point) and died. 

Thankfully most of those people are no longer in my life as they had no idea how to handle someone not answering the phone. ",1459469035

Alternatively, you could level them all through the first tier evenly, and focus on two once you've unlocked the second tier.  This will put the other tribes on hold, but level these two to tier 3 faster, which will allow you to start collecting materia and tokens.  If you have a wealth of one or two types of tokens from either an earlier gordias normal grind, hunts, tomes, or maps, you could do this and level specific tribes for their rewards.

I finally got to the point in my life where I realized I would rather be healthy than stubborn and unhappy.  It will be a long road, but I'm going to walk it (or crawl if I have to).  

It has been two months since I started upping my activity levels and incorporating real exercise into my daily habits, but I just started officially logging my progress about 1 week ago.

Goals for April:

    1. Get myself able to comfortably drink 8 glasses of water per day.    
    2. Spend time with my furry pal, and go for a walk at least 3 times a week.    
    3. Learn to do 40+ proper situps (or equivalent) on ab day.    
    4. Maintain 5-6 active days a week, doing cardio for at least 45 min. to 1hr. per day.    
    5. Learn not to stress eat.    
    6. Actually take a full recovery day off once a week...or even two if I need it.

But the philosophy behind Actuarial Science and Mathematics is very different. In Actuarial Science courses, you must be able to solve and handle lots of computational problems quickly under a **time constraint**. More importantly you need the skill of being able to solve a problem on the spot **without making a single computational error** in your steps while memorizing a ton of formulas and relationships. Why? Because all questions are Multiple Choice and 1 small mistake will get you the wrong answer but you don't have a lot of time to recheck and re-do them.

In upper level math courses in 300/400 series, you don't see that many computations and it's mostly theoretical material focusing on proofs writing techniques and written answers not MC. If you're very good in writing proofs and absorbing theoretical math, then you will have no problems in specialist math courses.

I don't want to sound so pessimistic to students who got 60s in MAT137, but I don't want to give the false impression of the Act Sci Program in general. The main point of MAT137 was to teach you how to solve problems using calculus and that's really why Actuarial Science department used that course as a pre - req in the program, so if OP got 60s because he or she is bad in solving calculus problems, I don't see how he or she would somehow handle Act Sci courses that heavily focuses on solving lots and lots of different types of problems.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","The only problem I see with using tarot cards is that it could easily give a sense that the players have no control.

What about a system like this: Use a standard tarot deck, minor and major. For each scene, the GM draws a Celtic Cross (or similar single reading), and this dictates what kind of luck the players have during that scene. 

But, the players can mess with this arrangement. If the player chooses to use their skills to aid a situation, they can draw a number of cards equal to their skill level (so use a simple proficiency based system for building the skills) and replace a single card in the Celtic Cross with one of the cards they've drawn. This gives some player agency which is still mechanically based, but also still relies on luck.

The deck is reshuffled when the scene is complete, and a new drawing done for each subsequent scene. However, if the deck is ever exhausted as a result of the players drawing, that's it for the scene. There is no reshuffling within a scene (maybe a character could gain an ability allowing a deck to be reshuffled on a limited basis).

The game could have a specific drawing designed for each type of encounter (combat, social, exploration, puzzles, &amp;c) or just a single type of drawing for everything, or maybe even have a couple of different options made at the GMs whim. Either way, it could be an interesting mechanic.",1459469044

A few hours following my second run of November, I couldn't put any weight on my knee. Initially diagnosed as PFPS. Did physical therapy. Ran just under a mile right around Christmas at PT -- same result later in the night. Had to go back to the doctor and scheduled surgery to remove cartilage and clean up the knee. In January, I decided to jog an easy 1/3 of a mile in the snow to shovel out my grandparents house, despite being told not to run. Ended up tearing a meniscus in that 1/3 of a mile. Had surgery on Feb. 24 to remove cartilage from under my knee cap and at my lateral femoral condyle. Grade 3 osteoarthritis at the lateral femoral condyle.  

I go back to the doctor on Monday and I'm praying that I'll be cleared to run. Or at least do the elliptical or spin class. I've been unable to do any cardio or lower body workouts since surgery. It's driving me crazy. ",1459469046

We were talking about the fetish / lifestyle of being a cuckold where one is deriving sexual pleasure and an identify out of being submissive and/or replaced completely in the bedroom. 

Being beta / alpha isn't a singular choice, it's a aggregation of choices you've made over years, even decades. Your choices and behaviors determine how ""alpha"" or ""beta"" you are. If we define alpha as high SMV (alphas are those atop a social or sexual pyramid) or we define alpha as the set of behaviors that typically lead to increased SMV, you can see how being alpha or becoming alpha is the product of a many choices. 

You can think whatever you want about my alphaness or betaness. It's unrelated to what I'm saying about how dudes into cuck / femdom type fetishes need to re-evaluate their behaviors. They need to try to change instead of trying to hamster their beta sexual fetishes as ""RP"" or ""alpha"". I'm sure most of them will disagree with me, just like I'm sure you'll disagree.

I totally understand what you mean. 

It's difficult to put out an effective representation on your worldview via a Reddit comment, but I really try my best not to use generalizations to describe anyone, of course including men. 

If I notice a man looking at me, if I catch his eyes, he'll usually look away. That's not bothersome at all. (This would include a youth, such as yourself, who may have been stumbling over himself or perhaps didn't look away; these types of things happen, but they don't usually make me feel the heebie jeebies). I was referring to much more blatant display of behavior, usually by men of an age old enough to know that what they're doing isn't right, particularly when I've made it clear that I'm uncomfortable. 

 A few months ago, a man (mid 50s) knocked on the door of my cafe as I was closing up, and I went over to see what the deal was. He was foreign to the city and asked for directions. Seemed like a super nice guy, kinda reminded me of my Dad. I spent about 20 minutes with a map showing him good areas, areas to perhaps avoid, etc., and when I bid him goodbye, he propositioned me for sex. *""Why don't you come spend the evening with me and my friend? We'll make it worth your while.""* Really forcefully. I very firmly said no three separate times before he would leave. 

This is the kind of stuff I'm talking about. I really didn't mean to insinuate the ""all men are pigs"" mentality in my original post, because that is so very much not at all how I feel. And I also hope I didn't offend!",1459469046

I did a lot of yoga and practiced mindful meditation. I learned to relax and breathe *through* the pain. I told myself ""I am safe and sound"" over and over and my midwives and husband were incredibly supportive. It got to a point where all I could think about was pain and pushing, but I just focused on that and trusted that everyone in the room was there to support me. And bring comfort items from home.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","There's no electrical reason for the battery closest to the atty to be drained more. It might be stressed a bit more due to the slightly higher temperature at that location but that doesn't drain it faster.

In a parallel mod the batteries can drain at different rates depending on their internal resistance. In a series mod they all drain at the same rate.

The charger tells you they are at the same voltage but they aren't. The charger might have a display precision of 1/100 of a volt but that doesn't mean it's accurate to 1/100 of a volt.

Charger current is also a bit different from bay to bay. This will affect the charging speed and what voltage is displayed.

Each battery has a different capacity, internal resistance, and leakage current rate. All these force each battery down to a different voltage when discharged. When you charge them they may or may not be close in voltage.

The differences in internal resistance cause the charging voltage and speed to be different for each battery too. They all eventually reach the same voltage but at a different rate.

The differences between charging bays can then make it seem like different voltage batteries are close in voltage or make like voltage batteries seem to drift apart in voltage.

Unless the battery voltage is being measured by a separate meter after the batteries have had time tomsit and reach their true resting voltage we just don't know what their voltage actually is.

If the voltage measuring taps in the RX200 draw a decent amount of current when not balancing, due to bad design, then batteries could be drained differently. But series connections without these taps, or with properly functioning taps, won't affect battery voltage. A crappy balancing algorithm could cause problems too. Especially if it's combined with the lousy battery voltage reading accuracy of the RX200.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","\&gt;Abbasids tagswitching to Persia



Abbasids started out as an arguably Shia revolt with a huge Persian influence. Their initial armies were of Persian stock, it would be these soldiers who would form the nobility. A lot of the Caliphs were  half-Persian as well. 


Abbasids forming Persia would not be absurd at all; in fact logical. Heck the Anatolian minors in the game should also be able to form Persian since Persian was the court culture, language, and even their religion was ""Persianite""; Dulkadir, AQ, QQ were Hurufi. Karaman, the heir to Sultanate of Rum had Shiite elements to it; heck arguably S.o Rum fell because of Shiite revolts (and they, the ruling family, was described as Batini-shia sympathizers, check out the Baba Ishak revolts)",1459469048

Obviously you cannot control her life, it's her decision, however it's also **your** decision as to whether to stay in this relationship or not.

"thewalkingdead","t5_2rygv","Cable providers pay channels or organizations (such a Newscorp or Viacom) carriage fees to show their content. These carriage fees will usually specify what level of programming the channel must be available at (basic, basic plus/expanded, digital tiers only, etc.) and are charged per number of subscribers. In turn, the cable providers pass a divided portion of those fees on to you in the form of your cable bill. You don't have a subscription to AMC. The cable company pays AMC if you want their channel. There is a difference.  

While channels like AMC charge these carriage fees (less than a dollar per subscriber to the channel in their case), the majority of their revenue comes from advertisements. Hence why it is not ""subscription based"" the way the premium, commercial-less channels like HBO or Showtime are. HBO and Showtime, etc. doesn't have ad revenue coming in like AMC or FX. That's why you pay a subscription fee of $16+ for the channel.  

Now, the number of households that a cable channel are available in *does* determine how much that cable channel can charge for ad time, so hence why these cable channels want to be on as broad and open of a cable tier as they can negotiate. It's also the real reason they fear a la carte cable. Say I own five cable channels, and 2 of them are very popular. I can get similar ad revenue from the other 3 that aren't watched as much (but are carried in just as many homes) if I can force a cable provider to broadly carry the lame ones in order to have the 2 popular ones. 

[Also, a la carte cable would not save anyone money, so you can do away with that myth.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/upshot/why-unbundling-cable-would-not-save-you-money.html)  ",1459469050

You, however is a beneficiary of it &amp; has rights to it, though limited. My advise to you with regards to such a joint account is to close it *a few months after you turn 18* &amp; have your own active transitional debit-card account under your name. Do not close it unless you have your very own debit card. 

Remember, it is within your best interest that when you leave the house, things are amicable and respectful between you and your parents. Remember this rule: **Part ways amicably**. The rule is also applicable to employment &amp; relationships. 

Within the next few days, you ought to start looking for a full-time job that you can hop-into once you graduate high school. If you find a part-time job now that allows you to immediately transition to full-time after graduation would be super. 

Talk to your high school guidance counselor as to which of your H.S. classes can be credited by both community college &amp; uni. Also certain universities do not credit H.S. classes; again, it depends on the uni that you want to get into.  Have you considered attending a trade college or a vocational school? Look into that &amp; consider what you really want to do in life. 

Since you want to move out, ask your parents which of the stuff you can take with you freely in preparation for attending college/ living on your own. That is what I mean by ""clearing things out"". Ask them via e-mail so you can get a response in writing. Never take a verbal response as an honorable contract. Always get things in writing. Again, be amicable. ",1459469051

The feral wolves barking in the caves is most likely a normal sound to the goblins. 

In the end, though, it is up to you as a DM. In a beginner adventure, having a ton of goblins swarm a party is probably fatal and ends your night quick.  As the party progresses and gets more powerful, maybe having goblins swarming is a better option for a more challenging encounter or to maybe gently let pcs know that their actions have consequences.  It is really up to you and what you want from your campaign and world. So if you want a ton of goblins swarming, maybe that waterfall doesn't sound quite so loud.  If you want your beginner pcs to learn their characters/skills/etc, maybe the waterfall causes a ton of noise or whatever.  ",1459469051

http://www.fadak2.tv/

This is the english website, excuse it's current state - a rework is coming soon.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4zPvmoqDEY&amp;list=PL0lDUtSMX8QNLPrlRJc1BXdbApSRfHHQF&amp;index=2

You can check out our youtube page above and see that we are legitimate. The above playlist is a series of lectures titles 'Sunni Islam: The source of terrorism'

All our efforts and passion is put into revealing the truth to the world, even if that means exposing the corruption in our religion. We feel it is the right of every person to know the truth.

In terms of revealing the name of the director or actors, unfortunately this is not possible. If we do reveal their names it is certain they will receive uncountable threats and harassment which could put them in harm and could lead to the termination of the project completely. Because of this reason management has decided to keep their names private until the project is in a stable position.

EDIT: This is our address. Anyone in London is free to come pay us a visit and have a chat to further understand our goals

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","My family  is better than some in the manner that they haven't beaten me or kicked me out or anything, but they are still terrible. I had a terrible childhood moving around from relative to relative before ending up with my grandparents. They always sorta spoiled me when I was younger and now that I need direction and help in life they are unable to give it. I can't be open about my sexuality with them because they would not approve of it. I occationally see my dad, but whenever I do get to see him I also have to see my stepmother that I hate. She's a completely bitch and has said, and I quote, ""All I see in him is pure evil, you shouldn't see him"" referring to me. As for the school thing, the world is going in the direction of Math&amp;Science as it always has. I'm currently in pre-calc and we just took our midterm which counts twice in our grade of only tests. I didn't have enough time to finish and my teacher told me that I wasn't allowed any extra time to finish it. I only managed to do about half of it which means that if I got everything right I would get  a 48(I calculated it before I handed it in because I had enough time to add but not enough to do another problem) With my grade on the midterm being a 48, if I got nothing else wrong for the rest of the year on any of my tests I still would  be unable to pass the course. On top of that, my other classes are shit and I am only in them to get enough credits to graduate.  Math has always been the only class I've cared about, and now my teacher just failed me when we still have half a semester left. I no longer wish to attend school, and I no longer wish to live with my un-accepting, hateful family. I want to move to California because if I decided to get my GED and go to community college, after 2 years I could apply to University of California(since you apply to all of them with the same app, but each city's has slightly different standards) and hopefully get accepted there since it is my college  of choice being one of the leading schools in the country when it comes to Game Design majors. The reason that I need to live with someone else is because you cannot live in Cali on minimum wage by yourself, but two people can support themselves if they are both receiving minimum wage.

If you guys have a family plan for phones, see how much it would be to cancel that and only pay for your own plan—make him pay for his own phone, too, so if the internet and cable and everything gets shut off, and his phone does, too, he doesn't have anything to do but own up to his financial responsibilities.

Sure, you may suffer for a bit in the interim if cable/internet gets shut off, but it's likely he'll suffer more since those seem to be his primary escape from shit he needs to do.

What makes those two processes any different? Personally, sleeping for an hour is significantly less immersive for *me*, as i have to adapt my character's story for a nap even if he might have no reason to be tired, and at the same time more annoying for me as a player, because i've frozen on a sleep timer before, frozen on the exit of a sleeping session before, and i would have my immersion bent harder as i'm not sleeping to sleep, i'm sleeping for a purpose the character has no inkling of. Every single other change in this mode sounds amazing and like the Fallout 4 i've wanted to play since launch, but the sleep-only saving just doesn't add up to me. And before you say the mode might not be for me - why limit the player's options? If quick/autosave was enabled, more people could enjoy the mode. If you like the idea of not saving, don't save. I don't like wasting my free time, especially if every encounter is do-or-die.

I asked you to prove your claim. Don't dodge because you have no proof. You can claim they bring in more money and doctors but that is not dependent upon them being Muslim. We can bring in plenty of doctors who are not Muslim. I have yet to see a reason why we need to have Muslim immigrants.

Yeah, we need to move away from family based immigration and more towards skill based immigration. Immigration should be a mutually beneficial thing. We get access to their skills and talents, and they get to join our country, culture and infrastructure.

Western converts to Islam are the closest thing to moderate Muslims and I really don't have a problem with that.",1459469063

Pointing a finger at ""Wahabbism"" and blame it for the ills of very different issues is never an answer. 

You do know that no Saudi would even consider ""Wahhabism"" as something to be associated with? Vast majority of Saudis dont give a flying fuck about Moe bin Abdullwahab. I heave read his famous book (Kitab Altauheed), and I tell you, he never said anything new or has anything to do with vigilance or what we associate terrorism today with. The reason why we know his name is purely political, when Ibn Saud aligned with Al-Alshaikh in Uyainah 200+ years ago. When the media says ""Wahhabism"" they mean Salafist conservative Muslims from Saudi. AND that has nothing to do with vigilance and terrorist outlaws, in fact, its non-compatible.

"bladeandsoul","t5_2skd6","Gear is also a part of my Dark Souls example.

The whole point of why I chose this specific Dark Souls video was, because the player is doing a challange by killing a difficult boss with very weak equipment. 

It is like trying to kill Junghado with your basic training weapon and no accessoirs equiped. But in Blade and Soul you couldn't do that, no matter how good you are, because you're going to run into the enrage timer.

I agree that people have expectations on gear unnecessarily high, you could for example do the whole Naryu Labyrinth with 6 lvl 45 people that all have the True Profane weapon, Infernal Accessoirs and maybe a full Bloodshade Soulshield, maybe even less when they keep up the dps absolutely perfectly.

However, if there were no enrage timer, they could even do the whole thing without any equipment at all (would just take a lot longer and they'd get one or two-shot by everything).

And what are you getting from having the enrage timer? If the bosses are so weak on their own that you could totally suck and just heal through, then the problem is the boss being too weak. If you're afraid of having way too long bossfights, there is still the minimum requirement to join a party in the cross server dungeons.",1459469064

My first day of work I realised how I knew absolutely nothing. Having a degree in something relevant to System Architecture really wouldn't help that much with the amount of experience you have.


So to 1) Having working in my industry for 15 years, I'd say having a degree affects maybe the first 4 years of your work, and yes, it's a good step up onto the ladder. But after that, nobody really cares. There are quite a few people doing the same job as me that don't have degrees.


2) Car salesmen probably make more money than you. Does that make them more educated? I don't know April's problems are less about you and more about her. It's not really about college is it? I mean if you did a night course and got a piece of paper, would that make things magically better? I don't think it would. I mean what does she want here, for you to lose your job and work in a gas station? It sounds more like a power thing, is she worried you're going to leave her for someone ""better""? It sounds like she's trying to knock your self-confidence so you don't start thinking that.

* Exercise (run/swim/bike) 4-5x per week.

I'd print out the 60+ page behemoths from gamefaqs and keep them in front of me, picking up every piece of treasure, exploiting every glitch, and getting every secret.  Even then, some games were too hard for me.  I don't think I ever beat Legend of Legaia (though that game does not fuck around), and in Guardian's Crusade I ran away from battles because they were too hard, which made them harder and harder until I hit a point where I couldn't get back to the rest of the world map and I also couldn't progress because I was too weak to even beat a random encounter, let alone a boss.

Nowadays I try to avoid guides, but I'm still willing to check them if I get stuck or there's well-hidden optional content.  I never really picked up the habit of grinding to begin with, but now I'm staunchly against it until I reach post-game.

"math","t5_2qh0n","This is a really cool list! After taking a look, it seems like some of the topics are more broad, while others seem to be more focused.

That said, here are some topics with their advertisements which I think would be interesting to learn about and write a good essay on. 

i.) Non-Euclidean Geometries-  What happens when you introduce  geometries in which Euclid's[ 5th postulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_postulate#Converse_of_Euclid.27s_parallel_postulate) does not hold?  It turns out a lot of cool and beautiful things. Including the structure of the unvierse. While this is a somewhat broad topic, there is also quite a bit to learn about as well as a lot of history behind this. Some keywords would be hyperbolic geometry, spherical geometry, Poincare disk, Curvature. 

ii.) Four color map theorem: This is cool. Back in the 19th century, people realized that in colouring a map to differentiate territories, one only needed four colors. (Think about this!) There were many attempts at proofs for quite a while, but none bore fruit. In ~1970, Appel and Hakan managed to reduce the proof to a series of cases, and then used a computer to run the cases and prove the theorem. This is also one of the bigger cases in which the current proof is a ""brute force"" one. But there are some recent developments in a more mathematical proof as well! Google Kronecker and Mrowka. 

iii.) Random Walks! How can a drunk man in 2 dimensions can always find his way home with probability 1, but a bird flying in 3 dimensions may get lost? This is a nice introduction to Stochastic Processes. 

All of the topics are lovely, and while I've only talked about the more idea based ones, the application and numerical ones are also very interesting and I encourage you to take a look at some of them as well. ",1459469069

&gt; The Acolyte, a prominent Enlightened leader and Roland Jarvis’s successor, is attempting to
&gt; find and activate an XM artifact known as the Obsidian Shield. Originally found by a Roman
&gt; explorer named Obsidius, the Acolyte believes this technology will create a barrier that can
&gt; protect humanity from the N’zeer. In her view, this is a desperately needed response to their
&gt; rising influence.
&gt; Jahan, a high-ranking Resistance and Anti-Magnus leader, has discovered that the Shield
&gt; can be modified and used for a very different purpose, to block Shaper transmissions that
&gt; enter our universe via modulated XM. If she can obtain this technology before the Acolyte,
&gt; she intends to use it against the Shapers.
&gt; Our analysts have verified that the Shards that will manifest during Obsidian contain fragments
&gt; of the Shield artifact. However, simply obtaining these Shards is not enough. Jahan
&gt; and the Acolyte will need the Anomalies to generate the XM energy needed to activate them.
&gt; By controlling the Obsidian Anomalies and Shards, Agents will be able to help these
&gt; high-ranking Enlightened and Resistance leaders accomplish their goals.",1459469069

Glass cannons are more acceptable - however they managed to give ridiculously effective camouflage to black units in a snow map, go figure.

Turrets are too annoying while not being a real challenge, I guess I wanted some new mechanic to work around with when it was introduced, instead of the shit we got.

I just said you can't always highlight the taser, even if you can kind of see them and mash the F button, especially when there are tons of other specials around. But he can always see you, and a lot of times tase you in the same exact frame that you peeked a spot.

I'm not calling for nerfs, I think the map just needs a few adjustments such as cutting down on the tree branches and more reliable cover spots near objectives (I'm not too big on only being able to hold out in a single area while objectives that have to randomly be interacted with are far away). Or just reduce the effective range of those units, they can see you from far away when you can't.

I think with the Rift it is mainly a situation of people's expectations not being set correctly about the lenses in the first place. The artifacting basically seems to be the same. Even Vive fundamentalists like linknewtab, said as much on /r/Vive in the past. The artifacts are fine, I think people just expected more of the Rift lenses, because that was the messaging they got about them.",1459469071

""But you have people coming in, and I'm not just saying Mexicans, I'm talking about people that are from all over that are killers and rapists, and they're coming into this country.""

""The Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them. They don't want to take care of them.""

I mean, there's people out there who have open relationships. Different people are comfortable with different things and have different preferences, and that's totally great and totally okay.

At the same time, HE should not be telling YOU how you feel about it. I don't know him or the whole story but he sounds like he's being quite dismissive of your feelings. My boyfriend watches porn frequently, sometimes we watch it together, and we're both super happy with that arrangement. Within another couple, one person might feel that watching porn is unacceptable. And that doesn't make them crazy or possessive or controlling, it just means that that's their personal preferences in a relationship. If your preferences don't align with your partner's and nobody is willing to compromise, then you break up.

What's happening right now, though, is that he is telling you that you need to suit his preferences and that your feelings do not warrant him compromising. He's not even trying to understand where you're coming from. And you might be willing to compromise with putting up with his friend's behavior so that you can stay together... but it sounds like this is really upsetting and hurtful for you to witness.

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","Today has been really hard for me and my partner. A couple of years after getting together eight years ago, we were moving into our own place and were unable to come to an agreement about dining room furniture. In frustration, my partner wanted to go to the humane society to pet the animals. I agreed and we went there.

When we arrived, a rabbit was in a pen at the front and was really curious and interested in us, another was quietly yawning off in a cage on a table. She was interested in getting him, so we went home, researched, and came back. This time, the yawning bunny was in the pen with the curious bunny. She hid off in a corner a lot and let him explore ahead of her. The shelter had a two for one deal on cats, so we asked if we could apply it to the bunnies. They talked with their manager and agreed, largely because rabbits are best in pairs and the quiet ones are tougher to adopt.

For eight years, we've taken care of them with some minor medical hiccups here and there, but they were largely okay, especially the quiet one. Last night, the quiet one had a seizure. We ran her to the vet, who thought this might pass, then suggested to keep an eye on her. This morning, I had to drive my partner to the airport, but we discovered she wasn't eating or drinking. I sent my partner off on her trip and brought the bunny to the vet. At 11:20, the vet called and let me know she passed.

I haven't had a lot of death in my life. Largely because I've lived far from my family and these two were the only family pets I've had. I've had other sad experiences, but usually alcohol numbed them and I got through. When my grandparents passed, it was sad, but alcohol numbed a lot of it and they were far away. 

I'm a couple weeks into sobriety, and this has been hard. I've cried all day, which I haven't done in years. I'm grateful that I can feel this, and not bottle it up and away like I have other sad experiences. I'm also grateful for my bunny, who as much as she was pretty fearful and kind of avoidant, was kept from being killed in a shelter, and we got to experience her.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","the phrase is trite.  watching something die is beyond summary.  I ride a loaded bicycle around the country, I've lived outdoors for 3 years off and on, and lots of way out there.  I'm road kill.  I'm a target.  I'm a homeless guy playing in traffic.  

the mind revolts from this.  ""why am I riding a fucking bicycle.  I'm going to die.""  your  riding companion is the endless wake of dead animals on the road side.

eventually after many thousands of miles, I started to accept it.  I've seen many animals die after a car hit it.  I always stop and see if I can help.  first time I saw a beaver, road kill.  first time I saw an axis deer, road kill.  first time armadillo, road kill.  last two I watched die was a kitten, and a finch.  we all fight for life in the end.  then the hair smooths, the feathers smooth.  the body is stiff.

I don't care about PETA, I don't want people to stop driving or eating meat.  nothing is going to change.  it's ok.  I will say that animals are individuals and each life is precious.  automobiles are killing.  cats are killing.  building all this stuff and moving everything around is killing and the amount is huge.

I'd just like to point out that a death is not something to shrug at.

The zoomass of wild vertebrates is now vanishingly small compared to
the biomass of domestic animals. In 1900 there were some 1.6 billion large domesticated animals, including about 450 million head of cattle and water buffalo (HYDE 2011); a century later the count of large domestic animals had surpassed 4.3 billion, including 1.65 billion head of cattle and water buffalo and 900 million pigs (FAO 2011). Calculations using these head counts and average body weights (they have increased everywhere since 1900, but the differences between larger body masses in North America and Europe and lower weights elsewhere persist) yield estimates of at least 35 Mt C of domesticated zoomass in 1900 (more than three times the total of all wild land mammals) and at least 120 Mt C in the year 2000, a 3.5-fold increase in 100 years (and 25 times the total of wild mammalian zoomass). And cattle zoomass alone is now at least 250 times greater than the zoomass of all surviving African elephants, which in turn is less than 2 percent of the zoomass of Africa’s nearly 300 million bovines (Table 2).

""Security"" is the primary concern of any country.
You see humans do it when they have a vested and collective interest hence the enigma machine and the collective effort of world war two, to steal technology, learn about it and develop a specialized device to break it, then suppress it.

For the FBI to go out in public and declare Apple should help them break their own machine is subversive and telling how quickly they shut up about it when another cohert helped them brute force the xcode and see the PIN for the phone and then take a disk image of what is saved.

There's no sustainable growth model in curing anything.
 
Now killing, building a machine that costs pennies to manufacture and you use only once but costs millions to r&amp;d exposes how incongruent capitalist valuations are. As this too is unustainable. However unlike a cure, it benefits a chosen few. Which is the essence of capitalism. A few people make bank while a load of others are on the otherside making uninformed decisions, relying on a confirmation bias that ensures their economic independence is further eroded.

I don't think policing insitutions are in the business of medicine either, so although your query merits philisophical consideration, a pharmeceutical company is more geared to unlocking a treatable means toward cancer, where as the NSA is more inclined to do what it structurally is built to do. Break encryptions, socially engineer to access the unaccessible and deceive.

I used to have some concern about what privacy we would lose. But these days as I earn more and assert my future on my terms I figure, fine read my emails, read my books and watch my youtube videos. If there is enough interest in someone surveiling me then maybe whatever its aims at least the person at the other end might learn something.

My worry is the decontextualization and application to undermine and marginalize groups. People of ethnic origins, income class, education levels.

It's weird.

I come from a time that once thought they weren't being watched. Believed their drug use was a secret. You grow up and find out everyone is into something. Not because its wrong, but because there is an instinct to the wrongness that an individual commits on another. Headless insitutions wont have that discretion. That self awareness.",1459469077

Now what I can tell you even an Unevoed ShivaDra will be fine. The difference between the evo version is mostly a bit more stats and some extra awakenings so you tecnically arent losing a lot while you wait. You will have issues evoing ShivaDra since Legendary Skyway and the other Dragon emperor dungeons before it are among the hardest dungeons out there.

Team cost will be a problem, Urd and Ares should be your main focus to get into the team. Urb should be obvious as she is your most worked on sub and Ares because hes a dual orb changer meaning he will produce the most orbs in a single skill use even if he is your only orb changer. You will have to use Antares though while you get your team cost up since she has less cost than Ares. Concentrate on farming King of the Gods or other high EXP content, which should be possible for you.

Thanks to the massive damage boost from dual shivadras even a low cost team that runs 2 samurai goblins as filler has more damage than the full stacked Urd team you cant run right now.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Their change is a bit of a watered down version of the thor upgrade nice_username and i concocted via an extension mod.

The problem is this does not help mech at all still.  I tested thors against the ""mass air"" situation of tempests/carriers, in various amounts and the result is the same post-mod map as it would be pre-mod map.

Thors still lose versus some1 that is brainlessly massing only tempests/carriers.  On top of that, now it's a single target unit so it will not be able to fight mutalisks anymore...

I think Blizzard is listening a bit about the mech/ground anti-air issues, but they should test this version of the thor WITH the splash damage.  

I am sure their reasoning for removing the splash is they think it would be too strong versus mutas but that's not true - because thors would destroy mutas regardless of the extra damage to air or not.

The splash damage is necessary to dissuade someone from just purely massing only BCS/libs/tempests/carriers, and also would allow thors to kite versus carrier interceptors.

People need to test these changes and reason them out like i have and see that the proposed changes alone are overall a NERF to the thor because of the removal of the splash and the fact it does not change the thor versus mass tempest/carrier situations at all.

"amiugly","t5_2rgjh","This is coming from a 42 year old woman.

I went through a very difficult awkward stage as well. Let me start by saying, you are NOT ugly!

If you want to look more stylish, I would first recommend going to a higher-end beauty salon for your eyebrows.  I didn't touch mine until 20, and they were bushy and had no shape.  Eyebrows really make for a tailored look - but don't do them yourself until you know what you are doing!

I think your glasses are too large for your face.  If contacts are not an option, try out smaller pairs with styles that are more flattering to your facial structure.

You have lovely hair! You can do all sorts of fun stuff with your hair to reflect whatever mood you are in.

Your complexion is not bad, and is typical of a teen, especially once who is suffering from depression and anxiety.  If you can get help for those emotional issues, that would go a long way in your overall well-being.

I promise you that your face and body will change and develop a lot over the next few years.  At my 10 year high school reunion people were stunned and told me (in a nice way) that I had grown into a very beautiful woman. I see the same for you.

Once you are an adult, and have changed the things you have the power to change (eyebrows, hairstyle, stylish clothes, glasses that are more complementary to your face, working out to firm up) you can then decide if you really need something like cosmetic surgery.  I hope by that point you will not feel that way.  

Its a tough age, and you are comparing yourself to images in magazines of airbrushed models, many of whom have had work done, and who also are just genetically lucky.  And you know what? Its ok. As you get older, you care far less.  Of course you want to look attractive, but you no longer care that you do not naturally look like the 1% who hit the genetic lottery.

And - a charismatic personality (which doesn't come overnight, but with life experience, trying new things, being nice and facing things that scare you) is very, very sexy and attractive.

Be kind to yourself.  You are not ugly. Just a teen going through a tough stage, but who will soon transform into a woman.  And so much can be done in the meantime with other little things that really change your appearance, and do not require an hour of hair/makeup a day.

Also, a good dermatologist can clear up your skin in no time.

Good luck!",1459469079

"Rabbits","t5_2riv8","I have a gray and white dutchie... she big and fat too. The day before my wedding, we were packing up our pets (both the bunnies and the ducks) to bring them to the hotel closer to our venue. We live in, and got married in Chicago, but we needed hotel suites for our family and wedding party to collect at the start of the big day... so we're running behind and need to get the bunnies in their carrier and get going. 

Only one problem... we can't find Minny... at all! She isn't coming when called, even shaking the treat jug isn't rousing her. We check all her hiding spots, no luck. We start freaking out that maybe she somehow braved walking through the kitchen, over the yucky lava tiles, and walked out the door while we had it open bring stuff to the car. We're searching outside, panicking! Where could she be! 

Then as a last resort, I search under my desk and couch again- I have a big sewing table and shelves tha sit behind our couch (so I can watch TV while I work) and we set up little tunnels underneath for the bunnies the play. That's when I realize that there was a newly opened spot on a shelf that is ground level. I have one of those big shelves from ikea that have the cubical spaces for drawers and containers. I push some stuff out of the way and low and behold!!!!

There she is, asleep in the little cubbies area of the desk. She roused, and looks up at me with a sleepy look like, ""yes, what do you want mom?"" It's 9pm the night before my wedding, and she's looking at me like I'm the jerk for waking her up from her nap! Such a stinker. ",1459469080

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","SW:TOR takes place around 3,300 BBY. There were plenty of Jedi and Sith around; the main plot of the game revolves around the politics and conflicts between the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic, and (more recently) the invasion of the galaxy by the former Sith Emperor and the empire he raised over the last millenia-ish.

So the whole deal is complicated by the variety of forces and conflicts around the galaxy, including major ones I've not mentioned for brevity.

That said, Mentor was much more of a threat than an IG-88 Death Star, imo. Mentor became self-aware around 300 years before the events of the game, and its ""final solution"" was to broadcast a signal across the galaxy (from the geothermic moon Zadd) that would allow it to take control of all droids in existence and use them to exterminate organic life.

Mentor's plan was foiled by a defector, Mender, alerting Republic and Imperial forces to the threat. In that game's canon, a small strike force infiltrated the moon Mentor was set up on, destroyed various droid forces, and eventually overloaded Mentor's power cores to the point of creating a chain reaction with the moon's geothermic activities, destroying the entire moon.

Even given that Mace Windu was an exemplary Jedi Battlemaster, it's not reasonable to assume that a single Jedi could have handled the forces on Zadd. It could be argued that poor writing is responsible for Mace's abilities against the B2s, the strike team's ability to miraculously confront only small squads at a time, and Mentor's lack of contingency preparation after 300ish years of planning.",1459469081

I thought it could have been that the light was too close (since the edges are white) so I moved the lamp up but on the new growth the same thing happened. Could it maybe be the heat? It's pretty warm in my tent (up to 30-31c at times) but that would only explain the leaves not growing straight and not the discolouring. I don't think it can be nute burn either cause I haven't used any nutes and the soil is pretty nutrient-poor.

I grow using a 2x2 tent with an open reflector holding a 250w HPS, so it gets warm in there but all my other plants are doing fine, and Im growing 4 other strains.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","1) Because we have done more experimentation that you'd be able to really count. 

Most of the food we eat is GMO. In the United States we are GMO centric with regards to our food supply. 

Corn and soy (two of America's biggest crops) are both majority GMO. If there was a problem with the food we would have known about it by now because we've been eating it for so long. 

2) GMOs are based moving traits from one organism to another. You take RNA (One of the string of gene sequences in a DNA strand) and you infect it into the DNA of another organism through a viral delivery system. When the virus infects the organism it implants the genetic material into the DNA.

There is nothing on this chain of events which leads to disease happening. The only way that could happen is if you purposely put a disease gene into the formula. Even if you did do that, you don't get cancer because the DNA of the plant is what gets altered, not yours. This means the plant would be what gets cancer. 

When we eat food we don't mix the DNA of the food with our DNA. Digestion does not work like that. The food is broken down and the resources our bodies need is filtered out as waste materials are removed. 

At no point in the series of events does the DNA of a food product implant itself into our DNA. This means there isn't a possibility that GMO genetic alterations can impact human DNA. It doesn't exist as a problem.

3) We have been testing these food products on animals for generations beyond what is to be considered scientifically clear cut. 

In humans, we have to wait for humans to breed and have kids and their kids to breed and have kids before we can see how something impacts us down the line. 

Animals are the best for long term studies because we can see how something not only impacts the animal but their offspring and their offspring's offspring and so on and so forth.

Helps to get away from glowing screens from time to time and is actually good for creativity to change perspective occasionally. (A single notebook for each game focuses marvelously. Avoid leaving notes all over the place or sharing a notebook between games)

Other than that... start with an idea, a clear simple concept you can describe in a few sentences, usually something you see ""missing"" from games on offer. In other words, a game you'd love to play but can't because it doesn't exist yet.

After that... iterate, iterate, iterate. Try to prototype the key original concept as soon as possible and build on that. When your eyes begin to bleed from coding or don't know what to do next, take the notebook and go for a walk in a park or to a cafe. When you've got enough ""to do"" items in the notebook and can't keep away from the PC anymore, start coding.

"CringeAnarchy","t5_35j1r","Well, although it is semantically offensive in how poorly it is phrased, the idea being presented is this: There are two terms that exist in english to describe differences between dudes and dudettes. Sex is one, and Gender is the other. They originally meant the same thing, but recently, connotative differences have been introduced to allow people to better express what they mean. Sex is biological. Do you have a willy, do you have ovaries, etc. The comic is saying, if I understand right, that Sex is governed by laws and authorities, in that certain things can legally apply to you based on your biology, and you (I think) have to switch biology via operation to change certain things like you birth certificate. (I think. It might vary depending on where you are.) 

Gender, on the other hand, has come to mean the set of behaviors, societal expectations, and modes of expression usually assigned to Sexes. Dressing a certain way, acting that way, etc. It is regulated by social codes, and societal norms, and is thus a tad more flexible. you can have tomboys, femmy guys, crossdressing, and other such things that warp Gender norms, because Gender is a thing that was shaped by society, and is thus easier to defy.

"bloodborne","t5_31k9i","Gonna CP my response to a friend during a conversation about the Sterling video:

I would make two points each, about variable difficulty modes in general and about easy modes for dark souls specifically

first is that there just plain are some games that function because of their difficulty. volgarr the viking is an easy example: the character's RPG like power progression is also his life bar, so a player who is better not only dies less but is also stronger - that would not necessarily work in an easy mode. there are workarounds, but there isn't a workaround for *everything.*

second is that players who complete hard modes do so not only because they like the challenge but because they expect to feel rewarded. Darklurker is kind of a shit boss not only because of how hard he is, and not only because of how hard it is to get to him, but because you dont really get shit for beating him, whereas fume knight has some amazing rewards - and my experience with star fox games in general is that there isn't much reward for beating hard modes besides ""I DID IT!"" (a good contrast is the reward you get for beating Dead Space 2's ultra hard mode - check that out, seriously.)

in specific, I would argue that the difficulty of dark souls is part of its aesthetic - not only the expectation of brutality, and the sudden horrible pitfalls and other gruesome things, but the repetitive mutilation of the player character, followed by eventual triumph is key to the series' identity, and making the game ""easier"" could be counter to this if done wrong. That said, it wouldn't be the end of the world if there was an easier difficulty on a different server, but in my opinion the ONLY thing that should change is how hard enemies/effects hit, and some attacks should still be auto-kill.

Additionally, Dark Souls ALREADY HAS an easy mode - it's called co-op. Albeit co-op has a lot of issues, it's been getting steadily better as time passes, seeing fixes (albeit asynchronous fixes) in both BB and DS2. ",1459469086

Miles/month is lowest since last April 2015 (except for November due to vacation), but I am happy. Went through a funk this winter, so I'll take happiness at this point. 

Ran my first half! Loved it! Will definitely do a half again sometime in the future, but not sure when.

No injuries except for a naggin hip and knee pain (seem related) that seems to be fading away. Fingers crossed. 

Planning on doing something modifying Uncle Pete's base building. I want to keep base mileage between 25-30 with some speedwork and strength training. Starting on strength in a week!

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","Time for some crazy bullshit (in no particular order):

Sun, Yang, and Blake fight and defeat Adam. Sun and Blake then reform the White Fang into a small mercenary type group that travels around protecting towns from Grimm.

Roman is alive and plans on helping the heroes because ""My previous employer no longer had use for my services, and as such, requested my... immediate termination""

The SDC has a hostile takeover at the hands of one of Salem's soldier's, who was a mole within Atlas. Papa Schnee is killed and Winter flees with the help of Roman and Neo. They also release Adam and force him to travel with them (he's got some dust choker or something on that forces him to obey Winter). Their mission is to try and take back the SDC, as well as rebuild Beacon.

Mercury and Emerald are eventually captured and interrogated. Cinder breaks into their prison to try and execute them because ""if you 2 are weak enough to get caught, then you're not of any use to me"". She succeeds in killing Emerald, but Mercury is able to escape, he joins the heroes in exchange for all of the information he has on Cinder and Salem's plans.

Ruby gets one of her eyes gouged out in a fight with one of Salem's Knights, Qrow protects Ruby while Taiyang fights the Knight. He wins, but ultimately dies, he asks Qrow to find someone to transplant one of his eyes to Ruby.

Weiss is forced into multiple Dust and Aura experiments on her body due to the SDC take over. The strain on her mind has made her barely able to properly emote, but her Glyphs are now incredibly powerful, and she can generate very minute amounts of dust from her own body.

Before the WF reform, Blake is captured and tortured, mostly cuts and whipping, as well as having her ears cut off, since they believe her to be a race traitor. After the WF reform she travels around remnant by herself, eventually meeting one of the maidens, a kind and loving elderly woman. This woman gives Blake good advice about her life, and Blake stays with the woman to help in her day to day life. Eventually the Maiden dies and her power is transferred to Blake.

Yang trains with Raven and ends up getting her right leg cut off. However this training allows her to properly master her semblance and anger, which she constantly has active, meaning her eyes are permanently red. She also gets a robotic arm and leg courtesy of Mercury.",1459469092

Seriously? Kareem is one off the top of my head, and he played forever. Malone missed 10 games during his 18 years in Utah. I think he hurt his MCL on the '04 Lakers. Stockton banged his knee up once but played sixteen 82-game seasons and is fine in retirement.. That's off the top of my head, there are lots and lots of players who played long careers without sustaining significant or recurring knee injuries, and there are even more who dinged their knees once or twice but retired with 0 ongoing/long-term damage 

&gt; If you don't see how, again, somebody doing it ~300 days out of the year wouldn't have a debilitating effect from repetitive stress

Running the ropes just isn't a high impact activity on your knees. There's not enough space to build up more than a couple steps' worth of speed, the ropes handle a lot of the change of direction stress for you, and the ring surface, while far from a trampoline, is designed to lessen impacts. 

Wrestlers don't wrestle 300 times a year, but they do wrestle an awful lot.. running the ropes is not debilitatingly affecting their knees, especially in comparison to something like using your knees to absorb bumps.

Let's say I'm ""punishing"" someone, I lie to make them feel however I am trying to make them feel.  Let's say I'm ""working a root,"" I lie to make them do what I want them to do.  Let's say I am ""on the job,"" I lie to get the information I am after.  Let's say I'm trying to hide details about myself or my past, I lie to hide the truth.  There are a million reasons to lie.

Are you asking how to make them stop?  It's easy, every time you KNOW the guy is lying AND you can prove it with more than conjecture or speculation, throw it in his face and reveal the truth.  Don't tell him how you learned the truth.  Big mistake if you want to maintain power.  Instead, call him on his bullshit.  Prove it.  Wait for him to react.  If you're lucky, he will crumble, fess up and start respecting you enough to usually tell the truth.  If he maintains the lie despite the proof, move on because he's never going to change.  

PS - If he snaps and murders you on the spot for calling him on his shit, don't blame me; you've been warned.  There's nothing worse for a sociopath than to be challenged and the lose thoroughly without a way out.  Think cornered tiger.",1459469096

Scene 1: He drives up. The neighbor nags him about something; he ignores her and goes inside.

Scene 2: ""Mom, what's for dinner?"" No answer. He finds a note on the fridge. 'We'll be gone for such and such, be sure to yadda yadda.'

Scene 3: A pizza box hits the coffee table, and Dean turns on the T.V.

Beyond that, you need to put yourself in the characters' shoes a little better, because their reactions don't seem realistic yet.

But let's say it is. If we only take into account the planets, which are supposed to be life-size (they're probably actually much smaller). If you placed 100000 players on random locations, it take months for one of them to meet another. That is, unless they converge on a point of interest, let's say a space station. Now, indeed, 1 million is kind of a lowball number if we assume players only visit stations.

However, 1 billion, 400 trillion and some quintillions are still all sufficiently large that they might as well be the same.

Given 100000 players randomly placed among 1 billion space stations, we'd have to visit 10000 solar systems to find another player.

Of course, that doesn't take into account people converging toward the center of the universe, but this effect applies to the other numbers of systems as well.

With these pictures it's near impossible to judge whether you should lose weight, but you don't seem to be overweight.

Your face is average now, but it's also the kind of face you can do a lot with (required for modelling and no, I'm not saying you should become a model).
Unfortunately you didn't included a picture of you smiling since that can change a lot. As someone mentioned you look teeny, but that's not surprising at the age of 16.
Cloths can be improved on. All I can see is an outfit covered by a dark comfy at home vest you probably paid quite much for since it's lacoste (unless it was a nice sale) while a 10-20 dollar one would have looked the same. The striped shirt looks a bit shapeless or too big at some pictures, but I could have that wrong. The colour combination of the striped shirt with the gingham shirt seems nice, but I don't think that I would combine stripes with gingham.

At picture 5 you turned up the legs of your jeans. It can be nice, but if you shouldn't do it that far that you can see skin when not wearing low socks. Would turn it up once or twice max if you really want to turn it up.",1459469101

It is definitely readable, almost compulsively so, but I didn't think it was a great book.

But be sure it's the VW certified stuff. Hope this helps!

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","1) 20% is an unreasonable pay increase. It's unlikely that you'll get that much of a wage increase in a new position especially after 6 months. From a business standpoint the first time they really start making money with newbies are at 6 months. With that said you still might be able to swing it if they are really losing people, for the same aforementioned reason.

2) If you have good reason behind your honesty good upper management will see that. Explain yourself and your position to him, if his head is in the sand other management has talked to him and you're not going to magically sway his opinion.

3) you could always bring this to the table? If they ask if there is anything else you would be interested in anyway. Read up about them here.

4) It's your timeline. How much is it worth to you? you've only worked there six months and I wouldn't blame them to see if you can work by yourself in an entire building. I wouldn't even expect them to implement by may 1st unless you are incredibly qualified and they know it.

5) what you're not considering is there is someone out there who is willing to work for less than what you are working for. You need solid facts and loyalty to a company before you can start swinging things like 20% wage increases. What you see as mid-level management and what they see mid level management might eb incredibly different. Hell they have probably worked at mid level management. What if their *real wage* was much less than yours?

If you have another company offering 15% wage increase in a better environment why not go that way?  ",1459469109

DIO's pretty nuts, but maybe imbibing Joseph's blood isn't a great thing for your sanity either.

Apart from DIO's weak side, it's notable that Jotaro's final blow killed DIO because he countered with The World. If he'd blocked with his own leg, Star Platinum would have smashed his leg off and he could have counterattacked Jotaro with The World. Since The World is hard and not squishy like flesh, its entire body cracked instead and the mirrored damage ran up into DIO's brain. DIO was going to lose anyways by the end, but the fact that a property of the Stand he relied so heavily on is what killed him in the end is just fantastic to me.

Kakyoin turned Hierophant invisible to get the secret of DIO's Stand. Joseph turned Hermit Purple invisible to fuck with his grandson and some paramedics. Bless his restarted old man heart. I'll always imagine that he was blasting classic Weird Al when he was the one driving. 

I'm glad we could do this rewatch with so many regular posters week after week. It really was fun. I believe that from the bottom of my heart! It's fitting that this journey of a rewatch ends with an episode about ending journeys.

To harass, W a creep/ball thats out, use on opponent, and then follow up with Q, an auto attack (and then anotber Q+E+R if you have all in potential) this basically just gets off a quick and easy thunderlords proc, and W is a hell of a lot easier to land due to its range + speed, and slows them down for a much easier Q.

I saw this subreddit as being filled with people who were more fond of my videos than the average perhaps, and would hence enjoy a small, intimate stream a lot more; and interacting with those more-passionate viewers would be awesome. But I'm now seeing that the stream would've also be filled with people who are passionate about complaining and knowing I'd have to answer to those people would just ruin the mood of the stream. 

There's a small streamer I watch, doesn't have a lot of followers so you won't have heard of him, but I admire the guy a lot. He's been streaming casually for years and he told me that streaming when you're not in a particularly good mood is a bad idea and it'll just make the stream shit, and I agree with him. Given that I now have a somewhat bad-taste in my mouth when thinking about the stream (if you see what I mean), I don't think it'd be a good idea to do it this weekend like I was planning. Maybe later, but now? I think it'd be a bad idea man. ",1459469113

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There's this great WWII book called Forgotten Soldier. True story of a Guy named Guy Sajer. Anyway...Hes a 17 yo German soldier on leave in Berlin. He's there to try and find a friend's (whom was killed in battle) family. He finds the house, and outside there is this beautiful young girl named Paula, she is also 17. He gets to know her over the next couple days and they soon become great friends and they go everywhere together. Soon he develops strong feelings for Paula, but it much to nervous to voice them to her.

After spending weeks with her, they one day decided to to go a park for a rest. They are resting and being flirtatious. Suddenly Berlin is hit by a daylight bombing raid the likes which have never been seen before. As they bombs fall, they search for cover and when they finally do find some he confesses his love for her, and she does to him. 

The rest of his time in Berlin, is spent only with her. Not a moment goes by where they leave each others side. However, the day finally comes when he has to go back to the Eastern Front. They both go to the train station to get him abort a train. Before he leaves, they confess their love over and over. The dialog is beautiful. She is crying, he is crying and as the train pulls away he says he will come back for her and they will be together forever, however...He never goes back to Berlin, and he never sees Paula again.

The Dialog in this chapter of the book really hits home for me. It makes me feel just as I did when I first felt love in my heart. He hits every emotion a man feels when he's in love. Its almost to real, and the experience of that chapter really choked me up.

&gt;When asked about her experiences on the set of The Wizard of Oz, Hamilton said that her biggest fear was that her monstrous film role would give children the wrong idea of who she really was. In reality, she cared deeply about children, frequently giving to charitable organizations. She often remarked about children coming up to her and asking her why she had been so mean to poor Dorothy. She appeared on an episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1975, where she explained to children that she was only playing a role, and showed how putting on a costume ""transformed"" her into the witch. She also made personal appearances, and Hamilton described the children's usual reaction to her portrayal of the Witch:

&gt;""Almost always they want me to laugh like the Witch. And sometimes when I go to schools, if we're in an auditorium, I'll do it. And there's always a funny reaction, like 'Ye gods, they wish they hadn't asked.' They're scared. They're really scared for a second. Even adolescents. I guess for a minute they get the feeling they got when they watched the picture. They like to hear it but they 'don't' like to hear it. And then they go, 'Ohhhhhhhhhh...!' The picture made a terrible impression of some kind on them, sometimes a ghastly impression, but most of them got over it, I guess...because when I talk like the Witch, and when I laugh, there is a hesitation and then they clap. They're clapping at hearing the sound again.""

I remember hearing about an interview where she said children would recognize her in line at the grocery store and often get scared.

He was nearly startled out of his skin when a hand was laid upon his arm. Bryen turned his head quickly around to see that the hand belonged to one of those beautiful women. What's more, she was talking to _him_. Why was she talking to him? His mind swirled as he looked at her pretty face, his heart starting to thump against his chest.

&gt;Field Post Office' Kiev, 16 May 1942

&gt;No 32704
&gt;B Nr 40/42

&gt;TOP SECRET
&gt;To : SS-~bersturmbannfuehrer Rauff [Handwritten :j

&gt;Berlin, Prinz-Albrecht-Str. 8 pers.

&gt;R/29/5 Pradel n.R

&gt;The overhauling of vans by groups D and C is finished. While
the vans of the first series can also be put into action if the
weather is not too bad, the vans of the second series (Saurer)
stop conzpletely in rainy weather. If it has rained for instance
for only one half hour, the van cannot be used because it simply
skids away. It can only be used in absolutely dry weather. It
is only a question now whether the van can only be used standing
at the place of execution. First the van has to be brought to
that place, which is possible only in good weather. The place
of execution is usually 10-15 km away from the highways and is
difficult to access becausemof its location; in damp or wet weather
it is not accessible at all. If the persons to be executed are driven
or led to that place, then they realize immediately what is going
on and get restless, which is to be avoided as far as possible.
There is only one way left; to load them at the collecting point
and to drive them to the spot.
I ordered the vans of group D to be camouflaged as housetrailers
by putting one set of window shutters on each side of
the small van and two on each side of the larger vans, such as one
often sees on farm-houses in the country. The vans became so
well-known, that not only the authorities, but also the civilian
population called the van ""death van"", as soon as one of these
vehicles appeared. It is my opinion, the van cannot be kept
secret for any length of time, not even camouflaged.
The Saurer-van which I transported from Simferopol to
Taganrog suffered damage to the brakes on the way. The Security
Command [SKI in Mariupol found the cuff of the combined
oil-air brake broken at several points. By persuading and
bribing the H.K.P. [?I we managed to have a form machined,
on which the cuffs were cast. When I came to Stalino and Gorlowka
a few days later, the drivers of the vans complained about
the same faults. After having talked to the commandants of, those commands I went once more to Mariupol to have some more
cuffs made for those cars too. As agreed two cuffs will be made for each car, six cuffs will stay in Mariupol as replacements for
group D and six cuffs will be sent to SS-Untersturmfuehrer Ernst
in Kiev for the cars of group C. The cuffs for the groups B and
A could be made available from Berlin, because transport from
Mariupol to the north would be too complicated and would take
too long. Smaller damages on the cars will be repaired by experts
of the commands, that is of the groups in their own shops.
Because of the rough terrain and the indescribable road and
highway conditions the caulkings and rivets loosen in the course
of time. I was asked if in such cases the vans should be brought
to Berlin for repair. Transportation to Berlin would be much
too expensive and would demand too much fuel. In order to
save those expenses I ordered them to have smaller leaks soldered
and if that should no longer be possible, to notify Berlin immediately
by radio, that Pol. Nr ............. is out of order. Besides that
I ordered that during application of gas all the men were to be
kept as far away from the vans as possible, so they should not
suffer damage to their health by the gas which eventually would
escape. I should like to take this opportunity to bring the following
to your attention: several commands have had the unloading
after the application of gas done by their own men. I
brought to the attention of the commanders of those S.K. concerned
the immense psychological injuries and damages to their
health which that work can have for those men, even if not immediately,
at least later on. The men complained to me about
head-aches which appeared after each unloading. Nevertheless
they don't want to change the orders, because they are afraid
prisoners called for that work, co~zld use an opportune moment
to flee. To protect the men from these damages, I request order2
be issued accordingly.
The application of gas usually is not undertaken correctly. In
order to come to an end as fast as possible, the driver presses the
accelerator to the fullest extent. By doing that the persons to
be executed suffer death from suffocation and not death by dozing
off as was planned. My directions now have proved that by correct
adjustment of the levers death comes faster and the prisoners
fall asleep peacefully. Distorted faces and excretions, such
as could be seen before, are no longer noticed.
Today I shall continue my journey to group B, where I can be
reached with further news.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Two really important 'secondary' scenes here, for me anyway.

First: Mr. Ral, in his natural Mr. Exposition role, talking about the different reasons people build Gunpla. He highlights the major ones - they're cool fighting robots, they come from anime that deeply moves people, they're expressive/articulate enough for dioramas and customization.

There's also the simple fact that the act of /building/ is fun, which we'll get to see a few times throughout the series. And for plastic toys, Gunpla are incredibly well designed, truly feats of modern engineering writ small, and there's pleasure in that too. (The fantastic conversation yesterday about RGs is a great example.) He also doesn't mention people choosing kits based specifically on mecha aesthetics/design, though Mihoshi hinted at that last episode with the ""I like the GMs from 0080!"" talk - it's nice to 'just look at' things that are, well, pleasing to you. 

I probably come from the ""honor the anime"" camp, since I highly prefer buying kits piloted by characters I like, or at least from series I like, with a side of ""enjoyable engineering"" and ""calming building process"". I actually don't think I'd battle myself, even in a world with Plavsky Particles. 

Second: Let's talk about Fellini flirting with a freakin' plastic toy and almost succeeding if not for Reiji's interference, shall we? 

Build Fighters really is the best of all possible worlds, if Fellini is able to take these sort of chances outside of conventions/tournaments and have it ACTUALLY WORK. I absolutely adore how much a huge, ludicrous geek he is, yet it doesn't detract at all from him being flirtatious/a ladies' man, and it gives him confidence instead of taking it away. He's clearly looking for someone who is also going to balance conventional attraction and ridiculous nerdery, and he's not afraid at all to be a giant fucking Gunpla addict in public in order to find that kind of person. 

It's basically what I aspire to in life, it's the best. I think I have shown this clip to just about every person I've seriously considered dating and judged based on reaction. (Best reactions: ""I really want to live in a world where people hit on you by buying you action figures instead of drinks"" followed by buying me a Gunpla at the next opportunity and ""Why didn't he give her [Gundam Alex](http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundam_Alex) instead?"")

I also love this 'imagination battle' idea; the idea of knowing in one's mind how things will play out without the reflexes to act on it pleases me. Though Mao, why aren't you wearing a pilot suit in space? (I know why, it's another reference, but I'm just saying.)

In our post-credits scene, our senpai has disappeared. I wonder why? Does it have to do with what happened last time? And what does he see in the light of the Plavsky Particles?

Discussion: Working on it in bits and pieces after work, and still following my other hobbies, I'm probably working a little faster than 1 HG a month, and that suits me just fine. I could probably purely snapfit a not-too-complex one (say, the GM I posted in the first episode thread) in the course of an afternoon/evening.

The logic being, if these were primaries, the turn out would have been much larger, and Sanders margin of victory over Clinton in the caucus states (where he has performed a lot better) would be larger (in terms of absolute voter numbers, not %).",1459469119

"Kappa","t5_2tjsd","&gt; ""(these kinds of risks just aren't taken by Japanese companies... typically).""

The Japanese were the pioneers that built the whole game industry from the ground up.

The American sections and companies today are too obsessed with immediate profit and are caring less and less about the quality of the product being delivered on launch.

Now that is not to say they don't care about quality in general.

Most do.

They just realized that most gamers are dupes who will buy whatever they punt onto the shelves and as long as they fix most of the more glaring issues people will continue to buy their products and play their games.

Some companies however, American, Japanese, or otherwise, have gone fully into profit mode with no care for the games they make.

Just look at Konami, a once great company who are now fully invested into mobile games and pachinko.

&gt; ""Cos seriously, wtf happened?""

In my opinion gaming becoming a major mainstream everday thing is slowly killing off parts of the industry from the inside out.

There's zero pressure on companies to release a fully finished product because people are just going to buy it anyway and two years from now when the next major thing comes along everyone will forget about what happened last time.

It'll be worse next time too.

"Bonsai","t5_2qowd","I think it largely depends on how long you can stretch the process out over.

If you've got a couple years, you can dig a trench around it and cut roots a ways from the trunk, which will encourage smaller roots to grow within the area that you can actually dig up as part of the root ball.  I've seen things suggesting doing a trench around half of a tree one year, the other half the next, then digging it up in the third.

Something you might want to consider if you're bonsaiing this (and not just putting it in a pot) is that your foliage is a lot farther off the base than you're going to want it long term.  That means you're going to want to trunk-chop the thing at some point, and if you can it probably makes sense to do that in the ground.

I've got a japanese maple in the ground that Im going to start working on soon.  My current plan is trunk chop this coming winter, let recover, trunk chop again (and maybe do some root work) a year or two later, then do the root work (or the rest of the root work, depending), then actually completely dig it up.  So the whole process will probably take 4 - 5 years before I get it out of the ground.

If you need to pull it out ASAP:

Now isn't a great time of year.  Ideally you do it in late winter / early spring, before leaves start popping.  Dig a trench around the entire thing, get as much of the root ball as you can, sever the tap root as cleanly as possible, then water well and keep in partial shade until you see signs of healthy growth.",1459469123

I've never been on medication for my illnesses and they weren't really triggered either, so I apologise that I can't fully relate to your problems. I'm also really sorry you had such a rough time from early on in your life.

Although I can't relate to your past, I have felt suicidal on many occasions and experience similar things in terms of good(ish), bad and completely shit days. Bad days seem to be the most common for me, with little pockets of good or crap days every now and again. That's just one of the ways depression can affect you. As well as that, I wish my friends knew the person I want to be rather than the person I am. For me, this is partially because I'm transgender but also because I'm really down, distant and quiet all the time...

But to answer your question, no, that's not really what being a teenager should feel like. Feeling suicidal is definitely not a product of being a teenager and I would strongly suggest trying to get help. You don't have to suffer alone. There are so many people out there that want to help and there's no shame in trying to make yourself a happier, healthier person! You shouldn't doubt your dreams either. I know it's really difficult to believe but we all have more potential than we think.

I just do about 200 cals of nuts every day and the rest is other fruits and snack veggies, sometimes I smear a little hummus on greens and eat them rolled up.

Anyway, I eat ""maintenance"" for my meals and just add that snack pack. So all I have to do is stop eating the snack pack and I'll stop gaining weight. I could also increase it if I wanted to. It's like an extra meal that is easy to eat on-the-go and throughout the day. Make sure your plan for eating maintenance is well-established and you can follow that well. Then all you have to do is add something every day. I find that easier to follow instead of changing the size of my meals all the time.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt; Firstly, that sort of approach leaves you ridiculously vulnerable to trolling and deception.

What sort of approach? If someone claims to be pro-GG, and I can find no contradicting evidence that they are, what reason do I have to believe otherwise? 

How do I know you're not a troll? I assume that you're pro-GG, because you claim to be, at least through implication, and I have no reason to doubt you. If I learn new information that causes me to doubt you, I'll reconsider based on that information. Same goes for that ChristiJunior person. Show me evidence that they're lying about being pro-GG and I'll reconsider it.

&gt; Secondly, does that mean you're now going to blame ""GG"" for mocking GG supporters committing suicide and supporting sending gore mocking their deaths to their bereaved loved ones?

No, because I'm not aware of any significant portion of GG that mocked that person's death. From what I can tell, it was just a handful of people. A lot more than a handful of people were posting in that #AlisonRapp hashtag. But, considering no one here seems to be defending her firing, which is what I originally expected to happen when I posted here, I will concede that it's possible that there weren't as many pro-GG people in that hashtag as I thought.",1459469128

I transferred in with an AAS and A+/Sec+/MCSA (70-680 &amp; 70-685) and I took Network+ through WGU, when I transferred in I received 54 cu's because they had already made the switch away from Windows OS for the Network pipeline.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You story is very similar to mine - I grew up in a very Christian Conservative house - my extended family has pretty much achieved Bible Thumper status. I grew up Protestant and we went to all the major Protestant churches before my parents settled on the Lutheran Church. I was eventually baptized Lutheran and I even went proselytizing once a month with a local youth group to various places all over the pacific northwest (I was brainwashed). 

In my early 20's I was finally able to throw off the choke chain of religion (it was a slow process), which has been the most freeing experience - it changed my perspective on life, death, purpose, etc. 

George Carlin and Alan Watts played a huge role in my transition from being a pious theist to a secular agnostic. 

Up until the last year or so I would always get emails from my uncle (now in his early 70s)  - I would write a very polite retort showing how the email he regurgitated to his mass mailing list was wrong - he ended up blocking me and unfriending me on facebook lol. 

So here are my thoughts,  if someone is willing to cut you out of their life over something as trivial as this - then they probably don't value you as a person. They are very clearly sending a message that their invisible man in the sky is more important than a living breathing person in front of them (you). And you deserve someone who appreciates you for you - who places value on you as a person. 

Don't sweat over the small stuff, you are who you are and they are who they are. Nothing is going to magically change that. 

People should not be so sensitive to a difference in perspective, you only get one shot to live this life we are given - you are not here to live your life as some puppet to please the people around you. 

You have to live the life that you want to and there is strength in that. 

PS: Well thought out letter and very articulate! I would be surprised if your uncle you sent this to read the whole thing, unfortunately.

"poker","t5_2qhix","Ok, your THIRD sentence.  If their range consists of ""a lot of draws"" that ""are likely to call a raise"", why would you say that ""anyone with a worse hand will not stick around if you raise"".  Isn't a draw a worse hand than top two?

&gt; Calling doesn't protect your hand but it controls the pot in case you are coolered.

If you avoid value because you are scared that your opponent could cooler you, that's bad imo.  

&gt; Why do you think raising is better?

I'm not saying that I 100% think that raising is better than flatting, although it is def my initial reaction.  I'm trying to have a conversation to explore people's thoughts on ranges, textures, image, value, etc.  It seems like BB had virtually zero hands in his range that have us beat except for the occasional TT and 98.  We want to charge him for all of the qx/jx/draws he has.  UTG's range is still wide enough that we can raise for value and it helps us define his range in the future.  If he calls two bets and then donks the turn that's a way stronger hand than if he calls one bet and then bets when BB checks the turn.  It also gives us the initiative, allowing us to do things like b/f sketchy turns with the intent of checking back all non-fh rivers.  Basically, we want to maximize the money we make when we're ahead while minimizing the money we lose when we are behind.  Obviously we can flat the flop bet and then b/f turn if it's checked to us and almost never be wrong, BUT by flatting the flop we reduce the likelihood of us being checked to on the turn.  And now we're stuck in a worse spot, do we call-call-call?  When we flat flop and then get checked to on the turn and bet and get called and either player donks the river, we're in a REALLY tough spot because our hand is underrepped and they should be taking that line with a polarized range...but do they?",1459469131

I realize that not everyone thinks this way, but I don't think I came across as rude or belittling in my statements, I made them purely for your benefit (not the OP's, your answer to that was perfectly fine for his purposes, hence why I posted in response to you), and no, I'm not that smart, I didn't know most of that stuff off the top of my head, I spent ~45 minutes researching about battery chemistries to figure out why they work the way they do because I knew that your statement was wrong, I didn't know why, and I found myself curious about the reason. I then decided to go ahead and pass the knowledge on to you on the off chance that you would find it at all interesting. The alternative was to than simply tell you that you were wrong with no explanation, or leave you to repeat the information in the future.

It doesn't matter if she seemed friendly.  It doesn't matter if she was helpful.  It doesn't matter if she lied.  And it doesn't matter if she used ghostwriters (which I don't think she did).  Nothing else matters.

Plagiarizing is not something any writing community will take lightly.  There isn't a mea culpa and all will be forgiven.  This isn't an opportunity for the tribe to help pick someone up and clean up the mess.  This is a serious offense and any excuses made in her defense is just painting you with some of the same muck covering her.

Orchid is good if you go ganking, with QE unless the opponent has a blink/invis ability it's not that important because you can stun lock with coldsnap. Also remember that urn procs coldsnap so if you are killing a lot then it might be worth picking up for before the 5 manning starts.

Lots of people go blink but this is for getting that instant kill on someone with QE rather than the big crowd control of QW.  

Drums is a good item after midas for general stats- helps the early/midgame fights a lot. 

QW is generally all about the crowd control but lacks damage, so you want to focus on your spells, whereas QE can be a little more dependent on items like euls/blink in the midgame to annihilate a single target. ",1459469136

The flipside of that is that the jump from 3 colors to 5 colors in terms of mana fixing is not huge, especially with trilands.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","So based on my calculations, a $217 payment a month for 6 years on an 11k loan is about 10% interest. For a used car, that's on the high side but not obnoxious, but since you have the disposable income right now I'd start throwing it at the car a bit. Maybe pay 300 a month instead of 217, every little bit helps. 

Also, a tip, check your insurance coverage and make sure you have GAP coverage. It's usually incredibly cheap to add to coverage and it pays off the remainder of any loans owed against the car in the event that it is totalled. So if you wreck the car and owe 10k and insurance decides it was only worth 8k, you'd be on the hook for the rest. GAP coverage covers that amount.

Edit: aslo, I don't think it was a bad idea. It's good to take on the responsibility and you didn't go nuts and get a car loan for 500 bucks thinking ""Oh I can afford that no problem"" you were sane about it, put a chunk down, and the car should last you a while. Don't panic :)",1459469136

But it beats Ruby, Python and most interpreted languages by a good margin. I think it even beats C# which has a similar architecture, though I'm not sure of that's still the case.

"Vive","t5_378go","&gt;i was only speaking to the catalyst people have for wanting vr. I think we all have an idea in our heads of the experiences that made us obsess over the possibilities of vr, and it wasnt 3rd person games.

I absolutely agree with you.

&gt; Most of the games journos interested in vr have proved in recent times that theyre kinda bored with the state of gaming, and i think most of us are too (perhaps for different reasons) hence it stnds to reason that they might not be blown away by the current oculus launch titles..

Absolutely, I just saw the [sneak peak for Polygon's Vive review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/4cs3fg/sneak_peak_at_polygon_staff_reacting_to_the_vive/) and compared it to [their Rift review](https://youtu.be/P_QyfkAC100) and the difference in excitement is palpable.

Also, to quote Polygon:

&gt; In many ways it [the rift] feels like a display technology more than a way of bringing the player all new gameplay experiences.

The Rift is extremely limited in what it can do by its lack of motion controllers/room scale and I guess they're trying to make the best of it with their current lineup. The games they have are surely going to be fun but I can't help but feel like the Rift is VR 1.0 while Vive already skipped ahead to VR 2.0",1459469137

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","Psst! THERE ARE NO GODS. Pass it on. I am a very imperfect Prophet of the Bleeding Obvious [POTBO] and I can tell you that the ONLY way to end strife caused by Religion is not to pick on one religion or another, but to GET RID OF ALL RELIGION! SHOULD be doable. Eg. re the Christian Religion simply ask: You say a god made a woman pregnant? Even as a 5-7-year-old I could see this was a Fairy Tale, and was amazed that adults could believe such hogwash/horseshit/nonsense. I wondered then WHO made up this far-fetched yarn called the Jesus Story? Decades later I discover it was con-man, yarn-spinner and Master of Priestly Fiction Saul of Tarsus [later 'Saint Paul']. Saul is also credited/blamed for writing 14/27 Books of the New Testament, and who knows what else. Saul made a breakthrough for the poor old Priests who often got stoned when harvests failed even after the people had 'sacrificed' to the priests their pretty goats and fatted virgins. Saul's beaut idea was that all you had to promise to the punters with this new 'one true god' was life after death! So if you died and didn't get immortality, you were in no position to complain, mouldering in your dark grave. Problem solved! This new dodge spread like wildfire among the priestly class in many places. Anyway, if you'd like to try and help save people from suicide bombers, Christian nut-jobs infesting our Democracies, Jewish 'god's chosen people' nonsense, dis-'Honour' Murders of young women escaping from loveless forced marriages etc etc, just SPREAD THE WORD: THERE ARE NO GODS, and ONLY FOOLS, the BRAINWASHED-from-Birth, and the UNEDUCATED/UNREAD believe in them. Write it as graffiti, on a Tweet or wherever you can. There is no Heaven, no Paradise, no Satan/Devil - these are all Fairy Tales for gullible adults. Do you see any IMAMS blowing themselves up? Nope. They know that all Religion is Horseshit and Fairy Tales. If you say 'I am a Christian' or 'I am a Muslim' /Hindu/Jew etc then you are acting as a sociopath or trouble-maker. Say ONLY: I AM A HUMAN BEING! All humans alive today are ONE SPECIES called Homo sapiens [man wise even though most of us are stupid and the best half of us are women] therefore EVERY MAN IS MY BROTHER EVERY WOMAN MY SISTER - ONE BIG FAMILY OF HUMANKIND. Palaeoanthropologist Richard Leakey told us this 20 years or so ago, but we human animals are SLOW-learners, and MANY are trying to keep us stupid and drag us backwards to suit their own lousy purposes. All we need to do is learn TRUE ETHICS, which guides us on HOW TO BE DECENT HUMANS - HUMAN DECENCY. ENOUGH 'Religious Ethics'=Bigotry/Finger-Pointing/Judgementalism, all stupid stuff, backwards and cruel. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS regarding other people's sexuality, desire for euthanasia, etc. ALL TRUE ETHICS asks of us is that we CAUSE NO HARM [at briefest, anyway.] Ciao Bros &amp; Sis's ALL!

But that's ""security through obscurity"" more than anything else. It really has nothing to do at all with ""digital-security"". 

Apple's most recently updated iOS Security whitepaper is 60pages long and can be found here: https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf

iOS is generally consider to be ""more secure"" compared to platforms like Android for a wide variety of reasons,.. the big one being:

* Uniformity .. Apple's ability to control the entire Apple production from beginning to end.. means they can ensure much more consistency and uniformity .. this makes their product line easier to secure,.. compared to platforms like Windows or Android.. where there's significantly more fragmentation and 3rd party fuck-ups who don't upgrade things. 

If you watch the various Apple Developer videos regarding different sub-systems in OSX and iOS.. you'll start to notice consistent patterns where Apple strongly enforces rules on developers to use end-to-end encryption, requiring 64bit-ONLY App submissions and other platform-wide security ""best behaviors"". 

I'm not saying that to imply that Apple is ""the most secure company EVAR""... because I certainly don't believe that. Good Security **STARTS** in the platform,.. but a lot of the responsibility also ends up on the end-users shoulders. You can have the best / most-secure platform in the world.. but if the end-user isn't following good op-sec.. then you'll still get exploited. (but in that scenario.. it's not the platform failing.. it's the end-user). ",1459469144

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My elementary school one time hired some awareness-type company to do a presentation to the school in the auditorium about some sort of mental disability--I honestly can't remember which specific one.

It started out with a middle-aged woman introducing the program and what they'd be discussing.  She then introduced the ""main speaker"" of the program, who was supposedly waiting behind the curtain, and who supposedly actually had that disability and would be talking about what it was like to live with it.

So then the lady goes behind the curtain, and you can hear the ""two"" of them talking through the mic as the lady encourages her shy and nervous ""friend"" to go out and talk.  The friend emerges and... it's just her.  The same woman.  Her literally just acting like someone with that disability--changing her voice, her posture, the way she moved, so that she appeared more ""disabled.""

&gt;A lot of 40 and 50 year olds on reddit are still in denial and will call themselves young

Not winning any points, you know. Though one thing that comes with age is the ability to see how ridiculous one was in their early 20s

With those two things out of the way: SNAP OUT OF IT. 

First of all, stop thinking attractiveness is all that. It's not. You can be an Adonis and be the most self-loathing, boring person on earth. You don't like yourself? Work on yourself. You're not a static piece of modern art, you're a human being who can learn, grow and evolve into something people want to have dinner with. Read books, get a hobby. Stop worrying so much about how you and others look and work on the inner parts. Those are the ones that withstand the test of time. That is what makes YOU, not your biceps. 

Go talk to a therapist. Now. Please, please go. You sound like you're either in a full-fledged depression or working your way HARD towards it. A good therapist will help you with strategies to get out of the hole. 

The point is that you're 23 and you're behaving like you're 95 with a heart condition. Life is not here to entertain you, you have to work at it. If things are as dire for you as you've listed, you really need to get some help, because this ends nowhere good.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","&gt; Noun wild animal ‎(plural wild animals) * Any animal living in a natural, undomesticated state. * (figuratively) One exhibiting uncontrolled behaviour.

You are able to read, are you? Protip: *uncontrolled behaviour*. I think if a “pet chimp” rips someone's face off, that qualifies as uncontrolled behaviour. 

&gt;[…] Though, some wars have had positive outcomes (the American Revolution, the American Civil War, World War II, ect.[sic!]).

Yep, about 60 million dead people, including ≥2 atomic bombs going off, levelling two cities, and a little bit of genocide. All in all good times. You're really a “glass half full” kind of person, aren't you? 

&gt;Morality is informed by reality for all moral people. Only immoral people don't think reality matters. 

What is that even supposed to mean? Moral people are moral? Moral is what everyone does? Is that supposed to be a definition? This might be down to English not being my first language, but I seriously cannot make out what you're trying to say with this. 

&gt;The fact that people can and do safely keep animals in captivity and derive pleasure from doing so - and the fact that many tamed animals show affection for their caretakers - suggests that it is indeed moral behavior.

What kind of reasoning is that even supposed to be? Utilitarianism? If so, you still haven't provided me with any reason that you can take animals out of this equation, which essentially is what you're doing. Furthermore, how are animals even able to “show affection” if they're so stupid? 

&gt;No, it isn't arrogance. It is scientific reality. Sorry!

And still, you have not provided me with any kind of source to back that specific “scientific reality” up. That should be really easy, shouldn't it? I, for one, wasn't exactly out for a “scientific discussion”, but since you brought it up: How about you first define “thinking” (or “intelligence”) or provide me with a source where someone has done that for you? 

&gt;1a: the ability to learn or understand or to deal with new or trying situations b: the ability to apply knowledge to manipulate one's environment or to think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (as tests)

Nice of you, to throw in part of the definition of intelligence from Merriam-Webster without even providing your source. That's the epitome of scientific literacy, really. 

&gt;I understand you aren’t scientifically literate. Let me explain these things to you:

Oh, an ad hominem, great. Do explain your wisdom to me, oh enlightened one. 

&gt;Number of experts cited in that article: 0.

I'll cite myself on this one:

&gt;Because I have no idea of your background knowledge, these are all popular science articles. 

*****

&gt;You didn’t recognize this. This means you are scientifically illiterate. It is hardly surprising that someone who is scientifically illiterate would believe garbage like this. An expert said it, it must be true!

I never claimed that. Oh, and the “experts cited in the article”, apparently even literally, seem to be [Arthur Saniotis](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arthur_Saniotis) and [Maciej Henneberg](http://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/maciej.henneberg). And what exactly is the “garbage” in this article? Care to elaborate? 

And what exactly makes you an “expert in intelligence”? Having published in “The Proceedings of I Am Very Smart”? 

&gt;[…]Heck, they even said “different kinds of intelligence”. […]

Did you notice the quotation marks around “intelligences”? Do you know the meaning of quotation marks? 

&gt; […]Which, as anyone familiar with g-theory will tell you, is not really an accurate understanding of intelligence. 

Which, as anyone familiar with the theory of “multiple intelligences” will tell you, depends on your viewpoint. Oops. 

&gt;Animals are not nearly as good at any of these things as humans are. None. Zero. Nada. Humans are vastly, vastly more adaptable. We have technology and language and philosophy and law and all these other things that animals simply are incapable of. The most advanced technology animals have is very, very, very primitive. Most animals can’t even pass the mirror test. They cannot understand law. They are awful at math by comparison to humans.

I never claimed that either. It's not even a fair comparison. Comparing humans with chimpanzees under certain conditions, humans have an awful [“working memory capability for numerical recollection”](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.027). So what? Did I, at any point, claim that Bubbles will (dis)prove the Riemann hypothesis next year, or that Coco the gorilla is about to drop “Lectures on the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problem”? 

&gt;Blabla 

*****

&gt;Just because someone writes a book doesn’t mean they have a clue.

As this someone has a Ph.D. in ecology, I think he might at least have “a clue” what he's talking about, even though it might not be his area of expertise, unless the American (higher) education system is complete and utter shite. 

&gt;Blabla

*****

&gt;Again, nothing newsy here.

&gt;I’m afraid that I appear to be far more familiar with this subject matter than you are, given you seem to believe this is surprising, while I was reading about this stuff decades ago, and follow along with various animal intelligence studies, such as the studies on Alex. 
&gt;It seems you have fallen into the classical hole of the ignorant: you assume that you are correct, and that anyone who disagrees with you is woefully uneducated and that they will SEE THE LIGHT if you link to basic articles which are full of obvious errors, misrepresent the science, and don’t exhibit even a basic understanding of what intelligence is.
&gt;Sorry to break it to you, but I’m not an idiot.

Yes, you are very smart. I got that, even though I'm apparently scientifically illiterate. Are you a member of Mensa, as well? 

Interesting how you also seem to completely ignore *the one reference* I made to an actual scientific journal, namely “Science”. 

&gt;You’re engaging in rationalization. You are trying to protect yourself from the possibility that someone who has studied this could arrive at a totally different conclusion.
&gt;Every scientist I know agrees with me on this stuff. Like, literally every one of them. 

Great references. Could your dad also beat up my dad? 

&gt;Animals aren’t people. They aren’t capable of understanding or obeying the law, or of language, or of developing advanced technology, or of any number of cognitive tasks that humans are capable of. No animal is capable of representing itself in court.

Where did I claim that (non-human) animals are people? 

&gt;If it was, it would be a person. 

So people in a coma aren't persons? They can't represent themselves in a court, after all. 

&gt;Given you are apparently incapable of even understanding something as simple as what a wild animal is, I doubt you’re capable of understanding intelligence. 

Thank you for your understanding. ",1459469147

[Q:  What happens when we die? Are we judged immediately and our soul sent to Heaven or Hell or what?](http://www.lcms.org/faqs/doctrine#die)

A:  Lutherans believe that Scripture teaches that at the moment of death the souls of believers enter the joy of heaven (Luke 23:43; Acts 7:59; Rev. 14:13; Phil. 1:23-24), while the souls of unbelievers at death are consigned to ""the prison"" of everlasting judgment in hell (1 Peter 3:19-20; Acts 1:25). The departed souls remain in heaven or hell until the Day of Judgment, when they shall be reunited with their own bodies (Matt. 10:28; John 5:28-29; John 11:24; Job 19:26).

Therefore, ""The Last Judgment is the grand finale of this present world, in which the sentence pronounced in death over the individual will be publicly confirmed and extended to the body, which till then has returned to the dust, from whence it came. He who continues in the faith unto the end has nothing to fear for his soul after death or for his body and soul on the Day of Judgment (Rev. 2:10;
14:13)"" (Edward Koehler, A Summary of Christian Doctrine, St. Louis: Concordia, 1939).

""**Wait** a second Mr. Sir Stats-san, I have a song we want to sing to you.""

*Snorf and Moist onto stage, with Betty the bar maid carrying a guitar. Stark and Kala looked at each other confused as Betty was from the Sky island and they don't remember her riding along on the ship. Snorf and Moist the frog quickly changed into sweaters and Moist put on a Afro wig. They brought out a stool and brought the microphone close*

""Alright this song goes out to all those on my home island. Alright lets go, here is [the Sound of Silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fWyzwo1xg0)""

*Snorf cleared his throat and began to sing.*

Hello darkness, my old friend

*Moist teared a little at that line and Snorf moved his hood back showing his shadow face, lost in darkness.*

I've come to talk with you again

Because a vision softly creeping

Left its seeds while I was sleeping

And the vision that was planted in my brain

Still remains...

*Snorf's voice began cracking up a little, he could not cry he had no eyes. He was remembering the events of the fall of his island, he dreamed about them all the time, loosing all the people he grew up with, and then his only escape becoming a marine and not being able to return. He finally was able to pull himself together and began to sing again.*

Within the sound of silence.


In restless dreams I walked alone

Narrow streets of cobblestone,

'Neath the halo of a street lamp,

I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

That split the night

And touched the sound of silence.

*He then belted out the next set of lines standing up grabbing the mic and kicking down the stool. Betty began strumming the guitar loudly and sang along too.*

And in the naked light I saw

Ten thousand people, maybe more.

People talking without speaking,

People hearing without listening,

People writing songs that voices never share

And no one dared

Disturb the sound of silence.


*He danced wildly and was singing loudly and quite poorly at this rate lost in emotion*


""Fools,"" said I, ""You do not know.

Silence like a cancer grows.

Hear my words that I might teach you.

Take my arms that I might reach you.""

But my words like silent raindrops fell

And echoed in the wells of silence



And the people bowed and prayed

To the neon god they made.

And the sign flashed out its warning

In the words that it was forming.

And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

And tenement halls

And whispered in the sounds of silence."" 

*He put the mic down gingerly and once again raised his mic close to where his mouth should be*

""My frog here has a song he wants to sing.""


Jeremiah was a bullfrog

Was a good friend of mine

I always understood every word he said

And I always helped him a-drink his wine

And he always had some mighty fine wine


Singin' joy to the pond

All the tadpoles and froglets now

Joy to the frogies in the deep blue pond

Joy to you and me

*Moist began just croaking after that laughing and spitting some lemonade*

""Alright enough of that buddy. Stats-san we wait for your judgement""

So let's use that information. 

As a side note, the total purchase price of the home is then set for $1,005,000 (because you paid $5,000 in loan fees). 

Ok the calcs...

- The present value is $750M.
- The interest is set for 7% and divide that by 12 (for number of months in a year).
- Periods is 30 times 12 (for monthly) which is 360. Now put these into excel or your financial calc. This gives you a **PMT of $4,989.7679**. That is your monthly payment on your mortgage. You can google how to create an amortization table if you need that information as well. It's a good learning exercise in excel. 

Now the second problem is a bit more complicated and honestly is a good exercise in excel for you to learn on. Good luck!

It will introduce the free software ecosystem to many who were not able to experience it.  It will allow me to use MORE open source software when I need Windows.

What your husband is doing is classic. He is taking advantage of your weak boundaries, and he is making you second-guess yourself.  Are those his words about preserving integrity?  Integrity means not compartmentalizing.  Affairs require compartmentalizing. Communicating with his lover on his own terms, even to finish things (possible highly doubtful) is still compartmentalizing his relationship with her and his self with her away from his relationship with you and his self with you.  That compartmentalization is what enabled his cheating in the first place.  You cannot base any healing or reconciliation in it. You might be able to sweep it under the rug, but you will always wonder, you will always resent him, and your marriage will lose any chance at true intimacy.

Second, the problem with our healthcare system is the complete lack of competition due to over-regulation.  Some states only legally have one insurer, and since insurance is mandatory, that means they have a monopoly that the government forces you to use.  This is just utterly awful, and not a free-market approach at all.

State-by-state variance in regulation needs to die.  People should be free to buy policies from any provider they choose.  Competition can absolutely help this horrendous situation.

I'm purchasing a former industrial site which is still wired for 480volts with at least 400 amps of capacity where I plan to someday build a welding shop.  To give you an idea of the massive scale, the 13,800v to 3 phase 480v stepdown transformer [looks like this.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9PMAS4-RwOE/maxresdefault.jpg)   The equipment is all gone, but the electrical service contract is currently locked in with a minimum monthly charge of $80 / month whether or not I use any electricity at all.

Rather than spend thousands of dollars to remove the transformer and thousands more to rewire for 220 single phase just to lower my minimum bill by a few bucks a month, I'm hoping to keep everything the same and just recoup a portion of my energy expenses by bitcoin mining.

In the short term, until I'm ready to build my welding shop, I plan to use this as a weekend hunting/fishing property.  I plan to build a small cabin which will need to be heated anyway to keep the pipes from freezing during harsh Michigan winters. 

I'm new to digital currency, but I'm willing to learn if I can use it to offset my electric bill by $1000 / year.

What would you look like? Probably the same as I do in real life. I don't care if that's boring. I think it's fun to put yourself in a game. =3",1459469161

http://www.cigaraficionado.com/webfeatures/show/id/The-Love-of-Lanceros_9116

Some quotes!

&gt;""It's the best size that I make,"" says Carlos (Carlito) Fuente Jr., who is sometimes seen smoking the long, thin versions of his Fuente Fuente OpusX or Arturo Fuente Don Carlos cigars.

&gt;...

&gt;Thin cigars have always been part of the Cuban cigar portfolio, but the lancero is a relatively new size. It was first rolled at El Laguito in the 1960s with the creation of the Cohiba brand. ""The lancero came out of Cuba—before Cohiba there were no lanceros,"" said General Cigar's Benjamin Menendez, whose father, Alonso, co-owned the H. Upmann factory in Havana. Fidel Castro is ""the father of the size,"" says Cigar Aficionado European editor James Suckling, an avowed lover of lanceros and an expert on the cigars of Cuba.

&gt;...

&gt;""A lancero should be made only if the wrapper can carry the cigar,"" says Jose Oliva, vice president of Oliva Cigar Co., which has also rolled its first long, thin cigar for the market, the Serie V Lancero. ""The wrapper-to-filler ratio is so much in favor of the wrapper that it really has to be able to stand on its own, which is why we made one for the Serie V. The wrapper is so unique and rich that we created a lancero so that people had a chance to really taste it.""

&gt;Cigarmakers say they believe in the lancero size, even if they are not big sellers. ""We made it for connoisseurs and for ourselves,"" says Oliva. ""We are not worried about the numbers."" Says Johnson of his Tatuaje lancero: ""Not the best seller, but I would never discontinue the size, because I smoke it myself.""

Yeah, the disciplinary stuff sucks, but the trick is to avoid things escalating to that point by catching it early, and not letting whatever the problem is go on without saying something. One thing I've learned recently that really helps in any situation is to focus on the business. Someone underperforming? Talk to them about how their performance is negatively affecting the business.  Bad attitude? How it affects the business. It's not personal, it's not about whether you like them or they like you, it's about the business.

Keeping people from quitting is hard, and over time I've found there is often very little you can do.  They generally fall into 3 groups: 1) people who didn't like the job or co-workers; 2) people who didn't ""fit""; and 3) miscellaneous. Groups 1 and 2 you can't do anything about - every workplace is different, and someone may be a great worker but doesn't mesh.  In group 3, there is a subset of people that you only find out what the problem was after they resign, and that's really frustrating (particularly if its something that you could fix, like adjusting work hours). Group 3 also includes people with delusions of grandeur (ie, think they're ready for promotion when they aren't), or bored/need a change, or just move away.

I don't have direct supervisory responsibilities anymore, but when I did, I always made sure to have regular 1 on 1's, and made sure to ask what challenges they are facing, is there anything new they're interested in doing, etc.  Its amazing how easy it is to make someone feel important and vital to the business, which can only be good for the business.

As for the ""walking all over you"" thing, I've had people try to do that. The mature and responsible response is really to let it go - if there are no performance issues or conflicts with coworkers, its irrelevant.  In practice...I gave one person like that a ""special project"" to work on that would be presented to the CEO, and let her do what she wanted instead of what I knew the CEO was looking for (I did give her guidance, but didn't correct her when she didn't follow it)...and let her get shot down in front of the CEO.  At the end of the day, you're the manager, and probably more valuable and harder to replace than the person reporting to you.  Now I just laugh at people who act like that - they usually quit after a little while when its clear their crap isn't going to fly.",1459469167

"intj","t5_2qowo","Browse these boards long enough and one might begin to think INTJs have a tendency for depression! However, I'm inclined to think that's just the type of people who tend to be drawn here, the ones depressed at home, lurking on the internet for a solution to their woes. Just look at the subscribers to r/ENTJ vs r/INTJ. ENTJs occur at least as frequently in the population as INTJs — according to some findings [almost twice as frequently](http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/population-gender/) — yet the INTJ subreddit has literally 8x the subscriber base. Why? Because INTJs tend towards introverted activities (such as lurking on the internet by themselves) and ENTJs tend to be out doing things with others.

So I agree: While knowledge and rationality can sometimes bring someone to somewhat disheartening realizations (ignorance really is bliss, as they say), going from there to ""giving up all hope in life"" seems to point more to a chemical imbalance in the brain of that individual person (something that can affect any MBTI-type), rather than a particular feature of a given personality type.",1459469168

"anime","t5_2qh22","Hi. What movies have you seen recently? Would you recommend them?

Also, I began making recommendations for movies. Here are some you should check out:

1. [12 Angry Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/) is an American drama film that tells the story of a jury of 12 (angry) men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a boy who allegedly stabbed his father to death. One of the most interesting things about the film is that it is almost exclusively presented in one set, the jury room. Even with this restriction, the film remains compelling, intense, and inspiring so if you’re in a mood for a courtroom thriller, you should check it out.

2. [Amadeus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/) is a period drama film that gives a highly fictionalized account of the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The interplay between these two characters is masterfully presented and you can feel Salieri’s bitterness as he grows more envious of Mozart’s musical talent. If you’re not into classical music, then that’s totally fine. The movie isn’t really about classical music so you don’t need to worry about that. Really, Amadeus is a superb film that is definitely worth watching.

3. [Barton Fink](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101410/) is an American comedy drama film about a New York playwright who accepts an offer to write Hollywood movie scripts; however, he soon struggles with multiple personal dilemmas including writer’s block. The film is surprisingly surreal and there’s a deeply resonant quality about the story, especially if you’re a writer yourself. This is a Coen brothers film so you should expect their trademark humor and filmmaking style. I personally think it’s one of their best films and if you’re looking for something unsettling and complex, you should consider watching Barton Fink.

4. [Caché](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387898/) is a French psychological thriller film that follows a successful Parisian couple who are terrorized by anonymous video tapes left on their front porch. It’s better to not know too much about the story. All I can say is that if you’re looking for a perplexing and disturbing film, you should watch Caché as soon as possible. It’s one of Michael Haneke’s best films and the amount of nuances in Caché warrant multiple viewings.

5. [In the Mood for Love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118694/) is a Hong Kong romance film that focuses on two neighbors, a man and a woman, who form a strong bond after realizing their respective spouses are cheating on them with each other. It is a story of a forbidden relationship plagued by melancholia and voyeuristic implications. At the same time, it reveals the repercussions of a fantasy-fueled romance. The film is visually beautiful, emotionally moving, and skillfully crafted so if you want to watch a film that masterfully communicates its themes through images and music, you should add In the Mood for Love to your watch list.

6. [Memories of Murder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0353969/) is a South Korean crime thriller film. Two rural cops and a detective from Seoul are assigned to investigate a series of brutal murders. With each new corpse found, their methods become more desperate. Despite having a familiar setup, director Bong Joon-ho manages to provide a distinct vision of his own detective story. It’s a wonderfully shot, wonderfully acted, and wonderfully crafted film that engulfs you with its powerful narrative. If you’re a fan of the genre, you’ll most likely enjoy watching Memories of Murder.",1459469170

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Back story here:

I'm a rising senior at my high school, and with the upcoming release of the HTC Vive HMD, I pitched a VR lab idea to our computer science department.

Armed with a $2,400 budget, I built a ridiculously awesome VR rig and ordered the HTC Vive, along with a bunch of VR-oriented accessories.

Specs:

- EVGA 980ti SSC 6GB
- Intel i5 6600k
- HyperX FuryX DDR4 2133 MHz RAM
- ASUS Z170-A
- Samsung 850 EVO 256 GB SSD
- Hyper212 EVO
- NZXT Source 210 Elite

Accessories:

- Bluetooth dongle
- Bluetooth headset (low-latency, optimized for VR)
- **HTC Vive! May preorder!**
- Waterproof VR Cover
- **15 ft. by 15 ft. roomscale space!**

I'm also going to be designing multiple VR experiences personally, tailored for education, exploration, and discovery. Think utilities for dissecting and pulling apart 3D models, VR research organization (3D whiteboard with sticky notes, anyone?) 

I'd be thrilled to answer any questions you would have. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to be able to give back to my school with this fantastic VR lab.

"careeradvice","t5_2rfvj","I'm in a bit of a different situation, but I will say that you have to do what makes you happy, and there's definitely a balance between your personal life and work life that can sometimes be hard to manage.


I had a post a few weeks ago detailing my situation, but the gist is: I graduated from college last spring. My college is in a major Midwestern city, and I was able to get 3 job offers in that city, another 2 elsewhere in my state, and then 1 in California and 1 in Texas. I ultimately chose the job in Texas because the job description was the closest to what I wanted to do, there was plenty of opportunity for advancement, it was in a major city, and the pay and benefits were good. The biggest thing was that I was leaving behind my family, my friends, and my girlfriend, but I figured I would make plenty of new friends and still get to see everyone a few times a year. Fast forward a few months, and I'm totally miserable. The job was nothing like the description, I was having trouble making new friends, I was extremely homesick and miserable. I started applying to new jobs back home and never really got anywhere. I had a few interviews but never got any offers. My job has finally started to turn around and I'm doing what I came here to do. At the same time, I just got a job offer yesterday to move home. The problem is, I don't have a great gut feeling about the job, it's in the middle of nowhere about 45 minutes from my family in one direction and an hour from my girlfriend in the other, the pay is not great, and I'm finally starting to get somewhere with my current job. 


I guess I'm trying to say, I did relocate for a new job, and although the job sucked for a long time, now that it's getting better, I'm still not sure if it was the best choice for me because my personal life is still less happy than it was before. At the same time, I'm not sure if it's worth relocating for a worse job to be closer to my family and girlfriend right now rather than stick it out for a better opportunity.

Ultimately, there's no way to know exactly how you'll feel in any given situation, you just have to look at the information you have available, pay attention to your general gut feeling, and try to make the best decision you can based on a combination of those two.",1459469177

&gt; Why does Lex hate Superman?

He has a problem with authority.  We know his father was abusive.  We know he has disdain for the laws blocking his way.  We know that he actively subverts Superman and wants him dead.

But he *also* has a god complex, which ties into...

&gt; Why does Lex even want to create Doomsday?

Doomsday is the gift of fire to mankind.  Luthor sees himself as a ""Prometheus"", guiding and empowering mankind (this is hinted at during his awkward speech).  Ironically Prometheus was a deity in Greek mythology (not a ""god"", but a ""titan"", which is just an older generation of gods).

A big motif of the movie was a reversal of perceived roles.  In the Greek myth about Prometheus, the gods are the bad guys, Prometheus is the good guy giving the gift of fire to Men, and men are the good guys victimized by the gods.

In Luthor's mind, Superman was the bad guy gods wreaking unrestrained collateral destruction on mankind, Batman was man, and he was Prometheus, giving his gift of fire in the form of Doomsday to help Batman stave off the evil god Superman.

But the way the movie actually played out, Superman was Man victimized by the evil gods (Luthor).  This is evidenced by the whole bullet subplot that showed Luthor was damaging Superman's name by having people murdered in his wake.  Batman was Prometheus, and his gift of fire was the Kryptonite spear.  That spear allowed Superman to fight back against the evil gods (Doomsday being a proxy for Luthor).

All of this role reversal or role rotation theme was heavily implied in the scene in Luthor's office where he talks about flipping that painting upside down.  In each act of the movie, each character takes on a different Biblical/mythological role.",1459469179

I love tracking trends, so I weigh daily and take the average of the week as my weight. I like this because I can see that even though I may move up and down each day, ultimately I still trend down.

My biggest advice is to be consistent. Weigh yourself in the same clothes or naked. Weigh at the same time each day or same time weekly. You want a consistent weight to view. 

Spacing weighing out over a big chunk of time can definitely work. My only worry is that you may see your weight go up on the day you weigh, but you are actually still tending down.

Case in point: I was weighing one week and saw a massive spike on a Wednesday where I was 212. The week before I had been 208, what gives? I realized it was a lack of bowel movement coupled with sodium rich food making me bloated and retain ""water weight."" Although that particular day I was heavier than the week before, my weekly average was still 207, so down a pound. ",1459469179

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Grease will contaminate your brake pads and vastly reduce stopping ability.

Brake squeal is caused by two things:

As the pad wears down, the spring clip that holds it in place no longer has as much tension as when the pads are thick and new. Also, if these spring clips are not replaced from time to time, they will eventually lose some tension as well. This causes a sympathetic vibration at a high frequency that we consider squeal. You can change the clips and coat the backs of the pad with a liquid rubber type material to inhibit this process.

The second potential issue is that you have been doing a lot of light braking. This causes invisible pad transfer from the pad to the rotor, which in turn causes a vibration that we hear as a squeal. A brisk stop or two (away from traffic on a smooth flat road or parking lot) can wipe off the material. However, it will come back if you do light braking and use these pads. You can try another brand of pads or just plan to brake hard every once in a while.",1459469180

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","It is quite the other way around actually, but I'll get to that point in a second. 

I'm from Romania, where gaming is comparatively way more common as a hobby for a lot of people. A lot of us are very much into things like CS, League, Dota and MMOs. I say comparatively because now that I'm in the Netherlands I feel like a freak. There are huge differences, within Europe, in the way we perceive this hobby. 

Why? Well, Romania is way poorer and there are a lot less things to do for entertainment. We do one thing good, which is nightlife, but other than that your options for fun and hobbies are very limited. Here in the Netherlands everyone seems busy and active all the time: biking, traveling, at cafes and restaurants all day. The solution for many Romanians is escaping the boredom of mundane life through online gaming. For the Dutch (and most of the developed part of Europe), it seems like more of an excuse to be lazy and not do anything interesting during the day. I remember how we were walking around town one day with this group of European students and we passed a dark game store. One of German students quickly pointed out how ""it looks shady"" and ""it was made dark because creepy gamers enjoy that"". For this reason I'm always a bit covert about being a pretty passionate gamer, until I am comfortable with admitting it. 

Now going back to why I believe the US is more accepting. I stayed in Massachusetts for a semester last year and I could already see gaming organizations/clubs in the University I went to. It was very surprising, because I have yet to find someone as (or more) invested in gaming as me in my home uni, and I'm fairly casual nowadays. These guys in the gaming club were the hardcore squad, the real deal. I'm not sure what the causal factors are here but at least in terms of online gaming, you have the advantage of a very large player-base who all speak the same language. You are much more homogeneous than we are. Try playing League on EUNE and you will understand why I am very skeptical of meeting other players. Sure, you will typically see English or nothing at all in chat, but 50% of games will have chats in 3 different languages, each trying to out-swear the other. It's a mess. Online gaming is less enjoyable here especially when there is an important communication component, so this might be something worth considering so you can better understand why I'm doubtful about the gaming-online-dating scene.

However, I think that the payoff for forming the Roman Empire is somewhat weak. I know that the ideas were copied from the CK2 Converter, but they don't really scale with the difficulty that comes with owning all of the required provinces. In my mind, forming the Roman Empire in CK2 seemed like a relatively challenging goal, so it would make sense that the Roman Empire's ideas would have an appropriate amount of payoff when converted into EU4. 

By comparison, forming the Roman Empire in the new update is more challenging, and would take some time to accomplish, to the point where there would be little time to even complete all of the Roman ideas. To top it all off, forming it by decision changes your primary culture to Roman, meaning that you have a whole lot of unaccepted cultures within your border (which could possibly include your own).

I am a Catholic lesbian. My Catholic friends - a mixed group of married couples, priests, and nuns - don't know my orientation, which for now is for the best.

When I've volunteered with the Missionaries of Charity near me, I've hidden my grimace whenever I've seen ""Marriage is a sacrament between one man and one woman"" stenciled in curlicue lettering on a wall in their soup kitchen.

I've remained silent while listening to a group of religious sisters question how to catechize the children of LGBT couples. ""It's a changing world,"" an older sister said, shaking her head bemusedly.

I've laughed when a kindly old priest suggested that God will send me a linebacker-sized man to marry, while I inwardly hoped for a woman who will match my 5'3"" frame.

These are not bad, hateful people. They are some of the most dedicated, loving people I have ever met, who strive to live out the Acts of Mercy to the best of their ability. Their love is why I remain Catholic - it's a love that reflects God's love for his creation. 

Here's the thing (and sorry if I sound preachy): only God's love is perfect. The rest of us try our best, but our love is limited by prejudice, selfishness, and fear. However, I see signs that the Catholic Church is changing, slowly but surely, into a more tolerant faith that reflects God's unlimited love for us.

At the end of a Mass I attended a few years ago, a religious sister was invited to speak about the HIV/AIDS ministry that her religious community participates in. During her talk, she expressed hope that the Church would soon change its teachings on the LGBT community, and the parish applauded in agreement.

I recently had a conversation with my coworker, a married lesbian. She told me that she and her wife are practicing Catholics, and although they could not have a sacramental marriage, their union is still welcomed by a number of priests and parishioners.

Examples coming through:

* Smart weak characters, powerful cocky scumbag...that's about it. In general, more powerful enemies that are too smug for their own good work very well. This works the other way around too: many enemies will try to look as harmless as possible, just so the can have the upper hand on an otherwise hopeless fight.

* Weaknesses. Sure, the black dragon could insta-melt your face, but did you know that Frangdask the Gruesome is allergic to petunias? Or that Worcox the Lich would give a phylactery in order to witness a concert of the Air-Powered Band? They don't have to be comical, but everything and everybody has weak points and, especially if the party has time to prepare, it's nice to give them interesting advantages.

* Parallel Challenges. Yes, you could just kill this annoying kobold who's so cute with its puny little spear. But, if the paladin's deity catches you slaughtering another helpless creature again the paladin will lose her cool divine powers until she can redeem herself. So you now have to catch it instead, and tie it up. But damn if it's fast! And don't make it call for help, we've had our share of abominations for today!

* Common sense. Before doing this, speak with your players, and ask them if they'd like combat to make a tad more sense. For example, it'd be nigh impossible to slay a stone golem without a pickaxe or some other specialized tool. Similarly, your full-armored tank is now completely impervious to arrows, because that's how plate armor works. Stabbing a Treant would be pointless, but axing it down would work wonders; Air elementals are best fought with shovels; Devils are blinded by holy water; and so on.

But really, the best examples are those you come up with. Only you know what will fit your campaign, your players and your style.",1459469189

I know he has a history of severe anxiety and depression, as well as PTSD from his time served in the military (his enlistment ended early last year), as well as the mentioned ED and a literally obliterated testicle from the same accident (resulting in something called varicocelectomy). Although those are all quite traumatizing, they all happened within the two years before we met. As of recently? Nothing. He did mention in passing that the military (without releasing too much information, he is still involved) will be setting him up for mandatory therapy because he still shows so many extreme signs of PTSD/depression/anxiety, etc. Prior to us dating, and in the very beginning of our relationship, he was extremely depressed, underweight, had suicidal thoughts often, and couldn't sleep due to constant night terrors. These are all things that no longer effect him; he is literally hungry and eating 24/7.
 
I am sorry for such a lengthly reply, I just can't pinpoint whether or not any of these are extremely relevant to a lowered libido.

Reddit isn't good for races and deadlines because old submissions disappear from the front page. A stickied self post collecting them works ok, but requires one person to manage the list. Other users cannot easily contribute. These lists are frequently out of date and lack any feedback-based ranking of races.

We wanted to bring the open submission and voting of reddit to events.

Hey man, let me play single player offline and you won't hear any complaints from me.  Til then, I paid for the game and I like having things like clearly visible skill cooldowns and custom tooltips and larger healthbars.  I like not having to grind the same shitty bounties over and over again.  And I'm not hurting a soul doing it.

&gt; Botting isn't a positive mod. I hesitate to even call it one. And yes we should be punishing people who are clearly in breach of the rules.

It's not just botting, it's also TurboHUD, and it's the shitty policy in place keeping more mods from popping up in the first place because the market is so limited (due to it being against the rules).  That's just an argument for getting the rules changed, not for punishing people breaking a rule that's stupid in the first place.

&gt; I don't. I'd prefer if instead of banning they would lump all known botters into their own server permently. Play with other cheaters.

"warcraftlore","t5_2s5rg","&gt;Consciousness is a bit trickier but I would relate it to both the hardware effects of networked AI (changing wires or processors have permanent effects) and ~~data corruption~~.

Mmm.. I'm not sure that I can make that same connection, personally.  I agree with your data corruption statement (hence the strike), but I'm inclined to think that we really can't say for sure how the transference of power versus consciousness behaves.  Yes, we know Highkeeper Ra received at *least* a flash of memories from Aman'thul, but isn't able to tap into or access them again as far as we know.  I use him as an example because the rest of the Keepers, while having experienced that same phenomenon, dismissed it, whereas Ra did not.  Further, Highkeeper Ra didn't become unbelievably more powerful by his absorption of Aman'thul's power.  We can only come to **one** of **two** conclusions from this: a) Aman'thul had already given Highkeeper Ra a significant compliment of his power and the power we see demonstrated by Highkeeper Ra is indicative of Aman'thul's power potential and, as such, is not as unfathomable as one might have thought or b) Highkeeper Ra **did not** get a significant portion of Aman'thul's power, in which case it is unlikely that the power of Aman'thul can possibly aid us against Sargeras, whenever that fight might happen.

&gt;And I would counter this with pointing out that one cannot tap into energy beyond Azeroth without using energy from Azeroth to do so. We're talking magic here so the laws of conservation of energy be damned I guess but its much more fun to try to explain magic within the parameters of science.

I don't know that I agree with this statement either.  Not because I am not trying to confine the world of Azeroth to the laws of conservation of energy, but because I *am* trying to.

Your analysis of Warlocks being Diesel fuel is very good, and it illustrates your point well.  I am even inclined to agree that the conservation of energy must exist within the physical dimension.  To that end I won't deny your analysis on Warlocks, Shamans and Druids, Mages, or the Light, with a caveat.  That caveat is that we know that at the Universe's core, the 'Light' is what permeates the Great Dark Beyond; the absence of it is what formed the Void. (First few pages of the Chronicles book).  Tapping into the Light should be a simple thing for those who are aware of it.  Beings have been created by it -- entire existences even.  I take the Light as a parable of God, in that while we have no real reason to think it is sentient, it is what effectively created all of creation, in on some level or another.  The sun, Elune, Naa'ru, faith, etc., are all vehicles for the same thing.  I think all of those except the Naa'ru are the same as faith.  The sun and Elune, for example, are what our mortal minds use to understand our connection with the Light and thus, to wield it to the degree that we do.  For example, the Sun (Tauren Paladin light source) give them the same power as the Sunwell gives Blood Elves.  Elune is the Goddess that the Night Elves worshiped after the Well of Eternity (read: wound).  They went so far as to say that they believed that Elune rested in the Well of Eternity during the day.  I think these are all personifications of a single power; the power that ultimately is derived from the Light, but as you pointed out, is passed down in layers.  

As far as the Light / Holy being outside of the closed system, I'm inclined to think that there's just SO much of it that our tapping into it via the motivator of faith brings it to us with the perspective of it being endless.  I think it's still part of that closed system that you're outlining, just like Fel energy is.

What differs from all of the energy sources we've discussed here is that they reside in the physical universe.  But their use and effect has the *side effect* of drawing other energies into it.  I'll use Dalaran as an example.  The energy that they expended to construct Dalaran and to make it the glorious magical city also weakened the veil between the Twisting Nether and the physical dimension, thus demons came in ever increasing and powerful numbers, thus the Guardians and Council of Tirisfal.  Sure, the expense of energy was needed to weaken that veil, but the power that the demons brought with them was introduced, not transferred or changed.  

The important distinction there can be demonstrated with, say, water.  Imagine you have a cup of water.  You pour some in smaller cups and you turn some into vapor, some into ice, some different temperatures of water.  The energy you spend to make those transitions is accounted for, but the water is ultimately never removed or added, just changed.  Within the closed system, it will remain in some way.  

Now, outside of the closed system, add water.  The water you're adding is not part of the system, it's *introduced*.  It **does** take energy to add it, but the energy you're spending to add it is a finite measurement of energy that is ultimately spent within the closed system; the added water is *new*, changing the finite value from one measurable amount to a greater one.  

This is what we see happen when the various dimensions bleed into our own.  At least, as I see it.",1459469196

From has always been a very small company that catered to a very small fanbase (mostly Japanese). This has been due largely in part of poor publishing by Age-Tec and Ubisoft. Namco-Bandai gave From an opportunity that (though seems greedy) gave the small developers a chance to expand (which costs a fortune in Japan's economy).

As for the DLCs being on preorder, they are probably all half done by now. From has always been hesitant to announce DLCs, as was the case with DS1 and 2. They've got the staff to handle two games at once so they are trying to keep busy.

Whether or not its worth buying is up to your money situation. Its worth a play eventually. If anything, DS3 won't keep your attention forever. Or if you need something to do for the next 2 weeks, then there you go.",1459469202

"playrust","t5_2xks2","Having played this now for several hours, here's my constructive criticism:

The change to medical syringes is absolute dogshit.  

If you must nerf syringes due to med spamming, use a cooldown or diminishing returns.  Giving only 5 hp with a slow creep to 30 has made these items useless.  They're not even worth the inventory space anymore.  The only time you *really* need them is in a firefight, where you don't have time to wait for them to boost your health.  And in that case, you might as well use bandages, at least they stop bleeding.  And if you're not in a firefight, guess what, you still might as well use bandages, they're cheap and you can just hide in a bush and spam them.   Bandages + food make more sense, a couple pieces of bear meat or pork now give the same health benefit as one syringe, they stack in your inventory, they're cheaper since they don't require low grade or metal frags, and they fill your hunger up while healing you.  Why bother with a med syringe at all?

I understand the reasoning for this change, med tanking is a (minor, in my opinion) issue for all players, solo and grouped.  I understand your aversion to 'design by committee'.  What I don't understand is focusing your attention on things that, as far as I can tell, very few if any people have been complaining about while common complaints go unaddressed.  What I don't understand is forcing these changes which punish solo players even more.  A group of three can afford to have one guy hang back and heal.  A solo player is almost guaranteed to get destroyed now when encountering a group unless he can dodge arrows and bullets like Neo while waiting for the syringe to work. 

Yeah, I know.  Join a group.  I am in a group.  But we're not always on at the same time.  And now I might as well not even play before or after they're online because unless we play on a barren low pop, I'm going to run into larger groups when I'm solo and now you've nerfed my ability to escape.  So whats the point?  Why play at all when I'm almost guaranteed to get destroyed.  It's not fun.  It's not helping my group succeed.  It's just making resource donations to my enemies.  Might as well just log off and go play something else until my friends are online again, at least then if I'm going to get robbed my enemies will have to break through a few walls to do it.  So once again no-lifes who can play in the wee hours of the morning when nobody's online and large groups who have friends to play with get yet another advantage while the little guy gets fucked.

Not to mention the effect this is going to have on those entertaining 'clutch play' videos.  Say goodbye to 'zero to hero' vids.  That new 'plays of the week' series that kcmo is doing?  Yeah that shit is about to get real boring.  1v3+ clutch is pretty much over.  If you don't think that's important, consider that videos like that are what encouraged me to purchase the game, plays like that are what keep me playing when my friends log off.  And you just killed it.

Raid towering too... as though online raiding didn't have enough deterrents with people despawning loot.  Now if anyone's home and shooting at you, you have to be fuckin suicidal to try and jump off a raid tower.

Overall I rate this change aids/10 and hope you adjust it as soon as possible.  Until you do I think I'm going to go find something else to do.  

When your design choices are encouraging players to spend less time playing, maybe it's time to rethink them.

Thermal energy flows from high to low. So your body to the water. When you initially jump in the water the difference in energy is at its largest. You instantly perceive the water as cold because you are losing energy at the fastest rate. 

Consider the following situation:

You are in a room with a temperature of say 17 degrees celsius.  Let's say everything in the room except for you is at the room temperature of 17 C. If you put your hand on the wood table, it doesn't feel cold. You put your hand on a steel pan, It will appear to be colder than the table. But in fact they are the same temperature. The difference is the resistance of the materials. Steel has a lower resistance allowing your hand to lose more energy at a faster rate compared to the higher resistance wood.

So back to the water. As you stay in water your body's temperature will drop. The difference in temperature between your body and the water is getting smaller. The rate of change will slow down as well. The longer You stay in, the slower that rate will become. You are reaching thermal equilibrium. At this point the rate of change in energy is at its slowest.

This is where sensory adaptation comes into play. This is when your body adapts to situations and basically throws out useless, repeating sensory information. Since you are near equlibrium and the rate of change is near a constant. Your body will throw out this information and deem it useless. At this point you are 'used to' the cold water.",1459469204

I only report your threads because I see you spam them as I'm going through the new section. Even then, I only report ones that are actually spam/reposts. I liked your Illaoi thread and the discussion it actually brought. Your Cho'Gath thread was incredibly popular, and brought much needed discussion to the table. Your Kha'Zix threads are just you saying his buffs are bad, and then arguing with everybody who brings a different view.

Threads with the exact same body get removed. On top of that, you just repost the same thread, and even said at one point that that was your goal, because your threads get removed.

You want to promote discussion? Then actually promote discussion. Your body doesn't have anything to get discussion rolling. Your responses to people are almost always you arguing that everybody but you is wrong. I don't even remember the last time I saw you respond to somebody about Kha'Zix that wasn't essentially ""I'm right, you're wrong.""

I get that you want to discuss Kha'Zix, but you need something to actually discuss. Posting his champion.gg page and saying something about him doesn't leave room for discussion, which is why your Kha'Zix threads never get quality discussion. On top of that, nobody wants to comment on a thread when all the OP is doing is shutting down arguments, and seems very unopen to discussion.

So if I'm to take this at face value, the reason it's apples and oranges is because in a crime, we cannot guarantee that someone will be armed at any given time?

If we are going to exclude on that basis why wouldn't we also exclude on the basis of factors like not owning a gun or having a concealed carry permit? 

As it stands, as far as I can see we have the largest distribution of guns possible. Unrestricted access, nearly unparalleled ability to legally carry guns and yet DGU is accounting for so little. It makes no sense to assert DGU is having an impact on crime or murders.",1459469207

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;I agree, but RPers don't. They believe female promiscuity is a cause of infidelity. So promoting promiscuity is promoting infidelity, in their view (although they don't realize it, or perhaps just don't care).

Promiscuity and infidelity are correlated; this doesn't mean one directly causes the other. I would suspect that underlying psychological tendencies are to blame for both, personally. Also, many RPers wouldn't care about making women less faithful, as many of them refuse marriage and say they only want to spin plates anyways.

&gt;That's one way to end it. Another is to not reward men who are slut shamers. If virgin women (or non-virgin for that matter) refused to marry (or have sex with) men who slut shame, the double standard would end very quick.

Women contribute to slut shaming just as much as men, probably more. It wouldn't have emerged as a cultural norm if 50% of the population was wholly against it.

&gt;Something isn't good because it's natural.

Ergo there is little point in talking about what's ""natural"" or not. I'm glad we agree.

&gt;By saying this is ""natural"" I only mean to say that, if you want someone to give up some natural (and fulfilling) behavior of theirs, you'd better have a damn good reason.

I don't want to get divorced or cheated on. That is an extremely good reason for me to not date promiscuous women.

&gt;I agree it's a non-sequitur. But many men seem to reduce a woman's worth to just that. (Calling sluts ""worthless"" etc).

It actually is a defect. Let me explain...

Having a big penis size makes you more qualified to have sex with women who have had sex with many men (and thus can tolerate the size), which may increase the likelyhood of STDs.

Having a small penis size makes you more qualified to have sex with a pure, chaste, and virgin woman who is more likely to be endowed with better qualities, with small chance of STDs.

Tax withholding doesn't get tied to the individual taxpayer until the employer files their W2s with the SSA which can be as late as March of the next year. So it's not like you can call the IRS in July to find out how much they have on file for you for the year.

If an employer hired somebody who refused to provide their SSA, they would have a sophies choice. They could pay them, but could pay a fine for not having a SSN on the W2, or they could refuse to pay them until they provided it.

&gt;We've all seen the videos of the migrant crisis in Europe

Which are ridiculously blown out of proportion, and isn't half the problem it's made out to be. It *is* a problem mind you, but Trump supporters sound an *awful* lot like people in the 60s pissed off about black integration into white schools.

&gt;but there's nothing more consequential in the world right now

How many people, precisely, have been killed by Muslims in Europe since... say... 2001? Nevermind terrorism. Let's include murder in there too. Can you find me a number? No? Would you care to wager a guess?

Could it be... 5000 people? Is that too high or too low? 8000? ... 10,000? That seems like a pretty high guess, but let's say 10,000 people. You're telling me that, of **all the issues in the world**, the death of 10,000 people in Europe outweighs literally everything else?

&gt;So yeah I'd say it's pretty important.

I didn't imply it wasn't, but Trump has no realistic plan for dealing with... anything, as far as I can tell, let alone the spread of Islamism. His policy is to accept zero refugees? Can I safely assume this? Is there anything else?

Hillary, I'm sure, intends to continue Obama's policies of vetting refugees as well as possible and continue letting small numbers of them into America. This seems reasonable to me. The vast majority of refugees in Europe are peaceful people just trying to live their lives, and the issue can be solved by vetting them better, and refusing to admit those who are deemed unable or unwilling to integrate.

This is a perfectly sane policy, and one I fully expect Hillary to implement. She is not going to open the doors to refugees and there's really not a good reason to think she would.

I have no idea what Trumps' policies on this exactly are. I'm pretty sure he doesn't either. But I am going to need something a *little* better than MUSLIM IS BAD.",1459469213

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt;As a non-Japanese person myself keeping the honorifics the translations helps to convey the relationship behind. It may not be immediately clear whenever I encounter a new one, but that something that you can pick up on over time. 

You could say the same thing about *any word or phrase in the entire language*--that leaving it untranslated would help to convey the meaning better.

Except it doesn't, because the target viewer *doesn't speak Japanese*.

And no, it isn't more clear because most non-Japanese don't understand how/when to use them.  For example, the top comment on this post says: ""Sama, extra polite, for people of higher rank or customers"" but that's wrong.  -sama is used for addressees of letters/email. Also for lords such as shogun, daimyo, Darth Vader, and royalty.  Customers rarely get -sama in spoken language, only written, except in the one word お客様, or if it's like the receptionist.  It additionally has additional use in anime/literature to show obsessive fans or lovers.  So when typical person sees a letter addressed to X-sama--some usage they're not familiar with--they will think the *wrong* thing about the speaker and X just because they're not familiar with that usage!  If only there were somebody who spoke Japanese and could then interpret that Japanese language into something for people who speak English... and then they could write out that English...  we could call that person a ""translator"" and maybe he could do his damn job.

People watching translations don't speak Japanese. So maybe translators should *actually translate*, instead of relying on the audience's Japanese ability, which 99.9% of the time will be worse than the translator's!

And it's just so arbitrary and pointless and distracting to leave name suffices in.  Nobody ever wants to use any of the hundreds of first- and second- person pronouns as their each individual ones with their own meanings and nuances that convey certain aspects of the character.  Nope, amateurs just translate all of that to ""I"" and ""you"".  Nobody ever wants to leave in the however many sentence-terminating particles there are--each of which reflect some certain feeling.  If you saw some translation that was ""Ore ~~is~~ am going to put omae in ~~your~~ omae's place-yo!"" then you would probably feel that that is idiotic and needlessly complicated and that the translators should have just translated it as, ""I'm going to put you in your place!""

The kind of guy who is as attractive and successful as ""Chad"" is more likely to be well under 1% of the male population.

&gt; Well, that escalated quickly…

&gt; While I stand by my previous comment, I realize I should have been more clear. As the game director, I have final creative say over what does or does not go into the game. With this particular decision, it was an easy one to make—not just for me, but for the art team as well. We actually already have an alternate pose that we love and we feel speaks more to the character of Tracer. We weren’t entirely happy with the original pose, it was always one that we wrestled with creatively. That the pose had been called into question from an appropriateness standpoint by players in our community did help influence our decision—getting that kind of feedback is part of the reason we’re holding a closed beta test—but it wasn’t the only factor. We made the decision to go with a different pose in part because we shared some of the same concerns, but also because we wanted to create something better.

&gt; We wouldn’t do anything to sacrifice our creative vision for Overwatch, and we’re not going to remove something solely because someone may take issue with it. Our goal isn’t to water down or homogenize the world, or the diverse cast of heroes we’ve built within it. We have poured so much of our heart and souls into this game that it would be a travesty for us to do so.

&gt; We understand that not everyone will agree with our decision, and that’s okay. That’s what these kinds of public tests are for. This wasn’t pandering or caving, though. This was the right call from our perspective, and we think the game will be just as fun the next time you play it.

&gt; If it isn’t, feel free to continue sharing your concerns, thoughts, and feedback about this and other issues you may have with the game, please just keep the discussion respectful.

All this huge outcry over nothing and trying to build some false narrative about feminists and SJWs forcing Blizzard to remove it, when in reality they wanted to remove it anyway, is exactly the kind of nonsense that got Gamer Gate dismissed as a sexist movement.",1459469216

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Posting as a fan of FC united (who I don't think would be half as far as we are today without the advice AFC Wimbledon have provided and the inspiration) and also quite a bit mental floss fan.

Just a few questions wimbledon wise.

1) as a foreign fan, but someone who has been quite involved over the last few years. How do you see other fan owned UK clubs? (FCUM, wrexham etc)

2) How likely do you think the new plough lane stadium is to go ahead? (money wise, our stadium although rather grand for a 4.2k capacity cost 6.5 million)

3) How are you staying involved in wimbledon these days?",1459469219

It took me a long time to realize that social standards, even if they aren't logically defendable, still matter. It *is* different because people think it's different. It upsets people. It's that simple. 

Upsetting people is not nice, it's inarguably worse than *not* upsetting people. So if I touch my penis to someone, and compare that to touching my finger to someone, the former is worse because our culture makes it more upsetting. Is that culture logically defendable? Maybe not, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still more upsetting and therefor worse.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Well u find me the proof the this isn't A. Representative of the number of pitbull mutts that exist, B. That these are all pure bread pitbulls (which they almost never are) and C. The solution could be to punish owners to the point they would have to think about what their doing.

This isn't a breed specific issue, at most it is a breeding issue... So obvious spay and neuter, and breeding needs to be more carefully regulated. I would say all problems could be solved simply by implementing strict regulations on BREEDING. Not on individual breeds.... Don't hear much about Dalmatians anymore..but when 101 spotted assholes came out a million idiots saw dollar signs and started breeding, and a million 1 idiots bought dogs that ended up biting people and being put in shelters.

Part of the problem with BSL is that nobody can even tell what a real APBT is. For 1 they are 30-50lbs (if it's 50lbs its probably a mutt or fat), 2. There are about 20 breeds people mistake as being pitbulls, so what we are actually discussing is short haired, big headed dogs between 25-150lbs.

Lastly, they are a working dog. They are not just a house pet. Both huskies and pitbulls when bored will turn into assholes. That's how I ended up with them. My husky mutt was destroying the owners house, digging through drywall, dragging them everywhere, the pitbull was left to starve to death in a basememt, and was found a week later.

I would concede that my dogs, one being far more wokf like, and the other being far more animal aggressive require treatment specific to their nature, so I researched the breeds they most characterized, and treat them accordingly. 

Both of my dogs come to work in the woods with me, they have been in treeplanting/logging camps and saved lives by fighting bears, and they also will take out coyotes. 

Dogs aren't really pets, they are purpose built machines, and as an owner you must satisfy their drives/needs for a purpose. 
 
When Im not in the woods Im in a big city, and exercise them (running, fetching, swimming, hide/seek with toys) at least 2 hours a day. Never had a problem,

I got my face ripped apart by a beagle, I blame the owner for pretending it is not a dog bread to hunt and kill and be outside. Not the dog. 

BSL it doesn't deter people from being shit heads. And depending on which authority (kennel clubs) pitbulls are either an entire group of mutts that are in fact not a breed at all, or they are a very very specific purpose built dog with strict behavioural and physical traits, one of disqualifying features would be human aggression. If they are human aggressive and recognized as APBTs they are culled, not mass produced.

EDIT: This is in spite of bsl, and still no proof of breed.
Also where were the kids parents? This is bad journalism to say the least.

I would also say, there are more risks factors just having people existing. We wouldn't need laws if people behaved responsibly in the first place, and the people who argue in favour of BSL are typically the mist ignorant, and least responsible. BSL doesn't prevent people from having pitbulls, it prevents responsible people from owning pitbulls. 

If you ask a veterinarians, they oppose BSL, same with trainers, and people who work with these things. The consensus among people who actually deal with these dogs, blaming a particular group of dogs is not a solution.

Reading these comments it's clear that not one sensible factual argument has been made, it is just 'kill kill kill!'. But then again, the reaction to this story pretty accurately reflects the reality that people are monkeys and they act like illogical beasts. 
Breeding in general needs to be regulated period, all working dogs are now messed up inbread over fed under trained physically deformed abominations. Dogs, like other beasts of burden, have a purpose, and it's not to comfort fat people while they cry themselves to sleep.

* Safest car ever manufactured. 

* Only production vehicle on the road that had a specific focus on cyber security; sooner or later some ass is going to short Toyota (or whoever) and then a week later brick 20 million of their cars. Over the air updates should probably be mentioned here. 

* Only autopilot system worthy of that name

* 12th quickest production car of all time. The 11th car being a two seater that costs $30k more and by no stretch meets the definition of an everyday driver.

* First electric vehicle that normal people use for road trips. 

* a huge amount of usable storage space. 

* Best traction control system I've witnessed 

* Putting a large touchscreen with a great UI in lieu of the traditional button board

* Using a sales model that isn't a cultural byword for [sleazy behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pks7q2qyM-s). 

To be sure Tesla has had *plenty* of hiccups and remains behind other manufacturers in some areas like cabin luxury. The fact remains that no other automotive manufacture can today match Tesla technology. The Porsche Mission E is set for 2018-2020 and by most technical aspects is inferior to Tesla's late 2014 S.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I used to be a debt collector, so I can offer a little bit of advice dealing with them.  I would say offer 20% as a lump sum (they most likely won't take it), then say you can borrow whatever amount would bring it to 25%.  If they still won't accept that settlement, they may accept 25% up front if you commit to paying up to 40-50% of the total over the next few months.  If you go that route, you better freaking follow through on it.

I'm not saying that's the best way to go about this, but from the debt collector's point of view, that's something we would've taken at my company.  It's a last resort sort of thing, we were supposed to get as much as possible in a lump sum, but a decent up-front payment followed by monthly smaller payments was acceptable.

I'd say the hierarchy went like this:
Payment in Full --&gt; Large up-front with monthly to full payment --&gt; Lump sum at less than full amount --&gt; Smaller lump sum with monthly payments to settling amount --&gt; Monthly payments to settling amount

And whenever you do any sort of dealings with them, always say that you may be recording the call (whether you are or not, you won't be threatened with a fake pending lawsuit like my boss would do to people to get them to pay more), and demand to get something in writing sent to you in the mail before you pay.",1459469223

If you wait long enough (which isn't necessary) you'll feel pressure and eventually slight pain from the build-up of saliva. But 15 - 30 seconds should be more than sufficient.

Then open your mouth wide, lift up your tongue, and kinda tense up the muscle at the base of your tongue.

"MakingaMurderer","t5_3b2cn","&gt;The availability of a vial of Avery's blood to the Manitowoc County sheriff,s Department' indeed to the general public, can be shown smoothly and with a short, logical succession of steps. The blood was unsecured and unsealed in the Clerk of Court's office in the courthouse; the sheriff's Department has access by master key

&gt;to that clerk's office,l including the location where the blood sau and there was at the relevant time no log or other means of recording who handled the file. Indeed, at least one Manitowoc County sheriff's Department emproyee with a crucial role in
this case (and whose actions had been questioned in his deposition in Avery,s civil
case less than three weeks before Teresa Halbach disappeared) was involved in
septembet 2002 in transmitting to the Crime Laboratory some evidence from the same court file at issue now. That is Lt. James Lenk.

See what you fail to acknowledge, and this is the very empty rebuttal by people who refuse to admit even the possibility of planting in this case, is that MaM nor anyone else is stating that Lenk acquired the blood and held on to it from 2002. That is not what is proposed.

The fact that he signed the papers back then, and subsequently the blood was left out in an unsecured box for a very long period of time, where there was no proper evidence seals on the blood, which was available to Lenk should he seek to access it (which he would have known about from his interaction in 2002), that is the point that Buting made.

You are making a straw man argument, implying that because of the signature on the paper, that ""oh see, they say Lenk took the blood here"", no, that's not what is being stated. They are showing that Lenk *knew* about the blood.

And that blood, which was stated in court documents to be **under seal** was not under seal. And it does not matter if it was Avery's defence attorneys who handled it last, or Avery himself, or the pope. At the time, it was **in possession** of the clerk of courts, and in the court record it was **under seal** but in actuality, there were no seals. There was scotch tape.

Because of that, because of the fact that the evidence was left out unsecured, unsealed, in a place accessible by Lenk, who was aware of it, who had a key to it, who lied about the times he arrived on scene (the day the RAV4 was found), who volunteered to be part of the case, who volunteered to search the trailer, who was present when the key was found after multiple searches, who also showed up 4 months later when the investigation was handed over to CASO, to offer up food to the people searching the garage, who entered the crime scene 4 times in 30 minutes, who had no legitimate reason to be there but lo and behold a bullet is discovered shortly after, it's because of all these things/reasons, why his actions are under scrutiny, and the blood evidence itself is.",1459469226

"anime","t5_2qh22","Though, if you were to do a very little amount of research you'd find that Asterisk War's LN was released in Sept 2012 (manga in Jan 2013), whereas Rakudai Kishi's LN released in July 2013 (manga in April 2014)...  So to say:

&gt;[I] got pissed when I saw Asterisk War being just a shitty version of it ('it' being Rakudai Kishi)...

is incorrect, since both Asterisk's LN and Manga came out before the LN of Rakudai Kishi.  Before spouting nonsense, please check the facts first.  It's 2016, finding information is incredibly easy.

Now, saying one is a copy of the other is probably an insult to both authors of the LNs and the artists of the manga.  Art is art, if you don't like a certain piece of art then stop looking at it.

In case you have any interest in my opinion in regards to Digibro... Just look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/animegifs/comments/4bcmg9/the_idolmster_cinderella_girls/d18wpix?context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/animegifs/comments/4bcmg9/the_idolmster_cinderella_girls/d19sazf?context=3).

[TL;DR](/s ""I'm of the opinion that Digibro is an under educated moron who prances about the internet spewing nonsense"")

I'm just going to also throw in: Mind over matter.

What I mean by that, is that if you go into something (a book, movie, graphic novel, etc etc) thinking ""Oh, this is going to be so bad"" all of the negatives will pop out more.  The exact same could be said about the reverse, if you go into something thinking ""Oh man, this is going to be great!"", the positives will stand out more.

Kishi isn't perfect either, but am I prancing about the internet pointing to all of the negative points of that anime?  No, because I enjoyed Kishi for being Kishi.  Same way I enjoyed Asterisk for being Asterisk.  They both tell a story, which is fiction's general purpose.  

You're 100% free to have your opinion... However, make sure you get your facts straight... Otherwise I'll just dismiss your opinion (and you as a person) as being completely baseless and foolish.

"londonontario","t5_2rds8","I have similar concerns about living wages, but I think that if we get the living wage in exchange for the minimum wage it might be worth it.

Minimum wage, as a concept, has always had the problem of the fact that it interferes with the process of employer and employee coming to an agreement on what the employee's work is worth.  Saying that the employee's work must be worth a certain amount, companies are encouraged to cut corners to compensate.

If everyone is given enough money to survive on, and people are put in a position where they have to work for any luxuries they want, then maybe the situation will honestly improve.

But then again, a good number of the people who are poor (though obviously not all of them), are in that situation because they never learned how to manage money.  The sort of person who gets their paycheck and thinks 'I have money now!', and spends far too much of it until they can't afford groceries the next week.  That, a living wage won't fix.",1459469227

I'll give you a personal example. I used to be a junk food junkie. Ate it all day, every day. Knew it was bad for me, bad for my weight, but at the time it was hard to care. Enough to feel guilty, not enough to stop.

But slowly, I started having indigestion problems. Stomach cramps that left me in agony, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea. Until one day it got so bad I thought I was dying and went to the hospital. Didn't like the way my weight was ballooning either.

I figured out it was the junk food that was causing it. So I quit. Cold turkey. No more soda pop, or cookies, or ice cream, or chocolate cake, or potato chips or candy bars or any of that stuff.

That was some 4 months ago. Haven't had a single bit or sip of that stuff since. Lost 40 pounds since then. The indigestion and stomach pain is completely gone.

Thing was, it was *easy*. I didn't feel deprived. I didn't struggle with temptation. Every time I see junk food now, I remember writhing on the floor in blinding agony, thinking I was dying. And suddenly the temptation is gone and I don't want the stuff anymore. And I think too, now...I was a junkaholic...an addict. I've read too many stories of drug addiction and all the drama of trying to quit, and relapsing over and over again. I've already proven I can't eat ""just one bite""....one bite and my self-control disappears and I'm right back to daily binging again. No. I'm not doing that again. Now now, not ever. I don't *EVER* want to go back to the way I was--I'm much happier with the way I am now.

Do you see what happened? My mentality changed. The way I thought about junk food changed. I had zero self-discipline with junk food before. I have iron discipline with it now. I didn't associate junk food with pain before. I do now, the worst agony I have ever exprienced in my life. I'm not doing that to myself again.

I think most self-disciplined people think similarly. They won't let themselves procrastinate, because in their mind it will destroy something they care intensely about. Destroy their future, destroy their life, destroy dreams.

It's also what makes establishing new habits much easier. That emotional intensity. Or use the Tiny Habits technique. It's much easier to make permanent small changes than permanent big ones. Small changes take less willpower than big ones. Drastic changes are very hard to sustain for long--it's why most people fall off their diets. Tiny changes are a great deal easier to make permanent.

Habit plays a huge role. Good habits make a lot of things easier.",1459469230

"bourbon","t5_2rgos","**Review #62 - Ranger Creek .36 (Revisited)**

*likely &lt;1yr (9mo.?), aged in mini-barrels for speed-aging, 96 proof, looks to be ~$40 for a 375mL bottle*

Everything about this on paper just reeks of the traditional start-up distillery business plan of selling yearling juice for a crazy high price and just calling it ""craft"", or even worse  - ""artisanal"".  Which I like to pronounce as ""artie's anal"".  Poor Artie.  Unless he's into butt-stuff, and if he is, more power to him. 

 I understand that overhead is high, and income after start-up is tough to come by for new distilleries that have to wait 3-4 years for juice to come of drinking age, so I guess I'll have to accept the pricing as a necessary evil.   Ranger Creek .36 is a Texas bourbon named after some gun or something, which should (incoming stereotype, puts on helmet and bullet-proof vest) resonate with and draw interest from many Texans, so at least they're hitting an appropriate local target demographic. 

  Fortunately, I'm pro-Texas and pro-2nd Amendment, so let's *pull the trigger* on this dram - time to give it another *shot*.  It's a good thing this isn't *barrel* strength, or I'd need a *muzzle* to keep myself from drinking this at a very fast *clip*.  Gonna stick to my *guns* on this one and just hope this sample goes out with a *bang*.   

...Bullets.

----------------------------------------------------

**Color** - Surprisingly dark for a youngster.  Goes to show how much the ratio of surface area to barrel comes into play compared against traditional barrel-aging.

**Nose** - young oak, strong cherry, clove, light hit of ethanol, cereal.  The cherry is a little too heavy, but it's honestly a decent nose

**Palate** - an odd flavor I'm unable to discern on entry (overly-diluted caramel?), transitioning to cinnamon heat, cherry, wet oak

**Finish** - a little warm, cherry, coffee

**Overall** - Unique, and honestly not too shabby considering what it is.  I could see the regular-sized barrel release of this actually being pretty tasty if they give it enough time to mature (8-12 years)... but that's quite a bit down the road.   I appreciated the pour and the experience - I'll look for their products down the road and hope they're priced a little more reasonably.    On tasting this blind, I gave it an 83.. I think I'll keep it the same, if not maybe a point lower... **(82)83/100**

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","If they're super covert, or if they've trained you well, I can see how it might be hard to tell. After reading this subreddit, and specifically [this website] (http://www.daughtersofnarcissisticmothers.com/characteristics-of-narcissistic-mothers/), I realized for sure about my Nmom, though.

Here are some bulletpoints:

* Do your suspect Ns ever treat you like you were the adult and they 'just couldn't' handle things emotionally or physically? My mom used to physically cry on me when she and my dad got divorced. She'd wail and tell me how terrible her life was, and I tried to console her. As an elementary school child. This is called parentification. 

* The opposite is called infantilization and it's basically reducing you to a child/inappropriate age to keep you dependent. My mother, for example, just this month, tried to take tax forms away from me and tell me to let my stepfather do it for me. She said I was always too irresponsible to handle things ""like this."" I was doing taxes at her house, but I'm 24 and don't live with her/take money from her.

* Do your parents instantly take on others' tragedies/your tragedies and make them their own dramas? I've watched my mother get ""upset"" about people SHE DIDN'T KNOW that died. She does this in order to earn the sympathy/attention of others. I've noticed a ton of people say that their Nparent does this or something similar. 

* Do you ever try to have a mature, respectful conversation about something that happened in the past, but it backfires horribly on you because your parent believe you're criticizing them? If there's ANY indication that they made a mistake or were responsible in any way for anything bad that ever happened to you, they will shut it down so quick. 

Even if it was clearly their fault, they'll blatantly lie to protect their image. Example: My Nmother was an alcoholic throughout my teen years. She went to the hospital for example, for being so drunk that she fell into something and hurt herself badly... but she'll say she was ""low on her vitamin D levels and just unsteady"" during that time. 

She was insanely abusive during that time of my life and I actually ran away from home for 2 months, but nevermind any of that. She was just a poor, sick woman :( poor baby.

Also keep in mind that your parents may have other cluster B personality disorders, or other problems altogether that don't exactly fit with NPD, so really what you should do is just do some research on your own. Just because they don't have NPD doesn't necessarily mean they weren't crazy/abusive/toxic/etc.

If you were in a similar situation and found out one of your friends knew about it and didn't tell you, you'd be more than furious.  And hurt.

Whatever she may be plotting is of no concern of yours, so long as you tell him the story in great detail and honestly.  Once done, it's up to him to believe or disbelieve, and for him to act.

One more thing I feel is important to mention, because everyone here seems to be giving you directed advice without clarification (""Tell him NOW!"" for example).  It won't be that simple.  I would also prepare for losing her as a friend.  If she doesn't have the self-respect to tell him herself, then she won't likely see that you really didn't have a choice about telling him yourself.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Iceland was invaded and occupied by the UK (the US took over the occupation a year later) during WWII. 

With the exception of slave raids (for example, the [Turkish abduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Abductions)s), clashes between German and English fishermen with Danish administrators on Icelandic soil, and [Jørgen the Dog-Days King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B8rgen_J%C3%B8rgensen)'s temporary seizure of power in Iceland, there have not been any attempts to invade Iceland. There is no evidence of any concrete plans by Nazi-Germany to invade the island prior to the British occupation in WWII. The Nazis examined the feasibility of seizing the island from the British but found it unfeasible. There is no evidence of Soviet intentions to invade Iceland during the Cold War. There is no evidence of German intentions to invade Iceland during WWI (the British didn't think so either, which explains why they didn't invade Iceland).

Iceland had little of value for much of history. Danish kings tried at different times to sell Iceland to the Scottish King, English King and German merchants but nothing came out of these attempts. (I'm not completely familiar with this episode but I believe Sweden decided against obtaining Iceland in negotiations concluding the Napoleonic Wars). A British businessman tried to convince the British government to purchase Iceland towards the end of the 18th century (he wanted to mine the sulphur) but the government wasn't interested. Secretary of State Wiliam Seward considered purchasing both Greenland and Iceland in the 1860s. A US Senator talked openly about annexing Iceland towards the end of WWII but that was never a realistic option.

You're not sitting your Rhino because you don't care about this game / you want to pad your opponent's record because he is a friend of yours.

To continue to strain analogies: An MLB team with a deep enough bullpen might do better in a given game if they brought in a new relief pitcher every inning.  But then every one of their pitchers would be tired for the next game.  So we don't consider it bad sportsmanship if they have their pitchers throw for an extra inning to keep the bullpen fresh for tomorrow.

Sanders can be seen as a caricature of a liberal the same way that Trump is a caricature of a Republican, but the key difference is that there's a lot more daylight between Clinton and Sanders than there was between even Trump and Bush. While Trump called for a Muslim ban, Jeb! was suggesting we only allow Christians in- effectively the same policy. They both have the same health care plan of repealing Obamacare without any real plan to replace it, but Trump isn't skilled at talking around the fact that people would 'die in the streets.' They both want to ban abortion but Trump isn't wise enough to avoid the conclusion that women would be criminalized.

Sanders and Clinton share a direction but have a real difference of degree. Clinton is for improvements in the private insurance system and moderate tax increases at the top; Sanders is for large tax increases in every bracket and huge socialized health programs. Clinton is for better college loan programs, Sanders is for making it free. Sanders isn't winning and he doesn't represent the positions of the mainstream Democratic party.

Adventure, Drama, Thriller [[USA:PG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings), 2 h 10 min]  
Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, Lorraine Gary  
Director: Steven Spielberg

**IMDb rating:** [](#movieguide_stars)**&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;** **8.1**/10 (396,462 votes)

&gt; A Great White Shark decides to make the small beach resort town of Amity his private feeding grounds. This greatly frustrates the town police chief who wants to close the beaches to chase the shark away. He is thwarted in his efforts by the town's mayor who finally relents when nothing else seems to work and the chief, a scientist, and an old fisherman with revenge on his mind take to the sea to kill the beast.
(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Jaws received mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it ""a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings"". Variety's A.D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance ""absolutely magnificent"". According to The New Yorker's Pauline Kael, it was ""the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... \[with\] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, \[and\] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way"". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, ""Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days\: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark."" Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as ""an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order"" and complimented its acting and ""extraordinary technical achievements"". Rex Reed praised the ""nerve-frying"" action scenes and concluded that ""for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department"".

**Awards:**

* **1975 Academy Award** for Best Film Editing; Best Original Music Score; *Best Picture (nominated)*; Best Sound Mixing
* **1975 Golden Globe Award** for *Best Director - Motion Picture (nominated)*; *Best Motion Picture – Drama (nominated)*; Best Original Score; *Best Screenplay - Motion Picture (nominated)*

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","I like the way you approach multiple methods of activity. Frequently people ask ""how many Mormons are active."" But ""active"" is an undefined term. I liked the methods you used 

I also liked the comparisons between percentage of missionaries and percentage of seminary enrollment. If I assume the teenage members accurately reflect the activity of their household, I think those numbers help show the lines between fully-active, less-active, and non-participating members of record. 

I believe the ~35% serving missions is a rough representation of LDS households who are fully invested:  attending, tithe-paying, calling-holding members. The ~25% (60% total less 35% serving missions) enrolled in seminary but not serving missions represent the fringe membership: the NOMs, the Jack-mormons, the ""less-active."" While the 40% not enrolled in seminary likely represent households not involved in Mormonism at all, but on church records. 

I can't help but wonder if LDS corp cares if there is a decline in fringe membership activity. All the programs I was ever involved in were always aimed at boosting the core 35%, boosting tithe-payers, and boosting temple recommend holders.

There is a lot to take in on your site. Another data set I'm dying to look into is the close connection between Convert baptism rates and inactivity rates. It seems the same number are walking off the boat as are getting on every year, but the actual church records still show growth in units etc. ",1459469237
"videos","t5_2qh1e","Short answer, yes.

It's a rare old drug that few people need that is mostly anti-malarial and treats toxoplasmosis which affects mostly people with AIDS, and it was extremely cheap. 

A pharmaceutical company sold it to Shkreli for $55 million and the company priced it according to the industry standard, it was a 5000 percent hike but it only affected insurance companies.

The headline on the story was ""Guy buys drug for kids with aids and rises it price from 13 dollars to 750 dollars a pill"". That may seem like much, but only insurance companies pay that.

If you go to a hospital and ask for an aspirin pill you are going to be charged $25 dollars. The diapers for your baby are going to be $100 dollars. Are you expected to pay that? No, the insurance companies are. 

Shkreli says he did that in order to raise awareness to the drug, which is a shitty drug and since it's anti-malarial not a US problem. Whether or not that's true, who knows. But saying that he was expecting to profit from kids with aids is complete bullshit and the reason people hate him.

Having seen what this guy has to say about the medical industry, he knows his stuff and seems like a good guy. He claims that the company loses money, that they only sell 60% of the medication they produce, and give 40% for free and that no one has been left out of the medication. **The media hasn't been able to produce one person that has been affected by this price change (and trust me they have looked).**

Even if everything that the media said was true, which it isn't. It has always been an uninformed hate bandwagon. People are blaming the problems with the US medical system on him.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of supply and demand. People want to live in SoCal because of the weather, the opportunities, the culture, etc. A few people buying houses and not renting them are going to have a negligible impact on housing prices.

That's the last frame of the video before the Jhin activates the ability with a mouse click. He's aiming roughly at Riven's feet.

As /u/OddlySpecificReferen mentioned, camera perspective and height differences can make things look weird.

The most important thing to realize is that the position of your mouse cursor is the most important determinant of where the shot is going. Because of the height difference between the river and top lane, even the first-person would-be W indicator is off, as is the the indicator that other players could see.

Of course, none of that is particularly awesome. Having the game lie to you about where a skillshot is going is not a great thing. But this is about camera angles, elevation, and indicators.

When a child dies, your child dies, a HUGE piece of you dies too. I lost my God kids (while they weren't MINE I was like a stand in mother, watching them, babysitting, I spent my last penny on them). I will NEVER ""stop grieving and move on"". This is something you think about every day. Sometimes I can't stop thinking about it.  It's been 9 years and I will never ""move on."" 

I did however get help, granted it took me about 5 years to go get help. Your friend is suffering and for her this is the only way to cope. It may not be the healthiest way to cope, but to her it's dealing with it the best way she can right now. Yes she absolutely needs therapy, just ask her ""hey have you talked to someone about this, I think it may be a good idea."" Offer to go with her. Maybe reach out to other friends to see if they can help too. She needs support right now. 

Please try to see it from her point of view. 2.5 years maybe be a long time for you, but her child died. It's going to take her a long time to get out of that grief. (Again I am not saying any of this is healthy, it's not. Just please understand her grief may take a very long time to resolve.) She's not ever going to ""move on."" She can learn to cope.

It also sounds like you aren't afraid of exercise since you used to run. Did you really enjoy running or did you just kind of do it to do it? I'd say try hiking or some local mountain bike trails if you can find any. Hiking can be pretty restrictive on your location but usually you can find some mountain biking trails near you with a quick search.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;While the Soviets didn't attack until roughly the same day as Nagasaki, the Soviet invasion was decided long before Hiroshima.

While that's true, it was still the bombing which caused the Soviets to schedule it when they did. Stalin wasn't informed of the event, and only found out about it essentially when the rest of the world did, and was quite displeased with Truman for the timing of it all, unless I'm mistaken.

See for example *Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan* by Herbert Bix which goes into great detail about these events.

&gt;I know I'm taking a kind of awkward and inaccurate stance on Germany's role and alignment with Japan, but I meant it only as a what-if

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","PS Protestant ""theology"" doesn't say ""pray for forgiveness"", it says that forgiveness is a free gift that Jesus paid for on the cross. God has already made up his mind about forgiveness, I no longer have to ask for it in that sense once I have accepted and believed in Christ. That is the Gospel. It's all grace (not denying the ongoing relationship between a believer and God where ""sorry"" is a common theme - at least it is with me).

I say Protestant theology, but that's only to answer your statement. It's just straight New Testament. I don't care who says or doesn't say it beyond that. Every single mention of the topic in the NT is in the past perfect tense in the Greek i.e. it happened once, and cannot happen again - the book is closed on it. It's done. That was God's doing and we were and are excluded from it because if not we would have messed it up.

I realize how much Catholics have invested in this point due to the entirely unscriptural traditions of priesthood and confession, but it's just one of the many points on which Catholic doctrine diverges from the actual book it's meant to be based upon. There are many, many of those points - more than several of which formed the impetus for Luther's thesis' being nailed to the door at Wittenburg.",1459469245

"Mcat","t5_2saxp","In all honesty you should've started this two months ago. However there is a general setup you should follow. You'll be in crunch time however so prepare for the long haul. You're going to go through the materials a second time, possibly third. This is just the best way to do it.
  
First of all take a practice exam every week. It doesn't matter which day just choose one where you can do a time that you'll actually be taking your test. Review it the next day. When you finish a practice exam you're done for the day. Don't even think about MCAT for the rest of the day.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**Weeks 1-2:** *Content review 100%* 
You should be going through a chapter a day from each subject. Makes sure you don't just read but actively study. Take notes on things that confuse you.
  
For each chapter read you should do the end-chapter problems the next day.  
  
*Morning:* Read, read, and read.  
*Noon:* Lunch  
*Early Afternoon:* End chapter problems from previous day's chapter  
*Mid Afternoon:* Break, workout, exercise, outside.  
*Late Afternoon:* Make notecards on any concepts that gave you trouble.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
**Weeks 3-4:** *Content 50%, Practice 50%*  
By this point you should've gone through all the chapters on top of your first time through them in the course. Use practice passages from Kaplan, KA, NS, anywhere you can grab them from. Really dive into what you're getting wrong and why. Write down specifically what you tend to miss, not just content wise but specific types of questions you tend to get wrong.
  
*Morning:* Read what you need to go over. Do some practice problems  
*Noon:* Lunch  
*Early Afternoon:* Skim back through the chapters to make sure you didn't miss any minor details at this point.  
*Mid Afternoon:* Break, workout, exercise, outside.  
*Late Afternoon:* Make notecards on any concepts that gave you trouble.  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
**Weeks 5-6:** *Light content, Practice, practice, practice*  
There is really not much to say here. Should be done with your second read through if not going onto your third time through. At this point you should know the material by heart, know where your mistakes are by heart (important), know where in the chapter you need to look to stop struggling. At this point it is practicing your weaknesses to make them strong maximizing your score as much as possible. Trimming down time used on reading passages and answering questions.

There isn't much of a hard schedule I can give for this, it's up to you how to format it. I would stick to reading in the morning (the brain isn't so good at advance thought so early in the day, so says recent studies). Still you should wake yourself up with an easy passage or two, just to get in the MCAT mode.
  
Your note cards should be finished. You should know exactly which ones give you trouble and zero in on them.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
This plan is about 6-8hrs a day, not the average plan but not too horrible. I only post it here because most people I see getting 85th and above are doing something similar if not even more (yes I've seen more than 8hrs a day, it's overkill IMO). If you really focus you can get away with 6hrs of study a day.

Also, I've noticed the latest Watch update (2.2) seems to register the BPM more accurately ... before, if the plethysmograph would register half BPM or pause during reading, it now seems to stick around the same range.",1459469248

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","I agree just because a game takes a risk doesn't mean its better. And I don't expect everyone to enjoy. What irks me is that I seems like there's a lot of blind rage for the game, nobody has any respect for the game. Respect and enjoyment are not mutually exclusive for game. I have loads of respect for a game like Starcraft, but I'm really not down for real time strategy games.

Same can be said for 13, some people may not have enjoyed its level design. But I actually think there are strong merits to it! The game is at its most linear when the characters have the least amount of freedom and choice in their lives. They have to run or they will die, there's nothing else they could that would be inside rational self interest. But once they get to Pulse, where they are away from the tyranny of Cocoon, they get to truly experience freedom for once. Life outside of order and authority (Cocoon) is dangerous for them, but you can tell it is fulfilling for them due to the resolution they experience over their personal conflicts while they are there. They became more open to ideas and each other while on their journey. Once they are done exploring for a solution the level design returns to a linear pace. But this time they made the choice, and not someone else. They have mutually agreed and feel invested in a goal, to the point where it is the only thing they can focus on, just like there's only one physical to take once they are back in Cocoon.

If the dealer persists with this contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and your state's attorney general.  

Also, the CFPB [has some advice](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/831/i-bought-car-and-got-call-salesperson-who-said-i-need-come-back.html) regarding this exact situation:  

&gt; What you are describing could be a practice called a “yo-yo” scam or “spot delivery”. This happens when you drive away with the vehicle before the sale is finalized and later get told by the dealership that they couldn’t fund the loan at the agreed-upon terms. They ask you to bring back the car and renegotiate the loan for a higher interest rate. You may be entitled to legal protections in these situations.
&gt; 
&gt; You should review the contract and disclosures before agreeing to the sale and entering the loan to make sure you understand the terms of your deal. Find out if the financing and the loan rate is final before you take the car off the dealer’s lot. A dealer may require you to return the car if the sales contract states that the sale is not final, or that the sale is conditional on the dealer being able to find someone to buy your loan within a short duration of time.
&gt; 
&gt; However, if the contract did not contain a clear statement that the deal was not final or that the sale was conditional on the dealer being able to find someone to buy your loan within a short duration of time, and if you already signed all of the documents before you left with the car, you may have a right to keep it and make the payments as agreed. If you are asked to return to the dealer to discuss your financing and it was not disclosed to you that the deal was not yet final, you may file a complaint with the FTC and your state attorney general.

Edit: Offensive Ability is generally considered to be better than (Increased) Attack Speed (IAS) for the sake of crits, wherein you can multiplicatively augment your damage on each attack which in theory beats out attacking 0.3 times/sec more on average. However, this is not necessarily the case for proc-based builds, be they Nightblade/Shaman/Soldier procs or general % chance on attack procs. Builds like these benefit vastly more from stacking IAS than by trying to push into the crit range, as the likelihood of proccing both a proc and a crit on that proc is exceedingly low even for high crit chances (40%+).

Resist Reduction, however, universally multiplies all damage dealt and is usually ""permanent"" in the sense that it lasts for more than one quantum of time, letting you multiply your damage several times each time you hit an enemy. This multiplication stacks over crits and attack speed, so if you were to 'max out' resist reduction, you'd then want to move onto either crits or IAS.

"AmericanHorrorStory","t5_2spug","I watched the first season of AHS and absolutely loved it. It was cheesey, but fun and packed with every american horror cliche I could think of. It was like halloween night every episode and it was so fun to watch.


I heard most people's favorite season was Asylum, so I went into season 2 with very high hopes. It was a little all over the place. it was (generally) trying to be more serious and tense instead of being a horror cliche like the 1st season. I didnt have fun watching it, I hated that aliens were throw in. I was so glad to finish the season.

I watched season three as it aired and figured, its a fresh start, no more tried old asylum. odern day witches was such a neat idea! they were witch-bitches (still giggle at that), sassy, murderous. The plot holes were enormous and I ended up getting bored of the constant ""x is dead! wait two episodes for them to be revived!"" theme. It was good, but definitely still low quality compared to 1&amp;2

Freakshow. Not much focus, more and more characters made decisions that made no sense or very little. It felt less like a story arc and more like ""how can we make 13 episodes based on these 20 characters interacting with each other?"" Eh. Dandy was the redeeming feature for me.

Hotel....was garbage. I loved lady gaga as an actor, but almost none of the plot lines made sense. All the guys blended together (i know, I know thats the point, but I constantly forgot which handsome white guy with dark hair i was looking at) the beginning plotline of the commandments killer was brought up and then forgotten until the final episodes. Too many plotlines that would be dropped for four episodes and then revived and expect you to remember every detail. Dialogue was stupid. Evan peters, oh my god, why did they let you do that role? I still get into hysterical laughing fits watching him do a shitty andrew ryan impression with a tiny moustache. WHyyyy why why.

I guess what Im getting at, is season 1 HOOKED me. it got me bad, I wanted so much more! and every season being a new story and theme was so exciting, every season is a fresh start.So even if I hated season 2, well who even knows what season 3 will be?? you know? you always hope the next story will be better. I think people like me complain because we know this show can be so, so much better. They just lost something along the way (probably a writer or something honestly) because they clearly dont even attempt to upkeep with the quality, they just keep cranking out drama, even when it doesnt make any logical sense at all. Me personally, I dont hate on the show. I love it. I know its garbage and I love garbage, we all have guilty pleasure shows and this is mine. But season 1 was no guilty pleasure to me. my love for this show has downgraded, but I still know it became awful and objectively worse. still excited for whatever the next season has, its probably gonna be shitty but itll still be something mildly entertaining to watch. /rant",1459469258
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There's not one easy solution, or we surely wouldn't still be having these issues. Unlike some others, I think public protest is totally worthwhile because it embarrasses the department and thus forces politicians to deal with it SOMEHOW. On a personal level, you just have to not be shy about holding officers accountable for how they treat you.

* Report both positive and negative interactions you have with the police. You can do this through the department's social media or community liaison (if it's something bad to report, you probably don't want to stop at Facebook). Always be as matter-of-fact and unemotional as possible.
* Familiarize yourself with local groups that deal with police misconduct issues. If you don't know any, the local chapter of the ACLU (assuming you're in the U.S.) can point you in the right direction. Also report any negative experiences to groups like this, so they're aware.
* Always remain calm and polite with officers, for your own protection, move deliberately, and keep your hands visible. You can ask for their name and/or badge number; if it's written on something they hand you, make sure it's actually legible. They may not want to give you this info if they feel you're going to cause trouble for them, so again, be polite.

Where I live, we've had a LOT of issues with police over the last year. I wish I knew how to fix it. It just seems like the only time things get better is when the department is embarrassed about something.

For example, we had a case where a guy was attacked on a local bike path at about 6:00 pm. He walked to the closest precinct and was told that they were closed. When he insisted someone help him, they pressed him about the exact location of the crime, gleefully informed him that it was out of their jurisdiction, and dropped him off at another precinct (which was also ""closed""). The man wrote an editorial in the local paper and lo and behold, police stations are now open 24-7 again to help people that have been jumped and robbed.",1459469258

He can still spread lies about her that could harm her well-being and they would probably fight about it when the baby can hear which would harm the baby.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Here are the recommended packages to start with. (You can upgrade to a different ship later, more on that in a bit.):
The following packages give access to the alpha, including Arena Commander and the persistent universe:

 * $45 USD, contains SC on its release: [Aurora MR](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Aurora-MR-SC-Starter) or [Mustang Alpha](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Mustang-Alpha-SC-Starter)
 * $60 USD, contains SC and Sq42 on their respective releases: [Aurora MR](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Aurora-MR-Star-Citizen-Squadron-42-Combo) or [Mustang Alpha](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Mustang-Alpha-Star-Citizen-Squadron-42-Combo)

This package will give access to Arena Commander during the alpha, but not the persistent universe:

 * $45 USD, contains Sq42 on its release: [Sq42 package](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/Packages/Squadron-42-Standalone-Pledge)

Before getting into specifics, it is worth noting that the game is currently in alpha. This means that many of the features (like mining) are still being developed internally, and haven't made it to the public servers yet.

 * Jobs:  There will be various things you can do to earn a 'living' in Star Citizen, and yes, mining will be one of them. CIG is going for a system that emphasizes player skill; that is, that to be better at mining than someone else you need to understand and execute on the actual mechanics better, rather than just performing it X% faster due to an attribute/skill tree. Here is a link to [more information on mining](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14522-Star-Citizen-Careers-Mining).

 * Once the game is released, ships will no longer be sold for real world currency, instead being only available for in game currency. (There will likely be a transition period as they phase the former out and the latter in during beta, but we'll know more when we're closer.) Currently, ships are 'sold' as rewards to those backing the game at this stage in development. So 'yes', ships are currently 'expensive', but you will be able to obtain all of these ships in game with only in game currency.

 * I linked a few packages above, so I'll explain the differences. Squadron 42 and Star Citizen are two separate games. Sq42 is a fully fledged single player campaign, we've been given the estimate of 20+ hours without doing optional content. It will contain many of the mechanics of SC, but won't have you go too in depth on the more 'civilian' aspects such as mining (assuming it touches on them at all). The Sq42 included in the package is 'episode one' - the first game in a trilogy (they likely used 'episode' being Star Wars nerds like many of us; each 'episode' is a full game, just like A New Hope is a full movie). Star Citizen is the MMO universe that I'm sure you've heard a lot about. Sq42 is due out sometime this year, with SC roughly expected late 2017 or 2018.

 * You can upgrade the ship within a package at a later point if you wish to by paying the difference, so you aren't missing out by picking up a cheaper package. You can also melt a package down into store credit, but the upgrade method is more cost efficient if the price of packages goes up after you purchased it. (They had one price increase this February; Sq42 used to be tacked on for free, and now it's a $15 additional cost.)",1459469259

Start screen was still a black screen but I was able to press buttons blindly and load my previous game save. [Nobody has skin or faces](http://imgur.com/yfO7Gk0). It's a start though. :)

Here's the settings I used to get it running:

**Graphics**

* Backend: Vulkan or OpenGL (seemingly no difference)
* Skip buffer effects (it varies between overbloomed and black screen with buffer effects on)
* Simulate block transfer effects - on

--------

* frameskipping - off
* prevent fps from exceeding 60 fps - on
* alternative speed - unlimited

---------

postprocessing shader - off

-------

* rendering resolution - 2x
* display resolution - native
* mipmapping - on
* hardware transform - on
* software skinning - on
* vertex cache - on

(That's it for graphics settings, none of the rest of the settings or speed hacks seem to make a difference)

**System**

Changing any of these settings didn't seem to make a difference either.",1459469260

&gt; WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama joined with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday to present a united front over what he called &amp;quot;Provocations&amp;quot; committed by North Korea in its recent nuclear and missile tests.

&gt; The United States has sought to encourage improved ties between Seoul and Japan, its two biggest allies in Asia, given worries not only about North Korea but also an increasingly assertive China.

&gt; The expanded U.N. sanctions aimed at starving North Korea of funds for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs were approved in a unanimous Security Council vote on a resolution drafted by the United States and China.

To be taking a simple (albeit weird) issue this far would indicate to me that you already had an issue with anxiety, which is leading you to catastrophize this situation. Emotional damages are generally reserved for cases in which someone is a victim of a violent crime, for example, or watches their child die because of gross negligence on the part of a third party, or maybe their train hadn't been inspected in a year and it derailed, and that person has diagnosed post-traumatic stress with monetary damages in the form of therapy, lost wages, lost tuition if they were in school, etc that can be recouped in some way by a settlement. Being preemptively hysterical does not fit the definition of emotional damages. ",1459469262

Start the game, and our jungle Master Yi did not connect into the game. The first blood went to the enemy Nasus, and this was at the 5 minutes mark. Since we had no jungler, our lane was pressured a lot by the enemy jungler and we lost lane. Top had to come mid for teamfights while the enemy Nasus free farmed. 15 minutes in Yi connects, and by that time nasus has around 300-ish stacks. Yi said ""don't worry give me 20 minutes to get sated and get some items, and then we win"". 40 minutes in, we were losing terribly. Nasus had close to 600 stacks, anybody on our team except the tank would get two shot by Nasus, and we had to devote all our resources on him to make sure our ADC survived, while the rest of the enemy team trampled us. i was so tempted to type /surrender in the chat to get a surrender vote, but I stopped and realized we have a farmed Yi. I didn't ask how or why, even with the 15 minute long disconnect. All they need to do is make one mistake and the game is our, and lo and behold it happened. The Nasus was split pushing our top inhibitor while the rest of the enemy team was pushing mid. As soon was we realized Nasus was not with them, Yi jumped in while I did everything I could to keep him alive, while our adc and tank did all they could, and we won without a single death on our side. The Nasus came too late and was killed as well, and from there we took two towers, one inhibitor, both the nexus towers and won.

I've made some furniture for myself, and for friends and family, that I wouldn't have been able to do without it. It is so cool to have a tool (the bench) that has been the birthplace of so many cool things, using just my brain and my hands.

If you are doing it by hand, even better - you can do a few chisel smacks at a time. I once kept getting interrupted doing a 10' long rip with a dull saw - it took me three days. The beauty was I just left the saw in the cut, and took a few swipes when I could. Obviously that's not efficient, but it is infinitely more efficient than not doing any work.

The great thing about many immigrants, especially those from the middle-eastern area is that they used to have jobs, and many got a quite good education. For example my dentist is from the middle east and the need for new housing in Sweden could use immigrant workers to build houses (they actually have houses they had to build in the middle-east too).

We also have a lot of jobs within our welfare that desperatly needs to be filled, nurses for example. Which, we've suddenly got many more of, we're just waiting for them to learn Swedish on a good enough level. So in the long term these immigrants will probably bring our society a profit.

Yeah I know, I watched the video. I also noticed you said it's a ""fact"" that they hate us for poltical reasons, so you seem to be totally ignorant of history and the *fact* that Jihadists started attacking the United States when the country was only a few years old. It's you who can't handle different opinions, you literally thought I didn't understand what was going on in the video, because obviously anybody who could follow the conversation with agree completely with you, the *genius*.

So, I'll say it again, trying to push the idea that the Jihadists have legitimate political gripes, and the USA is the true warmonger makes you a Jihadist sympathizer.

The south end is a bit of an older area, but safe and desirable. Lots of parks nearby. There's a new development called Harbour Landing in the south west. Bus service there isn't great thete yet, but they are waaaay overbuilt on condos, so if you're looking to rent something new but affordable, that's a good bet.

It grows logarithmically as the number of hits.

The exact formula for longest expected streak if you're interested is l = log(n*(1-p))/log(1/p) (where p is the probability of the event, 50% in the case of PA evasion).",1459469269

And that's aside from the intangible value HBO gets from having the biggest show on TV, the boost to everything else they show, and the reputation.

&gt; ISTANBUL The Turkish military said on Thursday it had launched legal action against unspecified media outlets over reports it said were damaging morale, as Turkey faces an almost unprecedented combination of national security threats.

&gt; Turkey&amp;#039;s military has a long history of intervening in politics, pressuring an Islamist-led government out of power as recently as 1997.

&gt; &amp;quot;News and commentaries in some media organs without any foundation naturally influence the morale and motivation of our heroic comrades-in-arms negatively and make all our members uncomfortable,&amp;quot; the military said, without giving further specifics.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; Consider that during the Civil War, some 15,000 miles of telegraph wire were laid for strictly military purposes. After the war ended, do you think they took all that down?

They better not have. After all, it was the people that paid for it -- with their lives *and* money! 

Just think what could have been accomplished had those resources been returned to the hands of the people (many more of whom would be alive) instead of being confiscated and placed in the bungling hands of government! One must always consider the counterfactual, that is, what might have been, not just what was.

&gt; Airplanes weren't widely used until WWI, where they were tested and developed extensively, setting the stage for them to be widely used for commercial practices.

I guess they never would have been developed were it not for WWI, huh? 

If airplanes were a profitable venture, they would have been financed and developed. What makes you think WWI was necessary for this?

&gt; GPS was invented specifically for the military to use during the Cold War.

And made profitable for consumer purposes by private business.

&gt; If technology can be used for war, than governments will pour resources into their development and application. Sometimes this technology and its benefits can reach the population at large and radically change the way we live.

This seems like a rather circuitous route. Why does war have to be a part of this? If a technology has properties that can be used in profitable ventures and capital markets are working properly, then government isn't necessary to finance anything and in fact society will have the resources necessary to develop it more efficiently.

&gt; If a job provides an individual with money, how is it useless or different than any other job that doesn't directly benefit the community?

It isn't, that's what I said: ""the government might as well just give money away."" But name a job in the private sector that doesn't directly benefit the community.",1459469276

He said that most parents in the community let their kids start Rumspringa when they're 16, but his parents didn't let him until he was 17.  If there was a get together ""a crowd"", like a party, he'd be allowed to go.  Sometimes there would be dancing, people would play games.  He wasn't Old Order Amish (there are lots of different Mennonite sects) but he had it in his head that there was more than one way to be righteous/a Christian, not just driving in a horse and buggy.

&gt; ISTANBUL The Turkish military said on Thursday it had launched legal action against unspecified media outlets over reports it said were damaging morale, as Turkey faces an almost unprecedented combination of national security threats.

&gt; Turkey&amp;#039;s military has a long history of intervening in politics, pressuring an Islamist-led government out of power as recently as 1997.

&gt; &amp;quot;News and commentaries in some media organs without any foundation naturally influence the morale and motivation of our heroic comrades-in-arms negatively and make all our members uncomfortable,&amp;quot; the military said, without giving further specifics.

I agree that static linking creates a derived work. I don't think it is clear that dynamic linking does. It seems analogous to hyperlinking to somebody else's website, or even linking to somebody else's JavaScript and using it in your own page. 

I don't disagree that it is a huge loophole. That doesn't make it illegal even if some would prefer that it was.

And just like with the FZ, if there was any design flaw it was the low operating time.  Otherwise Mudrock got the best of every world in a gravity environment.  

Agar lost to Zeon special forces because... well no shame really, they're Zeon special forces.  Fenrir Corps pulls off all kinds of ridiculous stuff in that game.  To get back to Droolcua's point, it's quite silly that the Federation blamed the Mudrock's defeat as a failure in design.  Agar simply got beat.

*****
&gt; China&amp;#039;s biggest listed steelmaker has said it expects to increase output by 20% in 2016, underlining the problems facing the British steel industry amid a global glut of supply.

&gt; Even as China steps up efforts to slash its bloated steel making capacity amid a rise in anti-dumping complaints, Baosteel said it produced 22.6m tonnes of crude steel in 2015 and is likely to produce 27.1m tonnes this year.

&gt; Total steel capacity in China is estimated at around 1.2bn tonnes and is expected to further increase this year, according to the China Iron and Steel Association.

There are a lot of things that negatively affect comp% that don't mean a QB was inaccurate. If all he wanted was a list of Comp%, I'm sure he knows where to find it.

For example, Brandon Weeden is legit an extremely accurate passer. When Jerry praised his throws, he wasn't wrong. The problem is, he's terrible at reading a defense and throwing to where a receiver *will* be rather than where is is. I definitely would not and am not putting his name forth in this thread though.

The context of the interview was not at all a praise of communism or Castro. I wouldn't even say it was a relativism argument, more than it was a criticism of American foreign policy in Latin America and the Reagan administration.

I am not claiming a conspiracy, but for the Clinton campaign to suggest it was and for Univision/CNN to run with it is frankly disingenuous. 

She did the same thing with Obama, coyly through surrogates suggesting he was a Muslim. 

And CNN hounded Sanders about it, with Cooper after the debate asking him four times in an interview and, if I remember correctly, the post debate continuing to show the video.

It is a moot point, because Florida voted, and both Clinton and CNN dropped the story. If it was such a big deal, wouldn't they still be talking about it? 

No. It was a fabrication designed for a particular news cycle targeting a particular audience.

Yes. Because he is a fantasy character.

Says who? The Bible? The Romans crucified criminals, we have basically no idea what he was actually doing.

I have no reason to give him credit for anything. As far as I know he was just a discontented rabble-rouser.  A man named Jesus (or was transformed over time and translation to Jesus) might have been crucified, but the story and the character are fantasy.

You need to let go of your faith-distorted bias here, it is making you illogical and unreasonable.

As a purely aesthetic final touch, I replaced the rod tips with RC antenna caps.

I've also cut off the extra length from the cup-mounting gimbals below the mounting pins to allow the cups a little bit of extra inward tilting room. (the current ""mushroom"" cup design restricts cup tilting compared to the old straight-sided cups)

&gt; China&amp;#039;s biggest listed steelmaker has said it expects to increase output by 20% in 2016, underlining the problems facing the British steel industry amid a global glut of supply.

&gt; Even as China steps up efforts to slash its bloated steel making capacity amid a rise in anti-dumping complaints, Baosteel said it produced 22.6m tonnes of crude steel in 2015 and is likely to produce 27.1m tonnes this year.

&gt; Total steel capacity in China is estimated at around 1.2bn tonnes and is expected to further increase this year, according to the China Iron and Steel Association.

* From the images, the map looks too cramped to be particularly fun. The reason why Junction is arguably the worst map in the game is that everything is so cramped; Demos and Engies are way too effective at shutting down the enemy team and Scout and Soldier aren't very fun to play. As for size, the only small map I've ever played was Byre, and I didn't enjoy it, but it worked for its game mode. You're welcome to see how well a small map can work outside of Arena.

* I recommend avoiding giving much thought at all to ""ninjaneering spots"" when designing a map, since I'd guess that 99% of games involve no ninjaneers. Plus, successful ninjaneering as I know it results in the enemy team getting spawn-camped, so I'm not sure why you would want to design a spot for that sort of thing in mind in a well-balanced map. Regardless, as a general rule, try to design a map with solid cross-class gameplay in mind, and add in fun nooks and crannies when it's more developed; it's what was done with Highpass. ",1459469291

As soon as a payment is made, even so much as a penny, the SOL for both collections and reporting to credit reports restarts.  This is why zombie debt collectors push so hard to get ANY sort of payment out for an old debt.  The moment any payment is made, they can not only slap it on their credit report, but can sue them for the balance + interest.  This is also why they are so quick to back down when a debtor pushes back.

The key to stopping it for good is the FOAD letter, specifically stating that selling or transferring the debt to another agency will be considered a Continued Collection Action and thus subject to statuatory FDCPA penalties for continued collection action on a disputed/time barred debt.  They only paid pennies on the dollar for that particular debt as part of a package of hundreds or thousands of other debts, so it is a better business practice for them to write off that single debt than pay out thousands in statutory damages to a single armchair lawyer.

Usually, people (whose comment histories strangely are defending police abuse, white supremacy, and how guns saved them) say they know better than MacArthur and Eisenhower and that nuclear bombs were necessary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary
&gt;
&gt;Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,[99][100] Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.
&gt;
&gt;""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan."" Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.[91]
&gt;
&gt;""The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children."" Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman.[101]
&gt;
&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years:
&gt;
&gt;In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.[98]",1459469296

This is why, so many, many times have I read articles/cases with the boys own Mother stating at some point she doesn't want the female offender to face jail time and agrees to the plea deal for probation. That attitude is what fosters opinions and comments like you see within news articles like this. If your own Mother might not take the assault seriously, can we really expect anyone else to? or just as worse, imagine it's currently happening to you, and then it's mentioned in a joke or perhaps portayed on television (Saturday Night Live) and you hear your family laughing about it.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","It was real complicated, but essentially resolves down to the reality that National were fucked. 

National were generally moribund. They'd had to pull back from all their crazy shit from their first term, and were busy undoing some of their stupider reforms, like the whole [Crown Health Enterprises debacle.]( http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/parl-support/research-papers/00PLSocRP09031/new-zealand-health-system-reforms) They were unpopular before the 1996 election, [did badly in that]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_general_election,_1996), had cobbled together a coalition with Winston Peters which was wildly unpopular, and persisted in a loathed and misguided privatisation programme. 

The National Party itself was antagonistic to the Winston Peters deal, and many inside the party blamed the deal for their appalling poll results. (The reality was that the government was incompetent and New Zealand voters were deeply antagonistic to their policies. If Labour hadn’t been a dire rabble in 1993, they would have easily ousted National.) [Shipley led a coup against Bolger which she justified with that fiction.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_National_Government_of_New_Zealand#The_National-New_Zealand_First_Coalition) 

The aftermath was awesome, really stunning. 

New Zealand First imploded. Peters walked from the coalition government, but eight of his NZF MPs stayed as Independents. These were political hacks of the worst order, led by the execrable Tau Henare. (Five of these later formed [Mauri Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauri_Pacific), a political party that went nowhere.) Because of ructions in the opposition, they were joined by Alamein Kopu, who defected from the Alliance and helped prop up the National government. 

National did not regain support after Jenny Shipley took over. Voters hated her, disliked her coup, hated National’s policies and generally wanted a change. So National+ACT got decimated in the 1999 election. New Zealand First lost half its vote. Mauri Pacific vanished. (Tau Henare later returned for the National party.)

EDIT: I love writing about this stuff. It was such a spectacularly chaotic time, with the Alliance (&amp; New Labour &amp; the Greens), ACT and United Future doing all sorts of crazy shit.",1459469300

* **CPU:**  [Source](http://www.ocaholic.ch/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=3942&amp;page=4)  
I went for a locked CPU (non overclockable). This hardly affects performance compared to the unlocked and more expensive i5-6600K. As you can see in the source. 
* **CPU cooler:** [Review](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/CRYORIG/C7/7.html)  
Went for a cooler with a fan on it, this is not even required. You could technically remove the fan, but I would advise to keep it on.  
You're not going to hear it much or at all, I can promise you that. As you can read and see in the graphs, it's very silent.  
It's also super easy to install, which is always nice. 
* **Motherboard:** Just a cheaper version, performance does not matter at all! B150 chipset instead of Z170. The only real difference is overclockability on the Z170 is missing on the B150. Which you don't need, so there.  
* **Storage:** Kept the SSD but had to change the HDD to a 2,5"" drive because of the case selection. My case does not offer a 3,5"" HDD slot. Since it's really tiny! 
* **GPU:** [Review (written)](http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/7246/evga-geforce-gtx-980-ti-superclocked-acx-2-video-card-review/index.html) &amp; [Review (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEOUUkGR9KE)
There is always a debate about which GPU is the most silent. Since just a pure DB reading won't tell you the whole story. I decided to go for the GTX980Ti from EVGA.   
This GPU (including almost every other GTX980Ti) does not let the fans spin, until you start to push the GPU. Meaning that you even play games like LoL without the GPU fans spinning!  
* **Case:** [Review (written)](http://www.eteknix.com/silverstone-milo-sst-ml08b-mini-itx-gaming-chassis-review/) &amp; [Review (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJHGVIZw9vs)  
This case is probably the most amazing small form factor case you can get on the market right now. There are a couple other small variations of this case, including this ML08B (written review). It's practically the same case on the side, as seen in the video review.   
It's absolutely not the most easiest case to work with, because of the tight amount of space that you've got, but given that there is not a lot of space. SilverStone designed this case very very well. You can still fit a good amount of storage into it and even a large GPU without sacrificing the cooling.  
Also, SilverStone provide you with the best manuals in the PC hardware industry, so absolutely make use of this and you're going to be able to build a very sweet, small, silent PC!

I haven't had my Liver Function looked at, at all. Ever. Should I attempt to get my GP to comply? In England, you have to work hard for all tests!

"CoDCompetitive","t5_2tvg8","H2K and Liquid are the only two teams in relegation who placed Top 4 (and top 8 for that matter) at the ONLY event we've had so far. So what happens? They play each other at relegation and only one of them gets in because it's single elimination. Single elimination for a tourney that determines a salary for players... even though it's a shitty salary from what I've heard.

And then we have the online qualifiers. KingPapey, a team that forms one week before the online qualifier gets Top 4 and then forfeits their upcoming match so they could play an ""easier"" team. So what happens then? They get rewarded by getting a golden ticket into the League because they didn't want to play an online match that determined seeding. Instead of being punished, they're being rewarded.

And some of you are saying ""tK should have played with a sub for those 6 matches."" How the actual **** do you expect a team who is going 2-10 in the League with 10 remaining matches to play with a substitute player for 6 of those 10 remaining matches when they're already struggling to get into the Top 8? 

This is easily the best Call of Duty game we've had since Black Ops 2 and this is the kind of support we get. Single elimination tourneys, not allowing substitutes unless you abide by the STUPIDEST rule we've ever seen, and promises made to players that then never see the light of day.

You mean this? I'll break it down for you one more time. If Schaub says that everyone in his family looks white, it means that his mother has a fair complexion and looks white. So that means his mother wasn't an immigrant, she was born in England.

It is highly unlikely that one of her mother's parents was an immigrant to the UK or had a very dark complexion. If it had been the case, why would his mother have kept it a secret from the family? I'm sure that they have talked about Big Brown's skin color in the family several times. Why wouldn't she just say, ""My daddy had dark skin, because his parents were from India.""?

So if the dark complexion came from his mother's side, it would have to come from one of her parents, who must have been born in the 1930s. That's why the 1950s are irrelevant. Yes, it's theoretically possible that one of Schaub's grand parents from England had a dark complexion, but it's highly unlikely. Btw, I never said it was impossible, I wrote that ""there's probably no African blood there.""

Just admit that you've had a knee jerk reaction to ""his mother is white becasue she's from England"" and that your response was nonsense. Btw, I love being schooled on the fact that England isn't purely white by someone who has probably never been to the UK. I've been to England several times over the past 23 years and I've been to neighborhoods where white people are in a minority, so you know where you can stick your wiseass ""not everyone from England is white"" comments.",1459469305

I feel like the risk is not worth the reward, although some would say other wise. 

From what I remember, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82p3kXuWz8w this video should go over what you do level 1.

You tend to execute as soon as someone comes for you, unless you think you can ghost away. Executing doesnt have any real negatives, so dont be afraid to run into tower if you have to. 

With the new season, I think you are supposed to get about 2 and a half waves, as by that point you should be low and the enemy jungler will be coming for you.

&gt; I never break contact with anyone and always follow up with people. So I am just more aware of being betrayed and disloyalty and/or just abandonment. But even with those people I follow up with, they never out of the blue contact me first sometimes, which again makes me think of how disloyal or socially oblivious they are.

Same experience here.  Being the person who follows up with people just makes them lazy.  And when you stop, they don't pick up the slack even a tiny bit.

Chances are most of these people have nothing going on in their lives, because (thanks to personal bias) most people don't realise how fucking lame they're being.  They count the cost of asking friends to go out much much higher than the cost of being asked to go out.  So most people end up doing nothing with their lives socially.

I got bored of it in the end and just stopped making things happen for other people.  Most turned out to be BP losers who viewed male friendship as a means to pass time until they found The Love Of Their Life.

I regard primates like chimanzees as having moral personhood comparable to humans of similar intelligence. I think that our laws regarding how we treat primates, and other similarly intelligent animals, should be *different,* but that doesn't mean I think they should be the *same* as the ones that govern our treatment of humans, because the interactions between humans and other primates are very different from the interactions between humans and other humans, many of the laws would be misapplied, and besides which I don't endorse all the laws governing interactions between humans anyway.

Much of the rhetoric around child support involves shaming men, and the primary reason for delinquency is inability to pay. If child support payments were socialized, it's likely that fewer children would go without adequate financial support. But socialized child support would be a really hard sell politically, and I think it would be foolish to conclude that people who endorse making parents who're not involved in raising their offspring responsible for child support payments don't *really* care about children, and just care about shaming men.

I see people complain so much about how they don't feel represented by either party. Which in turn would call for another party to rise up. But nobody's gonna ""waste"" their vote on a party they don't consider a serious contender. And that lack of trust in actual change is (in parts) fostered by the implication that Democrats and Republicans are constitutional entities.


Another factor that's completly unrelated to all of this: having parties choose their candidates also eliminates the option of people spending their way to the nomination. The parties later also pay for the campaign; after the election each party above a certain (very small) percentage receives ""campaign aid"" in order to reduce the risk of running a campaign in the first place.

*****
&gt; LONDON- GlaxoSmithKline PLC said it would stop seeking patents for its drugs in low-income countries, a move the drugmaker said could help the world&amp;#039;s poorest people access copycat versions of its medicines at affordable prices.

&gt; In so-called lower-middle-income countries, a group of 51 nations that includes Vietnam, Cameroon and Sri Lanka, it said it would file patents but aim to grant licenses to generic manufacturers to supply low-cost versions of its drugs in those markets in return for a small royalty.

&gt; Glaxo previously filed patents in most lower-middle-income countries, and in low-income nations where a patent office exists.

"Metal","t5_2qhud","If I were you, I'd look into a lot of power metal and thrash metal. Power metal tends to have pretty decent production quality. Thrash because you like Metallica. Start with Megadeth first and then move throughout the big 4 of thrash. So then to Slayer and Anthrax.

I would really recommend looking at sludge and doom metal, not because they are well mastered, but because they play with the mix in ways that are technically ""wrong"" for pop, but work wonders for other genres of music. It can eb an eye opening experience. 

If mix is important to you, then stick away from Black Metal wholesale for a while.

If you want anything intricate, it would behoove you to get into some prog metal. Stuff like Ayron, Ne Obliviscaris, Obscura, and maybe later Tool (might be controversial to say here, but I don't care) for well produced prog metal. That should give you a wide swath of variety in prog metal.

I'd also recommend Heavy Metal. Recently, there was Ghost's album which was very well mixed, and is arguably some of their best work.

But when you look at older stuff, you'll notice the mix was a certain way. Many times more ""lively"" since it wasn't over produced. For an example of older stuff that's in line with what I've recommended, try the classic Black Sabbath albums, for example. A lot of newer stuff is ""overproduced"" as many people put it, and can take the life out of things. Black Sabbath is traditional doom, by the way, if you want more.

Sludge is an offshoot of doom, and if you want something both sludgey and proggy, try Baroness. Or Mastodon. I would say for Mastodon, try Blood Mountain and work backwards to see the variety they *use to have*

Spoiler, they don't anymore, in my opinion.

Other people have posted good resources for you. I hope I was able to hopefully guide you in directions that help you find more music you like!

I would really recommend getting into melodeath, by the way. It's a nice transition from thrash into death metal, which if you are looking for quality riffs, solos, and intricacy, you will find yourself here probably sooner than you expect.",1459469314

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","It has been mentioned before that the Kinkou's idea of ""Balance"" has never been that of peace, but of equality of everything: Order and Chaos must exist in equal parts. So while the idea that they would create a war of some kind to create Chaos has some merit, I don't think they rely on Ionia for upholding peace and would create Order on their own terms.

Alongside this, Ionia (at least of the time of Jhin's release) is no longer the peaceful nation it normally was:

&gt; Outside the prison, Ionia fell into turmoil as the Noxian empire’s invasion led to political instability. War awoke the tranquil nation’s appetite for bloodshed. ***The peace and balance Kusho had famously fought to protect*** was shattered from within as dark hearts rose in power and secret alliances competed for influence. Desperate to counter the power of the ninja and Wuju swordsmen, a cabal within the ruling council conspired to secretly free Jhin and turn him into a weapon of terror. -Jhin's Bio I, eighth paragraph

So not only was the peaceful nature of Ionia something Kusho supported, at least publicly, parts of Ionia seem to be secretly fighting for political influence, and using Jhin as a cover for both terror and to occupy the Kinkou and the Wuju, the two orders meant to, in some way, keep peace. Assuming that Ionia is also still experiencing the Noxian invasion (since we have the lore rework and even then, Riot is somewhat vague about their timelines) Jhin could also be used to be creating unrest in other nations, since in his bio he is to go to Zaun, for personal or for the Council is unknown.

Moving onto Shen and Zed themselves, they both seem to have a different view than Kusho, and Kusho's methods are implied to have been weak by Zed:

&gt; “Your path’s closer to mine. Your father’s ideals were a weakness. Ionia could no longer afford them,” Zed said. He leaned back in his chair, keeping himself just outside of the range Shen would need to strike a killing blow. “I know that’s not something I can make you understand. But I will offer you a chance for vengeance.” -Jhin's Bio III, tenth paragraph

&gt; “Your father’s greatest victory. And now, again, his foolish mercy has tarnished his legacy.” Zed shook his head. -Jhin's Bio III, fourteenth paragraph

Considering Shen's latest updated lore, where he protects innocents no mater what nation they are from, and does not discriminate from demons or humans, Shen's idea of ""Balance"" seems to be different than Kusho's. Where as Kusho gave mercy, and seems to have it come back to bite him in the rear, Shen is willing to kill. Zed seems to take a more extreme approach to those he views as threats to Ionia's peace. 

I personally can't think of what actually happened when Zed spoke privately to his master, but I agree it was most likely an arguement of ideals. ",1459469315

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It wasn't some major drama or anything. Her dad told her to help her mom clean up, I said don't worry about it I'm happy to do it since she was home from college and hadn't had a chance to catch up with them yet. 

Her parents both said something to the effect of cleaning is women's work, I said that might be but with my girlfriend and I it's team work. Words were said in Farsi* and my girl gave me a look that at the time I thought meant she was pissed at *me*, they then said something to her in Turkish and she basically demanded that if they were going to talk about me they should say it in English. At this point I imagine my face was a cross between abject terror and the awkward situation seal

Essentially her dad said I was being disrespectful to him since she's his daughter and it's his house and if I was going to be ""friends"" with his daughter** I'd better respect his right to order her around (paraphrasing) and just generally infantalize her. 

I said I appreciated the fact that it was his home and his daughter but that she's an adult and my girlfriend and my equal and while he may treat her or speak to her a certain way I refused to. 

Things got loud and in Turkish very quickly though I later learned it wasn't nearly as heated or angry as I'd thought, I can't say for any Azerbaijanis or Iranians beyond her family and family friends but loud was just how they'd did things (especially about sports which living in Chicago was pretty expected). 

Anyway much outrage was had, Tala grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the car and I was like ""well shit I'm not gonna get to see her naked for a long time am i?"" in my head but after we got on the highway and she slowed the car to the point that I wasn't fearing for my life she said ""i fucking love you"". Which was actually the first time either of us said the L word to the other. 

And just to clarify her parents were generally great people and eventually grew pretty fond of me. Her dad is crazy smart and earned a PhD on 2 different continents. And her mom, despite being the most terrifying 4'11"" woman on earth, is a wonderfully warm person and an amazing cook. 

Really more than anything else they had gone into the dinner *wanting* to dislike me because they wanted her to marry a Muslim preferably from either of their home countries and were rather hoping to have at least some say in the selection. 

She was their oldest and eventually they got over that part, and her mom actually later told me she really liked that I wasn't afraid to stick up for her like that. Her mom always had an easier time with the whole cultural relativism thing and after talking to Tala about it on the phone basically acknowledged that to me *they* were the disrespectful ones and liked that she was dating someone who'd ""protect her"" (which still kind of missed the point but oh well).

I don't think her dad ever actually liked me though. Which might have been part of my appeal for her honestly. 



*i always found it to be a totally unfair advantage in a funny way that her parents raised her and her brother to speak both English and Turkish but purposefully never spoke farsi around them so that they'd have a language to communicate in that the kids couldn't understand

**I should note that at this point and for a while after they wouldn't actually acknowledge that her and I were in a relationship. They weren't happy that she wasn't dating this son of one of his coworkers (also Iranian) and were very unhappy that not only did she have no interest in that guy (or any other guy they suggested) but that the boy she did bring home was white.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt; Why are you comparing judging a trait inherent to a person like race or sexuality (wait are we saying homosexuality is innate now I haven't kept up) with something that a person has a choice in?

We only view race as the color of a person's skin now, because racism has been defeated. Before, it was associated with behaviors like savagery, etc (in the same way that ""sluts"" are associated with certain behaviors). In addition, it wasn't just about judging the *trait*, but about judging the *behavior*, such as wanting to drink from the same drinking fountain, attend the same schools, etc.

As to sexuality, sexual orientation is innate, but sexual behavior is not. Shaming women for having sex is like shaming gay men for having sex.

&gt; I'd judge someone who's fat for not controlling their urges

Being fat is unhealthy and signals laziness.

*****
&gt; Photo SEOUL, South Korea - The Constitutional Court in South Korea on Thursday rejected a challenge to the country&amp;#039;s ban on the sex trade, handing a defeat to prostitutes who have campaigned for years to decriminalize their work.

&gt; &amp;quot;The growing trend to liberalize and promote openness in sex doesn&amp;#039;t condone or justify its commercialization,&amp;quot; Justice Kim Chang-jong wrote in the court&amp;#039;s majority ruling, which found that the 2004 antiprostitution law, under which prostitutes and their clients can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year, did not violate the South Korean Constitution.

&gt; Three of its nine justices fiercely criticized what they called a government crackdown on women driven to prostitution by desperate circumstances.

"history","t5_2qh53","Americans usually don't acknowledge that even the US military's own Eisenhower, MacArthur, Nimitz considered nuclear bombing Japan unnecessary but the US used nuclear weapons anyway.

Usually, people (whose comment histories strangely are defending police abuse, white supremacy, and how guns saved them) say they know better than MacArthur and Eisenhower and that nuclear bombs were necessary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary
&gt;
&gt;Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,[99][100] Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.
&gt;
&gt;""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan."" Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.[91]
&gt;
&gt;""The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children."" Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman.[101]
&gt;
&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years:
&gt;
&gt;In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.[98]",1459469322

It's fine if you like getting raw teams in QM. It doesn't take enough about the meta into consideration. Given the choice, no one would ever choose a stealth character vs Tassadar for instance. Matchmaking will gladly give you Nova AND Zera vs Tass.

On top of that, because of the way matchmaking currently works Blizzard can't create true off supports. Tyrande and Tass were changed (buffed to absurd OPness and taken out of their niche roles) to ease the stress of matchmaker creating fair matches with only 1 support per team.

Admittedly, raw matches are more helpful for blizzard's data collection. Having a non partial matchmaker leads to less ambiguity in regards to balance and win rates.",1459469325

The settlement is to the benefit of the other party as it gets them off the hook permanently, and normally at a discounted rate compared to lifetime coverage.  And it seems like a large chunk to the recipient, until it's 30 years from now. Anyway, just a thought. Personally if you're taking a settlement, at a minimum I would have the number reviewed by an actuary - worth the few dollars to make sure.  I guarantee that the other party had an actuary look at the numbers - that's why you're getting the offer you're getting; it's less than the cost of them paying you over time.  Anyway, just a thought.


I'm no financial expert, so FWIW, I would not pay off the mortgage, at least not immediately.  You're trading off access to cash for a paid off house.  What happens if you need cash? 


Secondly, I've seen it advised that a good thing to do is simply park the money for 6 months to a year.  Collect your thoughts, take your time, get multiple opinions. There's no rush - risk of losing a bit of investment income over a half a year or so is less than the risk of losing a pile of future investment income.

Our DNA is linear and the very last segment of code cannot be copied, therefore we lose a small chunk of DNA with every replication. Telomeres are strands of DNA that don't contain any ""code"" in them. Once all of the telomeres are gone you start losing vital pieces of DNA and eventually the cell dies. We could technically live forever if we figured out a way to make our DNA cyclical like some bacteria, that way chunks of DNA wouldn't be lost with every replication.

Here's an example from Jefferson County's website (I know you said Denver, this is just a representative of the kinds of things I found).  It states right up front that there is no right of rescission for used car sales in CO.  http://jeffco.us/district-attorney/consumer-fraud/complaints/rescission-rights-complaints/

I know this sucks to hear, and it's a lesson a lot of people learn the hard way.  The law expects you to test drive a used car, and to have it inspected at your expense by a competent mechanic that you trust.  You should do this prior to making any agreement -- oral or written -- to purchase the car.

A reasonable, trustworthy seller will usually allow a serious potential buyer to take the car to a mechanic to be inspected.

But it's America and lets be honest, we don't give a rat's ass about soccer. 

So lets look at the big picture:
At the world cup, men's teams brought in $3.7 **b**illion and women's teams brought in $73 **m**illion. Based on revenue, the men's teams should be making 50-51 times as much as a woman's team that gets eliminated at the same point in the tournament. Considering those numbers and that the US women's team got $2 million for winning the world cup, the German men's team should have gotten $100 million in 2014 and not $35 million. So if they want equality, the German's can get another $65 million or the women can turnover $1.3 million of their winnings.

In sports, women do not bring in as much so they are not worth as much. It is simple economics.
Also, Hope Solo should just shut the fuck up and be happy no one cares if a woman hits anyone because if she wants true equality, she can go chill at home like Ray Rice.",1459469333

For people who didn't watch it at the time. For most of the Olympics Wade and Melo took up scoring duties for team usa and Kobe mainly played lockdown defense on the other team's best player. However, Spain came on strong and pulled within 2 points in the gold medal game vs USA in the fourth quarter. Kobe basically looked at both teams and went ""Naw. America aint losing another gold medal."" He then proceeded to take over the game. He was directly responsible for the next 15 points either scoring or making big assists, and capped off the run with a 3pointer and a foul. Team USA never looked back and won a gold medal. Kobe proceeded to celebrate by partying with every female at the Olympic village afterward. The end.

I personally have my doubts, and here's why...

I love Baldur's Gate. Love it. However, the ""enhanced edition"" released by Beamdog did a pretty shitty job of revamping the game. The majority of what Beamdog added to the game was ALREADY available through free mods. Hi resolution mods, bugfixes, etc...all already available freely through mods. On top of that, the Enhanced Edition was released with numerous bugs, many of which took years to fix. At it's current condition, it's relatively bug free, for the most part. That was not the case for a LONG time after launch. 

What Beamdog DID add to the game was rather lackluster. The additional characters, of which there are few, are not exactly groundbreaking. They fit the story, but don't add much. The additional quests associated with the characters are pretty boring. 

So yeah, I'd love more Baldur's Gate. Not sure if Beamdog is actually going to deliver on it.",1459469345

- 1-30 fm manually (you need 50 for dt anyway), then sea slug for 10 fishing to do fishing contest
- 10 fletch manually, then tourist trap -&gt; icthlarin's little helper -&gt; grand tree should give you 30 agil for horror from the deep
- monk's friend for ~20 wc, then just train manually for ava
- various low lvl quests for thieving. then The Feud when you're 30 thieving
- just get the cooking and crafting levels manually (they're super fast)

His suit is point blank bullet proof. You have to get a perfect straight stab at the weak point of armor to cut him, and it didn't come close to slowing him down. I just don't see how anyone who beats supes can be called shoddy with prep, and someone who successfully outran and hid from fucking doomsday can be called inept.

If the FBI used it, great, if they used something else, this is still worth fixing.

There have even been groups that have tried to replicate the photographs and have found that they are unable to do so. You can search google for ""moon landing hoax debunking"" and look at a few of them to get some ideas.

The problem is that your friend, and others like him, seem to be convinced that there's some huge conspiracy, maintained after all these years by what would have had to have been tens of thousands of individuals directly involved with the project. These people either cannot or simply will not listen to rational counter-arguments. They will always come up with some reason why your argument is wrong, and more often than not, their argument boils down to ""I don't believe you"". In my experience, a lot of these people are either anti-science or, are just ignorant. Hopefully in this forum this won't be controversial, but I'll bet that there's a lot of overlap between the folks who believe that the moon landing was a hoax and anti-vaxxers who cling to a (repeatedly) discredited study, preferring instead to take their medical advice from a celebrity with no medical training.

You state that all of C9 played bad that match but that freak's job is to enable shroud and skadoodle. So by essence if freak is doing basically nothing then the rest of the team will also be complete garbage. In the match yesteday freak rushed out long with the bomb one round and died instantly to rpk in the pit. Round over. How the fuck is that him being an entry fragger. Why does he even have the bomb? My point was that freak has no consistency, which was in my first sentence btw. Meaning he's basically unreliable as an entry fragger since he either kills lots or kills nothing at all, he has no middle ground like a nitr0. 

Stewie isn't the main problem either but watching him push smokes against G2 at a major shows he isn't learning. Hell even freak was doing it at some points. C9 does need a leader, or they just need to fucking adapt to their current situation and playstyles they have now. Let ska and shroud run loose, don't make shroud a turret on train, or post ska B with an awp all game.

In short the job of the entry fragger is to get entries, not die without doing anything round after round after round. The guy was 0-10 at one point yesterday...",1459469349

**350 Action**: Will Clinton refuse contributions from fossil fuel lobbyists?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO9EV_NAenY

---

&gt; Doesn't negate the fact she just assumed a voter who asked her a question was a Bernie supporter and then lit into them. 

Hillary exhibits traits of APD-Psychopathy.  
The signs are there.  

&gt;  Narcissistic injury occurs when a narcissist feels that their hidden 'true self' has been revealed. This may be the case when the narcissist has a fall from grace, **such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed** or when their importance is brought into question

&gt; Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from instances of aloofness, and expression of mild irritation or annoyance, **to serious outbursts**, including violent attacks and murder.

Psychopaths learn to mimic emotions, but don't actually feel them.

Traits include superficial charm, grandiose sense of self-worth, pathological lying, criminal prowess, manipulative tendencies, lack of remorse, shallowness, feigned empathy, impulsivity, and irresponsibility.

APD traits stand out in the case of Hillary, she just hides it better in public. She frequently displays bad judgement (impulsivity, irresponsibility). Hillary rarely takes responsibility (no remorse), when she does it is usually with a non-apology or a dodge.  

Research Hillary a little better and you'll find reports of ex-secret service agents, white house staff, and other people who will claim that Hillary is nasty, loud, and belligerent when off camera. [This is documented by people like Ronald Kessler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKm-qowOwk0) who have interviewed many secret service agents who consider Hillary Clinton's detail to be a form of punishment.

I walked into the lab one day and there was an engineer with his hand inside the printer with a Swiss Army knife, trying to remove a jam. (WTF?

I flipped out. Told him to step away from the printer and walk away. I fixed the jam. I went back to my desk and sent out an email to the group. ""You are software engineers. You are not hardware engineers. None of you are qualified to repair the $1M printer with a Swiss Army knife. Don't EVER do that again"". My boss called me into his office, said I probably should have re-phrased that, that some folks egos may have been harmed. We laughed about it.

That's why she is not a good drummer imo - she is too limited and unskilled, even though I wouldn't want The White Stripes to have had another drummer. However, I don't think you deserve to be called one of the 100 greatest drummers if you can't keep a steady beat.

Don't give up! Took me a while to find my first summer internship. 

First bit of advice I'd give you is to become a bit more focused with your portfolio. The first thing I see is that you are multi-disciplinary. This is great and the company I work for that would sit well but for most, they just want someone to come and work in UX. It'd be easier to find your first internship if you focused more on that. 

Secondly, your projects are thin. Just a description and some out-of-context wireframes aren't going to fly. Competition is fierce generally and anyone who has a detailed run through of the projects from research - implementation is instantly going to trump you here...

 To add something else, I'm not sure why but when I load your CV it completely glitches out for me and I can't see anything unless I scroll up and down really fast? Even then it's unreadable:( Could just be me as I'm based in Singapore.

---

Over all you seem very qualified for an internship... I'm not entirely sure why you aren't getting one. Maybe it's just the focusing in thing or how you're interviewing?

Now you can buff precision to do about the same average damage as crit in the long run, but at this point you have buffed precision to the point that its a required stat on all high base damage champions that do physical damage.  Therefore the damage output from said items would be higher for assassin's, bruisers,etc... as they have higher base damage and can build those items and still get enough hp to take care of adc's.

You honestly didn't think this part through by just brushing over and ignoring the fact that you have to let adc's still be able to kill tanks, the tanks still need to buy armor(with this new system they would need less unless precision is flat OP and even then armor wouldn't be as effective as HP in most cases).  Then if precision is put into line with current crits damage then bruiser and assassins will build it as they have higher base damage.

Now crit does suck at times and others it feels amazing.  It is not the best, but your solution is much worse.  Also changing code is a lot harder than most people think it is.  Just because you see Ashe you go oh you can just change this like that, that is not the case.  First you have to find all the sections of code then you have to change them all, make sure they are all the same for respective champions, change the items, and then comes the testing of it.  It isn't as simple as flipping a switch, this is something that would be a major patch and would take a good 6 months of internal testing to make sure nothing broke before even being released on ptr for however long.

I would like to also touch on one of your points about crit fishing.  That is there so you aren't in a dull situation in lane, and promotes good reaction to in game events.  With the new system you propose it would just be flat damage and would make lanes a lot slower than they already are(especially in the LCS).  Not sure about you but I hate the farming for 30 mins and then lose/win a team fight and game is over.


TL:DR The proposed system is not better than the new system for multiple reasons.  Of them is Bruiser and Assassin item abuse, overall adc nerf unless the increase damage is high causing the abuse I just mentioned.  Lastly it takes awhile to implement.",1459469362

I haven't stolen anything.
That 'SSHHHH' thing that you see in the image was a joke, dude. I guess you can't get a joke.
I use mods to play in Creative mode and in my own servers, so that's probably a rational explanation why I got a free golden armour the first time I logged in into the server. It only happened once! I know this server is in BETA state, and I have no malicious purposes.
I thought it was a welcoming gift because in BitQuest 1.0 they used to give you free stuff to get started...  but no.

I deposited 200 bits to the server and made me a diamond armour. It was the first day in TS so the golden armour wasn't damaged. Do you know what I did? Give it to somebody to help.
It was you, and now I regret.

Why do you want to join? I want to join a big faction, that is also good and has a good system. What I mean by this is I want to join a Power Faction or a Semi-Power Faction. I believe I am a good contender to be apart of this faction and I am pretty good all around and am willing to learn ways to improve and other things such as callouts in PvP and trap mechanics.

Thanks for your consideration,

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","I'm saying I don't consider it disrespectful if other people do it. I share your sentiments and hold myself to the same, but I do not consider myself disrespected in a video game if someone is not doing everything they possibly can do to make the run more smooth, even though I am. Personally, it does not offend me. 

In a school project heck yeah. And if you don't I'll talk to you about it. If you don't do anything I'll let the teach/prof know and whatever they want to do is out of my hands after that. I could even go so far as to do it for you, or whatever parts you're not doing. But am I going to get mad at you am so going to be upset at you? No, I have no controll over you. And I'm not going to waste my time getting upset or stressing out because you decided you want to be lazy. Do it. And we'll see what happens.

But as far as in a video game goes, if I get matched up with an Er (summoned - pet is an er lol) casting ruin I, I'm not going to care lol. I'll laugh and that will probably be my favorite dungeon of the day just because of the rediculousness, especially if they're chatting lol. That's just me and how I look at things.

Again, I know you see things differently but I don't see a good enough reason to stress out on the performances of another, especially in a dungeon.

Am I doing what I'm supposed to? Yep. Did we make it? Yep. Did I have a laugh? Oh jeeez yes lol (Nope....Did we make it? Yep). Good",1459469366

Even though these factors you mentioned are far less powerful than they were in the past, natural selection is still alive and well. People with certain genes are still more likely to reproduce, and allele frequencies continue to shift.

On the topic of the demographic transition, I'm not just talking about years from now. I'm looking on the scale of hundreds, and thousands of years into the future. In the near future, increasing access to education and birth control in developing countries, and other things like sexbots, will continue to lower fertility. But in the far future, due to natural selection, fertility will probably be higher than it is today, assuming the population is below carrying capacity.
&gt;Addition: If anything, when your survival and that of your offspring is much more guaranteed natural selection will make humans less likely to have to urge to reproduce at the levels of the past.

This is just an assertion. What you are saying would only be true if having a strong urge to reproduce caused one's offspring to have a far lower evolutionary fitness compared to the offspring of someone with a weaker desire to reproduce.",1459469366

Denial would be second - Clay and Attach being their answer to Scump and Formal. Replays reverting back to his obj style was very underrated in AW I feel - he'd hold his own most times in HP, very good at Uplink and SnD, and understood CTF well. JKap being the most versatile player would also be a plus point.

FaZe would be very good as well (assuming I have right team in mind) - put Aches and Enable as the two main SMGs (Enable as main obj), then either stick Parasite on anchor duty, or let him do whatever and put Slasher there. Either way, it's a pretty decent team on paper.

4th would be TR (or eLevate), or possibly nV (Saints and Zooma taking it in turns to be aggressive or play obj, Merk anchor and Nameless doing him), perhaps a case for Mindfreak, ON, or Epsilon? I'd be more inclined for TR personally",1459469367

You're missing my point, which is while I do enjoy the game, there is currently a distinct lack of things to do once someone hits level 30 (which can be done in 25-40 hours of normal play) granted challenge missions and dark zone are fun, and I still enjoy playing them, but I also like to do other things, and there's no options to do anything else.

This happened a few months back. I was at a Target, the girlfriend and I had just walked in and she had to use the rest room. The water fountains happened to be along the wall to the entrance to the restroom. So I got a quick drink and she went to use the facilities. After my drink I just leaned against the wall waiting for her playing on my phone, maybe 8-10 ft from the entrances to both men and women's restrooms. 

She was taking a couple minutes, and in that time the manager and a guard came over and asked me to leave. They said they had heard of complaints of a strange man hanging out by the woman's bathroom. I told them I was waiting for my girlfriend but they insisted I wait outside until she comes out. I said we are about to shop here and again they insisted I leave and that my behavior was frightening other guests.

Rather than cause a ruckus I left. Girlfriend came out a few minutes later. We did our shopping and left without further incident.

Do you think had I been a woman I would have been approached? I don't know for sure, but I feel like I was singled out because I was a man because as they expalined it a ""strange man"" was near the women's bathroom.

Other incidents like this have occurred throughout my life but so far this has been the most overt, or most impactful to me psychologicaly. 

Another brief one, was maybe 6 years ago. At a best buy I think, anyways a kid was walking down the isle alone. Maybe the kid was 4 or 5 I don't really know I'm bad at that kinda stuff. The kid was old enough to walk and talk but young enough to have gotten lost and scared, so whatever age that is. I notice he was crying, not loundly but audibe. I saw no parent and I instantly had a flashback to when I was a kid and got lost in a mall. So I wanted to help. I approached the kid with a friendly voice asking if he was okay and where his mom or dad was. He said he didn't know. So I said I would help him find them.

I start walking him towards customer service so that we can maybe get them to announce that $kidsname is at the front desk. Then what I assumed at first was the kids mom came up to me ask very rudely asked what I was ""doing to that kid."" I had my hand on his head while I was periscoping looking for an adult with an ""I lost my kid"" faces on and asking him to describe his mom or dad as he was sobbing. So I asked if she was his mom and she wasn't. So I said what was happening and she quite forcefully grabbed the kids hand, I was afraid shed pop his arm out of socket,  and said ""I'll take care of him"" and started marching off almost dragging the kid. I followed to make ssure the kid ended up okay, and possibly to fill out a police report if it turns out the parents just up and left. They found the parents who were thankful to the woman for finding their kid and I left knowing the kid was okay.  

Now I realize she may have assumed that I was hurting the kid with my hand on his head. I don't know, but I know ill never do that again, if anything ill find the nearest employee and have them take care of it.

BUT---

The Dot's BT connectivity to the Tap is pretty wonky. The Tap drops the connection about 60-90 seconds in, and when I try to reconnect with the, ""Connect my speaker,"" command (as Alexa recommends) I get an error message that starts with, ""I didn't find any available Bluetooth speakers..."" *coming through the Tap*, which means it IS connected. After that, audio from the Dot will pipe through the Tap for the usual 60-90 seconds before it drops the connection and switches to its own speaker.

Yet weirdly, when I connect the Dot via BT to my daughter's crummy little no-name BT speaker, it connects with no problem and *remains* connected.",1459469374

If you need that info, let me know and I can probably come up with something.

&amp;nbsp;
______________________

&amp;nbsp;

#Sample 1

**Nose**: Oaky caramel, deep plums and oak spice, deep wine notes (Port probably but could be a dark dark sherry), chocolate mousse, eggnog 

**Palate**:  Big old oak spice up front, cream, plums, spicy grains, easy drinking malt.

**Finish**: The creaminess on the palate helps give the finish some staying power.  Plum and oak spice.

**Overall**: There was a time I might have poo’d on this one but really it is a nice, old wine finished malt.  Not going to wow anyone but I would say if I were trying to get a handle on what old malts were like this would be a place to start.  The mouthfeel makes it easy to consume but it won’t challenge you.

[Guess After the Fact: Macallan CS]

&amp;nbsp;
____________________

&amp;nbsp;

#Sample 2 

**Nose**: Caol Ila peat - clay and sea brine, lemons, ground pepper, oysters, mescal, ash, burned tobacco

**Palate**: Carpet cleaner or hand soap, peat, gritty mouthfeel

**Finish**: More soap

**Overall**: Something went wrong with this sample, the bottle, or my glass because all I got off the palate and finish was soap.  This makes me sad but I’d probably call this null/void.

[Guess After the Fact: No idea, soapy Caol Ila]

&amp;nbsp;
_____________________

&amp;nbsp;

#Sample 3

**Nose**: Brine, acidic vomit (could be baby vomit), peaches, grain spice, vanilla

**Palate**: Peaches, chocolate, very acidic grain spice, some vanilla

**Finish**: Bites the back of your throat with acidity and spice

**Overall**: Really young, quite undeveloped, almost reminds me of Glenmorangie 10 with the baby vomit notes.  Not a giant fan of this style but it will warm you up - though it might eat the enamel off your teeth while doing it.

&amp;nbsp;

[Guess After the Fact: Something young and aged in ex-bourbon]

_______________________

&amp;nbsp;

#Sample 4

**Nose**: Waft of subdued nutty sherry (Oloroso or other dry), hazelnuts, strawberries, peaches/apricots and lemons, oak char and french oak spice

**Palate**: Candied walnuts - a bit of the dry sherry, the spice of young malt, still some peaches, a touch acidic

**Finish**: Dry and lightly nutty, spice of young malt stays for a while and the sherry nuts reassert themselves late.

**Overall**:  Not a bad dram to keep around the house.  Has a fair amount of fire on the palate and the finish.  I’m a giant fan of oloroso too.  This would be a nice one to keep around for a pork meal in the winter.

[Guess After the Fact: Glenfarclas something, 12?]

&amp;nbsp;
______________________

&amp;nbsp;

#Sample 5

**Nose**: PX Sherry/Raisin funk, Cocoa, Plum Cake (yeast+plums), Cinnamon, Peaches, Fresh Oak, Confectioner’s Sugar

**Palate**: Pure PX bliss, candied raisins and dark cherries, oak spice, does not mince words. Might give you diabetes.

**Finish**: Cake, dark chocolate, oak stays around just long enough.

**Overall**: Great example of what sherry should taste like with a hint of malty backbone.  I have started to really enjoy PX and I enjoy this.  Won’t be for everyone.  The nose has some nice activity too.

I abhor Siri. She is worthless. You cannot go from Google Now to Siri.  I, having not used iPhones, though that Google now and Siri were probably about equal because people with iPhones seemed to be happy. Those people are wrong. I find the ""hey Siri"" command to work more consistently (only one time has it not responded) than ""ok google"", which is nice, but it's a shit show after that. 

The UI is ridiculous to me. I see the conundrum that the are in when it comes to improving your platform vs alienating users. Android is super fragmented, but, that does mean that they can implement much needed change more easily. The idea behind the iOS interface is ludicrous. It looks like app vomit. You cannot take an interface designed before the App Store was a thing and adapt it to the way that we use phones today. While brilliant at its inception, a 10 year old OS interface is not acceptable. Then again, Windows 8 didn't go over well...😀

You can't *try* to do something without intending to do it.

Trump is only placing American citizens over foreign nationals. A lot of people don't realize that Muslim-Americans are far, far more moderate than your average follower of Muhammed overseas, mostly because 1) we know how to assimilate small groups of people at a time; and 2) people who immigrate to the United States are self-selected for loving freedom and Western values. 

It's really more of a backlash against the incompatible culture of many Middle Eastern countries than the religion itself. While there are plenty of foreign Muslims who would fit in *just fine*, many would absolutely not. Personally, I don't think religion has much to do with it insofar as these countries aren't exactly shining examples of democracy. We are taking a serious gamble by accepting too many refugees. Legal immigration is controlled. Refugees are uncontrolled.

If we pulled out of the Middle East and maintained controlled immigration, like always, we wouldn't have this problem whatsoever.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt; Normative statements and identity have literally nothing to do with each other. 

Yes, which is why you need to stop mixing them up.

&gt; Example of a normative statement: People shouldn't steal one another's belongings.

Yes, notice how you use ""should"" here, which indicative of that. Further, it is axiomatic from the collectivist perspective, because of deontological ethics or whatever else you want to use. Just like, you should not be racist, or misogynist. And bullshit that they are saying don't identify as such. They very much want the racists and misogynists to identify so they know who they are and can shame them for *thinking* that. Because they are shaming the individualist normative statements not identity. I've even seen this explicitly stated a few times.

When an individualist makes a normative statement, the prescription is self-referential. For example:

You should not stick your finger in an electrical socket or you shouldn't steal other people's things because if you get caught you go to jail. It's not stealing that is wrong, it's that the consequences are harmful to oneself.

&gt; Example of identity statement: I am a heterosexual white man.

This is rather trivial. I don't not care about 1% of the population being homosexual outliers, I am aware biotwinks exist. I'm talking about the BPers who don't shut up about the Kinsey scale and say only a minority of people are actually 0's using some Gaussian distribution.

It is very expensive, but there are copy cat versions that probably do the same thing...i would just google and pick one and see what happens.  I do think TM has a STYLE that I would go with: effortless, as opposed to effort/concentration. There is no ""right or wrong"" way to do tm.  you close eyes, say a mantra, and don't judge.  So what you are paying for is a mantra and instructions.  I'm sure you can find this for less online, etc.  but I would steer clear of the types that are effort based, since that can, ironically, create stress...

Same goes for any animal really, my cat perks up and runs to the door when she hears it open.

I work in a city that is loaded with dogs, people go outside with their pit bulls, rottweilers etc and most won't even pay you a thought. To me, the vicious and mean dogs are mostly the tiny ones. If a god has its tail down and starts to bring its ears down/ back then it is aggressive. All the dog in the video is, was curious and excited. It stopped in the center of the hall, looked around and wagged its tail..

It's the seemingly playable cards that are hard to evaluate like Xaril for example, simply because in a vacuum it seems playable but no one can be sure if there will be a deck supported by the future meta where this card can find a home.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Most of your posts are variations of ""you're twisting my words"" as opposed to actually clarifying and elaborating on your arguments. What you're doing is not normal. If you have a case for Sanders approach to downticket contests being more effective by campaigning for President first and focusing on the legislature later then just focus on making that case instead of complaining that your point isn't being received. 

There's a deficit of evidence to point to either way to actually determine what Sanders' plan is/was. Interview responses have been very vague. 

If I had to guess I'd say there is no plan. Sanders decided to run on a whim and is making it up as he goes along. Had he known that he'd be doing this ten years ago then laying the groundwork for qualified, progressive-leaning candidates to enter downticket races would undoubtedly put him in a better position than he's in now. I don't understand how that hypothetical could be seen as anything other than a far better strategic position for a 'political revolution' than the actual situation he is in now. 

Having the national spotlight and having a formidable network of supporters is only useful to downticket races WHILE he was the national spotlight and the support network.

---

The RM850 uses the same platform as the RMx, but without type4 cables  extra vsense wires. It will have slightly higher rippple, but still great ripple. Around 25mv on 12v.

&gt;It's just if you do any overclocking, you might have some issues.

Yeah.... no. All the units that are ""tier 2"" are good. They at least got that part right.

&gt;if you need lower budget, the SuperNOVA P2 is pretty cheap for a Tier 1 PSU, and although it's a ""lower quality"" Tier 1,

The next best thing would be the AXi... 8mv of ripple on the 12V rail. That's stupidly crazy. It's the farthest thing from bad. That's excellent.

&gt; I'd say go for the HXi if you can.

The HXi would be a downgrade in some ways. The only advantage would be the FDB fan, but the P2 is already very quiet.

The P2 is the clear choice here.",1459469387

Usually, people (whose comment histories strangely are defending police abuse, white supremacy, and how guns saved them) say they know better than MacArthur and Eisenhower and that nuclear bombs were necessary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary
&gt;
&gt;Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,[99][100] Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.
&gt;
&gt;""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan."" Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.[91]
&gt;
&gt;""The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children."" Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman.[101]
&gt;
&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years:
&gt;
&gt;In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.[98]",1459469388

"BravoRealHousewives","t5_2v6dk","In this particular case (Atlantis, Dubai) you are right in the fact that we have no idea how they are being treated but I'm not sure being forced to perform tricks can be defined as being treated well? I also wonder- will they be forced to breed in the future? Apparently performing/playing with/for guests is also risky for them because they can get injured- this is not natural for them. These sea lions were brought to the hotel from a facility in France and Germany- not sure what to think of that. I sure hope they were rescues and not separated from their families or poached out of their natural homes and even if they weren't it still doesn't sound like an ideal future for them (IMO). 

The owners of Atlantis, Dubai also claimed that its facility Dolphin Bay was a rescue and rehab centre to help injured/stranded dolphins in Dubai. They have since been called out by NGO's and environmentalists for purchasing these dolphins from a dealer (not rescuing). How is this a rehab centre when the dolphins are being forced to swim and entertain guests? The owners of this hotel also poached a shark (disregarding laws obviously) and put it in their enormous fish tank. Pretty shady stuff. 

I completely agree that it is wonderful if an animal was living in captivity for its whole life and was rescued from this captivity and then taken to a sanctuary where they had the appropriate room to roam/swim etc. or a rehab centre to help injured/stranded animals that could not be placed back in the wild. This is not what Atlantis, Dubai is doing from what I have read and now seen. 

I am glad we both support our fellow animals and I agree with you about responsible zoos and how they can offer valuable research info, create awareness and provide education. I am glad that animals in responsible zoos are treated properly and are being stimulated with games/puzzles however I am still personally uncomfortable with the size of some of their living spaces. I understand animals at the zoo have usually been rescued and are being rehabilitated and some animals are there because they are endangered and will hopefully mate but I have to wonder if all animals in zoos are rescues. Obviously not all of them are endangered/rescues/need rehab. 

On a side note: I know not everyone has the opportunity to travel and see different animals but these days technology is pretty rad too! There are all kinds of live streams and webcams of animals all over the world living their lives. I was looking at hibernating bears who were starting to wake up in British Columbia just last week! 

I heard they were thinking of getting a SeaWorld in Dubai or hoping that SeaWorld would choose them for their next location. :(",1459469394

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Trump isn't 'conservative' in the sense that he doesn't follow the exact positions that GOP candidates in the modern era are supposed to. So he is not the natural extension, He is the natural consequence.

He is brilliantly exploiting the weaknesses in the GOP base that the GOP itself has created. This is a party that entertain Sarah Palin as a vice president candidate, and has had people like Herman Cain, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee as front runners from time to time.

You can criticize the Democratic party all you want, and I've got plenty of criticisms to give them, but the closest they have ever had in recent times to an obvious scam artist is John Edwards.

The party has been getting by it's insistence that science is not real, that all of the media is extreme  leftists, and that Government has no value other than stealing your money.

It's hardly shocking that if you feed people this diet for long enough that eventually they'll decide to include your establishment in with the rest.

Trump is a symptom of the problem not the problem itself. The fact that Ted Cruz is doing so well and is now the back up position proves this. I am 100% confident that someone will run the same scam is Trump is and come in second if not win the nomination in 2020.

He's also shown that a big part of the base doesn't really care about a number of these items that they were assumed to. They basically don't care about religion as long as you call yourself Christian. They don't believe in free trade. If you frame it right, they think healthcare reform is great, they just don't want it from Obama.

It's obvious that most of them are the people that Thomas Frank tries to explore in 'What's the Matter with Kansas?'. They have been voting against their interests. Trump is substituting the religious / social aspect with open racism and open sexism to have them continue to vote against their interests.

Pretty soon it was realized that miracles could be easily faked given enough agenda (like causing people to 'walk again' or even 'raise from the dead') as many evangelists do now, however, one thing that really clinched it for me was that since Jesus was such a humanitarian and had the help of God as his son (and everything is supposed to be possible by God) why he didn't heal amputees. Afterall, that would prove beyond the shadow of a doubt why that God existed and so did his miracles (and it wasn't even to prove it someone! It was to help the sick like the rest of them. Afterall, amputees have problems too! you can make a man totally incapable of walking fully functional legs but you're not going to do that for someone who's lost one of his?!?) 


If I was a Muslim I would have a real hard time reconciling with the fact that Muhammad really didn't claim to have miracles (except for the splitting of the moon that is already adequately debunked) and the fact that despite his bitching to the Jews who asked him to take the 'prophet's test' he STILL ended up taking it to prove it to them and STILL failed essentially lol.

To take advantage of this, if you need more gun elevation to make a shot, turn away from your target for a moment and your gun deck will angle upward.  Likewise, turning into the enemy will cause the deck to drop, letting you hit a shorter range target.

I'm not sure if it's the game yet, but firing upwind is also easier because of this.  Due to the positioning of the sails, your ship always leans away from the wind when sails are furled, which gives you more gun elevation (whether you want it or not).",1459469401

You don't seem like a nutcase so it seems worth pursuing. You're clearly not impressed and you're worried about something in all of this. I'd very much want to see you elaborate if you have the time.

I've heard grumbling about Snappy Core before but I think the early quality of all that is beside the point. Canonical has *some* resources, probably spread relatively thin(?!), but enough to try the ""throw spagetti at the wall to see if it sticks"" tactic. Again, Ubuntu has a massive market share in the cloud server racket and the Microsoft deal shows they want to be present where developers are. I see potential here. 

I just have to say that unlike Canonical's mobile operating systems prototypes, I totally see some stickiness in this type of thing. As you say, they're a little late to the game with Snappy, but it's the kind of thing that could make make some actual demand for the splashier user facing things they've worked on worthwhile for new kinds of platforms. And succeeding at platforms is certainly not about instantly being the best at everything.

&gt; Consumers who signed up for Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans through the Affordable Care Act&amp;#039;s insurance marketplaces these last two years tended to be sicker and incurred greater medical costs than people with BCBS coverage through their jobs.

&gt; The enrollees in those individual health plans in 2014 and 2015 had higher rates of diabetes, depression and heart disease, according to a report released Wednesday by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

&gt; A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said it was no surprise that people with newly obtained access to coverage needed more health care.

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","After a long conversation with chickensage, I thought about the fight, and think it would go something like this.

When they see each other, Leon and Anja both start slinging. Zeek knocks these all away with his wind. Anja only creates 10 grenades at first, and over time creates a few more, and uses In to hide them behind bits of rubble. After a few seconds of this, Paul will conjure his pens. Using his extra arms, he can throw these at the attackers. This will force them into hiding behind rubble, or to go around the corner. Once they are hidden, the barrage of cards and grenades should cease, and Zeek, will rush towards the opponents, however Paul will tell him to be careful, and stop. As he gets about half of teh way down, he will trigger a Fear grenade, and be placed under the effects. Out of position, and fear'ed, he will panic, and run back to Paul, taking a few cards in the back on his retreat. Injured, he will tell Paul about the grenade traps, and how it suddenly effected his mind. Paul will know she is a maniuplator for certain now, and the two will seek cover back behind some rubble. Anja and Leon will now look up see their opponents have dissapeared. They will likely not come all the way down the corridor, as Anja has 5 intelligence, but will slowly edge down. Anja will give an opposite intent grenade the command to find Zeek. It will appear over the rubble, and hit Zeek, forcing him to leap from cover and attack. Paul will work out fairly quickly that it was the grenade, and will leave their hiding spot aswell, to assist Zeek. Zeek will use Uzamaki, pulling everything towards him. Paul can use 2 extra arms to hold onto the rubble, to stay sturdy, and 2 arms to try and swat away any projectiles that come near Zeek. He may get a few, but eventually, a lot of grenades will hit Zeek. The Uzumaki will have pulled the 2 attackers towards them aswell, and Paul will cease this chance to draw blood for his effigy. After Zeek faints from fear and pain from the attack he just suffered, Paul will attack the 2 with his pens. Seeing how dangerous Anja is, he will go for her, and since she is speed 3, his arms should be able to outspeed her. He will designate one arm to this task, and 3 to fending off projectiles. Eventually, he will get some blood on his pen, and work on escaping. He will back off down the corridor, using his free arms as a shield, but will definitely take some cards in the back, and also probably the Negation Card. Us defenders gotta have some luck on our side, comeon Jolt, let it be the repulsion.

If it's repulsion, then I believe Paul can escape to the roof, climbing up like a spider. From here, he will create an effigy for Anja, and rest a lot. In terms of teh event, he'd take a turn of movement off, resting on the roof, before continuing at 25% health.

If it's attraction, I don't think I need to say, bye bye Paul. Lady luck hits for free, and theres a 75% chance Paul will be fucked over by this. If he gets lucky enough to have the 25% that removes the attraction, then he will escape to the roof, and create the effigy, before falling unconscious/out for the rest of the tournament.

Probabilty wise: P(Paul makes it out alive, with Zeek dead, Anja nenless after 4 minutes, with a few injuries, and Leon with some minor injuries of a grazed knee and maybe a cut from Paul.) = 1 - (0.5 * 0.75) = 0.625. So mathematically, luck is on Paul living's side, if this is how it goes.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt;People come here because their society lies to them about women

I understand women. Probably even better than you. 

&gt;They want to get laid, but they can't, because they've been taught to be submissive beta males. 

Getting laid and attracting women has never been a problem for me. Also, I'm not a submissive male. 

&gt;You may want a woman to tie you to a chair, but that's not what she wants.

And how would you know? Lumping all women in to one group is going to cause you to miss some great opportunities. 

&gt;Reverse cowgirl is literally a turn-off to many women because it's too dominant a position. I have had women specifically tell me that.

Wrong. They just won't do it with *you*. I bet I could get them to do it. Then again, I have a rounded understanding of dominance and submission. 

&gt;But don't sit here and tell me that being submissive in your sexual life doesn't bleed over into the rest of your life, too. 

Oh, it certainly does. In fact, being submissive in the bedroom actually causes me to behave even more dominantly in other aspects of my life. You know why? Because I've eradicated fear. There's very little that can shake my frame after being put in a humbler and going through some CBT. 

&gt;they think it's hot to have a feminist jab a heel into all of our collective balls.

What the fuck does what I do in the bedroom have to do with feminism or society's collective balls? Go do your own thing. Honestly, the fact that you're so concerned over this raises some questions. ",1459469412

Thank you.

&gt; Do you like your therapist? Have you made progress with them? Why or why not?

I've made some progress with him, but recently it all unwound and I don't know why.  I stopped getting the sleep he helped me to get, and now I really don't want to sleep because I'm scared of nightmares and because I can cope when I cube,  but I can't cube *and* sleep because I don't have time.

&gt; You need to figure out how to love yourself.

I know I need to... but I really think this issue should be on the back burner for the time being.  It's not a primary cause of any of my problems, nor is it easily solvable, so I'm gonna wait until it's more important.

The whole thing about negative language really makes sense to me, which is actually why I wrote ""I can't love myself"" and then deleted it and re-wrote those last two sentences.  I'm gonna try that.

As far as the self-diagnosis you're talking about, I'm not saying it's their fault for not believing me, because I know that self-diagnosis is dangerous and stupid, I'm simply raising these things as a possibility.  My parents refuse to even acknowledge this possibility, which is the frustrating part, but I recently brought up the ADHD with my therapist and, having observed my behavior for many sessions, he actually says he somewhat agrees with me.

My feeling bad around people (without the ""can't"" language) stems partially from the fact that I feel very uncomfortable in social situations because I feel physically and mentally awkward.  I have to concentrate really hard to seem ""normal,"" which I usually don't want to do.  It ends up being a choice between being comfortable but appearing ""off"" to the person/people I'm talking to or being uncomfortable and trying too hard to appear ""normal,"" which doesn't even work all the time, making everything worse.

I am not on medication, and my therapist isn't ready to medicate me for anything, maybe because I haven't had a chance to talk to him in two weeks (this past session was with my dad in the room so I couldn't).  I don't want to suggest the idea, though, and he hasn't considered it necessary up until now.  He is not closed off completely to the idea, he just hasn't considered it for me yet.

I can't show my parents my wrist because I don't want them to know.  As it is, I feel most comfortable alone, and they'll never be able to let me be alone if they know I've self-harmed.  Besides, it wasn't real self harm.  It was one cut, one time, and it hardly even bled.  I haven't done it since.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Somebody at valve dislikes it a lot probably, else they'd have added it by now.

The main reasons against it are IMO only applicable if All Pick becomes too unpopular or is fully replaced by All Draft.

Allowing high level players to spam OP heroes is one, but I don't think it's a good reason considering how much worse matchmaking is because of it.

A better reason is that players can't spam their favorite / currently practiced heroes, for example envy would just never play ember again. He could play on smurfs and hide profile for that though. And if he was playing something new, (*like pa ;)*), I don't think the matchmaking should have to endure him lose a 1000 MMR on his main account for himself and other people just because he wants to practice it and doesn't care about MMR.

But these are only truly relevant at the top, could be fixed in other ways and most importantly, it'd be very hard to argue that they outweigh the benefits the rest of the playerbase would gain.",1459469418

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;I find it to be poorly transmitted, unkmown authors, unstable transmission

Because it isn't poorly transmitted, full of unkown authors (there are many historical documents that we have no reason to doubt and yet are anonymous or written by a person we can name but know nothing else about, which is hardly different than anonymous), or plagued by unstable transmission. 

Critical scholarship is not always right. They sometimes have good arguments and make good points, but plenty of times they are full of nonsense. The consensus of critical scholarship changes, which means that they are very often wrong, but the communities own admission! Not that they are always wrong, but ""the consensus"" has been wrong many times already. I will not trust it just because it is the consensus. As I've said consider the arguments themselves. Do you think that dating the gospels to after A.D. 70 because no one could have possibly predicted the destruction of the temple in AD 70 as Jesus did in the gospels, is a good argument? It's literally ""well, supernatural things can't happen so it must have been written after the fact""! That's not neutral! That's not good logic or scholarship! Of course we can't throw the baby out with the bath water and say that every critical argument is wrong, but consider them on their own merits. 

A point about the authors of the gospels too: there was never suggestion ever recorded of any author for these works other than matthew mark luke and john. No competing theory was every espoused, and it's always been those 4 gospels as far back as we can go. Heretics pop up, by they are condemned in their day. Orthodox Christianity never showed any doubt about the 4 gospels from the earliest day. If they didn't know, or were just guessing you would expect that alternate hypothesis about the authors would pop up, or that alternative gospels would be considered. But they never were. It was always, as far back as we can go, matthew mark luke and john. ",1459469418

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;Wouldn't it be very convenient for serial killers and other criminals if they could prey on the most vulnerable members of society secure in the knowledge that their victims lacked the means to pursue justice?

Poor neighborhoods in the US have the worst security. Poor neighborhoods usually have an adversarial relationship with police and the courts. Poor in the US often do not report crimes against them because they would have to take time off work to enable the prosecution, testify and and so on, all without any compensation. And if the conviction fails they are at risk of retribution. It costs the poor person more to report the crime than to get on with life.

For an AnCap society, if tort claims were transferable (as we might expect in an AnCap society), poor people could get justice if they were wronged by selling their tort claims to capable prosecutors.  The poor person might get compensated fairly quickly and the  prosecutor would have incentive to get as much restitution as he could, thus punishing the perpetrator. So there might be more of a deterrent to preying on the poor in an AnCap society, and the poor would be more likely to collect restitution, than in today's society.

&gt;If I am the victim of a crime and successfully prosecute the criminal what sort of punishment would s/he face?

That would depend on the law provided by the arbitrator similar to how it depends on the jurisdiction in current state system.  Of course there would be an incentive to provide laws that reduce conflict because conflict causes protection firms to pay indemnity payouts.

&gt;I am unlikely to be willing to pay significant sums of money for incarceration, even capital punishment is expensive.

See, [Prisons in a free society?](https://youtu.be/SzYJYSm-MfI) - Bob Murphy
 
&gt;What happens if there is deemed to be insufficient evidence to secure a conviction but my claims of criminal activity are considered to be valid? Who pays court costs? (I assume there is a presumption of innocence and the burden of proof rests upon the accuser.)

Depends on the law provided by the arbitrators.  Again, the arbitrators have an incentive to provide laws that reduce conflict.  Also people that are high risk for injuring others would likely end up in the ""prision"" scenario from the video above, even if not actually a criminal, in order to reduce payouts.

&gt;Is obstruction of justice illegal? e.g A doctor refuses to administer a rape kit upon request as s/he wishes to protect the suspect.

&gt;Is perjury illegal?

Again, it would depend on the law provided by the arbitrators. I suspect customers of protection firms would be under contractual obligations to not obstruct justice.  Perjury is basically a breach of a contract to tell the truth, what the punishment would be would depend on the contract.

"windowsphone","t5_2r71o","I posted this in another post about Continuum but I think it's worth repeating.

Continuum still has me very excited about Windows phones. I'm hoping we still hear about some more cool new features coming to continuum.

Azure remote apps are cool and so is the Xbox controller support, but I'm really excited about being able to project my phone to a Windows 10 PC via continuum.  I'm thinking it would be useful in cases where I have access to a computer that isn't mine. All apps, data, and credentials can be carried on my phone. This would effectively give me a ""Windows on the go"" environment in my pocket. (This was actually an idea that I had for Continuum but I never got around to suggesting it.)

I'm also very excited about the laptop dock for Continuum. I've been wanting one of these ever since HP showed off their mobile extender. As long as it is relatively cheap I would get one in a heartbeat to replace my 8 year old laptop. (I do most of my intense computing on my desktop and my laptop is basically for checking email and surfing the web on the go.) I'm hoping Microsoft also provides the ability to wirelessly connect my phone to the laptop dock (maybe paring could be handled via NFC).

As an aside, how cool would it be to have laptop dock in the form factor of the Surface Book? Then we could have laptop/tablet experience with Continuum.

Features I'm still hoping for with Continuum:

* [Touchscreen monitor support](http://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-mobile-redstone-will-reportedly-bring-touchscreen-support-for-continuum-and-more/)
* Snap 2 apps side-by-side like in Windows 8
* Support a webcam in the laptop dock (or at least a USB webcam) - this way you could skype like on a normal laptop.

Unfortunately, there were a few people who were not concerned for her privacy who took the opportunity to send her obscene messages over Instagram, telling her she was an evil bitch and deserved my mother's abuse. Someone also directed Voldemort and one of my sisters to this page. I told HaH she should just delete the posts for now, but she decided to delete her account as well.

There's no reason that there should be gendered rules for giving up responsibility for a child.

There's no reason that rape should be such a one-sided issue. It can affect anyone.

Too many feminists view it as a zero-sum game, unfortunately. ""Any talk about men's rights necessarily takes away time from women's rights, and we can't have that.""

&gt;Is this justifiable retaliation for  [u/theymos](/u/theymos)  censorship of consensus proposals xt, classic, unlimited?

&gt;Or is this a credibility hit and beginning of the end for  [r/btc](/r/btc) 

&gt;What other dirty tactics has  [r/btc](/r/btc)  been up to? What else would be fair game? Paying shills to post many negative stories? Telling lies and writing libelous false claims about core supporters? Using sock-puppets to fake support for comments? Shorting bitcoin and buying ethereum and then paying people to fake bitcoin FUD in hopes of driving people out of btc into eth.

&gt;Some other confirmed things: bribing people to mine classic and giving instructions on faking classic node counts.

At all 5 interviews the first thing they mentioned was my video resume. That's what prompted me to consider turning it in to a business. I know it won't work in all markets for all type of jobs.

   4. If you block anything but EX knees, it is your turn, while most are safe assuming the Bison is spacing properly, he is negative and it is your turn, don't let him bully you.
   5. Only EX version of Psycho Inferno is safe, blow him up on any other blocked Inferno.
   6. He does not have a 3fr normal and while a lot of his buttons are + on block, they are generally 'slow', Karin can out footsie bison in neutral. just don't spam buttons to get crush fished.

"ABDL","t5_2r8xk","So I think you probably get that people can have fetishes but probably haven't thought about the reality of it coming into your own life.  This discovery is therefore very shocking for you.  Leaving aside the whole argument of whether ABDL'ism is a fetish (diapers clearly are but some would argue the security of wearing them and ageplay in general is not a fetish).  Some fetishes are considered extreme by the mainstream, a diaper fetish is definitely one that falls into that bracket.  Fetishes can have a profound effect on sexuality with many finding it difficult to become aroused without the object of their fetish involved.  You don't mention your sex life in great detail but clearly he can enjoy 'normal' sexual activities without diapers; that probably means they don't rule his life.  That's not to say he might not enjoy things better if they were involved however...

He has therefore probably taken a view of 'well I can get what I need by viewing images/reading stories, why risk upsetting my partner by involving her?'  He has basically done a risk/benefit analysis and decided to not tell you; he has surely done this with your interests at heart.  It may seem like he's being dishonest (especially since you say you've asked him) but in his mind, he will be in a very difficult position (think of the superficial 'do I look fat in this dress?' question).  What I'm saying is don't take his failure to disclose this to you as a malicious intent on his part.

Try not to be too alarmed at the stories you have read.  Remember that a love of diapers and ageplay does not make your partner a paedophile.  The vast majority of ABDLs (and there are a hell of lot of us from all walks of life) are not paedophiles, have no sexual interest in children and are riotously outraged at any suggestion their fetish has anything to do with actual children.  Most stories I have read are outlandish, fanatical not based in any kind of reality.  Most normal human beings know you can't make someone wear 20 diapers out in public and change them like a child in the shopping mall food court but that is the type of fantasy some stories have.  He may imagine himself as either the dominant or submissive character while reading them or indeed just find the acts described arousing (e.g. he might enjoy the fact the story depicts someone being forced into diapers while completely ignoring how old the subject is meant to be).

That said, you do need to address the fact the stories depict children.  One would hope he has absolutely no interest in children but I personally think that is difficult to justify keeping such material (it's probably not illegal to have these kind of stories but I always think 'what would my employer say, what would the cops say, what would the media say').  You will unfortunately need to address this with him unless you want to make things worse by going behind his back and 'spy' on his activities.  I think he should be entitled to read stories, look at diaper pornography etc, even if you want no part of it but that he has to be honest that he does these things (I'm not suggesting you get the details of 'where, when. what'!)

One thing to bear in mind though is that no matter what he says, he won't be able to 'give this up'.  If he isn't 'allowed' (even if it's a case of 'don't ask, don't tell') he will end up resenting you and himself for it.",1459469427

&gt; Garfum, owned by a New Jersey man named Michael Garofalo, says the patent was infringed by the photo contests Taylor runs on her website, Bytephoto.

&gt; EFF quickly filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the photo contest patent should be thrown out as abstract under the Supreme Court&amp;#039;s Alice Corp. precedent, as hundreds of other patents have been in the past two years.

&gt; The firm also represented eDekka, a patent troll that was ordered to pay more than $390,000 in attorneys&amp;#039; fees after 168 of its cases were thrown out of an East Texas federal court.

I think you said this in the earlier thread, but my rule of thumb is if you take a Gifted Career, you are locked into the Game System (FMF or IKU) that career came from. There's too much room for serious gunmage or bloodweaver shenanigans otherwise. The only possible exception is Thamarite Advocate, which I'm not totally sure what to do with. It's a cool career, and pairs well with pretty much anything, but I haven't yet thought of a way to break it by pairing it with an IKU Career.

I definitely recommend listening to good kid, mAAd city if you like those two songs. They're both classics off that album, as long as you consider the content and perspective of the lyrics, and don't just hear club bangers. One of my other favourites on that album with a similar upbeat feel is Compton ft Dr Dre. The beat on that is really nostalgic if you like older West side/Compton artists. 

Section 80 is pretty different to TPAB, so you may or may not like it. His sound has evolved a lot and the production value of his music has improved a lot too.

Wesley's Theory though... It's the first and only song by anyone ever that I instantly loved. I remember my jaw dropping on first listen. It's genius. For anyone who hasn't heard it, here you go:

Your boss should also be aware so you don't get a reputation for being lazy, or a slacker. If he knows that you have a chronic condition, even if your colleagues aren't aware, at least your boss will be, and not think you're not pulling your weight. 

I'd also include your SO in everything. I don't mean that they have to come to every appointment or anything, but make sure they're up to date and, depending what type of EDS you have, make sure they know any important medical info they might have to share with anyone in the case of an emergency.

and I didn't even tickle him, second strike, nothing, third strike? oh hey look hi's health bar moved! oh wait skeletons fuck run! oh fuck I ran the wrong way now I'm in the bosses room FULL EBONY!? OH GOD RU-dead.

In the almost five centuries since the destruction of Alba and the overthrow of the Palatine Regency, and the Imperial ascension of the King of Valissar, the Paladins have all but disappeared.

In some quarters, they are looked upon by the common folk with nostalgia for a bygone age where justice reigned and they curse the princes of Adara for their corruption and pray for the return of the Paladins. In other places, the Paladins of old are thought of as cruel oppressors and any modern Paladins are looked upon at the least as vagabonds and at the worst as subversive elements working for the overthrow of decent modern society.

But when I see an overall *pattern* of abuses like I've been seeing with the Clinton campaign, then I can no longer justify excusing them. You may feel differently, but I think I'm not the only one to feel that way.

Yes, there have also been mistakes on the Sanders side. But they typically get called out by both Sanders himself and by other supporters. All I see on the Clinton side is, ""We didn't do that!"" or ""Well, *that person* may have done that, but *we* didn't tell him to"" and other denials. There is no acceptance of responsibility. Part of being a good leader is admitting where your leadership has failed and trying to correct it. Not just denying it ever happened (or spinning things so that people are so confused they no longer know *what* to believe).

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Omni is great, absolutely agree on that one. The thing with silencer though is that while he is great at being a prick in lane, that's only when he gets to stand there and spam his spells at you. He's slow and has no hard disables, so he's easy to both run away from and AT. He's also like OD in that he doesn't really farm well, he needs to be involved in kills for gold and stolen int to get truly disgusting, difference is that unlike OD he doesn't really have a way to catch people on his own so he relies on his teammates to secure his game for him. And if that means they get a dedicated ganking SWAT-team of tusk and lion to go after you, I'd personally be more scared if that team had a third contributing member.

Though of course, even without snowball, or played as a hardcore support, silencer has his ult, the cause of his name. It's super strong for sure, no matter how farmed you are, no matter if you have a bkb (unless you time it right), you're occasionally not gonna use abilities for 5 seconds. Thing is though, that you can still do everything else. You can move, you can use items, you can right-click. That means that unless other bad stuff is happening to you at the same time, you can just walk away for a while and come back as ready to fight as you were before. Unlike the ults of Tide, Naga, Magnus, Enigma or what have you, the fight is being reset but you get to be part of setting the stage for the rematch so to speak.

So Silencer has an ult which does nothing but allow his teammates to do stuff to you, unless he got fat which he can only really get through the help of said teammates in the first place. He doesn't really do much on his own at all really, unless he gets free reign to stand unbothered in a lane and spam to his hearts content. He certainly has potential to become unbelievably obnoxious, but he's never gonna achieve it without the help of teammates (or stationary enemies...), which is why it's kinda useless to ban him *first* before there's any hint of the gank squad he needs to help him, or the 3 channeled ults you were gonna pick, or whatever. Both teams can only pick two heroes before you get to ban again, so save him for later! :)

Usually, people (whose comment histories strangely are defending police abuse, white supremacy, and how guns saved them) say they know better than MacArthur and Eisenhower and that nuclear bombs were necessary.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Militarily_unnecessary
&gt;
&gt;Other U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur,[99][100] Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet.
&gt;
&gt;""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan."" Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.[91]
&gt;
&gt;""The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons... The lethal possibilities of atomic warfare in the future are frightening. My own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children."" Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman.[101]
&gt;
&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir The White House Years:
&gt;
&gt;In 1945 Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. During his recitation of the relevant facts, I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.[98]",1459469453

&gt;And just to open the discustion: I have always liked the shebang #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of #!/bin/bash. This gives each user the opportunity to choose their own version of bash instead of relaying on /bin/bash. But don't take it from me: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/29608/why-is-it-better-to-use-usr-bin-env-name-instead-of-path-to-name-as-my

OTOH, the use of `env` like this theoretically can be a security flaw.  Let's say `$HOME/bin` is at the start of your `$PATH`, well you could put a super evil hacked version of `bash` into `$HOME/bin` and get the keys to the universe.

Now, the *realistic* likelihood of that happening is slim, but it's still something that's likely to upset the more security-paranoid.

As the accepted answer in your link says (emphasis mine):

&gt;**The disadvantage of #!/usr/bin/env python is that it will use whatever python executable appears first in the user's $PATH.**

I instead have a `.bashrc` function that, from memory, tests for `/bin/bash` and if it doesn't find it, it suggests creating a symlink to something like `$(which bash | head -1)`.  That doesn't help with script portability though.  What would be great would be a secure way to have a dynamic shebang self-contained within a script.

Or you could just use `env` :)",1459469453

"MUD","t5_2quk5","Yeah, most of what you mentioned I have setup. I'll clarify. My item definitions are all existing rows in the database with a corresponding class in the code. At runtime, the item definitions (templates) are loaded from the db and stored in memory. As items are instantiated, I have a lightweight object that holds any of the dynamic properties and a reference back to the template for the static fields (things like name, description, etc).

It's these item instance objects I'm looking for a bit of guidance on and I think you touched on that in your first paragraph. If a mob loads a Sword of Power for example, there's a Sword of Power template in the db, template in memory, and then an instance in memory. When the player kills the mob and loots the item instance, that is when the instance would be saved to the db (it enters the player's inventory). What I was having trouble deciding was after that if the item moves around (player drops it, gives to someone else), so I delete/readd it to the db each time, or do I use a ""nothing"" belongs-to identifier and simply purge any item instances that belong-to-nothing at startup or maintenance time.

It sounds like I want to use the belongs-to strategy and just use a 0/negative value to indicate an existing item is no longer attached to a saveable entity, rather than doing deletes/re-inserts every time it changes hands.",1459469454

If you looked at the total amount of payments you make to repay the loan, for the purposes of this example, let's say you have to pay back a total of 900 thousand. The total amount you would get to write off as an expense is 400 thousand (900 total - 500 borrowed). This makes sense, since the 500 you received for the loan was not taxed as income, so you get no tax benefit for paying that portion of the loan.

A portion of that 400 thousand would be deductible as interest expense on every loan payment you made. However, the proportion of interest/principal on each payment changes on every payment. You pay more interest per payment in the earlier portion of the loan. This is because interest is calculated on the outstanding balance of the loan, which is of course higher at the beginning of the loan.  Whoever is financing this loan should be able to show you an amortization schedule, which will show the breakdown of interest/principal on each payment throughout the life of the loan. You can also find websites to create your own amortization schedule if you know the interest rate and term of the loan.

Not a dumb question. Many people have temporarily locked themselves out of their Windows OS because they changed something in the BIOS, but forgot to change it back. Record what you do so that you can undo it. If worst comes to worst, you can usually set something like ""load factory defaults"" to get back to normal.

&gt;Also can I delete the tor browser and other stuff that's on the internal disk drive?

Yes, but you should use a disk utility that wipes the free space on a drive because when something is deleted, the OS just marks it as deleted, but doesn't overwrite it on the disk. Forensic disk recovery programs can easily undelete them.

Between 1525-1866 a total of 10.7 million Africans arrived to become slaves in North America, South America and the Carribbean. (This was taken from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database)

In 2014 the Global Slavery Index did a report on modern day slavery and concluded that 35.8 million people are slaves worldwide.

14.2 million people are slaves in India and 3.2 million are slaves in China.

Taking into consideration that in 2014 India had more slaves than the entire North America, South America and Carribbean did in 341 years, I think it's safe to say that America's slavery issue was not the worst in history. ",1459469459

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","If you're going to have an underperforming teammate, then it's honestly best for that person to be the support - since supports aren't really taking many kills, their gold value won't reset as quickly (by your ninth death in a row, you are worth only about 58 gold). Also, during the laning phase as support, it's occasionally advantageous to trade your life for the enemy ADC's - assuming that your carry survives, they will receive free time in lane to develop a CS lead. 

However, although it's commonplace to have more deaths than kills as a support/utility tank, you should still have a positive overall KDA. 0/13/10 is not an acceptable score for any reason, period (nobody else on your team had double-digit deaths). A simple ""sorry, I'm not playing well"" would have been a sufficient reply to your statement -  there's no ""support [duty]"" that grants you license to feed and immunity from criticism.

"books","t5_2qh4i","It’s unfortunate to see Strunk and White's ""The Elements of Style"" in a reading list meant to make one well-rounded. Strunk and White espouse the kind of emphasis on grammar that leads so many educators to over-enforce it, when it comes to composition instruction. 

There’s recently been a paradigm shift (past few decades) in which first-year composition researchers discovered that “skill and drill” and other styles instruction meant to enforce good grammar and style does not improve writing. In recent years, researchers have turned to the study of rhetoric as a means to improve writing, finding that instruction which focuses on a text’s thesis or main argument (global concerns) is much more effective at improving writing than instruction which focuses on grammar and style (local concerns). That isn’t to say that Strunk and White’s work is of no value, but it is often a poster child for educators who stick to old grammar-based instruction, and won’t see it as an artifact from the past of composition instruction. 

One of the most important things that the study of rhetoric has taught us is that every kind of writing has its own unique audience and situation, and as such, the author must abide by different rules or conventions for their message to be effective. It would make sense to use passive voice in scientific writing, for instance, to remain objective. Using passive voice is not a grammar mistake, whereas Strunk and White would teach you that you should always use active voice. Another large problem with enforcing “good grammar” is that there is no clearly defined “version” of English which is universally taught. In other words, there isn’t a nationally approved set of specific guidelines defining what good grammar is and isn’t, because grammar rules change depending on your context (Edited American English, which is widely recognized, is merely a general set of rules). In other words, there can’t and shouldn’t be one uniform system of grammar that everyone should be taught, because it would be useless to some degree in every other form of writing. To me, the idea of enforcing one set of grammar rules on every other form of writing is rather imperialistic. 

TL;DR: The Elements of Style by Strunk and White make a lot of people incorrectly think that teaching good grammar is the key to making better writers, while teaching rhetoric is much more useful.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Yes it does, though not in the way you detail it. Organisms eat what organisms eat for no reason other than to maintain homeostasis. Arguing for the better treatment of food or a reduction in total consumption of meat is understandable, but a person eating a chicken is not evil. A family who enjoys a steak does not burn in a lake of fire. How about small village killing a whale, should they not do that because it is a sin to consume the whale's flesh? No, of course not, they are simply getting food because that is what they can and choose to eat to survive. But if thousands of ships set out to harvest whales, is that ""right?"" I'd say no. It isn't about what you eat, it is about how you eat and how it gets to you. There are scientific reasons to consume less meat, there are reasons to farm or capture in certain ways. However there are reasons to consume animal products as well. Yes, I think people should eat LESS meat, but to call ""Murderer!"" when your neighbor fries a fish is ridiculous and shows that some people have a serious disconnect with biology and reasoning in general. That is why the approach of most vegans is so ridiculous. They attack people for filling their bellies, attack them for surviving. If someone came to you and shouted ""RICE KILLER! WHEAT MURDERER! LEGUME LYNCHER! YOUR TOOLS ARE A SCYTHE AND SHOVEL, THE GRIM REAPER AND THE UNDERTAKER ARE YOUR KIN!!!"", wouldn't that seem a bit crazy? Life is all the same, all atomic chains of carbon, hydrogen, etc. Eating is just taking in these chemicals and reusing them to survive. Modern humans in the first world are lucky, we have so many options when it comes to food. Being a vegetarian now is so much easier, and many people have switched to more balanced diets. Sure, not everyone, but it takes time. That is why you approach them with sound reasons and not accusations of homicide.

But back to the lions. Lions eat meat, that's what they do. They do it pretty well. Well, let me introduce you to the Homo sapien, a marvelous species originating from southern Africa. These, like many apes, eat both plant and animal material to survive. It's a good choice. A varied diet allows for many different nutrients to be consumed, and that's overall good for the species' fitness. So, naturally, humans can and do eat meat. But as the species grew it eventually was able to eat a purely plant based diet. Now, does that mean the precursors to these plant based individuals were unethical with each animal they killed and ate?
