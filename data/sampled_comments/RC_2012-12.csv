"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","I don't know what the deal is with DMs.  It's almost as if Arsene doesn't believe they're necessary, but that goes against the wisdom of every other top team in the world.  Even Barcelona, who are known to play possession, attacking football, won't play a game without Busquets or Song or another DM in midfield.

If performances showed they aren't needed that would be one thing, instead Arsenal has very often looked shaky defensively, and the need to play a defensive role has limited the influence of players like Arteta and Wilshere.

As for Nasri, I think he was world class for one 6-month period, and easily good enough to start for Arsenal most of the rest of the time.  Even when he wasn't at that peak, he was far better than Ramsey has been as a winger this season, and possibly better than Gervinho and Podolski.

It's hard to look at the pre-2008 period objectively because that's the Thierry Henry period.

The difference between 2008-2009 and now isn't that that season was so amazing, but it seemed like there were a lot of very good players at the club and only a bit of time to mature and a couple of careful additions might see the club perform amazingly well.  Sagna and Clichy were young and getting better every year, same with Van Persie and Fabregas.  There was some hope for Denilson.  Song had serious flaws, but he also had lots of potential.  Almunia wasn't the awful unreliable keeper he seemed to become.  Ramsey was showing potential...

The main thing was that nobody would have thought of Arsenal as a selling club at that point.  It was a place that brought in good players and made them excellent.

Looking back, 2008-2009 may be where the current problems began (or maybe go back 1 year to 2007-2008 when Henry left for Barcelona).  But the thing is, there wasn't then a sense that making the Champion's League was the best that Arsenal could hope for.  A lot of the starters were really young and had yet to reach the peak of their potential, but their potential seemed huge.  Now it seems like anybody who reaches their potential is sold off for a huge profit.

I say this only because you seem to be unable to fulfill the role of dutiful father/partner, so it's a matter of minimizing the damage done to all parties.

If you think your partner would be comfortable with an open relationship and is capable of accepting it, then you should pursue it. However, you may find that she reluctantly agrees to it only because she perceives that the alternative is worse. In that case, you only prolong her misery while you reap all the benefits.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","Thanks for your reply. After rereading my post, I should clarify that talk of us officially dating never came up when we were hooking up. Obviously the idea was in both our heads, but this is one of those ""we never really communicated about what was going on"" moments that I referenced in my original post. I now realize a blunt conversation would have gone a long way. I honestly don't know why I never brought it up. I think I was guarded because I knew how tricky the situation was, and didn't want to open that part of myself up too quickly because there was so much at stake. And I'm sure this sent mixed signals.

The first time we actually talked about taking our relationship to a different level was when he told me he wasn't interested in a relationship. And it stopped after that. (Side note: he's now seeing a girl who he's very much interested in having a relationship with, and although it's irrational I'm a little hurt by him now wanting something only a few months ago he told me he had no interest in.)

I hate to think that our friendship was based on him being interested in me, but after the ""break up"" it's impossible to be as affectionate and carefree as we once were. I'm sure it's a mix of us having to destroy all the feelings we had and not knowing when the line is being crossed. 

Thanks for offering your advice and being so blunt. This situation was a first for me, and I'm still trying to figure out what I did/what I could have done to avoid the messiness. Obviously communicating would have made a world of difference, and I'm wondering if I should talk with him now so we can set some sort of foundation to move on from instead of living in this unspoken gray area of friendship.","1354320012"

"Republican","t5_2qndt","Alright, I see what you are saying. My issue is not the system itself, or the reason the Social Security system is there. Here is the position I stand on:
Social Security does bring in money to hold and give back as entitlements (like you said, no disagreement there), but back as late as 1994, the government started spending the surplus from Social Security in its federal budget*(please reference white house federal budget at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collectionGPO.action?collectionCode=BUDGET). When this started happening, the pot, or cash on hand, started going to other things. This money did not go to the military since the military budget at that time was cut in a literal sense, in half. With 101 billion dollars being the difference in incomes and expenditures for Social Security, the fed is having to pay out of pocket (other taxes) to cover down on the difference.  As for your opinion on the military budget, yes I agree there is mismanagement within the military budget, but cutting the budget as a whole (federally) will not solve that issue, that issue has to be resolved internally. I say this for many reasons, and if you would like to discuss this please state your interest, otherwise we can stay on the matter of the Social Security.","1354320018"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Herds are an interesting idea.

It also makes no sense to have 50 predators and no prey in a subzone, or all of the same sort of mob.  What the hell are 50 wolves living on?  Why are none of the predators heading for the unmolested boars over the hill?  Why do the moas and dolyak almost never inhabit the same field?


One thing Rift did better than most MMOs (although still not well enough, IMO) was the variety of mobs in an area.

Tyria would feel more alive if there were a herd of dolyak, and maybe a few scattered moas, and a pack of wolves picking off the outliers over here, and an occasional skelk stealthing through the remains of the latest kill, only to be attacked by an owl griffin who swoops in after the wolves have left... and on, and on, and on.

A bunch of lone wolves standing around in this field, while the next field has a bunch of jungle stalkers, and the next a bunch of spiders, and the next a bunch of deer, and the next a bunch of skale?  That's not alive.

I do realize it's probably much more complicated to program and balance areas for this kind of complex interaction between mobs, and that's probably why no MMO yet has really done it.  But I hope somebody figures out a way to pull it off.","1354320019"

No, I am not.  However, they can be applied to what I was talking about since I did not mention anyone specifically.  You could apply this to every POTUS election of my lifetime.

&gt;you are correct that RP is not like either.

I never stated that.

&gt;The most fundamental difference is that âthe main two candidatesâ had political support whereas RP had no political support two primaries in a row.

Very nice!  You get eight ""hates"" out of ten for this unsuccessful jab, especially because you reached so extremely far on something I never said.

&gt;American voters saw a difference in the general election so your failure to distinguish a difference between them is, well, your failure.

I didn't say they were the same human being.  I was saying they were two different humans who believed the same thing.  I understand they couldn't simultaneously be elected.  Of course the voters differentiated between one man and another.  Only one can win.  Of course you know this, but in your attempt to jab your statement came out wrong.
Just because the majority thinks they greatly differ doesn't make it true.  And just because someone that is so unqualified to give input as your says so makes no difference as well.

Secondly, I think that you (like me, Jessica Alba, Kate Moss, and Brandy) have somewhat wide-set eyes. There is more than one eye's distance between the two. I just found out, today, [through my own first B&amp;A](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1421li/im_determined_to_learn_first_ba_ccw/) that when you have wide-set eyes there are a few techniques you can use to help pull them together.

* Use a taupe color to pull your eyebrows in a little bit and shade down the side of your nose
* Use thicker liner and mascara towards the inner part of your eyes
* Using lighter colors and white liner on the inner corner of the lid makes your eyes look wider apart. I tried reversing the colors (dark on the inside, light on the outside) and it literally blew my mind how much better it looked. I recommend you play with that concept to see if you like it!

"learnart","t5_2s6fc","Go to an art supply store and choose a nice sketch book, not the cheapest or most expensive. Pick something that you will feel comfortable carrying around. For me my sketch books are all about paper feel. Not all paper is created equal, feel a page, I like the strathmore recycled 60lb or so for graphite and something textured for softer materials. Look for s spiral in the binding so you don't run the risk of your work falling out. Choose a set of pencils that go from 4h to 6b or so you will want a bit of range in the hardness. The h being the harder pencils(they will produce light shades) and the b being soft (bold shades). If you feel like going a bit further, pick up some charcoal, willow charcoal and some compressed charcoal in different harnesses. There is something very organic about charcoal and for gesture drawings its wonderful. 

It doesn't matter what you draw, when or where. Just choose and object and work on basic shape, identify where the light is coming from(best to set up a situation with a single light source to start) More important than anything is ENJOY what you are doing in the moment. If something turns out like shit, learn from it! Always ask questions if you need to.

Part of living in a society involves restricting your behavior to make things better for everyone. I love listening to loud music. But I also recognize other people don't share my taste so I turn my stereo down when I'm near other people. Because I'm not an asshole.

It's rude to blast your music in public. And it's especially rude to broadcast music laced with obscenities in a public place where other people's children might hear.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","&gt;So the problem isn't casual games, it's poorly designed introductions to a games mechanics.

I think you are wrong, and the problem is exactly the casual games made specially for gamers who cant play games in the first place. Its obvious if we examine the state of todays fps-games. They simply require BY FAR less from the player, than what proper fps-games did back in the days. QuakeWorld is a perfect example of a proper fps-game which is fully skillbased, few main differences compared to pretty much all todays fps games are:

- QW has fully skillbased movement which allows the player to gain speed while in the ""modern"" fps-games have no such thing, at best they have a ""sprint button"" or something along those lines

- the pace of the game is much faster compared to ""modern"" fps-games

- the weaponset in QW has multiple guns, and not all of em are hitscan weapons like in ""modern"" fps-games which means the player wasn't only to be able to pick the right gun in the given situation, he also had to be able to aim with guns which require prediction aim, not just spray&amp;pray

- in QW controlling the items in maps is very important, to a degree of requiring players to time items (including weapons/ammo/health/armors/powerups) to be able to secure the next spawn of the item - this system itself provides more possibilities for playing smart and requires by far more from the player than any tactical aspect in todays games

The reason i talk about ""modern"" fps-games is just that: they aren't modern what comes to the gameplay. They are actually the opposite, despite the eyecandy, and to me these ""modern"" fps-games are a perfect example of games made for those who cant play games.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","well aside from the fact that the 2012 budget marks it as 683 billion, which doesn't round to 600 billion- its not just a matter of ""The military creates jobs therefore its a good investment"" its a matter of ""where will a portion of that money"" do the most good- going by studies like ( http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/published_study/spending_priorities_PERI.pdf ) that place isn't the military, no one is suggesting that the military be done away with utterly- but many of our bases in relatively quiet areas of the world (of which we do have many) are unnecessary and drain resources- many of the expenditures on things like tanks, for example, have even been outright contested by the military as they already have more than they require active. 

Furthermore, its likely that increased spending in other areas of the budget would result in a larger net gain in the military's effectiveness than immediate military spending. Spending more on education for instance would not only result in more effective engineers and the like for the military, but also accelerate the rate of technological growth- potentially giving us a remarkable advantage, cheapening the cost of doing many things we already know how to do, and contributing to medical advancements that could play a pivotal role in keeping our troops alive. 

Finally- there's very little that things like more fighter planes, tanks, and missiles can protect you from. Our military is already large enough and powerful enough to take out just about any country on the planet (indeed, we own most of the aircraft carriers in existence- and all of the big ones), when we enter a war, we become the dominant occupying force in the space of about 3 weeks- our conventional forces are beyond sufficient for any task we might choose to set them to. We have just about every other developed (and therefore powerful) nation on the planet as our allies, including the majority of Europe (see NATO). In most conflicts in fact, the U.N is on our side- under our finger in many ways. We easily posses the largest, most well-trained, most technologically advanced force in the world- forget big, it's outright bloated.

The trouble is non-conventional warfare, the number of tanks and soldiers we can field is nothing when a few nukes in the hands of people who don't care about deterrence could literally cause the end of the world- certainly annihilate the country- and nothing we have is an adequate defense for that- in fact, the only real defense against the threat of nuclear attack- is that of mutual disarmament and cooperation. a larger military budget- beyond say 3-4% of our current GDP, does nothing to help keep you safe, and might even serve make your life more dangerous.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Interesting question and sort of relevant to something that just happened.  We had an indie movie shooting in our house for a few days.  They wrapped up on Tuesday.  In the movie, there's a masturbation scene with a 14-yr-old actress.  I imagine that they have to tread a fine line with that sort of thing.  They covered up all the monitors outside the bedroom during that scene so that only the on-set crew could watch.  I assume that this was to make the actress more comfortable, though I was thinking to myself ""What are you doing in there with that kid that your adult crew can't see and should I be kicking you out of my house...""

Edit:  Answering some questions from below:

The movie is [Sisterhood of Night](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1015471/)

I'm not trying to make it into a competition, and any time I've talked about it with him I haven't been accusing or manipulative by bringing up how much I do it for him (as I said in my post, I try and frame it as ""it's awesome when you do this and this, why don't you do it more?""). At this point I would be happy with him fingering me once a week, which, given the frequency of the sex we have, I don't believe is an unreasonable request.

I like giving him blow jobs because I know he enjoys them. I see it as a standard part of an active sex life. I know enthusiasm is the best thing you can have in a partner, so I am as enthusiastic as one can possibly be when gagging on a dick. It's not a pleasant sensation for me, but I take pride in doing a fantastic job and pleasuring him and I enjoy seeing him happy.

My problem is that enthusiasm isn't reciprocated. In the entire time we've been having sex, he's gone down on me seven times before sex, and has fingered me maybe three or four total (I'm not trying to tally it, but they stick out because they are so infrequent). Only two of the times he's fingered me has he put in the effort to bring me to orgasm. The disproportionate level of effort going into our sex life is what's upsetting me, and what I'd like to work on constructively.","1354320069"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt;Lebron loves winning and all, but I doubt he would have taken half of his current contract to still play for the Heat.

They're actually all losing a shit ton of money. I don't know of much people who would pass on so much money just for success in sports.

&gt;And to avoid the ""superteam"" why not enact rules that make it so a team can only have one max contract or anywhere near one.

I thing the cap rules are enough. If players are ok with taking less money and some front offices do better work than other, then it should be so.

&gt;Besides, avoiding injuries is supposed to be one of the top priorities of the NBA, as well as the NBAPA.

Well, I think there's a difference between running your players in the ground like Thibeaudo or sitting your starting five out. 

&gt; No solid free agent will want to sign there because they suck, they suck because they can't get any decent players.

Well, in leagues where the priority is sport and not only business, that's how it goes. Some teams are advantaged, because they have a bigger area supporting them and others have to do with smaller budgets. I mean it's more or less the same now: add the titles won by the big dogs (Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, ...) and it's not that different.","1354320070"

You and I recognize that attacking an international sport competition will bring no good for both Palestinians and Israelis, but Hamas could see it as an opportunity to make a big statement in a global scheme. I am also aware of Israel's world-class security force; however, a festive tournament such as a European Championship should not be played in a situation where military forces must be on duty to protect fans. 

**Just because Israel can call upon an extensive security force does not negate disaster threats**


Currently, it just seems like a poor idea to host a multi-national tournament in Israel, and it is a shame that it is so. Finally, after considering the opportunity for such a threat to occur, why risk thousands of lives so Israel can host a bloody tournament?

Not genius decisions - just a notch healthier than usual. For example instead of a sausage biscuit for breakfast I would have oatmeal with sweetener or two apples. Lunch I eat a lot of rice, beans, chicken, salsa, cheese, relatively healthy items (compared to pizza, or burgers, etc) and when I want something yummy like pasta I'll go for marinara sauce instead of high calorie fattening Alfredo sauce. Little changes like this aren't difficult.. And they add up! I also bought a bike and started biking to work every day.

A few freshman friends and I decided we felt like eating outside in the courtyard. We took a seat at one of the picnic benches and starting eating and talking, keeping to ourselves. Some senior yells ""fuckin' freshman,"" and a group of them laugh and try to look tough when we look up. We ignore them and keep talking and eating. Next thing I know there is something flying through air about to hit my friend in the head. Mid-sentence, without breaking my speaking stride, I reach up, without taking my eyes off the person I was talking to, and snatch the glass Snapple bottle one-handed and put it down on the table. I proceed to act like nothing even happened, and the senior who threw it walks away with his head down.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm British, and I went to Mexico (Mexico City, Puebla and Veracruz) six years ago for a family holiday.  For reference, it was just after the Felipe Calderon vs Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador presidential election in 2006, which saw ""AMLO"" narrowly defeated and his supporters shutting down various main roads in the capital and occupying the central Zocalo (square), and before Calderon's offensive against the drug traffickers which has led to the current violence in the country.  Whilst I was there, I did not experience any violence or crime: the political protests were peaceful, although a teachers' strike in Oaxaca, many miles away, was forcibly broken by the police.

I absolutely loved my experience of Mexico.  The food is excellent, the Aztec and other pre-Conquest archaeological sites (Teotihuacan, Tenochchitlan and El Tajin were the ones I visited), street life is colourful and vibrant, with plentiful public art exemplified by the murals painted by artists such as Diego Riviera, the weather is fantastic, and the natural scenery often breathtaking.  Everyone I met was extremely friendly, even though my Spanish is extremely limited and proficiency in English is not particularly common amongst the Mexican population.  I should also emphasise how diverse the country is, and the great  potential for pleasant surprises - from the building which was a perfect exemplar of Art Deco I found in Mexico City (which I think was a concert hall, but not certain), through local specialities such as mole poblana (turkey with an extremely complex and tasty sauce) and coconut milk with lime and chilli, to the variety of excellent local beers (due to German immigration and adoption of purity laws).

Some less attractive aspects of Mexico from my perspective include the fact that mains water is not safe to drink, the crazy driving standards that make any attempt to rent a car impossible to all but the bravest or most foolhardy, and the speedbumps installed in the motorways (highways)!  But overall, it's a wonderful country that I hope to visit again.  The current drug war situation - which occurred after my visit - is a real tragedy, and I hope a peaceful conclusion is reached soon.  However, I suspect that the scale of the problem is overstated by the world media, and that the vibrant culture I experienced still exists under the surface.

**SIDE CHARACTERS**

**Mutou is Mr. Fare**, not ironic just logical. He's a teacher a a lot of us had (I think) and many of us go to Sci-Fi club which he and Sasha run. And he is a science teacher.

**Kenji is me or [MrZestyFresh]**. I am a crazy conspiracy person but [MrZestyFresh] is random and weird. Also not ironic, that should just apply to the 6 main girls I think.

**Iwanako is python_regius**; [Krivoshein]'s actual girl friend. This makes sense because she is Hisao's original girlfriend and if the main character girls are all gonna be dudes, that leaves a female in this sub that we don't know what to do with.

**Nurse is Aabrar**? I don't know.

**Yuuko is Greg**. She stutters I suppose. Not really sure here either.


**GIRLS**

We can be ironic or logical, I have arguments for both.

**Hanako is [Calahagus]** because [Calahagus] hates her. No one is really that Hanako like. **[speedsk8]**?

**Shizune could be [spi007]** because [spi007] is loud as opposed to deaf and mute. **[jesus_de_lespace] is half-deaf** (check his comments, it's even brought up once in this sub) and wears glasses I guess.

**Lilly could also be [spi007]** because [spi007] is not sophisticated. **jLoop would make PERFECT sense** because he talks so eloquently and is so damn tall.

**Emi is jLoop**? jLoop is very very tall but Emi is short. However, I think he does or did Cross-Country so it's also fitting. **[jesus_de_lespace] could be ironic** because he is pretty tall and is not athletic in the slightest.

**Rin is [CJSBiliskner]**. It just must be. I'm not sure who actually makes sense for her.

**Misha could really be anyone**. If [spi007] is Shizune, then [Calahagus] should be Misha but he also must be Hanako.","1354320089"

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","Well, halacha is not the word of God and makes no claim to such.  It's the word of learned rabbis, but it's not the word of God; it's only interpretation of the word of God.  Some have come to the conclusion that some of this interpretation is not only wrong but actually harmful to people, so they have issued their contrary opinions on the subject.  The example here is egalitarianism.  We recognize it as a basic human right, but halacha not only makes a distinction between men and women but holds women to a specifically *lower* status, through no fault of their own but through vague notions about the honor of the congregation, because at the time of the opinion, women were considered shameful, or something like that.  In a previous comment I reference the blessing, *still in the siddurim*, where men bless God for not making them women, while the corresponding blessing for women bless God for making them according to his will.  Not ""shelo asani ish"" but ""sheasani kirtzono"".  Men are thankful for being men, and women are making the best of a bad situation and saying, ""well, it was God's will; who am I to disagree?""  Equality is a moral imperative *that is not realized in traditional halacha*.  This is why we replace that sex-discriminating blessing with a simple ""sheasani b'tzalmo"", because we've realized that the Sages who came up with this stuff originally, even though they were learned men, we have, as a society, built on their scholarship and surpassed it.  We have the perspective of a history that they did not have.  We have the perspective of science that they did not have.  They were learned, but they were not God himself.

Since we now know moral principles that they did not -- that the sexes are equal, that gays are equally deserving of respect, etc. -- we can't expect everyone to abandon their moral principles and stick to an ancient custom that we've since shown to be immoral.  Following this particular part of halacha should absolutely not be forced on anyone, because when it is, we see the terrible effects; there have been documentaries and documentaries about the plight of women and gays forced into living a life of oppression, and how much they suffered *in real life*.  These are not abstract concerns.  If you want to remain committed to gender discrimination as a specifically halachic principle, go ahead, but don't force others to commit to the same kind of discrimination.","1354320090"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I didn't say that the Constitution guarantees a phone call. I said that your right to a phone call is backed by the Constitution. The Constitution grants us certain rights when dealing with the law; one of them being the Sixth Amendment, which grants us the right to council (a lawyer). Denying someone their phone call would be argued as denying someone their right to council. It goes on a state-by-state basis, they have their own regulations on how to handle anyone they're detaining. With most states, I believe 48 hours is the time-frame in which they have to grant you a phone-call. If you ask for an attorney, they generally have to get them right away, or they'll be in direct violation of the Constitution.

They can deny you a phone-call for a certain amount of time, a good rule of thumb is to just ask for an attorney, and then shut the hell up. But, if you really need your phone-call, you generally shouldn't say who you're trying to call; just ask for your phone-call. If they deny you the phone-call, any lawyer will argue that it is the same as denying you your Constitutional right to council.

Since then, I try to offer whatever extra snack I have to people, if I can. I would say for every twenty people I talk to, one acts ""ungrateful."" The rest smile and say thank you. Maybe they'll eat it, maybe they won't, but it's what I can offer and I don't think it's my place to judge.

I think there's a difference in the trans built for the bigger engines. I think that's the type build trans I have, but with a medium power but high torque engine. Same chassis, different engine, the trans. goes at expected time (200k+?) but I think my model has a stronger transmission. Makes sense, eh?

as far as the v8 interview is concerned.  it was a time kill.  and when they 3 sat down muffin said ""i hope you know i'm going to troll the shit out of you"" so i had to out-troll him.  the interview was fun, and not awkward, we make mean jokes to have fun off camera as well.  it's just our dynamic, so it came out in the live interview.  sorry if some of you were turned off.  we had a blast.

as far as other interviews are concerned: i hope you guys are enjoying them.  i try to get away from general broad sweeping questions but sometimes they sit me down with a player and say, ""30 seconds till live"" and i don't have time to really think.  i normally take 2-3 minutes building a conversation with them, getting to know them and prefacing all my questions with them and i think that's where the natural conversation flows from.  

i'd hope you guys don't see it as awkward, because, imo, my interviews are the least awkward things out there.  but maybe that's just me. :D

Anyway, thanks for all the feedback!

EDIT: about the funny side of things, that is part of the reason IPL approached me to interview here.  they know me and my interview from Reign of Gaming and it's the exact style they want.  so as far as profesisonalism is concerned, i'm being myself, which is what they wanted.  and it's a effective bgalance, imo, of fun and informative.","1354320101"

Forget everything else that had happened with this team. If Haden and Taylor had played every game we would be 6-5 right now (Cowboys, Ravens, Bengals wins). We'd would be controlling our own destiny in terms of the playoff race.

If nothing changes between now and next year and we stay healthy the full year, we'll make the playoffs. We have the talent. We're a developing team. If we fire Shurmur/Heckert we will take a step back and have another losing season. ","1354320108"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Keynesian economics =/= formal economics. Aggregate demand is not the same thing as demand and it is not same thing that you were implying. It is a measure of spending. If you do subscribe to Keynesian it is not about demand being more important. It's about downturns in the economy being caused by decreasing in spending and a delay in the decrease price supplied due to sticky wages etc. Keynesian economics thinks that it's easy to spur demand usually by increasing nominal spending either by increasing money supply or government spending if you are in a liquidity trap. This is a theory about what causes recessions and not about supply responding to demand. This is one theory about recessions, other theories involve monetary policy or supply malinvestment etc. 

Yes, real demand for goods and services is what drives supply. Yes, according Keynesian economic theories changes in aggregate demand (not the same) can lead to recessions because businesses can not lower prices. This is not what I was responding to. Aggregate demand cannot always be the inciting cause if it so easy to influence. ","1354320112"

It may have been a bad past call.  And most of us here are normal folks like you that dont know medical fancy things.  Its hard to put your trust in doctors when the decision is so big, but they are professionals.  They have dedicated their lives to this study of our bodies, so keep that in mind.

There are tons of 'what ifs' that haunt me too.  But what helps me is just planning past the shitfest that is the hospital... just plan what you will do when it is said and done, regardless of the pathway.  that may help.

If what you are suggesting is that scratches cause **death** then you're probably wrong there too. There haven't been a single instance on the show where a human has been killed by a zombie scratch.  There was an occasion in season 2 where Rick suggested that a zombie scratch might kill you (in the episode where he and Shane try to ditch Randall at the school) but as we learn with the benefit of hindsight he was most likely just trying to hide the truth from Shane (that people become zombies once they die regardless of whether or not they have been bitten).","1354320124"

"tifu","t5_2to41","I was a naive late teen, who, whilst no virgin, had been in two long term relationships. In both cases, sex was something we had planned and talked about for weeks before actually doing it. I'd never had a one night stand.

When I arrived at University I saw a stunning girl, Sonia, but didn't have the confidence to do or say anything. At a Christmas party she came over, quite out of the blue, sat on my knee and said, I'm feeling sleepy, lets get a taxi and you can take me home."" 

We came back to campus where we lived in the same halls. She held my arm said ""are you coming up for a coffee?""

""Do you have decaf? 'Cos if you're tired the normal stuff will keep you awake.""

She muttered something I didn't catch. Of course, when we got to her room she closed the door and sat on the bed. I sat next to her and saw there wasn't even a kettle! 

I went back to my room and brought back two instant, decaf coffees.

She (amazingly, now I look back) let me back in, got completely naked, climbed into bed, ignored my coffee, gestured for me to join her, which I did. As I began to acress her body I discovered she had almost instantly fallen asleep.

I lay next to her for a while, stroked her smooth skin on her back then went to sleep thinking, Ah well. What a lovely girl. She must really like me to want to snuggle up to me. Perhaps she's right not to take it TOO fast though I'm sure my new girlfriend will want to make love at some point in the coming days or weeks.

At daft o clock in the morning she woke up, rolled over and asked me, ""what are you doing here?""

""Trying to sleep?""

""Im tired. It's best if you go to your own room.""

The next day. Six of my friends were gathered and asked where I got to. I told them of my new girlfriend and how I'd fancied her for ages but never summoned up the courage to say anything.

Alex: ""why didn't you just ask her for a shag? I did.""
James: ""yeah, that's why she stays up late in the common room. She wouldn't be offended. It was her that asked me for it when I shagged her.""

Me, shocked that they could talk in such a way about my new love said they were taking the piss.

They weren't. Four of my six friends had slept with Sonia. I never did. In fact she never spoke to me again.

I do have an old photograph somewhere of her sitting on my knee, asking me to leave with her, tucked away in the attic though. If I find it, I'll scan and post it.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;I don't agree with the settlements, but how much more legitimacy does the PA have over Hamas? How many times have they been able to negotiate with Israel (even though their demands for right of return to over 5 million people who have never stepped foot in Israel, along with control of East Jerusalem which houses the temple mount and western wall, two of Judaism's holiest sites, which they know won't be met, are a wrench in the process, as are the Israeli settlements), even though they are run by a man who wrote his doctoral thesis about ""the secret relationship between Nazism and Zionism""? Which party just got authority over a Palestinian state yesterday?

I don't understand Sammy, didn't the Nazis and Zionists both feel that Jews had no place in Europe? The Jewish people have a right of return not only for those who have never stepped foot into Israel but also those who have no ties to the land whatsoever. That's okay to you but Palestinians who have strong ties to the area should not be allowed back? Come on Sammy, that makes no sense!

&gt;It tells you something about who will actually win between the two governments in the end- the one that renounced its former violence and is trying to negotiate for a peaceful solution, not the one blacklisted as a terrorist organization in over 33 countries.

Hamas supported the PLO move at the UN and they are working on unifying. I hope neither has to win but instead both realize that working together is better than working apart. Wouldn't you agree, Sammy?

&gt;There is no embargo in the West Bank- there is a low (and equal) amount of Israeli and Arab civilian casualties, a much better economy which translates to a heightened standard of living- there are real advantages to using diplomacy over terrorism, something Hamas (and you) don't seem to understand.

Yet the Palestinians don't have their freedom in the West Bank, they have their land stolen and Israel refuses to stop stealing that land. You feel that the people of Hamas should pursue putting themselves in apartheid, Sammy? You know better than that buddy!","1354320134"

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","First thing to note: Labour has done very well (despite its leadership, or lack thereof). Average swing of 19% to them (or 23% ignoring Rotheram - see below). UKIP's average increase was only 7% (5% ignoring R.). Aside from Corby these were all safe seats, and all stayed that way. UKIP is nowhere near winning, even in Rotheram. Not that this isn't a good result for UKIP - it's always nice to see non-big-three parties doing well.

Looking at votes, we have a significant decrease in all votes for the big three parties (Labour, Conservatives, Lib Dems). In terms of raw numbers, they are pretty much the same - these are (mostly) people who vote at general elections, but can't be bothered to vote at other times. I would suggest they have no strong party allegiance, but vote for whichever of the three they prefer at that time. In percentage terms, the Tories and Lib Dems obviously got hit much worse - but these are (mostly) safe Labour seats, so the same number fewer votes means a bigger change. Plus they are in Government (in theory), and the Government tends to do badly in mid-term elections.

UKIP did see a vote increase (ignoring Corby, due to the lack of data), but it isn't much. The best they did was the 2,428 new votes in Rotheram, but other than that, they averaged 360 new votes (773 with R.). This suggests to me that those voting UKIP are die-hard supporters; i.e. those who *can* be bothered to go out and vote. So yes, UKIP is picking up support, but not much. And this is all with a vastly-disproportionate amount of publicity; with all the nonsense in the press about the EU and ECHR, UKIP have been getting an awful lot of coverage lately - something they may not get at a general election.

To me, then, this doesn't in any way suggest that UKIP is replacing the Lib Dems as the ""third"" party. If anything, it suggests that the Lib Dems are finally being treated as one of the mainstream parties, and UKIP is taking the place the Lib Dems used to occupy (as the ""plucky underdog""). As outsiders, they are expected to do much better in mid-term elections (although the Lib Dems still beat them in the PCC elections), but may be unable to repeat this in a general election.

But what if they do? Even if UKIP are able to replicate this sort of result at a general election (i.e. hold their vote, with a drop in Tory and Lib Dem support), it may not help them, but Labour. Given the FPTP system, coming second gets you nowhere, you have to win - and in these elections, Even where UKIP did come second, they were in second by a long way. To win, they would need to pinch an awful lot of Tory voters, in a safe Tory seat (otherwise while UKIP will do better, Labour would still end up winning).

And even if UKIP did manage to scrape a seat (possibly by pouring most of their funding and efforts there)... one seat is still pretty worthless (as far as 5-10, perhaps). Look at the Greens; they won their first seat (go them), and have been able to do nothing with it. Even the Lib Dems are barely having an impact with their 57. UKIP isn't going anywhere.

Note on Rotheram: this constituency just went crazy - the BNP came in third, Respect fourth. Without seeing polls, I don't know how much of that was due to the adoption mess, but I think this case is definitely the exception rather than a new rule. And even with this significant mess, Labour still had a comfortable lead.

**tl;dr**: While UKIP may have become the ""third"" party, that may simply be because the Lib Dems have moved up to being a ""first/second"" party (along with Labour and the Tories).

[*Disclaimer*: I fundamentally disagree with a lot of UKIP policies and positions, but the same goes for Labour and the Tories. Of the bigger parties, the closest I associate with is the Lib Dems, but am an activist (or sorts) for a different minor party. My opinion is likely to be biased by this. However, the facts above are facts.]","1354320139"

Someone linked me to some blog post about shit tests and none of it resonated with me or any of my friends at all. It was so bizarre.

* What style do you like to play? aggro, combo, control, etc...
* Are you willing to spend money on this deck?
* Do you have a favorite or preferred color?
* Is this to play competitively, at your local FNM, or just among friends?

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The state level doesn't dictate how money is spent i the staffing pool, at least mine didn't.

One problem is that education funding is tied to property taxes, since most of it is local.  That means that rich areas have good schools and poor areas don't.  One state has tried to address that, Vermont, by passing legislation to move some funds to lower revenue school districts so that they can afford to provide a higher quality of education.

&gt; If you have one of the students I described you basically lose a teacher + teaching aide + a class room.

That was up to your district.   Was that high school the only one in the district?  There may not have been a way to consolidate more zero function students into one setting.

Nor is it necessarily the case that it would be cheaper to pay for her to go to a private program.

&gt; The problem isn't the amount of funding, it is how its being spent. US troops complain about the lack of body armor but spend 50,000USD on toilet seats then you have problems and you don't just write a bigger check.

So we need to de-fund special education in public schools in order to increase spending on defense?  That's asinine.  I agree money needs to be spent better.  But cutting special education to increase defense isn't the way to do it.  Military is already the single largest discretionary spending area.  If soldiers need more body armor, there has to be room somewhere in that budget it.  Or we could put less people in harms way and reduce military spending altogether.  Or that funding can come from things like farm subsidies, which are a boondoggle.  Some help, yes.  But in other cases we're paying large corporations to not grow corn on land they weren't going to grow corn on anyways.

So don't tell me that cutting special education is about spending money wiser when there are things that can be cut that don't hurt kids and families.","1354320156"

There is a membership fee that you pay twice a year (somewhere in the 1,000s of dollars) and you get passage on this new freeway.

Just build it right above the existing freeways, two lanes wide (cause how many people are gonna use it?) and only people who pay can use it.

I would pay good money to have a pay only highway that follows main routes with less traffic.

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","I'm not very good at catching brown trout, although I've caught a few but I do *a lot* of steelhead fishing in Cleveland, Pennsylvania, Buffalo, and Rochester.

In my experience, sucker spawns and blood dots have produced the most fish, usually in light pinks, sometimes dark pink, brown, mint, yellow, and orange with a maximum of a size 10 hook. Normally, I try to keep them on size 12 or 14. It really depends on the day, water conditions, and fishing pressure. On Saturday, you might slay them on yellow and on Sunday they might not even look at yellow, but you'll kill them on white. They tend to work year-round also. I've caught some big fish using egg patterns, but have caught some of my biggest on wooly buggers. Olive, black, white/grizzly, brown, or purple seem to be the best, but work better in the spring. I usually tie them on a size 8 or 10 hook, but a size or two bigger probably wouldn't hurt. The other one I use all the time is the [Clouser Minnow](http://www.edgeangling.com/FLY73-2_0.html?gclid=CIC7wObx97MCFQpgMgodCGoAeg). It doesn't really work, but I had a good day on it once so use it in desperation all the time.

As far as brown trout go, I've caught a few while steelhead or salmon fishing in the fall, and I caught them on various colored sucker spawns. I tried stripping streamers for them with no such luck. I've caught *tons* of little 8-15 inch ones in the summer in Rochester tributaries on BH Hare's Ears, Copper Johns, or prince nymphs, but have better luck early in the morning by playing the hatch. I think the best day I had in summer was late in the season dry flying trico spinners, wooly ants, and grasshoppers at the ass-crack of dawn. Like I said though, I just started fly-fishing for brownies so I am not very good at it.","1354320174"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; religion says that contingent beings exist because they were created by a pre-existent reality.

I don't think the word ""contingent"" means what you think it means.

conÂ·tinÂ·gent  [kuhân-tin-juhânt]
adjective
1.  dependent for existence, occurrence, character, etc., on something not yet certain; conditional (often followed by on  or upon  ): Our plans are contingent on the weather.
2.  liable to happen or not; uncertain; possible: They had to plan for contingent expenses.

So basically you are saying that hypothetical beings, that may or may not be real, that may or may not exist, exist because they were created in the time before time.  You just managed to contradict yourself several times in a single sentence.

&gt; I have never heard an alternative theory that can be verified by science that makes better logical sense.

I also don't think the word ""theory"" means what you think it means.  Theory is an explanation, with repeatable evidence that confirm that explanation, that describes some observation.  As you yourself just said, these hypothetical beings may or may not exist - they are hypothetical.  They are not observed.  Therefore you can't have a theory (or even a hypothesis) about them - because to do so you must first show what exactly you are trying to hypothesize or describe.

Furthermore, religion is not a theory.  A theory is a a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.  Religion does not deal with the natural world, has no body of facts that have been confirmed even once.  Therefore religion cannot have an ""alternate theory"" because to have an alternative, it must first *be* a theory.","1354320174"
"Planetside","t5_2s48x","To help with the understanding.

Roll is controlled by the ailerons on the wings of most planes, causing the body to rotate when the fins are pointed alternate directions. 

Pitch is controlled by the Elevator on the rear stabilizer(rear wing) of the plane. 

Yaw is controlled by the Rudder on the tail fin, which causes the plane to skid through the air sideways. Fun fact, single engine prop planes will skid through the air sideways due to the torque of the engine if the rudder is not applied to counter the effect.

It specifically seems not to do anything for me on air vehicles Could anyone elaborate?

It basically presses the W key down for you. In ground vehicles, you go forward. Useful if you're lazy. Would be more useful if it kept going while you're typing or checking the map. In air vehicles, it increases thrust to maximum. Less useful since you don't slow down when you let go of W normally. You could just press W until you're at max speed, then let go.

We originally did all of our own screen-printing which allowed us to keep our costs very low. I believe we sold shirts for 5 dollars a piece at points. Merch sales really began to pick up when we started having more than one design, and keeping those designs fully stocked. I feel that merely the image of having merch has people take you more seriously than normal off of the bat. We also really picked up when people legitimately started to come out and see us because they were fans of our music, and not just at the show because we were opening for their friends bands or what not. 

Screen-printing your own merch can be relatively easy and inexpensive. It's also a hell of a lot of fun to get drunk with your friends and make TShirts. If you think about it, you're probably just sitting around and getting drunk and talking shit anyway, might as well have some fun!","1354320183"

Not to mention that Hip Hop/ EDM are pretty much entirely memes... shit... they are complete genres of music based on a few drum breaks... I could go on forever.... but please... if you love music... I encourage you to understand this concept...

Music progresses through ""memes"" , someone makes a small innovation that has a good sound, people love it , and BAM a whole new style is born.  

Rock n Roll came about by the simple tweak of speeding up the blues... 

Reggae... yes, the word and genre Reggae came about from a simple echo on the rhythm guitar in a rock steady track.  Rock steady guitar is usually play on the upbeat or the **AND** ..1 **AND** 2 **AND** 2 **AND**... applying an echo gave the stutter sounding 1 **ANDa** 2 **ANDa** 3 **ANDa** 4.     

The word Reggae literally comes from musicians imitating this guitar sound... 1 **Reggae** 2 **Reggae** 3 **Reggae** 4. 

&gt;Derrick Morgan stated:

&gt;We didn't like the name rock steady, so I tried a different version of 'Fat Man'. It changed the beat again, it used the organ to creep. Bunny Lee, the producer, liked that. He created the sound with the organ and the rhythm guitar. It sounded like 'reggae, reggae' and that name just took off. Bunny Lee started using the world [sic] and soon all the musicians were saying 'reggae, reggae, reggae'.[4]


Shit... If that ain't a meme... I don't know what one is..

Finally, if OP Likes DNB I kind of find it hard to believe that he hasn't seen this....

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","&gt;If Newton's laws are purely descriptive then everything is purely descriptive. They explain how motion works (in a macro sense) and are certainly falsifiable

""They ~~explain~~ **describe** how motion works"". We simply disagree on the distinction between descriptions and explanations. That's fine. Many disagreements can be reduced to the meaning of words (this is certainly true of the free will debates). Interestingly some dictionaries indentify descriptions and explanations as synonyms. Just another reason why I think the distinction between those two words is almost never important.

Not everything would be purely descriptive. ""What we see"" implies that the phenomenon is directly observable. The idea that all matter and energy in the universe existed in an area smaller than a grain of sand is not directly observable, and neither is the idea that all life on Earth shared a common ancestor. I still call those ideas scientific because they are based on verifiable observations and logic, which, to me, is what makes knowledge scientific. If it can't be verified by observation or inferred by verified observations, then there is no evidence that it exists at all. That's what separates scientific knowledge from revelation, intuition, and mythology. 

Falsifiability isn't the important quality that distinguishes science from non-science. Descriptions and explanations from astrology are falsifiable, but that doesn't make astrology scientific. Those descriptions and explanations still have to be consistent with verifiable observations of the universe. It's verifiable observation and logic that separates scientific knowledge from all other forms of knowledge.

I agree with you and epursimuove that descriptions can be predictive. Even someone who notes the positions of stars in the night sky is assuming that those same stars will be in those same positions the next night, and thus asserting that those stars exist at those particular positions. Their description of the night sky can be independently verified by other people looking up at those same positions in the night sky. If something actually exists, then it should be independently verifiable. Their description of the night sky is scientific in the sense that it is based on verifiable observations, and can thus can be independently verified by anyone. If it can't be independently verified, then their description of the night sky is about as valid as invisible fire breathing dragons in my garage.

We probably just have a fundamental difference of opinion of what constitutes science. You've used the words falsify and predictive as requisites of science. Both of these words apply to descriptions. Any description that is based on observation is also falsifiable through observation.

Because-your threats of holding American people responsible will be counter productive and you and people like you will continue to come out on the short end of the stick, so to speak. 

Let me reiterate, I am for peace, a peaceful resolution for the Palestinians and the Israelis. If that is not enough for you and anybody who might feel the same as you, I may have to change my position, which is not something I want to do. 

I encourage you to read through my past comments to get a better understanding of my position on the situation before you continue to make any more threats, especially towards me. 

Now, I am not making threats against you or people who think like you do. If you take it that way, its because you and yours apparently don't know how to move forward.

Say both Adam and Eve have the heterozygous recessive gene for multiple sclerosis (MS). They have four kids. One of these kids has no MS gene, two have recessive heterozygous gene for MS, one has homozygous MS combination meaning they have MS. 

Now, one of their kids is homozygous for MS and if he has a kid with a sibling that has no MS gene, all their kids (grandkids to Adam and Eve) with have a recessive MS gene. If the homozygous MS kid had a kid with a hetrozygous MS sibiling, then there is a 50% chance of their kid having MS and 50% they will have MS recessive. 

This will continue through the generations until the statistics have compounded to the point that every kid has homozygous MS gene combination, meaning the entire human race from Adam and Eve ultimately have MS. Now change MS to any mutation/disease in the genome that is amplified in the same way due to coming from only two people, and that's why the human race cannot be descended from two people.

I think it's that with only 7 bullets, players tend to shoot more conservatively with the deagle -making sure they let the recoil cooldown- while with the p250 people just start spamming, and thus their shots start going over their target's head.

But mostly, it's probably just a mental thing. If you think you'll grab a head-shot you will - If you think you can't you won't try to.

"technology","t5_2qh16","I've been using iTunes since version 1.0 and it's never given me any issues [and if it had, I wouldn't mind saying so].

I do agree that it should not have 'empty' features. Stuff should be there for a good reason.

The 'Ping' thing seemed like a nifty idea, but I've never really used it. Apparently, nobody else is either. I don't think we're going to miss it if it's left out.

It's no longer purely a music player, it's true, but I love the way it works. The size argument is useless. Current hard drives are big enough for large libraries. 

The only thing that matters is that it happens fast. I certainly don't want to wait for sluggish software to catch up. I don't notice any sluggishness while using it. YMMV of course, but my experience is good. It was not good on a PC, is why I stopped using it. I've seen the PC version and that sucked the big one, I'm not fucking kidding. It was horrendous. As good as it is on my Mac, as bad it was on the PC. I hated that version.

On my Mac, if I said anything other than that it has worked well for me for over a decade, I'd be lying. I'm your huge fanboi before it was cool, yessir, but not even Apple is going to make me use a piece of crap software for a decade. That is just not happening.

Since the iTunes store came to the Mac, I have never bought more music than I do now. It's just too goddamn easy to give in to the mood of the moment and download whatever took my fancy at the time. And, it's super smooth. Slate doesn't like the download manager? I fucking love it. That is some seriously good engineering.

"beer","t5_2qhg1","Great Lakes Brewing Company throws out exceptional seasonal offerings. Notably, Blackout Stout and Nosferatu. Everyone in the state goes nuts over their Christmas Ale but I don't like the style so I won't give my opinion on it. Edmund Fitzgerald is arguably the best standard porter in the world. The rest of their year-round lineup is good but nothing special, in my opinion.

The Brew Kettle has an amazing IPA called White Rajah. One of my favorite regularly-available beers.

Thirsty Dog's Siberian Night is a great imperial stout.

Hoppin' Frog makes several very good beers but probably most famous for B.O.R.I.S. The Crusher. It's an oatmeal Russian imperial stout. It's delicious and the barrel-aged version is even better. I'd say the Hop Heathen black IPA is arguably their second best beer.

Weasel Boy won gold in the Imperial Stout category at this year's GABF for Anastasia Russian Imperial Stout.

Columbus Brewing Company offers a great IPA. It's just called IPA. Their double IPA called Bodhi is absolutely wonderful but it's not yet being bottled. Rumor has it that they will begin bottling it in 2013. It's currently BeerAdvocate's highest rated beer brewed in Ohio. BeerAdvocate ratings shouldn't be taken as gospel, but a high rating usually indicates excellence.

Fat Head's Brewery has a world class IPA called Head Hunter. It's second on BA's ratings of Ohio brews. Over the past month I've been trying to decide if I like this or White Rajah better. I think this has taken the crown.

Barley's Brewing makes several great beers but they don't bottle so you'll have to go to one of their 2 brewpubs in Columbus. Fortune Teller East India Imperial Porter is probably my favorite. The Bloodthirst Wheat is pretty universally enjoyed by beer geeks and non-beer geeks.

Rockmill Brewery makes some very fine Belgian style ales. I've had the saison and witbier so far and will be trying the rest soon.

Christian Moerlein Brewing Company makes some solid lagers and their Oktoberfest called Fifth and Vine was one of my favorites of the style this year.

Jackie O's brews up some fantastic stuff as well. The Dark Apparition is an RIS that is their highest rated beer, but I haven't had the opportunity to try that yet. Great IPAs though.

This is all according to my experiences and I've still probably missed a couple. Having said that, if you drink these beers, I give a 99% guarantee that you will enjoy them. This is what I consider to be the best that Ohio has to offer. Cheers!","1354320195"

I fail to see the effective difference.  Strengthening an evolutionary argument degrades a creationist one.  My point is that this post does neither.

Points about how a creationist might realistically respond are irrelevant.  I'm giving hypothetical challenges that I don't believe you've responded to, other than to say ""Oh, you must not argue with creationists.""

I'm also not writing a handbook on ""Great Ways to Argue with Creationists.""  This is instead a criticism of the post, which is asserting in the title that this video of an octopus squirming on land defeats the creationist position.

This is about a critical understanding of our own justifications.  A strong process is better than a strong conviction that our conclusions are sound.  I certainly hope you don't disagree with that.","1354320199"

From my experience Ich is quite an easy to treat/managable disease. It also pays to use a premium medication.. Aquasonic's Ichonex is available most places.

Ich usually is best treated daily for 4-5 days at MINIMUM with a raised tank temperature to completely kill the disease, what some people don't realize is that even though their fish may be visibly clear of the disease it doesn't necessarily mean their environment is clear.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","While there will always be budget limitations for the show, and therefore limitations to what ends up on screen, it seems likely to me that there will be more money available for future season budgets as the DVD money and other revenue pours into HBO's coffers. Once 3 or 4 seasons are out on DVD, HBO will be rolling in extra cash from the show.

While the hard numbers are not public, reports say they are currently spending between 60 and 70 million for season 3, which is supposed to be a somewhat significant increase over the first two seasons. I'm guess that means somewhere between 15 and 20 percent more. They had to ask for extra money for the Blackwater episode last season. They reportedly did not have to ask for more money for Season 3 once production started.

Down the line, assuming the show's popularity continues to grow, it seems logical for HBO to reinvest in the show with increased budgets in order to retain and capture more fans.

So, while the books' elements will not ever be fully rendered by the show (since GRRM intentionally wrote the books with the idea that they could never fit into a Hollywood budget), I'm confident that we'll see much and more of the complex visuals from the books as each season progresses.

tl;dr yes with caveats","1354320207"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","3. Dig deep.  Do you really not negatively stereotype people on first sight occasionally? I know I do, even as a minority myself.  Now, imagine that someone more inclined to racism than you is living near a minority family.   Unwarranted derogatory remarks are quite possible in a situation like that.
4. I know plenty of people who have been followed or watched in a store, and they were dressed and acted like any average person who went out to get a snack.  Myself included.
6. It's not that teaching this is wrong, it's just that it makes some people feel left out of history, and of society.  I want to feel proud of my culture as well, but that is made difficult.  Your response to this statement shows exactly how you are privileged.  You don't NEED to think about the amount of people in your race represented in history.
8. This was written in 1988, I believe, and SOME but not ALL of the points here are a bit outdated.  At the time, it would probably have been difficult for a minority to go out and get something like this published.
9.  People typically know how to style hair that is like their own, and the majority of people have ""white"" hair.  Everyone else has to go to salons that are specifically for their hair type.  This isn't particularly racist, just a matter of preference.  I would never expect a white hairdresser to know how to take care of my hair.
12. If people see a black or latino person walking down the street, they can associate them with their universal stereotype.  If people see a white person, the term redneck doesn't usually come to their minds.
13. I am always nervous speaking in front of a large crowd, thinking that if I mess up, then it will reflect poorly on my race.  Then when I am done, I berate myself for these thoughts.  I have asked other minorities if they have felt this, and many have.
15. People ask me how my race feels about things all of the time.  I usually can't answer.
19. Minorities are so underrepresented in generic cards, that many have made their own lines and companies that make them.  
20. Everyone may feel like that at times, but it should never have anything to do with race, gender, or sexual orientation.  Unfortunately, for many, it does.
24. True racism is when you believe another race to be inferior to your own. The general view of most minorities in America is not a positive one, and this view bleeds into minority communities as well. I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear, but my main point is that yes, its possible to be racist against white people, but at least in America, you are so surrounded by white culture that it is very difficult. An inability to see whites as completely inferior leads to a facade of superiority that some minorities show in order to protect themselves. Also, it's not that people are ""never"" racist against white people, it's that the situations in which it happens usually have to do with verbal or physical abuse, and not when someone in a real life position of power can label you based on assumptions, stereotypes, and their feeling of superiority.  Racism affects minorities in America as a whole, while whites feel it individually.

Many people forget just how much a scolding from an authority figure can have since now that most of us are adults, we think we are suddenly magically above getting upset over such things. Frankly, with our current justice system based on a tier of how much money you have, this sounds like a better alternative than maybe spending a night or two in an overcrowded jail cell.

It could be that you aren't aggressive (betting) until you hit a great hand; which almost never happens. The others won't give you action if they've noticed.

I suppose that ties into my atheism in the sense that my desire for the lives of murderers to be ended is emotional in a similar manner to my desire for the afterlife to exist; and both have long since been beaten down by my logical streak.","1354320222"

My reasons for supporting the death penalty aren't *atheistic* because they have nothing to do with the fact that I'm an atheist. So no, my lack of belief in a god/s has no bearing on my support of the death penalty. 

The miscarriages of justice argument isn't the silver bullet you think it is, and thats because it doesn't actually address whether the death penalty is right or wrong when applied correctly... What the miscarriage argument addresses is the negative consequences which result when the death penalty is applied incorrectly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree that if you can be tried as an adult you can behave as one. However, I strongly disagree with your country's policies. I don't think 15 year olds should be tried as adults unless they've shown that they have the same maturity as one. In the same sense, I don't think a 15 year old is fully prepared for an intimate physical relationship.

Most 15 year olds aren't emotionally or mentally mature adults. It's a well-accepted fact amongst development circles, though I will admit that the brain still holds many mysteries. Here's a few sources for you ([1](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/criminal_justice_section_newsletter/crimjust_juvjus_Adolescence.authcheckdam.pdf) [2](http://ontheirlevel.org/whats-happening/maturation-of-the-teen-brain/) [3](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-teen-brain-still-under-construction/complete-index.shtml)) if you don't believe me, and many more can be found with some prodding. A fifteen year old can give their consent vocally, but it doesn't mean much IMO. More often than not they won't truly understand or be prepared for the implications, emotions, and consequences behind physical intimacy. Some will, yes, but those few are not the majority. 

Keep in mind that the average fifteen year old has never felt independence from their parents, has never held any true responsibility, and is very likely to seek short-term gratification rather than thinking about the long-term result.

If you know all of this about a fifteen-year-old, and you are a fully mature adult, I would hope that you would let them live their lives for a few years longer before trying to push for such intimate and consequential behavior with them. On top of possibly not understanding physical intimacy, most teenagers fall to social manipulation quite easily (especially if it's from an adult). Technically a 3-year-old can say the word ""yes"" too, but that doesn't mean they understand the meaning behind what they just said.","1354320230"

Fourteen B-29s were lost.[7] Approximately 16 square miles (41 km2) of the city were destroyed and some 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the resulting firestorm, more immediate deaths than either of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[8][9] .....
The figure of roughly 100,000 deaths, provided by Japanese and American authorities, both of whom may have had reasons of their own for minimizing the death toll, seems to me arguably low in light of population density, wind conditions, and survivors' accounts. With an average of 103,000 inhabitants per square mile (396 people per hectare) and peak levels as high as 135,000 per square mile (521 people per hectare), the highest density of any industrial city in the world, and with firefighting measures ludicrously inadequate to the task, 15.8 square miles (41 km2) of Tokyo were destroyed on a night when fierce winds whipped the flames and walls of fire blocked tens of thousands fleeing for their lives.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","There is a lot of trust needed to have someone join you for sex. It's really up to you if you can do it. My husband and I use to engage in that lifestyle a lot and to be honest we never thought about it further than him wearing condoms. However, now that I'm older and less impulsive, I would never suggest you risk it unless you are 100%. A child is forever, but being careful with condoms is a pretty big safety net. Side note, threesomes are fun. ","1354320234"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've played the same golf course all my life.  The number one hole is approximately 310-315 yards, with a small incline at the end towards the green.  I had never even come close to hitting it.  I'm 5.9 and not a noted athlete.  I used to swing like John Daly, but I lost a lot of balls that way.  One day I was invited to a bachelor party game for one of the most popular guys in my hometown.  There was about 20 to 25 guys on the tee watching people hitting and making fun of the misses while they waited for their turn.  My practice swing felt good, so I thought, fuck it, swing away.  I nailed that ball perfectly.  It made a b-line towards the green.  It had been a dry month, so it hit the ground with a big bounce and rolled towards the green. Nobody said a word.  I casually walked to my bag, giving nothing away.  Put my club away and made my way towards the green.  I was technically on the fringe, but I still chipped it in for an eagle.","1354320235"

PS3 gets the same as Xbox except Mass Effect 2 comes with Kasumi and The Lair of the Shadow Broker which is what came on the standard Mass Effect 2 disc for PS3 and Bring Down The Sky for Mass Effect 1 which they integrated into the base game for the PS3 release.

The whole pack just seems strange. It is definitely aimed at people who have heard about the series but haven't played any of the games. It offers no benefits over purchasing the games seperately beyond price and is still going to feel incomplete without the extra dlc that was released for mass effect 3 because of how people felt about the original ending to it.","1354320240"

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","Ok, so I just clicked and watched the Alladin let's play for a bit. Everything was pretty solid, and the only thing that was a little off were the flashing pictures/words that came up for emphasis on the screen. I personally didn't mind them all that much since they were there ever so briefly and saw what you were going for, but some people might get distracted by that if all they came for was the game and some good commentary.

Then I decided to watch some of the first slender video, just to see if and how well you managed the face-cam. At first the ""p"" sounds were a bit poppy but I saw you adjust your mic and it seemed to fix itself. The face-cam was ok in size, probably could go smaller but that's just preference. It also got pretty bright and a little hard to see you at times, maybe because you had a white wall behind you and lots of lights? Since slender is a game that requires a bunch of focus, it's hard to keep talking when you are looking out for his creepy ass, and I noticed a lot of dead air at times. Try to make it funny when it gets intense, or if you are going for scary, cry? Just be sure not to be quiet, especially on face-cam when people can see you. Of course let's playing slender can be a unique experience so who is to say you have that issue all the time?

So that is about all I've got, hopefully that helped.","1354320251"

The tank is a Juwel Rio 180.
The filtering system (for now) is whatever the filter it comes with is called. I might upgrade that down the road some time.

The lighting is 2x45W T5 (the standard light fixture).

CanÂ´t remember all the plant names off the top of my head, but here are some of them:

Spatiphyllum Quatro

Microsorum Pteropus

Anubias barteri var. nana

Echinodorus Bleheri

Althernanthera Cardinalis


I feel that the tank needs some taller background plants, but the ones i had in mind were not available today. I might go for some Cryptocoryne aponogetifolia.


Right now, livestock is not present in the tank, since i only set it up a couple of hours ago.  My planned livestock for the tank is as follows:

1 GBR pair
1 Apistogramma Baenschi pair
18 x Nannostomus sp. II
10 x Corydoras Pygmaeus
1 x Panaque Sp. (L204) Flash Panaque.

Littledot amps are good too but O2 is tried and proven to drive the piss out of Q701/K701/2. You will be hard pressed to find a btter amp (non portable) unless you really like coloring your sound.

Fiio E9 wont drive them well. It will drive them, mind you, just not to their fullest potential.

E10 is a DAC/Amp combo, not an amp. Just to clarify. The E10-&gt;O2 should make a significant difference. Try it. see what you think. Hearing is believing. (and so are measurements and waveforms).

As to your IEM question, there are plenty. But it depends on what you want and what you are looking for. i'd take the UE900, westone 3, westone um3x, or shure SE535 over the AKG any day. but thats because i know what i like in my sound and its not the same thign that AKG delivers. I need more bass than that. I like the HD650 type sound ideally. And maybe HE500 type sound. Both need amping, ofcourse, so the price range quickly climbs.

As you've certainly noticed, Aggies are really excited to finally have a team to get behind and we sometimes go overboard trying to defend the team. 

While you and I don't often see eye-to-eye, it's nice to have a voice of reason in this thread to tone down the over-enthusiasm from Aggies. While I think we're playing as well as anyone in the nation right now, we're not the second coming of the 2001 Miami team either.

Look around for an 'upgraded version' I got this awhile ago; I believe it was the monitor used for EVO (a fighting game tournament) which would imply the monitor is mostly lagless and was suitable for a ""professional"" environment. I use it with 1920x1080 (still) next to a smaller non-widescreen monitor and really like it for both 360/PS3/PC. The buttons are a little wonky, that's about it.

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","that's fine and you make valid points, but I was more referring to the historical backgrounds and concepts of said sports.  While it can be theorized that everything started in India with the earliest references to wrestling being found in the Mahabharata, it's completely possible that the Greeks developed their form endogenously.  While Greco-Roman was created in France much later, that's not exactly the style that I practice.  If anything, the submission wrestling that I study is basically pure pankration and also some Israeli Krav elements.

As we all know, BJJ was developed from Kodokan Judo, Judo being derived from JuJutsu, and JuJitsu being of the same budÅ as several other forms.  So, while I definitely agree with what you said about the distinctions and the basic rules and concept differences,  I'll have to dispute that wrestling and BJJ did not come from the same source.

edit: just realized that you are not the same person I was originally talking to.  Anyway, I hope this explains what I was trying to say.  If not, I can try to elaborate.

double edit:  originally, when I said what he said wasn't true about Judo and wrestling, I meant that it seemed like he was saying that one would strictly use judo or wrestling to take an opponent down, and after that a person is using BJJ.  Which is wrong as fuck, as we know.","1354320264"

She's not remotely ready to have a child, unwilling to use necessary preventative methods if she were, uninterested in a physical relationship outside of sex and indicates a disinterest in pursuing a religious fundamentalist type relationship. That leaves friendships as the only viable relationship in the interim with just about every person she's likely to meet.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I played sports throughout most of grade school, and in 8th grade I was a runningback.  One away game, we were losing and the clock was nearly out.  A touchdown would save it for us, but it was looking pretty grim.  The ball was handed to me, much against my wishes, and so I bolted down the field.  I thought I was in the clear, when someone I didn't previously see (bad peripheral vision due to our shitty helmets) comes running at me.  He dives at my waist, and for some reason I just decide to jump as hard as I can.  I wind up accidentally hurdling the guy, as in, my hand touched his back and he went completely under me.  We won.

A few years after that, it was snowing here HARD (I live in Southern AZ, it doesn't happen often) so the entire town was out and about.  I had risked my life to go see my girlfriend, because no one here knows how to deal with any sort of bad weather and as a result automatically shits the bed at driving.  Apparently, death had other plans in mind.  So, we're walking in this winter wonderland.. next to an irrigation canal.  I can't remember why, but I run ahead.. and as soon as I do this, an SUV comes swerving around the corner.. BARELY misses me, and splashes freezing water all over me.  As a result, I fall into the irrigation canal.  This all happens in about 2 seconds.  I remember being completely submerged.. and then fucking pissed.  According to my girlfriend, I leap out of the water and just started tearing after the SUV. (fully soaked, below freezing, still snowing, heavy clothes on)  Oh, did I mention the driver SAW this and didn't stop?  Luckily, the guy still hasn't grasped the concept of friction and didn't make it very far as he slowed down to correct his car and tries to speed away as he sees me getting out of the canal.  He runs into a snowbank, and gets stuck.  He jumps out of his car.  He looks to be in his later 20s, and his response to a soaked, frenzied 16 year old charging at him was, ""IF YOU CALL THE POLICE I'LL SUE YOU!""

It's important to note that I'm still uncharacteristically filled with murderous rage, and screaming at me was probably the last thing he should have done.  He's frozen in fear standing outside of his door, my girlfriend hasn't moved or spoken a word since I fell in, and with all my 130 pound, 5'8 might, I threw my shoulder at him in a tackle as hard as I could.  He went back into his door hard, the door was damaged pretty badly.. and then my rage dissipated and I realized I had just assaulted someone and I was freezing.  I ran back to my girlfriend before the guy could get on his feet, grabbed her hand, and we ran back to her house.  Somehow, I didn't get sick.  I wonder what that guy is up to these days.","1354320269"

Being 10 and invincible/stupid, I was not dressed for mountaineering. Jeans, rubber boots and a jacket.

But, my bad-ass moment was the fact that I crawled down the mountain in a blizzard in mid-winter, with my left leg swollen, purple and hanging at a weird angle. I managed to make my way to a farm and they called my parents.

This was back long before Toonami, and more importantly, before the internet really took hold. Shortly afterwards I discovered Saturday Anime on sci fi channel. It opened up a whole new world for me, as it redefined what I knew about cartoons. There was almost an aura of mystique about the gritty, violent anime from the 80's. Another kid in my 5th grade class had seen Akira and it was all we ever talked about. This anime was a symbol. Art so new to us, with stories that challenged us intellectually, and to add to the cool taboo factor, there was no way in hell our parents would approve of it. At least not until more kid friendly stuff started hitting the States. ","1354320271"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was at a friend's house (married couple with a 1 and a half year old) and we were sitting at the kitchen table playing a game.  I'm completely paranoid around kids, always seeing worst case scenarios unfolding in my mind.  Well, the little boy had been allowed to climb up on the table, and had had me nervous for the past 15 minutes.  He was sitting there next to his father and everyone had continued to just play the game.  Of course with my paranoia I was constantly watching him, and in a moment when his dad was preoccupied by something else, James fell backwards.  

In a split second I had launched myself across the table and caught him by the front of his shirt.  Him being across the table made it kind of a dive for me, and as I grabbed his shirt and he was just held in place leaning back over the floor, there was about 2 seconds of stunned silence as everyone at the table just stared at me.  Then the kid realized what had happened and started to cry and his father relieved me of the awkward hold I had on the front of his shirt.

""Christianity"" is a big tent political term. It encompasses several religious sects, some of which have mutually exclusive beliefs and/or practices. So while he's technically correct that ""Christianity"" isn't a religion (it's actually a politically convenient collection of somewhat-related religions) he's also wrong that ""Christianity"" is a philosophy (because it's a politically convenient collection of somewhat-related religions.)

I'm sure a corporatist like O'Reilly would love to argue that since Christianity is a gigantic megacorporation with several religious subsidiaries, it shouldn't be subject to any of the restrictions upon religion, but all of its subsidiaries should still benefit from any favorable legislation that applies to religions.

It's just like banks claiming they're not banks when being a bank would be inconvenient, but then claiming they're banks when it is.","1354320286"

"trains","t5_2qlps","It doesn't fucking matter what the warning time is, as long as it is at least 20 seconds, and the gates (if equipped) are completely down 5 seconds before the train meets the pavements edge.

Also, if the train had a crossing set up for a maximum of 25mph, and the train was traveling 70, they would have had a warning time of something like 7-8 seconds.   It is obvious that the approaches have been lengthened to provide proper warning for the track speed, and the original design 'documents' have absolutely nothing to do with the case at hand, and it is just thrown in the article as an attempt to make the railroad look like the bad guy. 

In cab video, as well as the event recorder on the crossing itself proves that the active warning system was working EXACTLY as intended. They should be solely going after the truck driver and nobody else, but since the trucking company doesn't have nearly as much money as the railroad, the greedy people in this case will sue the railroad for all they are worth, and as usual, instead of fighting it, the railroad will simply settle out of court.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","It's very easy to say that because we know how bad Partings build was in that situation.  We assume CombatEX knew it because scouting is such a normal thing but he chose not to.  Why?  I only assume because he knew that a player of Partings caliber would be able to pick up on that abnormal probe entry timing and almost always play safe on game point.  Also if the probe leaves warping in buildings, there is a chance it gets scouted without CombatEX knowing it -- A little bit more unlikely because he would be able to count the probes mining and know 1 is missing, it never scouted his base so by the time zealots are out chances are it was/will be seen.

Alright, so we know why CombatEX didn't scout... So why didn't he wait until 3 zealots? My guess would be that Parting went Stalker first in G2 and CombatEX was banking on Parting doing that opener again and sending that zealot in first was the right call.  My guess would be he won G2 and didn't think he could do it two times in a row; so he looked at the BO Parting used (or scouted it in game idk) and came up with his build upon that.  Waiting for 3 Zealots just increases the amount of time to be scouted and if it gets scouted it is a loss against a normal opener.  

Hopefully CombatEx will doa vlog/blog explaining it but I am fairly confident that is something along the lines of what I said.

I'll tell ya, there have definitely been days where I've cried before my clinical lab class, or didn't perform as well on an assessment as I would have liked due to my anxiety, but I have persevered. 

Here's what helped me:

* Informing my friends about what I'm going through such that, if they do notice me beginning to fear into anxiety-land, they give encouragement or help me become aware of the anxiety. Though I see your friends don't understand..would it help if you explained to them in more depth?
* know your triggers! If you know what's going to induce that anxiety, you can become more mindful of it when it begins creeping up on you, rather than allowing it to manifest into something unmanageable and debilitating.
* On-Campus personal counselling. If your school offers this service, I highly recommend it. It may prove beneficial to receive an objective perspective on your anxiety, and they offer various techniques to better handle anxiety and keep it at bay. One tool my counselor suggested to me was the use of a thought record sheet. [see here](http://www.jopm.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Table-1-Hide.jpg)

So we kept in touch during Senior year and the summer afterwards and we ere both sending vague flirting hints and he kept turning me down because we would be long distance... yeah I know. We went to college and he asked me to play if fake girlfriend so his roommate would stop trying to hook him up with questionable girls... two weeks later he asked me out for real and we've been dating for the last 2 years and change.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","For many organizations it is not how well a piece of software works but that its is proven or guaranteed to work. You never know what will change or break when you update to a newer version. It is really a version of the devil you know and fear of the costs that an upgrade a migration would bring.

Another thing that is especially important for browsers is the fact that many organizations have Intranet webservers and web-based applications. Many of those are old and have been very badly programmed in the first place. They will not work right on newer browsers. Upgrading the old Intranet applications is often non-trivial so things just stay the same.

In fact even Microsoft itself acknowledges the last part. If you use IE to open up a webpage on your local intranet, IE will automatically go into 'compatibility mode' i.e. emulating all the flaws and errors of long dead predecessors to get the Intranet webpage to display exactly the way the developer intended it to a decade ago. This is the default behaviour and basically MS admitting that most Intranet servers in use today were actually written for ancient non standard compliant browsers.

But still upgrading to a newer version of IE is definitely a good idea and should bring mostly benefits if done right. The security argument is the one I would concentrate on when selling the cost and risks associated with an upgrade to managment.","1354320303"

"Militaryfaq","t5_2tf5m","If you want a guaranteed job as an aviator, you should go in as a warrant officer. Comissioned officers do not chose their branch, they are assigned a branch based on the needs of the army, their PT, and GPA.

Should you choose to go warrant, you're going to go to basic training as an E-4 with every other enlisted, but your MOS will be Warrant Officer Candidate.  Then you're gonna go to WOCS, and since you aren't a prior NCO, you will have to take the entire course.  Upon graduation, you get your dot, and on to flight school you go.

The FAST is going to test generic mathematics and reasoning skills.  If you don't know anything about flight, I suggest studying for it.  ASVAB is about the same as a college entrance exam, not entirely difficult.  The ASVAB as a whole doesn't matter, what matters is your GT and ST scores.  Score above a 110 on both, and you're good.","1354320303"

The issue is that the biblical story says they were created in god's image, so they wouldn't have alleles for recessive inherited disorders unless god did too (I don't believe the story, but if we're going to say it contradicts itself we have to go off of the logic it gives us).

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Okay, the other commenters so far have all implied that your girlfriend is clingy and in the wrong here. I disagree. She's 29. You've been dating for 3 years. If you (as a couple) plan to have kids, you don't have infinite time. It's time to shit or get off the pot. If you don't want to commit to her, it's nothing to be ashamed of, but you owe it to her to let her know right away.

If you *do* want to commit to her, you're going to have to give up some of the aspects of your bachelor life. For the Navy thing, it's 100% reasonable for your girlfriend to not want her partner to leave you for 8 months, and it seems weird to me that you would want to leave the love of your life for several months at a time. Would you want to miss 8 months of your child's first year? Would you want to miss seeing your wife at Thanksgiving? 

You've laid it out as if there are 2 options: you leave her and join the navy to have some exciting, no-strings-attached travels, or you go to PT school, buy a house with a white picket fence, get a cat, and eventually have babies. Compromise is really important in a relationship. I suggest you think about some options in the middle. *Any* relationship you commit to is going to require you to prioritize your relationship when you're making big life choices.","1354320311"

So they decided to turn the bard into a popstar during an upcoming festival and then hold a contest in which anyone who brought one of the maguffins to the heroes got to spend the day with the bard. The bard was a beat poet/bongo player who had like 18 Charisma so it was an enviable goal.
They ended up teaching the Druid's Polar bear how to ride a unicycle (which they invented on a nat20) and then using prestidigitation made it multi-colored. This added a good bonus to his perform check.

This project is totally inspired by my girlfriend who really helped me understand the challenges women face and how they exist even in the game industry.

https://twitter.com/TaylorBalbi/status/274625982969823233

Leroux is a steampunk inspired platformer about a woman who has her workshop destroyed and inventions stolen by a rival because he was threatened by the presence of a woman in his industry. She fights back by recovering and using her inventions to teach her rival that she's not only a talented inventor, but better than he is. Overcoming sexism and patriarchy is really the underlying theme. Gameplay you can expect to have lots of running and jumping, simple combo moves for melee when fighting and unique boss fights. If all goes well, 60-90 minutes of gameplay, which would be a dream come true for our small team of 3.

We're hoping to release in time for the official launch of OUYA, but potentially give kickstarter backers early access to the demo.","1354320319"

"yoga","t5_2qhq6","I started doing yoga (Hatha) to help with my depression and anxiety. I was/am also seeing a psychotherapist regularly who understands the benefit of yoga, so that's helpful for me. But, I'd say one of the biggest parts of yoga that has helped me with my mental illness is the ability to notice, to discriminate the thoughts in my mind. Yoga helped me to notice when I was saying things to myself that weren't so nice. For months it was just working on noticing that I was doing it. Not trying to change it, but just noticing that I was calling myself all sorts of things that I would never call another human being. Then, after I got good at noticing that I was doing it, I started trying to stop myself. Not because I didn't believe it, but just because it wasn't nice. And then after a long time of practicing ceasing the behavior (a few months), I was able to replace it with something nice (this has really been the hardest for me).
For instance, I am an overweight woman. Substantially. And I've been overweight my entire life. I'm a good person who is incredibly successful, I spend my life working to better my community and help other people, I have a tremendous, large group of friends who love me. But, I only saw myself as the fat girl. So the idea of yoga TERRIFIED me. And going to class was sometimes agonizing because I just kept thinking ""I'm such a piece of shit. I'm literally twice as big as everyone else in here. What the fuck am I even doing. I'm a joke."" and on and on and on. Little by little, I would notice that I was saying these things to myself. Then, I was able to little by little notice earlier and then earlier and be able to stop myself. And one day, I was in down-dog with one leg up the wall and I had the thought ""Look how strong I am! I can do this pose just as well as everyone else in this room, and *I* can do it holding an extra 100 lbs!"" It was the first time in my life that I can recall thinking something positive about my physical body. From then on, that was my go to. When that negative voice would start, I'd stop it and replace it with ""Look how strong I am!"" Because it was something true. Saying ""Look how beautiful I am"" was a lie that I just couldn't say.
That's a REALLY LONG explanation and a lot more than you needed. But, I thought it just might be helpful for you as you're practicing. And, a lot of that stuff, creating new neuropathways, is the stuff a good psychologist is going to try to help you with, too.
Regardless, Good Luck! I wish great joy in your future!","1354320325"

-Kills on certain game modes

-Kills whilst carrying intel / pushing cart

If they're not efficient in the first place and need subsidies to make a profit, then they should go, they'll be less of a burden on the rest of society. They don't need to be shielded at the expense of society. See [Candlemakers' petition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlemakers%27_petition).

I agree that lecture-style teaching is not completely obsolete. Rather, there are a lot of people taking lecture-style science classes who shouldn't be there.

I will also suggest making 2-3 classes that have the weapon you are trying to hold and then 1-2 classes that serve niche roles.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","Screw tomato sauce! We use a recipe that (admittedly) contains tomatoes, but is not a tomato sauce.

Get some antipasto vegetable mix - it should be about 50% at least but usually about 80% of your ingredients. Just a mix of whatever is available is fine, like the pre-packed preserved bottle that vou might find in supermarkets or delis. 

Or go to a proper deli and choose ratios you like. (Artichoke, eggpant/aubergine, capsicum/bell peppers, sundried tomatoes, pitted and marinated olives, maybe even a bit of crumbly feta etc. Whatever you like, as long as it's yummy marinated vegetable)

Some good olive oil, garlic, more sundried tomatoes, fresh basil and oregano (though dried is okay), some fresh ground pepper. Do not add salt, because it's a pretty salty sauce as it is.

Chuck it all in a food processor and puree the hell out of it. Add more or less olive oil and/or fresh tomatoes of your preferred type purely to get your favored consistency. I actually like it slightly tomato-y but a bit chunky.

The tournament was held in the indoor basketball court which on the second floor had a running track where a VERY large crowd were able to watch and cheer.  Our team knew we were gonna loose, but obviously we tried. We slowly got sniped off, it wasn't looking good.  In one instance, I had a ball in hand my left hand and was staring squarely at one opponent who had another ball. I was scared that if i threw, he would be able to bean me faster since he obviously was a better thrower.  So I decided to goad him into throwing it, and boy did he launch it.  I managed to catch the ball with right my right hand with the other ball still in my left.  The crowd went bananas as i could hear people remarking on my one handed grab.

How was Nixon able to go to China? How was Carter able to accomplish the Camp David Accords? Reagan and the Arms Agreement with Russia?

Let's see, how many of those things apply to moving military prisoners to other locations? None. So none of them are applicable to your argument. The answer to those is the same as your answer to my argument, they were able to do those because those powers are explicitly defined in our laws and Constitution, as is every power the President has. The President is not able to work outside the bounds of our laws. 

Honestly, I don't care if he does have the power to do something or not. I simply want you to back up your claim, and you can't do it. You are claiming he has the power to do this, but cannot tell me which of his powers that is. Here's the facts that you have stated supporting your argument.

Obama has a lot of powers.
Other Presidents have done things.

That's it. You didn't even show that other presidents have done things along the same lines as what you claim he could do.

&gt; So I go back to my original statement. Do you HONESTLY believe there is nothing to be done here. That Obama and the International community can not find a way to deal with the alleged terrorists in Guantanamo because Congress said they can't move the prisoners to the states?

Honestly, I don't know. And neither do you. Just because you think they SHOULD be able to do something doesn't mean that they actually can. Our laws are pretty convoluted and really dumb in a lot of cases, so it's entirely possibly for those Presidents to have accomplished their tasks while specifically limiting the President in a case like this. So until someone points out the specific powers that Obama could use to somehow force other countries to take our military prisoners, which is what you seem to think he could do, then we have to believe that they are telling the truth.","1354320354"

Is it enchanted to have additional physical damage over a period of time?

* If there's no quest in a dungeon you see, is it worth going inside for the chance of more loot?

Always go in every dungeon you come across to build your character level and find loot. The opportunity to gain a unique item is worth it.

* Is it worth enchanting my weapon?

It is worth it if you plan on keeping that weapon for around 5 or more player levels. You will always find better loot but sometimes your enchantments and whatever enchantments came with it outweigh weapons that have more physical damage.

* Do you get better weapons killing bosses or from the Unidentified weapon store?

The drops are random, but killing bosses is an almost surefire way to get better drops. 

* If you've outgrown a weapon, is it better to save it for your next run as the same class, or simply destroy it and retrieve the gem?

Retrieve the gems if it is not a unique weapon. If it is unique then consider combining it at the transmuter.

* Do gems really change a weapon? Are they important in Torchlight?
I've never, ever found a full set of armor in my life. Do you have do explore every nook and cranny in one level before you find the whole set? Is it worth it?

Gems only add what they say they add to the abilities of the weapon/armor. Gems add a lot to gameplay. I add ones that increase my health/mana regeneration and damage boosters to the weapons. In TL2, I am one piece away from completing the sentinel armor set. I have played the broken mines probably 10 times through to get the pieces. I've noticed the transmuter is a good way to get the rings/amulet by combining 2 set items that are duplicates. The worth of a set depends on whether or not the stat boosts appeal to you. There will always be a set to collect at every level, so collecting at low levels might just be for a steam achievement or the gratification of it I guess.

* How important is having the armor with the most armor if you are a melee class?

There are a lot of builds that discuss where to allocate your points. If you are melee you definitely need to allocate points into vitality. Being up close means that you also need to add points in dexterity to avoid strikes and strength to do more critical strikes.

* If I am constantly losing health if you don't use your health potions or health regen from your skills, am I doing something wrong?

Try adding gems that boost your health regeneration or steal health on hit.  When you get hit just run around and let it replenish. ","1354320356"

My question is: being a fan of movie music, what do you think of today's film score industry? My opinion is, even though Hans Zimmer is an all-time favorite of mine, everyone wants to have a Zimmer-like score nowadays as the market is getting crowded by his disciples. 

I don't consider this a bad thing since most of them are really talented, but it leaves less room for those composers with a much more unique style. What do you think?","1354320357"

I love Bright Lights and the stuff off his EP, and there are songs from earlier albums as well as live performances on youtube that are brilliant. That being said he is not the ""next hendrix"" because Clark is coming from different parts of the blues. Hendrix came from the albert king buddy guy school, and gary is more BB King and T Bone Walker. This may not be evident in this video, but if you look at his really old stuff, he was a pure old school blues guy, and a damn good guitarist. 

[Don't Throw Your Love on Me so Strong](http://youtu.be/HVHr6RalZwc)

[Shame Shame Shame](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pq5vJXZ4V4)

With this in mind, I agree with the OP that he(now) sounds like the black keys which  really  disappointed me when I heard his album this year. I like The Black Keys, but I feel like Gary had a fairly unique that kept it really close to traditional blues while at the same time not conforming to the 12 bar blues. Now he's just copying the Black Keys(another band that has really deviated from the blues as of late) and sounding generic. I wish him the best of luck of course, and I'm glad for his success, but I wish he'd find his own voice again.","1354320360"

There's rather less work in arranging a bill of sale to which both parties have agreed than to go through the months of contested court proceedings necessary to use force and take it.  The considerably more friendly process of mutual consent might even end up costing less... but then people who espouse the view that it's all right to steal when they're the benefactor wouldn't get to enjoy the rush of doing wrong by another person and getting away with it.

"Militaryfaq","t5_2tf5m","From your original post, you've done two years of college (and may have other applicable credits) so you should be able to **enlist** as an E-3 or E-4, depending on what your recruiter can work for you. It's going to depend how much advance rank you're entitled to based on the number of relevant credit hours on your official transcript. That (te official transcript) would definitely be a piece of paperwork to request now.

&gt;To clarify, you have to be a prior enlisted officer? Because I am a permanent resident I can only apply as an enlisted right now and then first day of Basic they fast track me for citizenship. But if I enter basic as an enlisted I cannot become an officer, apparently.

If you have an enlistment contract, you're going to stay enlisted for awhile. There are a number of programs that allow enlisted personnel to gain commissions, but you should expect at a minimum to complete basic training, AIT / tech school, and spend some time at your first duty station before you enter a commissioning program.

You don't **have** to be prior-enlisted to be an officer, I only mentioned the O-1E through O-3E paygrades because that sounds like the the career trajectory you're looking at, and because your current citizenship status only leaves you with the enlisted option. And if you serve more than 36 months, you're entitled to full GI Bill Benefits.

To summarize, a short (3 years) enlistment will facilitate your naturalization and can either pay for additional schooling or help repay your existing loans (if any). You may be able to enter commissioning programs while enlisted or after completing your tour.

As an aside, considering that you have high-demand language competency, you may be able to enlist as a translator, which sometimes includes automatic E-4 rank (this was the contract offered to the guy I sponsored).","1354320369"

"funny","t5_2qh33","From the Wikipedia: ""Waldman, Weinberg, and Scarr (1994) responded to Levin (1994) and Lynn (1994). They noted that the data taken of adoption placement effects can explain the observed differences; but that they cannot make that claim firmly because the pre-adoption factors confounded racial ancestry, preventing an unambiguous interpretation of the results. They also note that Asian data fit that hypothesis while being omitted by both Levin and Lynn. They argued that,'contrary to Levin's and Lynn's assertions, results from the Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study provide little or no conclusive evidence for genetic influences underlying racial differences in intelligence and achievement,' and note that 'We think that it is exceedingly implausible that these differences are either entirely genetically based or entirely environmentally based. The true causes of racial-group differences in IQ, or in any other characteristic, are likely to be too complex to be captured by locating them on a single hereditarianism-environmentalism dimension.'""

I want to make clear that I'm not making a claim about whether or not intelligence is based on rearing or genetics but am trying to take a step back and say that (a.) the definition of 'intelligence' being used here is specious (and in some cases, totally undefined) and that (b.) these studies aren't as objective as they would like to seem. To extrapolate on (b.), the studies being cited here are asking ""What effect does race have on intelligence?"" and pretty much assuming that it has an effect at all.

I also think the smugness with which these studies are usually cited is telling (though you've been affable and I think this has actually been an interesting discussion).","1354320371"

Arab unity is a call of history and of the future, and a demand of destiny that can only materialize under the protection of an Arab nation capable of warding off any threat, regardless of its source and the pretexts supporting it. Such unity is to be reinforced through the integration and brotherhood with countries of the Nile Valley and of the Muslim world, both a natural extension borne out of the distinctiveness of Egyptâs position on the global map.â¨

Advantage for you: Easier to learn because you are still young, flexible (very important), and don't have anything to unlearn. Plus, a lady should always know how to defend yourself, especially in this day and age. Even if you ultimately decide it is not for you and stop after a few months, the basics you learn will stay with you for years.

If you have any interest at all, and it sounds like you do, then now is the time in your life to start. If it helps you to remember, learning the art spills over into everyday life including, but not limited to, learning how to concentrate.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Back in 09 I fell for this girl. Let's call her S. She was an old friend of mine from school. I was fifteen at that time, and we didn't live in the same town anymore. So distance was an impediment. I spend the most wonderful summer talking to her almost non stop. She dragged me out of the dark place I was. I never said anything to her because of two reasons:
1) She has the ""bad luck"" of being really beautiful, so almost every good friend she had had fallen for her, so I didn't want to dissapoint her too.
2) Once again, we were fifteen, so the two and a half hour trip was way too much for me, a guy who always walked everywhere (and still do).

All this began circa November '09. Somewhere between March or April 2010 I realized I had to end this. Going to school and not having holidays anymore made us loose contact, since we weren't chating online all day long anymore, and I was suffering that. So I did my best to forget her.
At the same time, that year I began going to this art school (I don't know how to call it), were I assisted to acting and cinema classes. It was amazing, formed me as a person, and meet a lot of great people.
A girl started to hit on me, and being the outgoing, grumpy, insecure guy I am, I started to like her. 

Jump to November 2010. It was an open secret what was happening between me and this girl, it was rather obvious that something was going to happen anytime soon, so I decided it would be a good thing, like giving closure to a phase of my life, to tell S. my feeling towards her during the past summer. I send her a long text, like we used to, telling her all my feelings for her, on a very thnkful tone, since (I don't want to exaggerate here) she practically saved my life.
She answered something along the lines of ""haha, in that case, we were the same"", meaning she was in love of me during the past summer too. My world was upside down. For almost a whole year I though things were like this, and they weren't. I broke down that night, I remember.
I asked her if she still felt that from me, and she answered maybe.
So there I was. The way I saw things, I had to make a decision. This girl from the art school or S. And I choose the easy way out. I choose the girl from the art school.
She was my girlfriend for almost two years. This year I started college, studying filmmaking. During the last year I grew increasingly tired of her, of her insecurities, of her injustificated jealousy, of being the center of her existence. So we split up. Not after seeing S. for the first time in eight damn years, when she traveled to my town to see her grandparents.
Don't misunderstand me, nothing happened, we were two old friends chatting about past times. The best thing about the day is that it felt just like old times. I always wondered how we would be face to face, and it was exactly like we were when we used to chat every night until sunrise. We said goodbye later that day and I walked away, it was hard not to look back, even after two/three years after that amazing summer.
The next day I went to the same park we had hanged out the day before and I cried. It was so liberating. Something I hate about myself is not being able to cry no matter how hard I want to.

Two days later, on sunday, my parents tell me they are going through divorce. ""Fucking finally"", I tell them.
So in the same weekend, three things happened:
1) My parents were finally separating, which was totally okay for me.
2) I realized I had to end my relationship with my then girlfriend for once.
3) I realized I had a unfinished story with this old fiend of mine.

Hell of a weekend.

So yeah, I break with my girlfriend in quite bad terms because of her, since I ended it really well (I'm not going to details because it's not relevat, you can trust me on this one).
I spend arround a month being semi-depressed and sad, until I finally texted S about a month ago. She answered telling me that she was moving to my town to study. I can't really describe how I felt, not because there are no words for it, but because I'm not sure how it felt.
Two days ago we finally see each other. I asked her to help me with a short film for college: she would act with me on a short film for me and the rest of my group from college, which most of them knew my situation and were highly supportive, and I'm thankful for that. But it was wierd, I don't know why, and she seemed a little cold most of the time. On a happy demeanor, as she always is, but cold.
I know she has her own troubles too. I know for a fact his father is no saint. But either way, it was wierd that codness she had. I'm not sure how much it really was there, how much I imaginated it.
This really affected me. Yesterday I was walking home and I couldn't help it anymore. My chin started to shiver and my eyes slowly flooded with tears. And I wanted to cry but I couldn't. But then I randomly thought about when was the last time I had cried. And it hit me: it had been because of S, the day after seeing her, a couple of months ago, when we saw each other after eight years. Just like yesterday. And it was so ironic I started to laugh uncontrollably and cry at the same time, while walking on this suburban street of this argentinian town. It was irony what finally made my cry, and my mind felt a little more clear after.

So here I am, three years later, and once again being an emotional wreck. I just don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do, and that's what drives me crazy. I allways know what to do, or at least can imagine the possible ending of something. But not this time.

Geez, I really wrote all that? It was liberating. Sorry for the wall of text and the horrible english.

And I'd like to do a TL;DR, but I think I'll fail. I guess that stating what is it that I really regret about all of this is the closer i'll get:

I regret not having balls, and not being able to see the real way out, the one which would have made me happy in the long term, even if a relationship with S. would have ended just after a week.

That is not all, I hope.","1354320387"

Well, good news - unless you're living in a geographical location that is conducive to such a business (valleys, large empty tracts of land), the chances that anyone is going to generate the capital and take the risk of opening up a garbage dump (either for personal reasons or as a business) is pretty fucking low.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yeah it's a tough question. The problem is that you can't freely ""use"" the land because you don't ""win"" the territory. You don't become sovereign over it through a right of conquest anymore, and you don't have sovereign rights over it as you would over your own territory. Use of force is supposed to be limited as a last resort, self-defense measure against a real threat (there's also a lot of talk on what a ""threat"" is and when it warrants the use of force, like in preemptive self-defense).

The use of force as self defense is also supposed to be proportional, it stops where the threat stops. Meaning that you can't use the defense argument to annihilate an enemy State and take their land. If for example there's terrorists based near your border and you strike/raid their camp in foreign territory as self-defense ([like Colombia did] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operacion_Fenix)), you are going to get yelled at because you are not supposed violate the other State's sovereignty like that (post 9/11 this becomes very muddy waters). But  if you march your army in there and take the area as your own, you are being very very naughty and very illegal. Imagine if the US said Iraq is now US territory after the 2003 operations, it would be a shitstorm.

 You are supposed to fix the problems with your neighbors through diplomacy and peaceful measures. It might seem naive in this context because diplomacy has obviously failed and there's a lot of complicated background but it's a really valid and important principle because States used to go to war over every tiny stupid thing imaginable.
 
It's an ideological thing, territorial sovereignty is sacred and you cant win it (from someone else) by winning a war.  However, and this is what applies in principle to the territories captured after the 6day war, you can have ""effective control"" over an occupied territory. It's not really yours but you are controlling it (and you are responsible for the shit that happens in there) until some sort of solution is found. It's supposed to be a temporary situation that will end once the military operations/crisis closes. You don't end up getting it through military force. It would be an incentive to go to war if you can get territory like that, which is the complete opposite from the UN's/international community's stance on war.

The old man was leading Scott through the subterranean labyrinth The Rat had procured to his quarters. He spoke very fluent English, not accented at all. ""He certainly has passion."" Scott smirked. 

*A little too much.* He signed back. *And just where the hell did you learn UK sign language?* He quickly added.

The old man smiled, his eyes clouded with nostalgia. ""I know many languages, child. I used to travel the world as a tutor. Helping parents deal with mute or deaf children. My own daughter was deaf."" His eyes lost the happy memory. Now, they were afflicted with sadness. ""She was killed by turians on the Citadel. Radicals, they said. She was part of an independently funded peace envoy. They left the embassy with applause and congrats. They were gunned down in the streets..."" He trailed off. Scott was beginning to see a pattern. 

*Is that why you joined this...Brotherhood?* 

""The Rat actually came to me. I speak more than sign language. He wanted a translator for every human language, and I was to be just that.""


*Why not just use a universal translator?* 


""Easy. Alien technology."" 


*And you thought joining this glorified lynch mob was a good idea? If your against aliens, why not join Terra Firma?*


""Well, the Rat has certain...persuasion techniques. It's hard to refuse when looking down the barrel of a gun."" The old man sighed deeply. ""He thought I'd be like him. On some mad quest for revenge. He's committed to this crusade."" He stopped Scott, looking him dead in the eyes. ""I'm just sad he's forced a child into this."" Scott didn't reply. The old man stared at him with prying eyes. He saw pain in Scott's face. Old, deep set pain. ""But perhaps the child died a long time ago."" After a few more steps, they reached a doorway cut into the damp rock, a heavy set door built into it. The old man pulled it open with a grunt, revealing an equally damp room, with a decaying cot, and an equally ancient chair and table, with a single modern lamp on the table for light. 


""Get rest, my child."" The old man said kindly, gesturing to the bed. ""Your going to need it."" Scott stepped into the room wearily, eyeing his surroundings. He was right. The Rat was insane, and Scott had little choice but to go along with his mad schemes. ""Good luck, my child."" The old man said as he left. Before he was gone, though, he stuck his head back into the door way. ""By the way, my name is Halit.""

I live in Santa Barbara, CA and near my house is a beach that is officially called Arroyo Burro beach.  The beach has a reputation as being a fun surf spot for locals, but because of a slew stream/runoff/watershed thing, the water can be gross at times.    Also, Arroyo Burro translates into 'Donkey Creek'.  
 
 
Basically I would love to get a drawing looking straight on towards the beach from behind the slew with a donkey looking out towards the water, raising it's leg and peeing into the stream.  The stream runs into the ocean, where you see a perfect A-Frame wave barreling on either side.  That would be awesome.  

I drew a very crude example of what I was thinking of here - http://i.imgur.com/8kdgX.jpg

My biggest reason I guess behind being asexual is that I think it's related to the fact that I have serious trust issues. It takes me years and years to actually trust someone, and I've never gotten how you can just meet someone and they suddenly allow them all this privilege into your life and let them do things to you that you wouldn't let people you've known for years do.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Well, basically, the lanes are a little bit different.

Top lane is long and close to baron.

Mid lane is short and close to baron, dragon, wraiths, and the other two lanes.

Bot lane is long and close to dragon.

The theory is that top lane champions are hardest to gank because they have escapes and are tanky (in general). They're put in one of the long lanes, which is easier to gank because there's a farther distance to your tower.

Bot lane has a support warding and protecting the carry, so the length isn't quite as big a deal- and the brush is really, really important. AD and support has the highest constant DPS for dragon control, as well- baron only becomes a factor after laning phase in 99% of games.

Mid lane is usually had by an AP for a few reasons. Firstly, if you put a squishy, no escape AP top, they're just part of a nutritious breakfast for the enemy jungler. Plus, most bruisers destroy most APs after a couple levels. Secondly, mids are bursty. This has a couple advantages: you can take wraiths without missing cs, and you can gank the other lanes effectively. A Corki ganks consists of him jumping over a wall and right clicking on you. An Annie gank consists of a 1.75s (iirc) stun and 80% of your health gone before it wears off. This brings me to the third point: it's easy for you to gank top and bot because you're close to both of them.

So, Riven mid is great, but not extremely popular- though ""popular"" and ""good"" aren't necessarily synonymous. (STOP BANNING ALISTAR PLEASE) Let's look at her.

She has aoe. Her q and w are actually really good for clearing wraiths, and her e gives her even more mobility. Speaking of mobility (ever-so-nice for roaming), she also has a lot of burst and a short stun. These things combined actually make her one of the best champions to roam with.

There is a big drawback to this, though. While you're having fun destroying the enemy mid, their top is destroying *your* mid. Side effects of this include whining, weeping, feeding, getting banned, afking, and elo loss.","1354320391"

""Not so fast!  You need to report this to the department manager and have purchasing get in touch with us or they may file a union grievance that we are taking their work away from them.""

So I get in touch with Purchasing, and within a couple days they finally order the part.  They order it from a specific dealer who has an exclusive contract with the government to provide the part for $7 due to it meeting excessively specific regulations and using inflated C.O.G.S. values.  

""We need to commission a report on why this part failed.""  says the boss.

""Oh, it was a stress fracture.  It was worn out and at the end of its normal shelf life.""  

""I know, but this is standard operating procedure.  You can get the new part installed once they review the report and approve the new installation.""

Wait another day- the review comes back normal and just as you stated it would.  

""What are you doing?  Are you thinking of installing that yourself?"" says the boss as I open the panel.

""You have to wait for the certified mechanic to come.""

""I know exactly which part it is and I'm familiar with this machine, as I'm the operator.  Some fixes the mechanic needs to handle but this is basic and I need to catch up on the backlog of work.""

""They'll file a union grievance if you steal their work.  You need to wait for the mechanic to get here and take care of it so he can report it on his worklog and the ticket can be cleared.""

Wait another 4 hours.  Finally the install is completed, and I can begin to use the machine again.  All that manpower, time, and extra money on parts spent on this repair.  It could have been completed in about an hour had they allowed me to go to the hardware store and pick up the part and fix it.

&gt;**#myouyagame is a 2D action game inspired by and highly reminiscent of classic platformers such as Mega Man X.**

The game is Rabbit Knight's Story, and it's an anime-styled fantasy action platformer set in a medieval-inspired world of swords and sorcery. It puts you in control of two distinct characters â Joan de Lapin, a young princess with a passion for adventure, and Midnight Wolf, a tough and strong barbarian leader. When chaos threatens the world, these two forge an alliance and set out to convince other rulers to do the same so they can send the threat back where it came from.

While Joan and Midnight canât change their equipment, they can gain abilities called Assist Powers by defeating bosses and forging alliances with them. These Assist Powers depend on what ally you have following you -- you can only have one at a time, but theyâre usually highly beneficial boosts. Joan can use Midnightâs freezing magic or Skyeâs extra jump height by having one of them as a follower.

The game's story will be conveyed mainly through animated sequences and slide shows. The story is humorous and light-hearted, but serious when it needs to be.","1354320406"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It depends.

For women in general, not at all.

For women I know, it varies. Some women I can tell , or eventually find out, are pretty confident in their sexuality so they wouldn't surprise me with much. However, the shyer, or less openly so girls do give me a little surprise. Usually it is sexy or at least interesting/lets me know them better

Also, I would say the same with men. Some things certain guys like would surprise me too. If I found out that shy guy in the corner, not so social, but usually cool is into hardcore BDSM( I have no idea how I would find that out, maybe we become good friends or some shit) then I would be just as surprised. However, I am not gay so it wouldn't turn me on. It would be interesting/let me know them better though.

However, I wouldn't actively go about researching it honestly. If it comes up in conversation with a girl, I might talk for hours, however, it is not a prime focus in my life in the same way that the sexuality of other men isn't something I would actively search.","1354320410"

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","I have a 2005 6MT. Purchased with 43k miles on it and currently has 70k on it and it has not given me a single problem, seriously, not one,  but the model you are looking at is priced a bit high. There are a few things you should know before buying that one.

     1) Make sure it's up to date on all service especially the brake and clutch fluid. The clutch fluid has a tendency to get very hot in that car and cause the clutch to act funky, expecially in the summer with the AC running. If the clutch fluid isn't clear have it changed, step it up to DOT4 or DOT5 fluid to get higher temperature tolerances. 
     2) Make sure the VLSD fluid is changed or you'll basically have just a regular open diff.
     3) The sedan is actually lighter than the coupe.
     4) Tendency to burn a little oil so definitely check every 2 weeks, more often if driven hard or much more than average, engines in these models will blow if you don't monitor your oil regularly. Otherwise the engine is bulletproof.
     5) Tranny shifts heavy but is solid, it takes a while to get clutch engagement down and I still embarrass myself sometimes after owning for a few years.
     6) Price is high, I got mine with 43k miles for 16. The one you're looking has more than double those miles and is only one year newer. Ask if they've installed any new parts (clutch master and slave cylinder) or something like that. Or you could low-ball them and be like even KBB.com thinks you're wrong.

I absolutely love my car. Non-car people think it's a responsible Japanese family sedan. Those 'in-the-know' recognize a pretty beastly car (for being 100% stock) that is somewhat rare-ish (rare-ish because of the manual transmission not the specific model.) Just drive it responsibly because if you're not careful it will kick you in the nuts and make you look like and asshole.","1354320412"

He started a game and I played for hours, being a little kid finishing a whole game like that took some patience. I had too leave the next day or I would have played for hours more. From then on I didn't think much about it, living on what my parents told me. About a year later I somehow ended up with a apple store gift card. Being somewhat educated I knew that I could barely get anything for $75 in that store. Well I walked in and looked at the accessory shelf in the back and right away I recognized the two words ""Sid Meier"", right away my love of the game poured back into my heart. I purchased CIV IV and an additional expansion pack. I played the hell out of that game until finally our mac broke. We only had pc's and my parents were not going to buy another mac.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I used a Dakine Sequence bag for 3 seasons shooting snowsports. Mostly resort riding but also some backcountry. Depending on the planned shoot, I carried some variation of:

Canon 1D Mark2N, 24-70, 70-200, 15mm fish, 3x 580EX lights, small tripods for the lights, PocketWizards, cleaning gear, and batteries all on the inside. I was then able to attach a Manfrotto 3021 tripod to the outside, with some room to spare for water bottle, snacks, etc. 

It held up very well, no problems whatsoever. One of the big design differences between a ""made for snowsports"" backpack and a regular photo backpack is that the opening is on the inside (the part touching your back) rather than on the outside. This lets you keep snow off of the zipper when accessing your gear, and allows you to place it outside down in the snow. 

It also has a small ""snowshield"" inside, which allows you to turn the backpack against the window to change lenses without too much snow getting on your gear (and sensor). 

They make a larger version now that has a bit more support for the tripod. 

Support is very good, stability is about as good as it gets with all of that strapped to your back. I was even able to go off some jumps with all that gear (probably not the best idea, but hey). ","1354320415"

Any woman who's dressing up cute, compliments other women's clothing/shoes/accessories with the word cute, and so on are obviously women who are okay with the word and may even seek it as a compliment. I can't tell you how many times I've heard, ""Oh, those shoes are so cute! Where did you get them?""

Some women will associate being called cute to being childlike, associating the word with immaturity, condescension, or worse, pedophilia. This is a hang up. Granted, this does have validity, since a few bastards out there will use the word cute in this context, but I would dare venture to guess that *most* guys do not.

Lastly, a lot of women will distinguish from being called cute, pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, sexy, and hot - and these all mean different things to a woman. So, if I'm trying to dress hot and sexy, the last thing I want to be called is cute, because it means I failed at being sexy. 

I know that there is some sort of overlap between the two looks, like if I was to dress in some sort of schoolgirl outfit for roleplaying, but generally I differentiate the two looks in my wardrobe. Cute and sexy are just not the same - most of the time. ","1354320423"
"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Menander is possibly the least funny comedian of all time. That's my vote for Classical Athens.

Pretty sure this isn't what you are looking for but I'll also take this opportunity to offer you a few modern historians you probably shouldn't concern yourself with and some alternatives.

Interested in Alexander the Great? Avoid some of the more popular modern historians such as Tarn and try and find more balanced accounts. Modern historians have a slightly strange view of Alexander that isn't always supported in the evidence.

If you ever find yourself wishing to examine ancient Greek economy, avoid T. Amemiya. He is a (surely) very knowledgeable economist who probably decided one morning to try and write about the economy of Classical Greece. He didn't succeed. A poorly researched and interpreted examination, best avoided.

Want a great examination of modern historians? Go read N. McKeown's *The Invention of Ancient Slavery* before you read anything else. While the historians he focuses on are concerned with Ancient Roman slavery this is a great volume whatever your interest. He outlines a lot of issues with the way evidence is used.","1354320423"

Thank you for the detailed and well-supported reply. However just for clarification the question was not whether Bahai's ""could be Muslims"" but whether they were considered apostates (deserving consequent death, etc.) I'm guessing from your reply that they are not considered apostates, because in order to be an apostate you have to first be Muslim and then leave the faith, whereas you indicated that Bahai's cannot ever be Muslims.

I personally don't care about the credit cards showing because I don't use my phone for talking much outside of work and even so I still only think that would be a problem in considerably bad areas. 

I like that if I want to watch a video I can lay the phone down while flapped open and its on a 30 degree angle so it's not laying perfectly flat. Also - It's a lot easier to hold when flipped open than you'd think. 

Also - the 5 version is greatly improved over the 4 version. There is a hole for the camera and it snaps into the case perfectly leaving full access to the screen. I tried as hard as I could to ""shake it out"", but it remains firmly inside. I can hold ~7 bills, 3 cards, and my ID comfortably. 

I'm sure it's not for everyone, but I don't see myself changing cases for a while. It has better drop protection than most cases and the screen can't possibly get scratched unless I drop the case while I'm holding it open.

They are fresh off a sweeping election win where Obama won by almost 200 electoral votes, Dems picked up seats in the House and Senate (not to mention the fact Dems won the congressional popular vote), and are now promoting a policy that has the support of 60% of Americans. Furthermore, if Congress does nothing, the tax rates on the rich will automatically go up Jan 1, which is exactly what Obama wants. Then the Democrats can dare the GOP to vote against a tax cut for 98% of Americans next year. Democrats are in the catbird seat waiting for the GOP to quit arguing amongst themselves. The one piece of leverage that Boehner has (reaching a deal before the financial cliff hits) is in danger of being squandered because most Republicans can't admit to Grover Norquist that they have to break their pledge to him. 

If you disagree with my analysis, I would be very interested to hear what power or ace in the hole Republicans have in their arsenal. It appears that conservatives like Ann Coulter see that the GOP is powerless and want the party to roll over and die, give Obama everything he wants, hope the economy blows up, and reap the benefits by seizing political power when the country comes crawling back to the GOP in 2014. How can anyone look at the current political climate and say the Democrats don't hold all the cards? Even Ann Coulter admits it! ","1354320428"

&gt;The average IQ score of black children in the U.S. is approximately 85, compared to the average score of white children of 100. No detectable bias due to test construction or administration has been found, although this does not rule out other biases. 

&gt;The gap is functionally significant, which makes it an important area of study. *The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study* tried to answer whether the gap is primarily caused by genetic factors or whether it is primarily caused by environmental and cultural factors.

The data corrected for the Flynn effect was published in 2000 by John Loehlin in the Handbook of Intelligence.

"slashdiablo","t5_2sv1q","&gt; Wait, wait. SO all this time the PC you gave was what the item should be worth and not an actual PC was? I mean, I understand it's probably really hard to give a PC for a griffons like this but if you're going to give a PC based on what you think it should be worth then be clear that is the PC you're giving. Honestly, I don't even see the point of giving a PC for what you think it should be worth except to establish a minimum for the item. Now I finally get your PCs haha. But like I said, I think you should be clear on this. Saying LSV's griffons is worth Ohm, even the nonexistant one at -15litres is really detrimental.

What the item is WORTH (it's VALUE) is what the Price of the item should be!  If someone wants to spend more, in a bid war situation, they are welcome to, but they are OVER paying for that item, plain and simple.  The value of the Griffons doesn't shift very much, but the price will shift as impatient people bid on it in an effort to get one sooner.  That has no affect on the value of the item itself.

No one can accurately say what any particular item will sell for, because demand shifts constantly (until supply greatly exceeds demand), especially with items like this.  What we can do is say what the item is worth, and that is almost entirely based on the supply of the item, with a very slight adjustment for demand.","1354320438"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This may not be my *most* badass moment, but I feel like it belongs here:

I used to live in Florida, and in 2010, I went back down for about 2 weeks to visit/stay with some old friends. One day, the family I stayed with took me along with them to get a boat and go tubing in the bay. I went out for my turn, and after a couple of sharp turns, I realized that holding on tighter would be a good idea. I didn't fall out, but there were a couple of close calls.

Now, on my next turn with the tube, I went out, but they went a bit faster than usual. I noticed some dolphins swimming far off from the side of me, so I looked over at them. Without warning, the whole tube jerked and flipped forward. The only thing then going through my mind was ""Hold on tight, hold on tight!"".

After water coursed through my nose and through my head, I resurfaced. They were still going, I was still holding on, and they were staring at me in disbelief, since I had gone fully under and the tube had gone completely upside-down. Most awesome moment I'd had in a long time.

**tl;dr** I did a full front somersault while tubing and didn't lose my grip, and it felt badass.","1354320442"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Yeah this definitely happens a lot. Or actually it seems like it happens a lot, because you don't notice the structure of where people are sitting being associated with people being included in a conversation when you're being included. So every time you think about this concept in a group, it is likely because it is happening to you.

Obviously, there are times you feel sympathetic toward a person you see it happening to, and I've had it happen to me enough times, that when I see it happening to someone else, I try my best to include them, but sometimes there's only so much you can do.

Really, it all comes down to who dominates the conversation. Everybody has that friend who just excels at telling stories and knows how to master people's attention. And due to this, if you're not either sitting close to this person, or being directly addressed by this person, you probably will not have a high level of involvement in the conversation.

Spurs/Pops only care about winning a championship.  If sitting your players now so they can last longer in the season/playoffs accomplishes it, they're going to do it (Doc Rivers has a similar approach, except he drastically reduces player minutes).

Stern cares about the NBA image that is put on display during Nationally Televised games.  This was a marquee game with the defending champions and a Dynastic team - of course he would want as many prime-time players going.

To David Stern, every game is an ad for the NBA, you don't want scrubs advertising the NBA.

But really, while Stern should stress his point, he is taking it way too far.  Does he not realize that what really raises eyebrows and interest across the globe are exciting NBA playoffs??

2.  Outside the camp on days off and even in the off-season, us counselors get pretty wild.  But nothing like this rarely happens in the camp.  I've been told the 90's were much worse though, with stuff like that happening with both campers and counselors.  It all climaxed around '99 I'm told.  A lot of fucked up shit happened back then, but I'm kind of glad it doesn't happen anymore since the camp could get shut down for that shit.  

3.  There was a guy in 2006 or 2007 who had just come out of Iraq and was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome and would punish his campers by marching them up and down a hill.  He was most definitely fired.  We are forbidden to give any sort of physical punishment of the sort.

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","The answer to this is that you will go immediately into REM during a nap. Each sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes when you are asleep and it is divided between REM and non-REM sleep (for the most part). When you first go to bed at night the first sleep cycle has very little REM sleep, maybe as little as five minutes. As you go throughout the night the REM sleep parts of the sleep cycles get longer and longer. This is why you can't remember as many dreams in the middle of the night as you can in the morning.

So when you WILD you need to stay conscious during the non-REM portion of the sleep cycle before you can get to the REM portion of the sleep cycle. If you do WILD at night you will need to wait through over an hour of non-REM sleep (assuming you can even get to non-REM) while if you do it during a nap you will have very little non-REM that you need to wait through and sometimes you can even go directly into REM.","1354320445"

It's easy to make a law, and have everyone support it, that says you can't murder someone.  It's very clear what's happening there, and everyone can understand whats happening.

It's much harder to get people to support an abstract thing like using taxes to prevent money from being horded, or shaping the actual ""Value"" of money (instead of thinking of money as set units with their value being the number on them).  And because of that being a more abstract and 'gray area' type of thing, it's easy to convince people it's the same as something they do understand, such as those who scream 'theft' at taxes... but don't scream theft at companies driving down wages and using employment loopholes to avoid providing benefits.

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","My barista always does this and it makes me think of him in a sexual way, which i enjoy. But i don't know if he's trying to sleep with me or just joking around. He has only alluded to him and I having sex a couple of times. He typically says something more discreet for example today he mentioned that when he is talking to people they always glance at his package, even men because the package is the epicenter of the body. I looked at his package right after he mentioned it. I guess it's a good thing for men that i don't know if he wants to sleep with me, it keeps me interested and eager to know what his intentions are. Personally I rather him continue with the joking and sexual puns but eventually do something about it or i'll lose interest. But the joking might also prompt me to say initiate something. This is a good tactic for getting women to think of you sexually but like you mentioned this would only work on women who like to joke around and are comfortable talking about sex.  
I like suggestive things or something that i can counter. If a guy told me ""I'm going to fuck you"" I would laugh and respond with a light rejection.  ""have you ever had your back door smashed in? You wanna?"" that's funny and sexy i can see that working on a girl ","1354320451"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","exactly. I get it all the time when I mention that I've been severely psychologically scarred from circ. people simply deny that I've been harmed, or tell me to man up.

Hell, a while ago there was this thread in askreddit that asked ways you've traumatized your parents. I mentioned that they were traumatized when I told them how much I hated them for cutting me and how much it has harmed me. I was viciously attacked by people who were angry and defensive at me, for being angry. Many insisted it was not the reason I was depressed, based on them not knowing anyone who felt that way. So, they attacked someone for coming forward to express that he feels this way, then cited people not coming forward, as proof that no one should/does feel this way. 

this went round in circles, with the Subreddit Drama forum posting to inform me that I was being attacked there as well. they did the same thing.

Interesting enough, It was some people in a topic on SRS who actually defended me. they made fun of all the people who attacked me for expressin my feelings and their defensiveness at feeling threatened by it. however, I then posted in that SRS topic using my alt account to give an example of several guys admitting that they were attacking me because they felt that my expression on the matter was a threat to their masculinity. you'd think the folks at SRS would like that; instead they banned me, because I explained that I was using my alt account due to my main account having been banned long ago for posting a minor disagreement, which I did not know what it even was. So even though I wasn't disagreeing in that topic, for admitting that I once disagreed with SOMEONE about SOMETHING long ago, they banned my alt account from SRS too, and deleted the post I made. It's crazy. we get no support from anywhere. we are on our own, and  don't know how I do it sometimes.

This is the exact opposite of what I was saying. What I'm saying is that spelling ""oui"" like the English ""we"" is obviously wrong in French, even though that's how an English speaker spells it. For the same reason, ""grammer"" is not the correct spelling of the English word, even if that's how you learned it in southern France. You are the only one claiming that only your country's language rules matter, an especially ridiculous claim given that we're not using the language of your country.

"science","t5_mouw","Right, because they're not ejecting matter as x-rays or gamma rays. But the question still remains on whether or not they have a life cycle like a planet or a star does. 

I would assume that eventually black holes die. Yes, they're ultra-dense and have enough gravitational pull that light cannot escape, but what happens after a few hundred millions years of not ""eating""? Is it possible that they undergo a ""black hole supernova"", where the matter it has consumed has become compacted enough that a new explosion occurs? Perhaps this universe and the corresponding Big Bang is nothing more than the consumed remnants of a black hole gone boom, which would reboot the cycle all over again... 

I mean, the universe can only expand so far before the gravity of the internal components begin to draw matter such as shock bows back, correct? And if the universe has been expanding for a(n estimated) 15 billions years, and only expands for another 5 billion, it'd be logical to assume that the contraction of the universe would take less time... 

Granted, the resulting contraction and compaction of space would trigger cataclysmic events such as galaxies merging, supermassive black holes combining into scary 17 billion solar mass sized black holes, and explosions that would resist the contraction... But in the end gravity always wins. 

So in theory, a universe's life span could potentially be a few dozen billion years before the reset switch is flipped and it happens all over again, yeah?","1354320469"

The Great Depression, the treaty of Versailles, Germany's embarrassment, it all ties together. It's not like Hitler came out of nowhere, nationalist groups were very popular during the time.  

My belief is that some sort of conflict was inevitable around the time the First World War began. However, wasn't the rise of Nazism in Germany due mostly in part to the First World War?

After three games of getting his ass handed to him, repeatedly, he threw down the controller and (I quote) yelled at me, ""YOU'RE CHEATING!

"funny","t5_2qh33","And how long have these scores been in development? Modern psychology started rolling around the end of the 19th century, if I recall correctly (which I might not). By the standards of science, this is infantile.

On top of this, the whole thing is a circlejerk, quite frankly. How do they evaluate the validity of the test?

&gt; A test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance.

College grade point average is a measure of how obedient and organized you are, not intelligence. I say this as someone currently working on a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Job performance might be more valid, but even this is arbitrary: The rate assigned to your job performance is going to be decided by some manager (an imperfect human with countless biases) or maybe by some measure of productivity, but that can be affected by countless other variables like market demands for your particular profession or the very nature of the work you're doing.

When I call this area of research ""infantile"", I don't mean that as an insult. I mean that as a matter of simple fact. This research is young. It has a long way to go before we have any hope of isolating the countless variables associated with the human psyche. The only way you're going to get meaningful understanding of human intellect is to be able to trace neural pathways and understand how human thought works on a fundamental level. Until then, all we can do is make our best guesses based on as much statistical data as we can get.

But I'm personally more inclined to analytic approaches. Statistical arguments just aren't very compelling to me.","1354320474"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Bicycles are vehicles and in some states it is actually illegal to ride them on the sidewalk. Arizona is the worst because they can ride either in the street OR on the sidewalk and most bicyclists here don't have a clue what the rules are when you're riding in the street, specifically the bike lane.

I actually had a guy run into my Jeep Wrangler and flip over my hood because he was riding against the flow of traffic in the bike lane. I jumped out to help him and make sure he was ok and he just kept saying (loudly but not yelling) that ""Bikes always have the right of way!"" Unfortunately for him, he was only partially correct. They have the right of way, everything else being equal.

He insisted that I call the police after I refused his offer of splitting the cost of his now ruined bike ($600 would have been half).

I asked if he was sure, knowing that he was at fault, and he said yes. So I called. It took them awhile to get there and the cop spoke to me. I told him what happened and then he went to talk to the other guy. I heard him tell the guy exactly what I told him before I called the police. The cop came back to me, told me he explained it to the guy and that I was free to go. At that moment his dispatcher came over the radio with information about the other guy. Turns out he had a warrant for driving on a suspended license from the next county over. So this jackass may have gone to jail because he was too stupid to follow simple traffic laws.

TLDR: Got hit in my Wrangler by guy on bike; he may have gone to jail after I left.","1354320474"

Spice etc refers to random plant matter sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids. Every time a particular blend is made illegal, unscrupulous capitalists make a new one that has even less history with human use. Stay away from those, they're known to induce seizures/full on bad trips.

If you want to hallucinate, you're better off getting some 2c-b, mushrooms or acid. Be careful with the latter though, because you could end up getting an RC like an NBOMe or DOx.

 But most gaming companies don't hire writers until the game is a good bit along, them trying to mix them would be silly and downright awful. 

I wouldn't want story lines to intersect that would water down both games.  I imagine having an apple of eden in Far Cry would be laughable at best.

So I have over 3 decades of electronic music inside me (Class of 88 Wooop Wooop!) me.

One of my biggest influences is [The Forest](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Forest/172683422754800?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts) and next year will be my 17th year of Foresting.

I Also have written my own [Real Video / Fractal Mixing Software - ChaoslabVJ](http://www.chaoslab.com) and still own two Water cooled laser's (a Krypton and an Argon), do some game coding (Ludum Dares 21, 22, 24) and have a new game in the works (want to do an integrated release possibly with my next album).

I went from VJing to Laser, little bit of Lighting and finally Music.  I have always had a deep drive to get into writing music and it is a journey into yourself (no better time than now to start).

Now that I have completed the cycle and have always wanted to do a fully integrated laser / video / lighting / music show from the ground up and perform it live in some fashion.

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","Big SD fan here. That said, I think it's worth mentioning some of the drawbacks. My biggest problems with San Diego all fall into one big category of urban sprawl. It's not a dense city, and public transportation's spotty, so you end up being very reliant on driving. I visit San Francisco once in a while, and while I prefer San Diego for the reasons OP mentioned, I can't help but be struck by how easy it is to walk there. And this is just a theory on my part, but I feel with greater density comes better restaurants, stores, etc. If you live in Rancho Bernardo, you might settle for Olive Garden, since it's close and it doesn't mean driving to La Jolla or Downtown for something of higher quality. That said, OP likes Mexican food, and the taquerias are spread pretty thoroughly throughout this city.","1354320492"

This is one of the reasons I like Red Bull.

That's pretty much the only point you've been making.  I'm not ignoring it, I'm explicitly calling it bullshit.  There is a difference.

It's essentially the exact party line used by the governments to justify what they did.

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","&gt;Sui Feng farly surpasses Byakuya in close combat I think we can at least agree to that

Agree completely Byukuya is probably a better swordsman but Sui-Feng more of a fists person.  

&gt; In bankai he has to stay almost stationary just to make sure he does not get cut

Pretty sure Byukuya can still move free while using Senbonzakura Kageyoshi to some degree he does not have to stand still.

&gt;This alone makes him an easier target for Sui Feng's bankai than most people and also he could partially blind himself sometimes with his bankai covering his field of vision

Byukuya knows his bankai inside out, he will probably never make the mistake to blind himself in middle of a battle.

&gt;Sui Feng could get in that zone and fire a suprise missile

Sui-Feng could pull this off but even at close range byukuya could use his petals to defend himself, Sui-Feng can only use her Bankai twice max before the timeskip (don't know if she can now) so she has to time it right.

&gt; Ichigo could get into Byakuya's safe zone multiple times with just his flash step and so could Tsukishima

Hard to argue against Ichigo as he is main character so Kubo always finds a way for him to pull shit off, as for Tsukishima we all how he used his power to learn Byukuyas every weakness and movements Sui-Feng does not have this advantage.

&gt;shunko too this will make her be able to get in his safe zone

Tsukishima is only person to know about this so it's unlikely Sui-Feng would know how to do it.

&gt;He is almost caught in a prison with her created by his own bankai (This happened with Tsukishima and he is not even captain level)

This all happened because Tsukishima knew Byukuya inside out your overestimating Sui-Feng ability to spot all this.

&gt;And then close up she could either use hakudo or her shikai to finish him of. She could also use shunko, blasting petals aside and breaking half his bones with one kick.

Who saying Byukuya could not flash step out of way when she gets to close?, Also is Sui-Fengs able to freely just push byukuya bankai so easily away? Byukuya has 2nd strongest Bankai out of the captains. As for Sui-Feng been able to break Byukuyas bones so easily i'm not to sure on this one.

Different people have different standards for what their money is worth.  I'm not trying to blame anyone for anything in particular, I'm just calling it like I see it.  More complex games got phased out of the market because the audience for them is too small to support AAA development.

&gt;The current AAA gaming industry has proven to me that while it is perfectly able (both in terms of development and budget) to make games that would appeal to the ""core"" older gaming audience, it is frankly unwilling to do so because they know that they can just make something less demanding and appease the less sophisticated crowd (not really calling them stupid but it is the best word I can find).

The current AAA gaming industry could indeed make games that appeal to the older ""core"" audience, I'll agree with you there, but how much would it sell?  THQ makes lots of AAA games that appeal to the ""core"" audience, but they're in dire financial straits.  Let's be honest here, the AAA industry is not unwilling to make those types of games because there's some sort of conspiracy against the hardcore gamers, it's a investment vs. return type of thing.","1354320499"

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","For that money I still think you should have received better specs though. I guess it was reasonable in 2010, but the graphics card probably wasn't that good back then either.

You knew this was coming, though. You knew this was all just a buildup to a criticism of Mac. As I'm currently living with two Mac-owning room-mates, one from 2010 and one from 2012 (both around the same price as yours, Â£1000), I can at least offer one solace: the room-mate with the 2010 Mac's specs are: an intel core 2 duo processor at 2.4GHz (circa 2008 processor), a 256MB VRAM graphics card that's probably worse than the new intel HD 4000 chipset, and 4GB DDR2 RAM. So you at leats bought at a better time in 2010.

Although having said that, the other 2012 mac has specs comparable to my Â£500 Fujistu Lifebook laptop, except his has no dedicated graphics, a weaker i5 processor, less RAM and a smaller HDD. And it's newer than mine (only by 6 months, but still). The reality is that you'll have worse specs as a compromise for your other features, like imrpoved screen and battery life. So unfortunately, besides upgrading the RAM (check to see if this will void your warranty though), there's not a lot you can do to improve the framerate

EDIT: Should probably say there may well be an absolute saint out there who will develop a mod that improves framerate with occlusion culling etc. in the future, like the Optifine mod for minecraft, but until then you'll just have to turn the specs down or uninstall some obsolete mods. As far as I know, such a mod doesn't exist yet though","1354320502"

The first thing I told him was we can't get married now! Counter intuitive? Maybe. But honestly I needed time to adjust- one massive life changing event at a time! And I wanted the fear/excitement/everything feelings of being pregnant and being married to be two separate memories, not just a mess all jumbled up together. I seriously doubted my abilities to cope with all that change at once! We waited four months, through many long talks and discussions of our new life plans, and finally got happily and blissfully married. I couldn't be happier. But if I had a dollar for every snide comment or sneer about getting married because we were pregnant, shot gun marriage, etc, I'd be rich! People were unhappy that we were pregnant and unmarried, now that we are married, people aren't happy, and want to hold our timing against us, as if we could go back in time and change things. Sometimes, you just can't win. 

whatever, people suck. I've learned to just shake it off. Insecure woman seem to LOVE pregnancy. We are like a magnet for nasty comments and overall rudeness. I use it as practice for rolling with the punches of parenthood! :)","1354320506"

"nexus4","t5_2v9bv","Except if you think about it, the ""real price"" is something almost no other place offers. If you go into a nike store, do they charge you 5 dollars for a pair of shoes? If you walk into an apple store do they charge you 300-400 or whatever it costs to make an iphone 5, or do they charge you 700? 
Do you walk into a restaurant and say ""I DEMAND TO PAY THE COST OF WHAT IT TOOK TO MAKE MY FOOD AND DELIVER IT TO ME ONLY"" No of course you don't because what drives sales is PROFIT, something Google isn't gaining from selling it for so low.
So yes, you are saving money because Google is selling it AT COST to SAVE you money. (and to lure people to google play store/android)
Besides, if Google had to choose one shipping method in order to negotiate contracts better with UPS to ship their phones, it would obviously be 2 day shipping. Overnight is double the cost, 3-5 is only slightly cheaper, and 7-8 day is when most people complain about shipping times. They are NOT a big physical goods retailer, so it may be harder for them to negotiate several shipping methods at a reduced cost.
What sounds better. buying a phone for 350+tax+shipping, or paying 500 +tax (which is about $13 more anyways since it's on 500) and walking out of the store.

That 1-2 weeks waiting time? It's not shipping time, it's ""they're out of stock"" time. They're just letting you ""preorder"" it. (Not actual preorder, but same concept, you order it while you wait for restock)

You need to get over your sense of entitlement and just look at the bright side of things, if Google didn't decide to sell it for 350, it would probably be going for 6-700 from tmobile unlocked. Or, you know, 200 on contract where you pay about 500 more than a non commitment plan.

TLDR No one forced you to buy it from Google. Buy it elsewhere and don't pay for shipping. Or just get a different phone. And yes you are saving money.","1354320508"

If the typical terminal is mix and match, GUIs are more of an all-or-nothing proposition.  Even a curses gui in a terminal raises the bar of entry to a point where all of a sudden there is a lot less flexibility; more things are stuck the way they are.  The hurdles to change them are higher and you have less wiggle room to mess around with when you get over that hurdle.

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","&gt;The $200 build is missing a power supply

It's using a case/PSU combo. A dangerous option, but not much else you can do at such a low budget

&gt;the $300 build is using 1x 4gb ram on a dual channel board

Real-world performance difference is only about 5-10% in gaming, and since almost all H61 boards only have two RAM slots, it allows the buyer to throw in another 4GB stick as a cheap upgrade.

&gt;and teh $400 build is the same damn thing with a more expensive jankier video card

Same reasoning as above. What do you mean about the 7770 being jankier?

&gt;IMO - cookie cutter builds should all be scrapped, because every one is going to want it to do something differently. I'm a label whore, so when it comes to certain SSD's, PSU's MoBo's etc... even if the reviews are all 5 stars, the price for performance is stellar, I'd still suggest something else if it's a brand that's screwed me over in the past cough foxconn cough.

That's silly. If you can't let a bad experience go then you can't really objectively evaluate part choices. There are people who swear off AMD or Nvidia because they had a card die once, or people who swear off Seagate or WD etc because they had an HDD die. Computer shit dies, and while you're free to make your own choices based on those experiences, telling others to not buy something because of a single poor experience you had once is not a good idea.

&gt;Instead of going cookie cutter, some one needs to scratch up a website that gives a flow chart or something.

You mean like [the Falcon Guide](http://i1002.photobucket.com/albums/af150/The_FalconO6/CurrentLogicalPCBuyingGuide/Guide.png)? 

&gt;Don't criticize my examples too much

I won't, but both of those gaming builds are vague, and extremely optimistically priced. Who would stick a $90 SSD in a $500 build? With everything else, and no peripherals or OS, you're left with about $70 for the GPU. Without the SSD that jumps up to $160, which will get you a proper GPU.","1354320514"

In my specific example I actually didn't gain any ticks with it at all since I can't hit the 2,5aps breakpoint with 33% ias. With 27% ias mace/dagger I'm at 2,0 and 2,5 aps respectively for an average tick rate of 7,62/sec. With 18% ias (or 27 which would give the same tick rate) and mace/EF I get 7,5 ticks/sec. So actually slightly worse tickrate in this example with the EF over the dagger, given that the results are not surprising. 

If I would get another ias item that made me hit 33% and the next breakpoint it would give 8,57 instead of 7,62 so a 12,4% increase in ticks. This would of course be much more favorable to the EF setup.

Not sure what you mean exactly in the last paragraph, I doubt Rawr has any big errors in its calculations. You know the mechanic of the tornadoes is that the damage is only based on the main hand but the tick rate on whichever weapon swung last so practically an average of mh and oh right? So yes that favors slow mh fast oh for dps.

I can't understand your point. 

A lot of people get killed in wars. 

It's not a question of why wars end, the problem is that we keep having new ones. 

Also:

- Afghanistan: [War still in progress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_%282001%E2%80%93present%29). 

- Iraq: [War still in progress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_insurgency_%28post_U.S._withdrawal%29).

And your list of ""**the past three major ""wars""**"" is pretty screwy 

You missed (among others) -

- The ""[Yugoslav Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Wars)"" (1991-1999) 

- the [First Congo War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Congo_War) (1996-1997)

- the [Second Congo War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Congo_War) (1998-2003):  ""The deadliest war in modern African history, it has directly involved eight African nations, as well as about 25 armed groups ... **killed 5.4 million people**, mostly from disease and starvation, making the Second Congo War **the deadliest conflict worldwide since World War II.**""

&gt;The people in ""the poorer places"" are people. ""The world economy"" includes the poor places and the poor people.

&gt;yes, but that is the future of these people, a negative population growth.

You can't just say ""I use my fate point so I don't die"", you must describe how Fate has swung your way and miraculously you have survived what would otherwise have been a fatal blow. Alternately, if this player death is a common problem, you could even let other players spend their fate point to save a comrade, if they can come up with a compelling description of how their character saves the character in jeopardy. 

As far as re-earning that fate point, I don't think I would give them one at a certain level. As a matter of fact, I would not tell them that they could get one back. However, if they finished some super major world saving, grand arc of an adventure, and did so with style and grace instead of a bunch of wining, I would consider replacing any spent fate points.

Authority, by definition, is the legitimate exercise of power. But how do we decide what is legitimate? We decide as individuals. 

Let's say there are 3 people on an island, Bob, Jill, and George. Bob declares dictatorship over the island, and declares the other two people as slaves. 

However, the other two people disagree with him, and refuse to be slaves. Bob attempts to use his power (in this case, muscles) to force them into a cage. Jill and George beat the living daylights out of Bob. 

Did Bob have power? Yes (in this case, not enough). Did Bob have authority? No. No one agreed that Bob should be dictator. 

Bob learns his lesson. After they forgive Bob, they all agree to have a vote. Whoever wins this vote is to be declared dictator for a year. The vote comes in, 2 in favor of Jill, 1 in favor of Bob. Bob voted for Bob. However, Bob understands that he lost, and now recognizes that Jill is dictator, and can do as she pleases. 

Jill is now the recognized dictator. All 3 people recognize her power. Does she have power? Yes. Does she have authority? Yes. The power is legitimate because the people on the island recognize it as legitimate. *Everyone is happy*.

Jill declares that moving the sacred Totem is a crime. Bob moves it anyways. Bob is punished, and grows bitter towards Jill. 

Bob thinks that this is unfair (objectively, Bob is wrong, he waved his right to influence public policy when he elected a dictator, however that is not relevant to authority). He wants to overthrow Jill. George is still loyal to Jill.

Does Jill still have power? Yes, she has the power of 2 people (her, and George). Does she still have authority? Yes-ish. Her power is legitimate to 2 of the 3 people on the island. Authority is not an objective value. It is subjective to the person recognizing the authority. 

Can Bob still be punished? Yes, Jill still has the power. Is it still ""justice?"" I suppose that would depend on your definition, but assuming that the law was just, and the punishment fits the crime, most people would consider it to be just. 

Bob can not stand the thought that someone as unfair as Jill will be in charge for the next year. Bob manages to convince George that the punishment is too severe, and that they should overthrow Jill. Does Jill still have power? Yes, but a minority of power (1/3). Does Jill still have authority? No-ish. Objectively, Jill has the right to do whatever she wants because everyone agreed to make her dictator. Objectively doesn't matter though. Jill no longer has enough power to sustain her dictatorship, and so she is overthrown. 

This is one reason why dictatorships are unstable. The only way to air grievances is to overthrow the dictator.

So, Democracies come about. Jill, George, and Bob decide that all decisions will be put up to a vote. Now, the power belongs not to a literal person, but an entity. No one person can decide what to do, the majority must. 

Now, when Bob doesn't get his way, he's ok with it, because he knows that he might get his way next time. Last time, when Bob convinced George, it lead to revolution. This time, it just leads to a new law being made. Everyone is happy. There is both power and authority in this Democracy. Bob, George, and Jill, agree to follow through with the will of the people even when they individually disagree.

Now to the question! 

Why can governments use force, where citizens can not? Because (nearly) everyone agrees that the government gets to use force, and no one is powerful enough to stop them.

That does not make them immoral. We are trained to hear the words ""force"" and ""violence"" and instantly demonize them. And why isn't it immoral? Because we need force in this world. We will need force until people stop interfering with other people, or in other words, never. 

Personally, I think that governments should exist to protect humans (and other animals) from other humans. 

Sometimes, this is apparent. For example, laws against murder and assault. Other times, it's more abstract. For example, laws against harming the environment (and by extension, future humans). Other times, it ultra abstract. For example, patent laws (I'm not a fan of current patent laws, but that is beside the subject). Patents increase the incentive to invent. With more invention, comes more money (for the inventor and society at large). With more money comes a greater standard of living. With a greater standard of living comes less harm (harm caused by preventable disease, for example).

All laws (or all good laws) can be traced back to the prevention of harm. These laws can only be enforced through, well... force. This force, ideally, is used to prevent harm. 

Most moral systems seek to prevent harm, and so by most moral standards, this force is moral. A government that attempts to prevent as much harm as possible, while inflicting as little harm as possible is a moral government.

But what of governments that have laws that harm, rather than protect? 

In dictatorships, you revolt. In democracies, you vote. In free societies, you speak, and you convince, until others agree with you (and no, these are not mutually exclusive, Singapore, for example, is a free Democratic Dictatorship). 

Yes, we will always have a violent government as long as we have people inside the country who are willing to harm others. It takes violence to stop harm sometimes. This is a sad truth, but it is the least harmful method. 

The world is not perfect, and all people have some amount of power. In order to minimize the harm done with that power, the government needs to use power of its own. Sometimes violence is involved. It is violence used to stop more violence. ","1354320530"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I guess what I meant was, I hope this reaching out process can help you in some way. I agree that 'see a therapist' is not an answer; your life, your love, your issues to work out. You can allow yourself to be influenced by others' words, but the influence you enact upon yourself is by far the most intimate. You need to recognize this influence, and if you find it is negative (constant haunting depression), you should change it.

Mine was an LDR that really dragged its feet as she got more and more emotionally distant. The last time I saw her was the worst time we had ever spent together. She never had the guts to tell me she didn't want it anymore, and after I found out about her infidelity, all she could tell me was 'I didn't want to hurt you'. But the way she said it, just emotionally dead, was devastating. She was my best friend and I shut her out of my life, I never spoke to her again, and you know what? It still hurts to this day. It was real bad for a couple of years, in fact, and honestly what happened was one day after choking on a relationship-talk with another woman I decided I didn't want to live like that. I did not force, but rather allowed, change in my life and attitude. I did this verbally as well, from myself to myself. It's been a little over three years now and I rarely think of her; when I do, it's usually in the dark and the cold, and I think about how things were there, and instead of feeling the hollow sorrow of the past years, I can now remember the warmth and love of the time that was. I couldn't dare face it before because I was afraid; but there is no nobler path in this life than to face your fears, and the only (and greatest) weapon in your arsenal is love.

I love her still. I don't feel like I have to love one woman exclusively, and to be honest nobody else has yet come along who could take her place. A couple have come close. But when I kept my fears to myself I suffered, and as I slowly loosened up and began talking about it to others, the fears abated. I've learned a lot since then, of life and love and many things, and one is this - change occurs, it just -is-. I believe it's not realistic to expect a monogamous relationship with someone for your entire life together. People shift and change, and sometimes they meet and sometimes they creep apart, and it's all part of the bigger pattern. Study it, and watch as laughter flows to tears and back, and revel in the fierce, bittersweet joys of the living for as long as you will.

Hope these words help you.","1354320531"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","from my experience their personalities are different. Ive been with big girls and skinny girls, and to me it seems like the big girls try a lot harder in a relationship. Honestly, and again this is just my experience and im not hating on skinny girls or whatever, but bigger girls seem a lot more real in my opinion. For example, in normal conversation a big girl listens more intently, pays more attention, contributes to the conversation etc. They tend to contribute to the relationship more in that sense. While a skinny girl (from my experience) tends to have a more ""yeah whatever"" attitude. Its like they have a ""I shouldn't need to contribute to this relationship any, Im ""model quality"" you should want me because of this and thats that."" Its like they take no interest in me and expect that I worship the ground they walk on. While a bigger girl will say oh you like Z, well Ive never done Z but id like to try, can we go together sometime? A skinny girl would have said to me yeah thats great good for you....yawn....They tend to have a holier than thou attitude while a bigger girl has more of a we are equals and I want to be a part of your life. as opposed to ""you will worship the ground I walk on, wait on me hand and foot, like the same exact things I do, never question me, always agree, and dont speak...just stand here and look pretty until i need you"". Maybe I just havent met a nice skinny girl yet that wasnt completely full of herself idk. I would also like to add that I am not too good with the words and the whole expressing things very well thing...What Im thinking makes sense in my head but just doesnt seem to work well on paper. I cant quite find the right words here, sorry. AAAAAND que the hatemail from skinny girls. btw this is also my throwaway, so I really dont care. Just sayin.


TLDR: Big girls are just nicer people in my opinion. A lot (not all) of skinny girls tend to be ""holier than thou""","1354320534"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Killing a character can disrupt the group dynamic.  These players have built up their characters and their interactions together, and it can be discouraging to suddenly be faced with making a new character that isn't part of that core.  

The flipside, of course, is that having a real and present danger of character loss means that they will appreciate the wins that much more.  If you feel like it's important that a character die (not that you go out of your way, but that it can naturally happen) then you have options.

As people have said, let the dice determine their fate.  But be prepared to be consistent.  If you ""let"" a character die, but you fudge other things, or let another's character live, it could cause resentment.

Or you could talk to one of the players, preferably one who really likes a challenge in the roleplay department, and plan out his death.  Use him as a sacrificial goat.  That way, the ice is broken on the death issue, the players will be freaked out and it might heighten the tension and suspense and overall enjoyment, and the player that ""went along"" will have a fun death to play, and he'll get the added fun of trying to roleplay integrating into an established party.

"vodka","t5_2r0x5","It seems like you haven't had much to drink, so I'm going to say this right now. 

I **highly** doubt you would enjoy a vodka martini considering how new you are to drinking. I would not expect you to even get halfway through it. I know people that have been drinking for years and they still can't even enjoy a dirty martini (which are my favorite). Also, don't ever say ""shaken not stirred"", martinis are always shaken. Vodka Martinis or Vespers (That ridiculously strong Bond drink) are NOT for beginners. 

If you are going for some classy starter drinks, I'd stick to some more basic yet classic well* drinks. 

* Screwdrivers (Vodka and OJ. Classic, simple, easy.)

* Tom Collins (Gin, club soda, lemon, sugar, maybe bitters depending on the bar. Excellent starter drink for gin if you haven't had gin before.)

* 7 and 7 (Whiskey and 7up. I'd only recommend a single rather than a double here unless you are already fond of whiskey. You could also just go with a whiskey coke with well whiskey.)

* Dirty Martini (Vodka/Gin, Olive Brine, Vermouth. When they ask if you want gin or vodka, tell them you want vodka; specifically, Absolute vodka. I'd recommend this if you feel a bit daring and if you enjoy olives. I enjoyed Dirty Martinis at my 21st bday. However, only get it at a sit-down occasion. You don't want to be carefully carrying a martini glass all around the bar.)

*Well. Well drinks is basically a term for whatever cheap alcohol the bartender uses to mix drinks. If you are getting a screwdriver, whiskey coke, or tom collins; if they ask if you want well vodka/whiskey/gin I would say yes. For the Dirty Martini, you may want Absolute or Stoli. For the 7 and 7, the bartender should be making it with Seagrams Seven. If they don't have that, don't be afraid to ask for their suggestion. ","1354320546"

Men may be psychologically healthier by being forced to face their problems instead of being given drugs.  The fact that females get these drugs so easily probably leads them away from dealing with the causes of their problems.

However, it would be a bad thing if that increased the tendency to give drugs to children.  That has the potential to affect the development of the brain and could alter the childs personality permanently.

So now for the controversial bit, are you listening SRS?  I think it would be better to look at the parenting of a child.

She was right, I had. But not because I presumed she was an idiot, rather the topic we were talking about the vast majority of people don't know anything about.

I do think your argument is valid. Not wearing any clothes may count as an expression in the same way that choosing one garment over another might count as an expression.

Another angle of attack can be brought from a consideration of unjust discrimination. In law we generally hold that in certain contexts (generally a public context in some way) individuals should not be discriminated for or against on the basis of irrelevant characteristics. Irrelevant, that is, to their participating in the public activity.

We explicitly enumerate those characteristics: race, gender, age, etc.

The clothes you choose to wear ought be added to this list. It is outrageous, for example, that a door thug can bar you from a night club because you don't have the right pants.

While society doesn't even recognise this injustice (let alone a discrimination for being nude) the same set of considerations can be brought to bear for nudity.

However, public nudity and public fucking are bound up in our general views about sexuality. Bound up in a way that I think these issues ought be considered as independent moral questions.

I would be curious to what you think of my own case for the

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","It's always encouraging to see people thinking critically about their beliefs.  It seems to me like you've rejected the more fundamentalist versions of religion, but now you're forced to consider the more moderate or liberal versions of religion before giving it up completely.  I was raised in a more moderate/liberal version of Christianity so I'd be happy to talk with you about things any time.  Feel free to message me.

As far as irreducible complexity is concerned, it seems like others have already provided excellent sources that show it isn't exactly a product of rational thinking.  ID causes some confusion because it isn't as ""hardcore"" as young earth creationism, and many moderates still subscribe to it because they've been told that there isn't a consensus among the scientific community.  For example, while I was still in high school, instead of being convinced that ID was reasonable, I was convinced that reasonable scientists supported it, which simply isn't true. It just so happens that this is one of few unscientific views that moderates never really let go of.

The point of poking holes in biblical contradictions isn't really geared to converting moderates and liberal Christians. It's mainly to get people to realize that the texts aren't literal. In fact, as a moderate/liberal Christian I really enjoyed watching atheists demolish arguments against a literal interpretation of the Bible because I agreed with them completely.  When it comes to apologetics, it quickly becomes apparent that very intelligent people have been working very hard to obfuscate the claims they are making.  It helps to look for things that could possibly set the Bible apart from other texts that apologists don't care to much about. What makes it different from the Quran? Or the gospel of Thomas? The gospel of Judas?  The book of Mormon? The Bhagavad Gita? All of these texts can be contextualized and interpreted as non-contradictory and infallible (although it's harder with some more than others).  The fact that you can interpret a text in a way that you agree with lends no credibility to the claims you're making, whether they're moral claims, historical claims, or theological claims.  I could interpret Mein Kampf in a way that supports my beliefs, and I could discard what the author believed in the same way that apologists discard what the authors of the scriptures actually believed.  The ability to extract good ideas from the Bible doesn't make it any more than just another text.  

The ""primordial soup"" question I think is quite confusing for multiple reasons.  First, I think it's easy to imagine how a self-replicating object could exist from purely natural causes.  (For an overly simplistic example, imagine a sticky ball of goop that grows in size as it comes into contact with other sticky goop.  If forces exists that could split that ball of goop, we suddenly have a self replicating object arising from natural causes.)  The question becomes ""How could consciousness arise due to natural forces?"".  The answer to that question is that we simply don't know.  Now it should be obvious that the religious ""rebuttal"" is really just an appeal to ignorance, or what can be called ""God of the Gaps"".  With that said, scientists are trying to close that Gap, and it's already apparent that it's almost certainly caused by the events in the brain, we just don't know exactly how yet.  

Hope this helps you think through things.  And again, feel free to message me if you want someone to discuss things with. ","1354320555"

If the funds aren't raised, then we will be selling all the merch offered in the kickstarter on our website and at comic conventions until we have enough to pay for the printing.

In front of me was a guy maybe 6 foot something, 230 (not muscular, but fat) and I am 5' 6"".  The 3 girls leave and he goes in.  A few seconds later the girls runs back and tells me she left her purse in there.  I said no problem, it's only him in there.  I knock on the door to hurry up.  No answer.  I try the handle, it is locked.

I, like many guys, don't lock the door when pissing, when there is an established line.  So I pull out the drivers license and jimmy the door.  From my view, I can see that he is not pissing, but behind the door at the sink.  The door slams shut in my face.  

I then jimmy the door again, and wedge myself in the bathroom.  With his back to me, I see him drop the purse, so i grab his collar, and put my knee into the back of his legs and pull him down with all my weight.  On the way down, I transitioned to on top of him with him falling in the tub.  On the way down he took the shower curtain and the towel rack.  I pin him down with a knee to his throat as he is swinging at me.  She is screaming, toilet is overflowing, and then my friend and more friends come in the bathroom.  They go though his pockets and find her $23 and a piece of paper with her name on it.

He gets ushered out and people poured beer on him when he was walking down the stairs.  About 10 minutes later, I am talking with another girl.

I tried to pack a lot if information into one video, mistake, and just got lost in the madness of it. Like I said, the exercises do work to some extent, but there are things I cut out for the sake of time. And I never condoned using duct tape. I was just telling my bad idea experience. I cut out a part that said if you insist on using duct tape, only use it for an hour or two, only because you don't have to wrap it completely around your chest and is by no means a way to bind on a regular basis. When I did I did it for 2 hours once a week. And the worse part was it sticking to my skin and leaving red marks. I could breath and move perfectly fine. Anyways, I'm in this to improve the videos in general. This channel isn't a die hard super serious channel anyway. I wanted to make a channel that when more like real conversation, less like an Anne frank video blog. Trying to get positive over here. ","1354320576"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Ok, from a logical standpoint, no.

He said it is ""less than half of what an average american makes in a year"".

Given that he said that, which provides a statement that can be figured out with math, we have that.

Since ""off"" and ""almost"" are statements that cannot confer an actual value, they can be disregarded in typical debates, but we're arguing over who is ""more correct"".

Given that 20,000 is closer to 32,000 (the average median income) than 0, it is not only ""almost"" (by some people's definition, it is 2/3 so that works for some people) it is also more than half.

So, the *one* statement that is being addressed by DJ's post is to some people as factual.

Then take a look at DJ's statement.  He makes two individual comments, one about half, and one about him being ""way off"".  While ""way off"" can be argued (it *is* 10,000 off) so some people would say that is way off, he is correct.  HOWEVER, he makes the statement that it is ""less than half"" which is not only not subject to interpretation but demonstrably false.

So, the statement of westrunner is more factually correct because it not only can be interpreted as correct, but because DJ's statement makes a false claim (even while making one that can be considered accurate).

I don't mind the halftime, and honestly, kind of like that feature. But the time limit completely changes the game and not necessarily in a good way. Rage quitting is horrendously common, especially once you get to that point of no return. They've lost anyhow, why not quit? They get a loss either way, and if they're not racking up kills, it's not worth it to finish out the game. And Domination is generally slow enough that you can figure out if it's already over or not as opposed to Hardpoint. 

Also, some of my favorite games of Domination were getting in a hole and being down 150-50, or getting to that point where you're just about fucked and suddenly making a break, throwing down a triple cap and holding it long enough to come back. That can't happen with a time limit. ","1354320584"

Maybe you don't or maybe you're just setting them out for discussion. Let me just see if I can help you understand (not change your mind) where some of the view points come from.

&gt;Intolerance? This is something thats exhibited by both sides. Go make a pro-republican thread in r/politics and see just how tolerant the dems are when they down vote it into oblivion.

True, but I think the point was to show intolerance towards things like gays, womens rights, non Christian religions, etc. I think these are pretty well known points that Conservatives tend to be intolerant about. What are Liberals intolerant of?

&gt;Xenophobia? Where the hell did this come from?

Immigration views of Conservatives tend to be mostly anti-immigration. Especially when they come from Mexico. Not saying it's right, but thats probably where it came from.

&gt; Refusal to pay taxes? I don't have a problem paying taxes when the money is being used efficiently.

The reality is that most Conservatives are against tax increases. Even against taxing the super wealthy a few % more. This especially true today where you have the Tea Party (Taxed Enough Already!) trying to lay claim to the party. 

&gt;Biased crap like this article is no better than the biased crap that comes from foxnews.

I didn't read the entire article, nor do I watch Fox, but I agree on principal.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Well, putting aside the mischaracterisation of MR as being all about how women suck, it is true that they don't seem to do much beyond complaining on the internet. Although it's not like most first-world feminists seem to do much else.

The problem is that they can't really do the same things that feminism did... 

When feminists campaigned against sexual abuse, they were just reinforcing the traditional social roles of women as victims, men as aggressors. It's easy to make people believe what they already believe, only a bit more. MRAs want to reverse the existing narrative.

When feminists wanted women to be able to enter the workforce, there were plenty of rich people who saw that as an opportunity for profit and were happy to help them. MRAs have nothing to offer the plutocrats that they aren't already giving.

When feminists wanted women to be sexually liberated, well, that wasn't exactly a really hard sell. People like to fuck. Telling people that they should do things they enjoy, then feel good about it, is pretty easy.

So, feminism had a bunch of things going for it from the begining. It also managed to serve as a good breeding ground for ruthless politicians who wouldn't otherwise have had much chance of getting significant power. Men's rights lacks that kind of strong, charismatic leadership, because the *male* social elite already have plenty of methods of getting into politics.

Maybe I'm a horrible cynic, but I think that most social justice movements succeed not on their moral merits, but on how well they fit the circumstances of the time.","1354320589"

&gt;The legendary helmer of Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle has yet to direct a film since the critical success of 2008's Ponyo, but has been rumoured to have been secretly working on a project for a while.

&gt;It had previously been announced that Miyazaki's film would be biographical and ""not the sort of work that everyone in the audience can relax and watch"".

&gt;Anime News Network says that anime director Osamu Kobayashi reported on his Twitter account that Miyazaki's latest work will tell the story of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Zero Fighter.

&gt;Horikoshi was an aeronautical engineer who had developed a number of military aircrafts before the Zero Fighter, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter aircraft used by the Japanese Navy during World War II, made him famous.

The reformer is a politician at heart! Disconnected in many ways from the real world. 

&gt;If you should carry out his ideas in your personal life, you would not have a rotten tooth that aches pulled out all at once. You would have it pulled out a little to-day, some more next week for several months or years, and by then you would be ready to pull it out altogether, so it should not hurt so much. That is the logic of the reformer. Don't be 'too hasty,' don's pull a bad tooth out all at once.

"starbound","t5_2tkp6","my theory on the procedural generation of npcs is that they have certain body parts, like for example, in the stream we're shown some sort of 4 legged spider/alligator/scorpion mix thing from hell, they take the legs, abdomen, head and tail and make them able to attach to certain amounts of other body parts (for whatever reason), then the game generates a species of monster based on that possibility of the parts connecting and tada, you've got the scropion/spider/alligator from hell.

Ugh I'm fucking starved! Lol no I told her to make me a pair! She said she'd have to find a pattern cuz the only mukluk pattern she has is the lil baby one I just told her to proportion it bigger to fit my size or take my measurements! I unno!

I my alarm for 6:45 but I just couldn't take the tiredness! So all I remember was walking through Circus Circus (it's a hotel) in Reno, Nevada, and I crazily ran into a cousin of mine at one of the little places in the hotel and so we talked cuz it was totally serendipitous and then I walked down stairs and once I reached the end of the stairs I was on a boat barely big enough to keep me afloat this boat was fucking tiny! I was off in the ocean in Australia and there was a swirling water tornado next to me and this guy in a different boat was telling me how if I got caught in it I would be transported like hundreds of miles away from land and so I tried my hardest to get ashore! My boat started sinking because there was a hole in the side or something and water started flowing all over and he was telling me how a few years back this guy got caught in the water tornado thing and he was taken like 600 miles away and he ended up running into a coral and he died so I was like way more fucking scared so I started rowing my way to shore which was like so close and I started imagining what was in the water around me and started freaking out cuz I imagined crazy huge killer sharks, mutated fish that were in a movie I watched last night, just crazy fucking sea creatures and once I finally made it to shore the other boat guy docked next to me on a beach and I opened up a case in my boat and got out a huge knife and what looked like an M-16 and I was getting ready to kill him when everything went black

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","The easiest way to make it sound like you have good tastes is to publicly dislike large corporations or games that are made for a mass amount of people.

Call of Duty is not a bad game. It never has been. It's not going to be a deep experience either, it's the equivalent of a large budget action flick. Its never going to win any awards but it's still a fun experience.

I also think gamers in general feel very entitled. They feel entitled to constant, free updates for their games. They feel entitled to devs developing and balancing their games to their specification. 

When you get these large companies that don't give into these entitlements you have people push against them.

I'm not going to argue that Activision, or EA are the bastions of gaming. However they are just companies, they aren't ""evil"" they just are concerned about making a profit. (like any company is, indie companies just go for a different angle to be accepted). 

I think that the arguement of these popular games ""corrupting"" the rest of the industry is silly. Indie games are a dime a dozen right now and what the big companies are doing isn't a big deal to them. It doesn't effect them because the people who buy their games aren't looking for indie game #213 to be a CoD clone.

It is indeed likely that it was in fact N traffic and I have now changed my AP's mode setting from mixed to ""G only"" (airodump-ng displays it as 54e in the ""MB"" column).

Prior to the match up, you research your opponent and figure out what will work against them.  If your strat happened to be picking a bruiser against his mid, only to have your opponent quit the game to change his rune setup to negate that pick is a little bit unfair.","1354320621"

On the other hand, if we rephrase it to ""women being *exempt* from the draft"" it becomes a lot more obvious that women not being drafted is a privilege rather than some kind of twisted oppression.

It's totally reasonable to use the fact that both sexes can enlist in military service to establish whether women being excluded/exempt constitutes a privilege or not.  The key is that they're not being denied any *opportunity*, but are avoiding a potentially fatal obligation.  I think what you're missing is that the argument is primarily about whether the draft itself is a privilege.  From my perspective, the existence of the draft is discrimination against men, because women have the ability to seek the same positions without the possibility of being forced to.

""*Womenâs exemption from the draft is not a âprivilegeâ that women have lobbied for and guarded. Womenâs exemption from the draft is discrimination that has been upheld by the States, Congress, and the Supreme Court time and time again. *""

It's kind of like saying that one racial group was being discriminated against by a law that allowed *another* racial group to be thrown in jail at any time without charge.  The first racial group can easily go to jail if they want to (just commit a crime), but it's clear that they're privileged by not having it hanging over their head.","1354320622"

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","You may want to look into a course like this: https://www.coursera.org/course/maththink
Or go through the (relatively cheap) book that this course uses. Such courses are pretty standard, but people have different feelings about them - I've heard professors praise these courses while others actively try to remove them from the curriculum.

As far as proof writing:
The crux of the problem is to take a high level idea and distill it into a structured, readable, and complete argument. That is, if you don't have a high level of idea of how to approach a problem, then your proof writing skills probably won't help you much. Conversely, if you have a good idea how to approach a problem, or even have great intuition for the details of a problem, you haven't necessarily gotten anywhere on writing a good, succinct proof. It also means realizing / filling in the blanks that your intuition leaves.

So my advice is this:

i) Pick about 7 problems (one per day of the week) that you have lots of intuition for, but is involved enough to require an argument that you feel has a meaningful difficulty level.

ii) Assign a day to each problem. Initially, write a proof for each problem, and put your best foot forward towards writing a clear, complete argument.

iii) Revise your proofs. On monday, revise the proof you wrote for monday's problem last week, and so on.

When you take breaks like this, you will have forgotten some or many of the details of what you wrote. If you critically analyze your previous proofs, you will begin to notice bad habits that occur in your proof writing, and eventually you will recall these bad habits when you're writing proofs instead. Here are some example questions to keep in mind while you revise.

1) Is my notation ambiguous?

2) Could my notation be clearer? (If you're writing for a class: are you introducing notation for something that either the lecture or your text has a standard notation for? Do you have a good reason for it? ... will you piss off your grader for making them learn your notation for something that should be standard?)

3) If I have a long paragraph of mixed english and equations, would some simple notation be better?

4) If I have a succinct notational argument that is trying to convey many deep ideas, will some english be better? (this is an almost-converse of 3)

5) If you read your work aloud, does it sound like something you are comfortable saying to a peer?

6) Will a peer who does not know much about the problem be able to follow your proof?

Hope this helps.","1354320622"

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","Some images are unrelated, I uploaded them by accident.

This here's 10 hours of gameplay where I took a shot of any joke or serious moment that alludes to homosexuality.

The game is rated M, and has lots of sexuality involved in it, but it's very mature (aside from the jokes made by teenagers) and it's approached rather seriously.

Quite a ways in (but not very far in overall) Kanji Tatsumi is introduced. He's a boy who basically got into gang stuff to scare off a biker gang that would keep his mother awake at night with their motorcycles. He has met a slim boy who expresses interest in him, and he does *not* even come *close* to knowing how to handle that idea.

He freaks out if anyone so much as implies he's off in some way, and he's incredibly insecure.

The basic plot of the game is that people appear on a strange TV channel, and then it seems they disappear in the real world and must be rescued. When they appear on the TV, exaggerated visions of things that appear to relate to them show up. In Kanji's case, we get the naked guy in the last few shots, who talks about sex and hot men with an exaggerated Lisp.

Yosuke, with the brown hair, tends to kind of react like he's afraid. Personally I think he's got some repressed homosexual tendencies or may be bisexual, but there's nothing outright confirming that. He does act like he's afraid to even think about stuff like that, and he may just be semi-bigoted out of unintentional ignorance, but that, too, is a good thing for the game to look at.

Unfortunately the game ends up making Kanji not totally accept his homosexuality, but it's clear to anyone plays that was an unfortunate cop-out on the developer's part.

Regardless, it's really nice. And since Persona 4 Golden is on the Vita, which has screenshots, I decided to try and take a picture of all the gay content in the game, including the jokes and innuendos (and things that could be taken as innuendo). 

There's a lot more where this came from. I love it. It's nice to see this kind of thing in a game and not as a joke or something defining a character with no personality besides. Kanji's a deep guy. It's a huge reason I love this game so much.

THIS is gayming. :D This is the kind of subject other games might want to consider taking on! I'll keep taking pictures, because Kanji's story is a significant chunk of the game and tidbits of his sexuality pop up at times throughout the entire rest of it.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","That's what I was getting at -- Moltke managed to turn it into something plausible, yet still a long shot.

But the Schlieffen Plan. If your plan involves traveling through sovereign nations, it's already starting bad. The entire premise of the plan was Belgium (why am I doubting that?) would capitulate. Well, they kind of did. While destroying their rail structure. Whoops. Also, it made the British mad. Whoops again. Thankfully for the Germans, the French actually did what they were ""supposed"" to do and the German right was saved with what it had, although they got caught up on the encirclement strategy, and the you end up with the trench line all the way to the ocean because at this point the Germans were too extended to actually penetrate on the right without cutting themselves off.

So, with a crippled rail way to the right flank, the bulk of the French forces on the Left -- though this was a fairly non issue, it did require reinforcement -- things settled down for a nice stalemate until the Germans could get their logistics together. Which also allowed France time to figure out exactly what was happening, and allowed for things to develop on the Eastern Front as well.

As far as the adjustments to the original plan, I don't know that they are listed anywhere in particular -- in fact, I believe when I was introduced to the subject, my Professor claimed no one had ever actually found the original plan at all. However, last minute adjustments called for might give some indication that the number of borders crossed would be limited, and the troop compositions were changed. While I tend not to get bogged down in such matters, I think this was one of the points of the back-stabbing myths after the war. I would normally try to use the German word there, but I know it isn't *Ruckstoss* to literally stab in the back, so the colloquialism escapes me.","1354320628"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Unfortunately, this isn't always the case, especially as a kid or a teenager. I had serious problems with depression and body dysmorphia as a teenager, and my attempts to bring it up to my mother and seek help were always met with, ""just cheer up,"" or ""it's all in your head,"" or just, ""bullshit."" 

My mother is a brilliant woman. Successful, driven, powerful, caring, intelligent. But she honestly didn't believe depression was something you couldn't overcome on sheer willpower. She continued to not believe me as my performance in school decreased, my group of friends grew smaller, and so on until, finally, I failed out of uni. The brilliant child of two highly successful business people was a failure. She wanted to throw me on the street. I wanted to kill myself.

Only because I was 19 at that point and old enough to seek my own medical care could I get help. It was the words of my psychiatrist that convinced her that I wasn't just a slacker. Our relationship is still awkward at times, but it's the best it's been since I was a child. Would it be great if speaking up solved these sorts of issues? Absolutely. Does it always? Not so much. If anything, we need more routes for kids to seek therapy on their own. They don't always have the words or the will to speak up for themselves.","1354320628"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","In practical terms I agree with [what wjbc says](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/142em5/to_all_what_are_your_views_about_the_death_penalty/c799fyj), and I think he provides a better summing up of the practical argument against the death penalty than I could. 

In psychological terms, I end up opposing the death penalty because there's a kind of occult symmetry between what the state does when it executes someone for murder and what that murderer does when he murders someone. (This applies specifically to murder and not to manslaughter, causing death by negligence, etc.) 

That is, the murderer usually thinks he's justified in killing his victim (because 'He disrespected me', 'She was sleeping with other men', 'He shot my homeboy', etc, etc, etc) and the state considers itself justified in killing him (because 'He killed someone who disrespected him', 'He killed his wife', 'He took out a revenge attack against another gang'). 

In both cases what's being said is that it's okay to kill people who do something wrong, so instead of the hoary old narrative where the death penalty, stark as it may be, is justified by the existence of murderers, rather I'd say it's the reverse: *murderers are justified by the death penalty*, which teaches everyone that when someone crosses you in a serious way, killing them is the correct response.   

On a separate note, a belief in Christian salvation ought to lead one to oppose the death penalty, because the murderer or rapist can repent at their hour of death and be accepted into heaven as long as they accept Christ. Killing them effectively frees them and doesn't do anything to try and make them see the suffering they've caused by their actions. ","1354320630"

We have the entire US-worth of land and resources to work with. Like I said, if Israel and Palestine joined hands and gave each other dutch rudders every Friday after work, it wouldn't change how inhospitable the area is. Having been there multiple times, it's an absolutely horrible place to live if you're looking for good land.

Trust me, if we fix this conflict tomorrow, there will still be HUGE water/natural resource/space issues in Israel &amp; Palestine.

&gt; I am directly addressing the original argument of ""Israel is 85 percent desert so we should just kick palestenians off of their land and build there"" 

To be fair, this is exactly what every country in the world does, and **did** at some point in history when times get tough. The US is guilty of infinitely more horrific war crimes than Israel, even today. Israel's civilian to combatant casualty ratio is almost 1:1, and in the US it's 3:1 (this number is for airstrikes, for other methods of engagement Israel is in line with the world's average.  [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualty_ratio) )

What I am saying here, is that people constantly villainous Israel for doing the same shit their own countries do/have done/will do in a time of war.

I'm just sick and tired of hearing assholes in Russia whine about Israel, when Russia consistently has genocides every couple of decades. I'm tired of people from the Netherlands whine about Israel and say ""Why can't those idiots live peacefully like us"" when there is no one trying to wipe out the Netherlands.

Us Americans are the fucking worst. Whining about Israeli war crimes while drone strikes kill civilians in the HUNDREDS. It's a fucking joke. Whining about how much tax dollars go to Israel when we spend exponentially more on killing people in Afghanastan &amp; Iraq (the latter of which is a total disgrace).

Not to mention literally 100% of the US is Native American land that we took through **war** by murdering innocent men, women and children.

And then these fuckstick Americans pull the ""it was in the past"" card, completely ignoring the Japanese concentration camps during WWII, how Germans were hunted down and lynched in the streets in WWI, how the US rejected thousands of Jewish immigrants after WWII, causing many of them to die at sea in shipwrecks. (Wikipedia entries for WWII)

The only way to solve the P-I conflict is to directly change Israel's laws so that there is a distinct separation of church and state, allowing an a Muslim to walk around as if they were Jewish and vice versa. Then you need to secularize the extremist Jews and pretty much all of the Palestinians, so that if a Palestinian takes a dump on the Wailing Wall, nobody cares, and if a Jew draws a picture of Mohammed eating dick, nobody cares.

Religion is the root of all evil **in that region.** 

I have never in my life met a secular Muslim or secular Jew who wasn't pro-peace and cohabitation. You don't even have to be atheist, you just have to make religion your own personal problem, and keep it out of the public sector.

Those are my two cents on this whole thing.

BTW I completely agree about your point of common goals, working together, etc. Unfortunately I don't feel this is possible while religion, nationalism, radicalism and genetic pride exist. :( ","1354320636"

To be honest I'm not necessarily nice to people in general. I'm polite, not intentionally rude, but I don't go out of my way to be nice.


&gt;Can you think of no benefits to being kind to others besides getting into heaven? 


The benefits of being kind are forming bonds with those you help and getting something in return. Based on that I'm kind to friends, family and people that I feel are decent individuals. 



&gt;Would you not know to be empathetic towards others without having had god tell you so?


I am, but like I mentioned before I don't go out of my way to help others, not counting friends and family. I don't give change to homeless people and I don't help strangers if it inconveniences me in some way.

"AskComputerScience","t5_2shke","First, this sort of question tends to lead to a flame war, and is normally considered trolling to ask, outside of much more specific questions.

Languages don't have ""speed"". That's like asking which is faster: Fords or Chevies. A particular program, implemented in a language, and compiled (or interpreted) by a specific compiler, can be measured under various metrics, such as wall time. So, for instance, a naive C compiler from the early 80s can be handily beat by a modern Lisp interpreter, for almost any given task.

Now, there are certain *semantic* guarantees a language can require that can negatively (and unrecoverably) affect perormance along some measure. The classic example is trapping FP in Ada. In general, C++s semantics are designed in such a way that their cost is zero, or nearly negligable. The same is not necessarily true of Java; the best example being the cost of boxing and unboxing values. In that sense, all other things being equal in implementation, there are times when C++ will be strictly superior in performance to Java. On the other hand, I know of no fundamental reason why, for a given program, that C++ would be worse than Java. Since C++ has looser requirements, one strategy would be to simply impement a Java VM in C++. (In fact, most Java VMs are written in C or C++.)","1354320641"

Now, Mama raised no fool. We had just passed the stations clock and its fairly common knowledge the Metro opens at 5. So I responded, ""5 in the morning, of course."" 
I was aware something was about to happen. The guy asking the question jumped in front of me on the stairs, mid-stairwell, lunged for the pocket my phone was in. I smacked he hand away and said, ""Don't bother me."" 
But then I felt some hands on my shoulders and knew it was on. With my left hand, I slammed the man in front's head into the stairwell wall. I continued with my left hand, grabbed the hand on right shoulder and yanked it hard while opening my stance to him and brought my right elbow directly into his face. Unbeknownst to me there was a third to their crew and seeing this he turned to leave. I grabbed his leg and pulled it out from under him. They picked each other up and ran up the stairs. I yelled after, ""Stop robbing!""

There won't be very many of them in relation to the total number of subscribers, but there will be enough that you'll be able to detect changes in voting, if that is something that matters.

Any sub is going to have an instant participation number that's way, way less than its total number of subscribers.  If something picks up fifty votes after being linked, that is a pretty huge effect when the comment was (2|0) or something before it was linked.","1354320651"

So instead I smoke pot. That's pretty much the only thing I've found that really works. It's allowed me to keep working, and kept me out of a wheelchair. 

If it makes you feel better for some odd reason to think of me as a worthless addict, that's fine, but I wouldn't be surprised if I pay more in taxes every year than you make.

I notched up a DUI while I was at it (there is never a convenient time to serve your jail time in the middle of a semester in case the judge asks), and got two C's, two D's, and and F. I was on scholarship at the time. I got a letter from the university stating my scholarship was going to be revoked. This was devestating, but completely self induced. 

Fortunately, I could appeal. I did. I won my scholarship back but with a condition that if I fucked up again, I would lose. I responded by hanging out with the smartest mother fuckers in the class, and spending all day on campus. 8 am to 8 pm, like it was my job. I retook the class I failed, and I managed to graduate in four years with a 3.1.

I'd like to see you try to find those sunny dispositions in south central in the face of a woman that works at the dmv (the alleged bureaucratic black hole). I don't even agree with corn subsidies, but you can't change the fact that corn grows here the most places, and the market demands that its grown in those quantities. It's the same as Sweden and Norway, everyone wants to talk about how awesome they are and how socialism can save America, when they are two tiny nations of rich white people.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Anyone familiar with the DC area will get a kick out of this one. A few years back I had an internship in DC, and I was out on the national mall on 4th of July watching the fireworks. After they ended, we headed to the Metro to go to the Bethesda station and hit the bars.

When we stepped off the Metro and went through the turnstiles, I looked at the massive escalators ahead of me. There were tons of people going up the exit escalator, but absolutely none going down the entrance escalator (shouldn't it be called the de-escalator?). I drunkenly thought it would be a great idea to run up the descending escalator, without really thinking this through.

For anyone who has been to that station, they understand; it is the longest escalator in the western hemisphere...[literally](http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/images/cache/854c6f3c2a321f33269be6e6bf4f9327.jpeg). I dashed up the descending escalator with all the energy in the world, and it seemed like a piece of cake at first. Suddenly I was hearing roars of applause and saw flashbulbs going off all around me. Adrenaline was shooting through my veins like never before. I made it about halfway up and realized I really miscalculated this whole idea...but I couldn't let my fans down. I let the adrenaline pump me up about 3/4 of the way until I had to take a few short rests. I was literally 10 steps away from the top when a cop looked down at me and told me to go back down, much to my and the crowd's disapproval.

When the adrenaline wore off and I came back to reality, i've never experienced worse muscle fatigue in my life. I seriously could barely walk to the bar it was so bad...but I will always remember that experience.","1354320658"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'd love it if warp drive was possible. Acubierre drives aren't a new concept. The thing that's new is that they previously tought that it would take them impossibly huge amount of energy to make it work. Recently they found out they could in fact make this work with a somewhat resonnable amount of energy. That doesn't solve the several other problems with the drive, one of the major one being that it requires exotic matter, something that is only theorized of which we have absolutly no beginning of even the smallest of proof that it exists anywhere in the universe. And it have to have negative mass, a property that'e never been encountered and that most scientist think impossible. 

And even if you take other warp drive designs, you still have the same problem with any FTL travel. going faster than light means that yo go back in time. A warp drive and a time machine is the same thing. And that's conflciting heavily with causality, something we see everywhere, everyday, that we don't want to be untrue. Unless you're okay with multiverses and landing in a different one everytime you travel.

EDIT: as an aside, be cautious when reading pop-science article like that. They tend to ignore MAJOR points because they want their readers to be dreaming about new technologies and possibilities. Not the fact that if FTL travel was possible, it would shatter our understanding of causality and probably be very dangerous.","1354320663"

"allthingsprotoss","t5_2tkqb","Make sure that you aren't expanding too far behind your opponent, or if you're going for a harass build (phoenix or blink) that you're doing enough damage to stay relatively even. Personally, if I'm not being heavily pressured by my opponent I go for a 3 stalker rush into two sentries into nexus into robo into two more sentries (this is a pretty safe 2 gate expand build used by Oz, Huk and others). This allows you to take a sufficiently greedy expansion while still being pretty safe from all-ins, with a nice  bonus of early map control/scouting with your initial 3 stalkers. After expanding you should be scouting for various all-ins, especially funny things like chargelot/archon, which you should have a gateway wall up to hold. After the threat of early all-ins has passed, you want to transition into double robo colossus with some zealots added in occasionally for safety. Once you've made 8-9 colossus, you should cut colossus production and sprinkle in a few more immortals (I usually go up to 5) and about 5 archons as well. In my PvPs I usually try and go for a timing attack when I'm maxed with a good composition and my +3 attack finishes. I don't bother with a mothership unless the game goes on a lot longer than my initial attack and neither of us want to attack into each other (as it takes up a decent amount of supply, is costly, and can be nullified with a single feedback and ample detection).

"raspberry_pi","t5_2syto","That doesn't answer my question in any way whatsoever.

Edit: Apparently I'm being downvoted for following reddiquette. This board stressed that it was important to follow it on here, so I did and downvoted his post for being unhelpful.

So let me explain myself a little and sound like a total dick.

&gt;Get the two from the website. Only costs you a fiver. 

He is talking about the license for [MPEG-2](http://www.raspberrypi.com/mpeg-2-license-key/) and [VC-1](http://www.raspberrypi.com/vc-1-license-key/) respectively. I was asking about which audio and video combo to use. By default the RPi has h264 decoding on a hardware level. I *think* that means it also decodes AAC audio but I'm unsure. Some h264 files have audio that is DTS, or AC3, or even MP3. I want to know which I should use (and ideally whether I should use the MKV container format or MP4 (note, the container format, not the codec, although we've already established that the MP4 codec, h264, is probably to be used).

At no point does MPEG-2 enter the conversation. It's a codec from the late 90s and is used for DVDs, and freeview transmissions (if memory serves), amongst other things. It was superseded by things like MPEG-4 Part 2 which in turn has been displaced by H264. H264 is probably going to be replaced fairly soon by something like HEVC but that's another matter entirely.

VC-1 on the other hand is a bit more recent but also not of interest due to its fairly niche position. It was the codec behind HD-DVD for example. Yay, useful.

So both of those suggestions as you can see, are not only unhelpful but they're actively irrelevant.

&gt;Then get a large hard disk.

Again, my topic states:

&gt;Much of the content is on a couple of hard disks that'll be hooked into it via USB, the rest will come from samba shares.

So his solution is to buy a license for an outdated codec and transcode my stuff into *larger* files and then deal with the storage problem by getting more hard disks.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","I never really thought it would be good. 

There is a distinct difference between appreciating and practicing. I love goth ninja. I love great concertos and paintings and food. I can't necessarily wear goth ninja well or compose or paint or cook. I don't think that necessarily detracts from my expertise, like others are suggesting in this thread. You don't have to dress goth ninja every day to appreciate or critique fits, much like you don't have to know how to cook to know what food tastes good and what food tastes bad to you.

That's why the whole ""let's see your fit"" insult that a lot of people use on MFA to shut down someone else mid-argument is pretty stupid. A person can critique outside of their own personal style. Sometimes it's a relevant point of contention if someone has been demonstrably horrible in their fits and is clearly regurgitating things of which they have little understanding, but most of the time it's a frail leg to support your argument.

I think I've gone off on a rambling tangent again, for like the fortieth time today. Oops.","1354320666"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","You are deliberately making those generalizations sound ridiculous by saying ALL when you make them.  The point of a generalization is to say most or almost all, or more than the general population.  If we made any of those statements less total we could have a sensible discussion about whether they were true.  It is not generalizations that are the problem but generalizations that don't fit with the facts.   Proper generalizations are essential for debate, the only people that pretend otherwise are those who don't like what those generalizations imply.

&gt;In a white supremacist group, every individual signs on to the idea of being superior to others.

How do you know this?  I am sure many Nazis signed up because they believed Germany needed to be removed from the harsh restrictions after the treaty of Versailles, and wanted to restore the German economy.  Maybe some even signed up because they wanted animals to be treated equally. Saying not all nazis are like that doesn't work though, because even the nazis that didn't really want all the jews killed tolerated anti-Semitism in the movement and supported allowing people who hated jews to be in power, even if they didn't know the full extent of the planned atrocities.  

Obviously the two movements are not the same in terms of scope and how bad they are: that is not the point of the analogy.  The point is that feminism has done many anti-male things, and the relationship of feminists to those things (in terms of responsibility) is the same as the relationship of members of the Nazi party to the Nazis actions.","1354320670"

In terms of Nhatphromoo, it was a safe, sustain, kind of passive lane. Just let Aphro sit and farm, trade if necessary and then carry near end game. When do we ever see Muffin play Janna? Almost never. It's not necessarily because Muffin is bad, it's just that their playstyle just doesn't work quite well in high competitive play.

The fact that there is a country, and not some backwards country either this is the UK, have a legal definition for the word which specifically removes any racial connotations and is used so prevalently that Roma don't just call each other gypsy but use it in their professional dealings with non-gypsies means that there is a huge difference between the two situations of calling a black person a nigger and calling a Roma a gypsy.

"politics","t5_2cneq","my party is the ""stop the bullshit party,"" im right leaning, but i dont support the republican party. ive written in my alter ego tom blumpkin for the last 3 elections (3 elections, 7 votes, try it some time its easy!) :) and you would do well to stop blaming everyone but democrats, amigo. revisionist history only works when those who were around at the time are all dead

these things are not as complicated as some will lead you to believe. dubya was not responsible for the first bubble, as it burst before his election, and the recession followed 2 months after his inauguration, he then took us out of it (a tax cut and spending on wars, remember what i said about fiat money?). the second bubble and ensuing shit the economy took is directly traceable to the dodd-frank bill.

i didnt say i expected obama to clean up the mess in a year (forget that its taken almost three and half to get back to pre-2008 unemployment levels and see any sort of recovery), what i did say is that to take two years *ignoring* a horribly faltering economy is irresponsible. hell, ill bet you that if the democrats focused on the economy first, and things started improving, they wouldnt have gotten annihilated in the midterms and could have passed the aca too! within two years! i give you one year of blame to republicans, *solely* because bush presided over the beginning of the crash, just as i assign blame to clinton for the previous bubble, all is fair. to take no action in two years with the presidency and congressional majority cannot be blamed on the republicans, inaction is inaction. a lot of talk about obstruction but there wasnt much going on to begin with!

i agree full heartedly that the republican party has it backwards on the social issues, in my opinion, a small government means administering infrastructure, schools, courts, and not much else, and certainly not telling people how to live (both sides are guilty of this, however). the reason im part of ""stop the bullshit"" is because there is a difference between theory and practice. there are good conservative ideas and good liberal ideas, the republican and democrat parties however demagogue the issues to high hell","1354320677"

It makes it appear like it's parallel to the camera, and not distancing. Which would mean her legs aren't pointed away, but just really short and pointy.

It's a very small point, I admit. But he/she wanted feedback. :)

Edit: Maybe it's not that. If Supergirl was curving her back and legs so that her legs were that short in perspective, the boots would be a lot shorter, and we'd see less of them because they would be pointed almost directly away from the observer. We'd see almost nothing of boot, but the top of it, and her foot.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","The main conflict, however, is about large territorial gains. The move by Israel is merely a part of a larger conflict that exists between Israel and Palestine. The house analogy is invalid due to the massive difference in scale and the different authorities which govern the disputed area. When it comes to a house, there are local and national authorities to deal with the problem. There are normal legal outlets and authorities empowered to enforce them, hence the document comment.

The international arena, on the other hand, is naturally anarchic. Yes, international organizations such as the UN exist, but their actual power is weak. If any country wants to defy the UN or another organization, all the organization itself can do is urge members to act against it. Resolving large territorial disputes is, therefore, nearly impossible unless both sides of the conflict agree. What you, and other redditors as well, seem to be pushing for is the opposite: forcing Israel to comply with terms it had little say in negotiating.

Recall the Treaty of Versailles. It was negotiated after WWI to essentially punish Germany for its actions during the conflict. The treaty blamed Germany entirely for WWI and created such strong resentment that it eventually led to WWII. (http://library.thinkquest.org/CR0215466/treaty_of_versailles.htm a good sum up if you want a little more info).

If we continue to attempt to place all the blame on Israel and force it into accepting terms it would not otherwise agree to, a similar situation may play out. Israel is already a volatile, reactive nation with nuclear weapons. If Israel is left out of negotiations about territory it feels it possesses, that will only anger the government and cause even greater conflict and even more civilian deaths. All finger pointing does is cause more rifts and conflict, and since when has that gotten us anywhere? 

Invoking the Holocaust - yet another weak analogy. War is substantially different from genocide. War crimes can be separate from genocide as well. There have been civilian casualties on both sides. There have been rockets fired on both sides. The PLO has aligned itself with Hamas, a terrorist organization that has attacked Israeli civilians on multiple occasions. Palestine is fighting. (For the sake of length and the assumption that you know of Israel's offenses, I am not going into detail of them. However, I acknowledge that Israel has been very violent). This is war. Making a comparison to the Holocaust is both false and trivializes genocide.

Just because Palestine's cause is considered more morally sound, you cannot discount the fact that they have used violence to advance their cause as well. Without cooperation and understanding from BOTH SIDES violence will continue to pervade.","1354320680"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Because both overlap and could benefit from functionality of the other.

For starters, Photoshop's vector tools are limited. But they're also easier and more intuitive to use. But they lack advanced vector functionality.

Illustrator can only do vectors and is about useless for much else. But that's such a relatively small field and building its most useful functions into Photoshop would make Photoshop a more powerful image editor while also removing overlap.

Fireworks is also entirely useless. Just build better web and mobile optimization into Photoshop's export functionality.

InDesign has the best case of the full products to be an independent software, but I'd love to see advanced layout tools added to Photoshop. A Layout Mode could probably emulate InDesign, and advanced typography tools can aid everyone using Photoshop.

Camera Raw (which also heavily overlaps with Adobe's other tool, Lightroom, which offers less functionality but is being pushed more) is an excellent piece of software, but the photo retouching capabilities should just be native to Photoshop without needing to open up Bridge and extra plug-ins. It also needs to be expanded to work with more than RAW images, though obviously RAWs are always preferable.

All five of these products can be boiled down to image creation, manipulation, and export. They deal with visual design through still or animated imagery. Building them into one or two distinct tools instead of five or more overlapping ones makes sense to me. Many of them have visually similar UIs that remain functionally distinct. If you're used to the UI of any one of them, you might feel at home in the others, but will find yourself quickly lost and unable to perform functions that are simple in another program. Obviously, stuff like Camera Raw doesn't have this problem, but Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign are the worst. Photoshop can be hard to create layouts in and typography is limited with options scattered. Illustrator can do vectors and gradients but anything else is beyond it. InDesign means importing graphics from the other programs to do anything, and also means hopping back and forth between them.

It seems much easier to just put it into one major product. Of course, at this stage, Adobe also needs to rewrite their code to be more efficient and lumping five programs together would make the problem worse, but it's a good long-term goal.

Oh, and while they're at it, why not just merge After Effects and Premiere?

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Something similar happened on my base in Afghanistan. It wasn't nearly as bad though. I was just sitting in the aidstation watching a movie and these two guys came in saying Mike just cut his finger he is on his way over. So I started getting up to get stuff for minor cuts then the guy came through the door holding is hand up. Turns out they said he cut his finger OFF. It was the same thing as in the picture where he didn't clean cut it off but basically all the skin around his ring finger from about half way up was gone and it was just bone sticking out.

  Apparently he was spotting for someone who was doing squats in the gym when it happened. Instead of being behind the guy like most people do, he was on one side of the weights and another guy was on the other side. The guy doing the squats started to fall and dropped the weights so Mike tried to catch them but his finger went between the weights and the bar stand thing.

  He took it like a champ though he wasn't acting like he was in pain at all. He was even joking around with me about it and just talking like nothing happened. I asked him what his pain level was because I was going to give him morphine and he said it was a 2/10. When we gave him to the flight medic to fly him out he was shocked that the guy didn't want any meds.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","I'm rather familiar with Portland, thanks, and it's a somewhat unique situation here. They sold the vast majority of their ticket inventory the first day they were available in February so keeping up the technical sellout streak was never going to be threatened. Attendance technically went up because they made more seats available this year. The main way for most people to attend a game here is the secondary market though and it [crashed and burned](http://timbersarmy.org/supply-this-is-demand-demand-this-is-supply) this year. While that's hard to get official numbers on, for whatever anecdotal evidence is worth I'll say that the markup on Timbers tickets went from about 200% last year ($60 for a TA ticket on Craigslist) to almost nothing this year ($20 which is basically face), there were times when I saw people having trouble selling tickets at face value. I saw large numbers of empty seats for the first time later in the season, and there would have been more if they had not been in contention for the Cascadia Cup, which means a lot here. It will be interesting to see the season ticket renewal rate when it's announced, I can pretty much guarantee it'll be less than the 97% it was last year, and they didn't raise season ticket prices for next year as everyone expected before the season. Those are more quantifiable affects. If there wasn't so much built up demand here before the season even started, the effects would have been even more noticeable, and not all MLS teams have the same size fan base in their city as we do. 

Toronto's attendance [dropped over 10%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer_attendance#Historic_average_attendances) this year from last year, which was the 2nd largest drop in the league, so yeah some of their fans did stop showing up.

&gt;Playoffs draw smaller crowd than regular season games.

I'm sorry but that's just wrong. Average playoff attendance has been higher than average regular season game attendance for all but one year since 2007 ([source](http://www.worldfootball.net/zuschauer/usa-major-league-soccer-2012-playoffs_2/1/)). Even if you break down the numbers on that site and compare each team's playoff attendance with their regular season attendance, in 2011 and 2010 the teams playoff attendance averaged an increase of 3% from their regular season average. But feel free to make the argument that those numbers are skewed because teams that make the playoffs already have higher attendance, because they in fact do. In the past 3 seasons (2010-12), using the [Wikipedia attendance numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Attendance), teams that have made the playoffs have averaged 18% higher attendance than non-playoff teams. (2012 Playoff Teams Ave: 20709, Non-Playoffs: 17149, 2011 Playoffs: 19276, Non-Playoffs 16109, 2010 Playoffs: 17785, Non-Playoffs 15652).

So yeah, the evidence does suggest that playoff contention is correlated with higher attendance, and playoff games do benefit attendance. I'm sorry if it's a bit harsh but the reality is that teams can't just depend on all these wonderful fans you're talking about to love and support them when there's no hope for their season. It's a business and when they're selling a bad product teams are going to find less willing buyers. If you greatly reduce the amount of time most teams are in contention for a championship each season then you're going to drive fans away.

TL;DR: Real numbers.","1354320691"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I tried it for a while. It was rough going being a newb in the game and making money wasn't easy. After 2 months of just learning how to play I was out on a mission trying to make some bigger bucks when out of nowhere this ship comes flying in and taking all my loot that was left after I had blown up the mission ships. I sent him a message asking him to please stop stealing my loot I worked hard for. He laughed at me and kept on stealing my loot. He was red to me (aggro) so I figured I wouldn't stand for someone stealing my loot so I took a shot at him...you know like a warning shot.... 

He warped/jumped out of my mission area and I continued my mission thinking I just defended my own. A minute or so later a much much larger ship jumped into my view and rained hell down on my ship (very overkill). I responded to him with something along the lines of ""oh come on man that wasn't called for..."" He didn't like that very much so he blew up my escape pod and sent me back to some cloning facility left with a couple thousand ISK (the currency of EVE), which wasn't enough to get another ship or anything. I had a few cargo ships but they weren't combat ships at all so I just gave up at that point. I couldn't buy anything and I was stuck at some station. It was all fun up to that point. 

To add insult to injury, I get an in game mail from the killer/robber stating something along the lines of ""You have just been killed by JoeBlow. Know that you deserved it and should probably go crying to mommy. Know that if you try and come at me again I will do everything in my power to make your life a living hell. Just quit playing, loser.""

I'm all for fun and games but what he did was legal to do apparently. I had invested so much time in getting the ship I was using that I was flat broke from all the nice upgrades I had just gotten. I said fuck it at that point. ","1354320699"

                                                                        2: The same can be said about any other class
          Scout: No skill meatshotting
          Soldier: Splashing, Crocketting luck class
          Demoman: Spamming little kid
          Heavy: Too easy and extremely overpowered
          Engineer: Skilless builder class, no place in tf2
          Sniper: CoD class, useless
          Medic: Healing class; team bitch
          Spy: Trickstabbing little brat

In my experience playing most every class, you'll get these insults a lot. The trick is to play the class you feel comfortable with and not care what the people who can't counter you say. It sucks that people complain about it, but that's just how it is. Personally, pyro is one of the most skill-intensive classes in the game, but you won't hear that from the people I kill.

No one is gonna sit there for 2 mins waiting to complete certain quests just to get rewards that are equal to or inferior to simply finding an elite pack and killing it. 

Be cool if there's some sort of achievement where you can do a large number of these events for particular drops that only drop from them for perks like a cool looking hat or a new skill for your follower (I'd love some paragon levels for my follower for instance) or customizing how your follower looks etc. 

This game has absolutely none of that. I just chalk it up to laziness honestly. You can't think of great games without endearing things that are pleasant to do or make you obsess over, does D3 have that beyond the chance of a godly item? Not IMO.

I played OT and DT, and of course I was lined up against a guy who had 40 lbs on me, and he played guard and DE.  This guy was a beast, was looked at by many universities, and all around probably one of the best players in the league.  I was by no means bad at the game, but no one really thought I was that good.  For the first quarter I was running past this guy like he was nothing, had no troubles blocking him (he would push me back, but I kept him out of the play).  Second quarter happens and they decide to cross block, the OT was jamming his helmet into my arm so bad I pretty much lost the use of my bicep.  I proceed to force the guy lined up against me to have the worst game of his season, in front of 2 scouts too, with pretty much no use of my left arm.  Felt pretty bad ass","1354320718"

Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? Less so. 

A lot of players fall into the line of thinking that just because they like a card(s), they deserve to win just because they don't want to follow the meta. That's silly; some cards are statistically better than others as proven over time and applied theory, and if the card(s) you like happen to be considered bad, you're not very likely to top a competitive environment.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","I treat speed as simply another stat, albeit a hidden one. That mighty weapon has 5 desirable offhand rolls, with a near max crit damage and life on hit. Note that to get more raw dps, you would have to lose one of str+vit, LOH, LS, CD or socket, so the low DPS is totally understandable in this context.

The only downside is that it isn't a faster weapon, but you might be overstating its importance. Best case scenario, a dagger paired with a mace gets 30% faster tick speed at 67% IAS roughly half the time, while the other half of the time you spend fury more quickly with WW while your tornadoes tick more slowly. More typically, you have an 11-15% difference in tick speed if your IAS is in a different range, this of course occurring only half the time. ","1354320725"

&gt;The federal indictment unsealed on Thursday names BP well site leaders Robert Kaluza and Donald Vidrine, claiming they acted negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig before the deadly explosion in April 2010.

&gt;The indictment says Kaluza and Vidrine failed to phone engineers onshore to alert them of problems in the drilling operation.

&gt;The indictment also charges David Rainey, who was BP's vice president of exploration for the Gulf of Mexico, with obstruction of Congress and making false statements.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt;Also if you blame skill orders for your inability to farm then you really need to work on your micro.

I don't think there is a need to be arrogant here. I'm high Elo, if not higher than you, and I am also an AD main with 200+ games of trist in S2 with ~55% winrate. Trist's e makes it difficult for anyone to last hit with maximum efficiency. It often puts you in a situation where you will lose 1 cs no matter what you do (and last hitting under tower nearly impossible). I have no problems microing at a high level. 

Saying there is a right way and a wrong way is closed minded, and any pro is going to tell you the skill order for Trist will depend on the situation. If you have a support with a stun/snare, you will land your rocket jump. Janna, Draven, Vayne, and Lulu are the only traditional bot lane champs that can interrupt her jump, and it isn't easy to pull off the interrupt. If you rank up her e, you won't be able to zone as efficiently, so I definitely don't agree with you stating e gives her better lane control.

As for trades/pokes, any other adc has a poke ability that hits harder than trist's e, and many of them scale with AD. At level 4, Phosphorus Bomb does 230 magic damage compared to Trist's 200 dmg level 4 e. Yes, if they are constantly getting hit by e's passive from minions dying, you will win exchanges, but that's not ideal in every situation.

I'm not saying your skill order with Trist is bad, I'm just saying I'm not familiar with it and it doesn't make logical sense to me at first glance. I'll have to consult some pro adc's on their opinion. As for now, I'm not convinced by the explanations given.","1354320727"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Pointing out inconsistencies in these various studies is often based upon political, social or other outside desires.  Most are extremely well manage,d and extremely accurate.

Scientists accept that schitzophrenia is very genetic, because fraternal twin studies (not that many mind you) and identical twins all exhibit higher than normal correlation coefficients.

However, intelligence is seen to a huge correlation in heredity.  In fact, most say .8-.9 for kids at all, identical twins are nearly 1.

Schizophrenia on the other hand, is only 0.1 for kids in general vs .68-.8 for IQ.

This is regardless if the children are raised by their biological parents or not.  The preference to ignore overwhelming evidence with regards to racial and hereditary links for intelligence belies a political will and is NOT related to the actual accuracy of the studies.

Just to be clear, what defines schizophrenia is way more dubious than what defines intelligence.  The G-factor is basically what the vast, vast majority of people would call intelligence.

The dial will have 2 pegs near the perimeter that are supposed to fit into the movement. If the  date window is at a different location, the pegs won't line up correctly and your dial will be rotated a bit. 

If you find a dial with the date window at a different location, you can get around this problem by cutting the pegs off and using dial dots to secure the dial to the movement.

When we silicone seal a newly fitted bath to the wall tiles, we fill the bath to the brim with water so the seal doesn't break when somebody steps into the bath for the first time. This seal was totally pulled away from the wall, and the adjustable supports had sank into the wood they were sitting on, there was a lot of weight in there because the bath was cracked too.

Thanks for sharing your story - I appreciate the response. And yep, I do AA. It's the tales of multi-year sobriety followed by slips that really scare me. It's awesome when people make it back into recovery/sobriety, but who knows how long (and at what cost) the relapse can be.

Things for me right now are, on average, pleasant these days. And I believe things will continue to stay pleasant as long as I do the right stuff to stay sober. On the other hand, sometimes it feels like never taking healthy risks because they might present a threat to sobriety (in terms of emotional wellbeing), can be a little too complacent. Kind of the equivalent of locking yourself in a jail cell and saying ""but I'm sober!"" So I'm cautiously taking a couple steps outside the cell now, and it's a little scary.

Isn't false dichotomy somewhere on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy?

This is huge. You're still blaming and attacking yourself. YOU didn't hit you. YOU didn't act possessive. That's all on him. Don't for a second put it on yourself.

&gt; WHY DO I STILL MISS HIM? 

You already hit part of this - he was someone to ""protect"" and ""be there"" for you, even in a twisted, unhealthy way. You miss that feeling, I'm guessing. But also, he damaged your self esteem. He blamed you for virtually everything. So there's a part of you that maybe feels it would ""fix"" or the self blaming would lift if things were ""back to normal.""

But they weren't normal in the first place. You've taken a huge step in realizing this would cost your life (both in independence and, perhaps quite literally with the abuse, a threat on your health). Some of this will heal naturally if you choose someone next time who is trustworthy and unequivocally kind. We can get a lot of healing through positive relationships.

But some of this you'll have to keep reminding yourself of. It's not your fault, and even the dad-issues aren't your fault (you didn't choose your father's death). But try to recognize them. Maybe ask yourself what you wish you had gotten from your father, that either he couldn't provide or his death deprived you of.

The migration of methane-rich fluid from deep below into shallow aquifers was concluded unlikely except for a few cases.

In other words, no additional land is being used for them. In fact, no new settlements have been built in over a decade and thus no additional land has been taken since the late 90s. That point is significant because it means that the Palestinians are NOT losing land from their future Palestinian state. These continual news reports we see about settlement growth make it sound like settlers are taking additional land, ergo the Palestinians are losing land. That's simply not the case.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","I was in your shoes, except my first bf was very emotionally manipulative, and it wasn't until I removed myself that I could see what he had been doing. You are lucky that you had a great first experience, and the first time is always the hardest, but you will grow to appreciate the experience and it will help you through a lot of other relationship experiences in your life.

It will get better. Concentrate on friends and hobbies, even though you're feeling miserable. It's going to take time, and there's nothing you can do to speed it up or avoid it, but keeping yourself in a good place for when you're able to see the light at the end of the tunnel is important. 

You will meet someone new. And you probably won't see it coming. It's an amazing feeling when you are super attracted to someone for the first time after a breakup. You'll have made it! And you'll probably feel so much stronger for the next person than you thought possible. 

You're still very young, and have a lot to experience. What/who you're looking for in life will change so much in the next ten years. Dating is hard, but so important in figuring out exactly who you want and how you want your life to be in the future. You will learn so much from the people you date, and you will definitely look back at your current situation and be able to smile on it. Hang in there :)

Get her some medicinal charcoal for the start, then google what ways there are to cleanse the colon of yeast colonies and what she can take to curb up the bile flow.

* Olive leaf extract
* Probiotics
* Psyllium
* Coconut oil/ Caprylic acid
* Epsom salts
* Oil pulling
* Liver tonics with herbs that stimulate bile flow

and many more.
There are several digestive cleansing products but do google about Yeast overgrowth and sluggish liver.
Chronic stress and birth control messes with the hormones. Stress actually makes the lining of the gut thinner and can shut down digestion totally.

&gt;""Evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts do not go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of gravitation replaced Newton's, but apples did not suspend themselves in mid-air, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.""

"subaru","t5_2rdhg","Subaru is the only car scene I've come across that is full of just nice people. Subie drivers tend to be friendly, level-headed, down to earth, and reasonable. 2012 STi or 92 Legacy? Same respect. It just comes down to the fact that Subaru owners LOVE their cars. When you go to a meet or a show, you're among other people that love their car as much as you love yours, and the equal enthusiasm means its easy to get along, and it strengthens the scene.

The ONLY caveat I have, after being into Subarus for 8-10 years, is that in the last year or so I've noticed an influx of ""bros"" and ""stance"" cars. I think its because WRXs have finally become cheap enough ($6k-ish for a halfway decent bugeye) that its not a big deal to buy one just to screw around with. So, people who don't necessarily share the brand loyalty and just want a piece of the action are coming along and ruining what I think is the most key element of the Subaru lifestyle: functionality. If you drop your Subaru on its nuts and it can't climb an snowy hill or go get dirty in the mud, its no different than any other Honda/VW/etc. I've seen some pretty crazy awesome cars that are stanced and hellaflush or whatever you want to call it. It looks cool, sure, but I don't feel like its a Subaru anymore. Its just a piece of shiny metal that you can't actually drive. Why have a Subaru if you can't do [THIS](http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/405504_631070348094_1412870552_n.jpg) :)

"Scotch","t5_2qq65","Thanks for the review!

This is also my favorite Glenmorangie. 

I was lucky enough to grab a couple bottles last year at a tasting in my local cigar club. 
We tried the 10 (Original), 12 year, 18 Year, Nectar D'or, Lasanta, Quinta Ruban, and the Signet. 


Out of all of them the Quinta Ruban was by far my favorite choice out of all of them, excluding the Signet. 
Considering that the average retail for this one is only ~5-10USD More than the 12 Year it was a no brainier. 


I loved the Signet, but I would rather have 5 bottles of the Quinta Ruban than 1 of the Signet. 


The 10 Year (Original) was lacking IMO, and was a little too bland for my liking. 

The 12 was well balanced and had a nice clean finish to it. 

The 18 had all of the characteristics that I enjoyed about the 12, though it was a good bit more ""Laid Back"" on the flavor, admittedly which if I would have had more time I may have had a better chance to appreciate it.
Out of the Nectar, Lasanta and the Quinta, I obviously preferred the Quinta Ruban. 

I was actually just given a bottle of the Lasanta yesterday and I will get a chance to have some this weekend.

The image of the W+M1 Pyro is annoying to the people who try to put some thought, effort, and strategy into playing the class, but bad Pyros are so common that it is easy to make such an assumption. Ironically, you almost never hear complaints about an W+M1 Heavy even though most of the same criticisms about bad Pyros can be levied against bad Heavies.

I tend to take on a defensive role, and Pyro suits that quite well; reflecting rockets/grenades, extinguishing allies, and removing sappers from the Engie's buildings make the Pyro good at helping make everyone else's job a little easier. And if you know both what you're doing and the class's limitations, you can be quite useful on offence.

My point is that if you can be a credit to your team as any class if you know what you're doing. As much as people complain about some weapons being overpowered, Team Fortress 2 is a pretty well balanced game.

Side note - almost every time someone says that I'm playing Pyro because I lack 'skill' is because they are losing. Hell, this is probably true of all such claims.","1354320782"

A utilitarian argument weighs the suffering of an individual against the benefits to society, or even to that same individual (such as the ability to make a free choice to engage in the pornography industry).

Note that this utilitarian argument does not clearly line up with a position against exploitation.  In the explanation, we begin to mix metaphors.  The argument for the ethical treatment of animals comes down to whether we have any business killing them.  As applied to the pornography industry it would analogously come down to whether we have any business having sex with each other, or talking about it.","1354320786"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Fair enough. In my opinion, if you accept the 1967 borders, you must accept that Israel is occupying and repressing another nation. I also can't accept your repeated claim that Palestinians are free to live where they want in Israel when so many of them were moved from their homes to live in refugee camps and they are to this day being harassed by illegal Jewish settlers in areas that even 1967 Israel accepted were part of Palestine.

I find it hard to accept the self defence argument as about 6 Palestinians have been killed for every Israeli since 2000. There is no equivalence for the hardship caused to Palestinians by the West Bank Barrier and the Gaza blockade. I also find it hard to accept that a nation that has decisively won every war it has been in and is strongly backed by the largest war machine that the world has ever seen is as beleaguered as it claims it is.

I am not condoning or excusing Palestinian attacks on Israel but they pale in comparison to the destruction coming the other direction.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay, so:

The next day, I get to school, and it's a completely normal day, but I'm looking forward to telling the story to my friends at lunch. Lunch period arrives, and I go to my usual table. It's all senior guys, except for one junior, Ben. He's a really good dude, quiet, and usually not at all talkative.

Just as I'm starting my ""So guys, here's what happened to me yesterday"" spiel, up walks Ben. He plops his tray down dramatically, and says, ""You will not *believe* what happened to me yesterday.""  Well Ben's usually as far as you can get from a drama queen, so we all perk up and pay attention. 

""So I'm driving home yesterday. I've got everybody in the car with me, and I hit this absolutely unbelievable patch of black ice. Everybody's screaming, I'm fishtailing all over the place and it took me forever to get the car stopped. And when I finally did, some complete lunatic flies by me at about fifty! He couldn't have missed me by more than an inch!  He must have been insane! Why would anyone do that?""

So of course, *you* all know who the lunatic was. It didn't take me long to figure it out either, since Ben lived in the same direction from school I did. (And had the same kind of gig I did, hauling some younger kids to school every day.)  And of course, I wasn't going anywhere near fifty. Ben might not have been a drama queen, but he clearly wasn't above embellishing a good story.

Everybody starts talking and asking questions. I couldn't figure out what to say, so I kept quiet. After everyone else died down a bit, I finally spoke up.

""Hey Ben. Glad you're okay and everything, but I think I know why he didn't stop. It was probably because he was sliding on the same black ice you did. Also, he was probably wondering what the hell you were doing sitting in the road for that long while he was sliding. What was that about?""

Ben turned several shades of red in succession. It was pretty funny. He finally managed to get under control and explained that in the chaos, he or his passenger had managed to bump the gear shift into neutral, and he was shaken enough that it took some time to figure out why the car wasn't moving when he hit the gas. We teased him for the rest of the semester. I'm pretty sure he got over it, though.","1354320788"

It is a forward thinking Court and at least one or two other states have modeled their corporate laws after Delaware's and, in fact, use our case law as their own.  Chancery does not fool around.

What I didn't like was having to navigate through the menus to get to the effects to change them.

Wound up selling them, and bought a powered pedal board, and a couple of individual stomp boxes. Never been happier. The best thing (to me) about having individual pedals is that if I don't like one, it's easy to replace. Also, it's just a matter of tweaking a few knobs to change the parameters of a pedal, no menu hunting.

The game looked pretty incredible, although everybody's face was very plasticy and inexpressive. Normally not an issue, but it is when you foist 30+ minute cutscenes on the player.

The big problem was the story. I just can't believe how bad the story &amp; writing was. Its not the only game with a godawful story but it is the only game I've played that biases things so heavily towards non-interactive segments of such highly concentrated badness. The pacing was bad, the dialogue was often cheesy, the ending flipped between a brilliant bit of fanservice (snake vs ocelot fight) to one of the most godawful conclusions to a plot I've ever seen (big boss is alive, CQC hug, here's the villain btw, oh he died, oh I die, you should live!).

I'm here to clear up what I see as a misconception. What you are saying is correct for copyright, where copyright can be invalidated by prior art. Regarding 'Test X please ignore', I'm reasonably sure I can dig up some prior art from the 90s, so yes, no copyright claims.

However, trademarks give no fucks to prior art. Take a look at Diablo, Spanish word for devil. I'm sure the Catholic Church can show some prior art for that, and yet, guess what, it's trademarked by Blizzard anyway. Origin does not matter. Usage matters. The fact that there's merchandise that is sold in Test's name matters. This argument that there's prior art does not matter, it's irrelevant.

I would strongly recommend not inviting the courts into something like this, this is something that should be resolved amicably between leaderships, but don't think that it's this cut and dry because you think it is. You are not contributing to the conversation.","1354320827"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","&gt;What are you supposed to do in that kind of situation?

Non-independent cabbies in the city are required to take cards.  The numbers I'm finding say that there are only about 200 independent cabs, of roughly 6,800 total cabs in the city.

If they refuse to let you pay by card, you have the right to call 311 and report them.  If they get threatening, call the police and remove yourself from the situation.

The reason they dislike cards is that they pay a percentage ~~to the credit card company~~(see below) - around five percent.  They're not allowed to put a surcharge on to cover that five percent, so it's money out of their pocket.  Consider tipping higher to cover that, if you pay by card.

EDIT:  So I did a little more reading, and it appears that the five percent surcharge may not be all to the credit card company.  A few articles claim that the credit card company charges the cab companies 1.7%(approximate) and the **cab company** charges the drive five percent.  Either way, the cabbie is out five percent of your fare if you pay by card.  ","1354320829"

Finally- more teachers could be hired, which would lead to smaller class sizes, more individual attention for each student, and therefore, most certainly more results. 

I would also note that it could take a different form, the implementation of the money as grants for secondary education would increase the skill of the workforce, and by extension the quality of individuals entering the military- it would also ease the strain of student debt on the American Public.","1354320840"

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","Yes, that happens. Proceed with caution.

Remember, single women (and lots of women in relationships) have all sorts of guys sending them messages, texts and FB chatter. Much of the time, they are not sure which ones they are ""really"" interested in, i.e., future boyfriend material.

That said, they will have first tier dudes they have the most interest in, either for one off fucking or for potential boyfriends, or even both.

What you SHOULD NOT do, at minimum, is two things: (1) bombard her with messages, especially if she never initiates, (2) send her boring ass texts just to keep you on her radar, e.g., ""Hey, how's your day going?"" (if you are a man with abundance and have 2 fuck buddies messaging, 2 possibilities messaging, and 2 women you simply don't wanna bang just sending ""hey, how's your day"" messages, you know how much a nuisance and non-turn on these latter chicks are. As a guy, try to see it from a woman's experience who has all sorts of dudes messaging her. How are you gonna break through that noise? Not impossible, but easy to fuck up.

So, the ""friendly but not-flirty"" responses should be viewed in the same manner. It doesn't mean that you are for sure, 100%, never gonna get with the babe, but the current odds are not in your favor. And you will make this worse with cloying, meaningless, and supplicating ""hi, how's your day"" messages.

Back off. If she hears from you too often and in a way that does not show you as unique, fun, and a way that spikes her interests/emotions, she will grow bored of your messages and never put you in the ""never gonna fuck"" file.

The thing is, chicks that know you but do not have you on their potential fuck/boyfriend radar will NOT respond with a ""not-exactly-flirty vigor."" A babe that is not interested you will make you feel like you are interacting with your sister. 

A chick that at least is considering you, will either be clearly flirty or toss you a bone that let's you escalate the flirtatious vibe. They will use innuendos, double meanings, and sarcastically prod to draw out your ability to banter back and do it well, if they are marginally interested. 

This is not just single women, either. I've had a woman in a committed relationship with a friend text me out of the blue at totally laid in my lap very flirty (and uncomfortable) opening, one clearly suggestive but in a way that left her deniability. I responded in kind and after a few texts back and forth, she had really made it clear with continuous double meanings, teasing, sarcasm, etc., that her intent was always flirty, sexual. I didn't follow up with an attempt to seduce because fucking in your social circle with taken chicks in a terrible, terrible idea. My point is that interested women will open the flirting door a bit and if you know how to recognize and take them up on their gambit, you can move the interaction along to more sexual levels, and this is what they want you to do.

The key to distinguishing between friendly and flirty is that friendly almost never leaves double meanings, sexual innuendos, teasing, etc. on the conversational table to be misinterpreted if things in the come on go south. A normal friend of the opposite sex will not give you an opening that can be interpreted innocuously (for their deniability) or sexually (in case it works out a hoped). A woman who has you on her sexual radar will. 

But, keep in mind, this usually happens in the first few communications. If you have been texting/emailing back-and-forth with mundane shit for a while, well, you've blown it and her friendliness is not an impending gina tingle. Women will give you a chance to escalate the flirt, but if you don't then over time they slot you in the harmless, asexual category and now you are just like another one of her online girlfriends.

Granted I've never really bought any DLC yet, just because I'm usually done with a game by the time its DLC comes out.

"WritersGroup","t5_2rh95","A lot of beginning writers seem to have a process that goes something like this:

* Psych yourself up, do exercises, stretches, procrastinate a bit.
* Slam down some serious lines!
* Find yourself exhausted, abandon hope, submit/publish/hand-in anyway.

Writing is a process, not an event. It's like making pottery or a painting. You don't just bang it out, you chip away at it, you refine it, you keep building up in layers, or whatever.

In general terms you'll have to both add and subtract from your writing to get it into the right shape. Let it sit to ferment a little, then go back later and see if you can't buff out the problems and clear up the rough spots. If you do this a half dozen times you'll probably see it end up considerably better than the first cut.

Remember the point of learning to write is not to simply be ""done"", but to go through the complete process, from conception to *final* draft, so that you internalize the steps and it becomes more natural.

I'm in Phoenix  so it's always pretty warm and there are lots of homeless around.  Well I was at a gas station, get the typical story and the guy pointed to his car saying he needed just a few bucks to get him on his way.  So I told him, no problem hold on. I went inside and told them to put $10 on my pump, paid in cash of course not credit.  Went back out and told the man to pull his car up behind me since I was done filling up, because I put $10 on the pump for him.

he ended up just walking away in a different direction without saying anything... 

I'm not a sucker for these things normally, but when he pointed to ""his"" car I truely thought he just needed a couple gallons to get him on his way.  Normally I actually get asked for gas money at walmart parking lots so this was the first time it's happened at an actual gas station.  Needless to say, I probably made the persons day who ever got that pump after me.  Then again $10 at a gas station today is nothing..  ","1354320852"

Acting like nothing advanced during them was revisionism caused by protestants burning old records to try to discredit Catholics. Especially since during that time, monasteries were pretty much the only places actually trying to restore old knowledge, instead of let it get destroyed.

Here's the thing about the church though. It doesn't make the claim that the body composed of the people are infallible. Only that they have apostolic succession that they can pass on. Ensuring they do not do evil is the same job that humans have for any other group. Many people will, and it is the duty of everyone involved to try to stop it.","1354320859"

The problem lies that even with a smaller amount they should want to spread their influence. The FSA isn't a single body, its made up of different organizations. The biggest problem is once Assad is finally ousted out of power (unless a super power steps in and defends Syria it is highly likely going to happen), the left over terrorist cells (for arguments sake let's just say 10% of FSA have terrorist links) will be adding to the chaos unless their extreme politics are incorporated into the new governing body.

It cheapens the experience. Back before the days of the RMAH, if I found a truly phenomenal item in a game, I could feel a sense of pride and accomplishment, because I *earned* that item myself. Now, even if I find an item myself, I don't feel that anymore, because I could have just pulled some cash out of my wallet and instantly bought the same item that would have once took me a lot of time and effort to find.

One of the many reasons I am a gamer is that I enjoy experiencing self-contained fantasy worlds, where I can leave all my real world troubles at the door. Now that real world money has wormed its way into my fantasy worlds, I can't leave that worry at the door anymore. I can't play games to forget about how shit poor I am in the real world, because I log on and I see people with real world money instantly buying items a hundred times better than all the items I spent *hours upon hours* grinding for. And that just reminds me of how the same people are buying luxury items in the real world that I will never be able to afford in my life. Instead of escaping the reality of my shitty economic status, I have it rubbed in my face, in the one place I thought that would never happen. It's just disgusting to me.","1354320862"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","It's not reinforcement. It's preparation. People talk a lot of shit in dota. Saying ""you suck"" is probably the least tame of the critiques that pubs give, in my opinion. The learning curve for this game (read: the sheer cliff face that must be scaled to **really learn** dota) is insane, and you must approach this game with the knowledge that you will be **terrible** in your first few games. Hell, first few dozen games. 

In my opinion, purge's title of his guide is a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the community. Personally, I found it humorous, once I realized the context.

Edit: If saying ""you suck"" is unnecessarily hostile, imagine what your friends would find if they just got the basics of the game and fired up MM. Honestly, purge is trying to do everyone a favor by starting off this way. Thick skin is almost as important as an understanding of basic mechanics in this community, in my opinion.

I also recommend you avoid instants and sorceries that deal damage, unless they are really big they are usually not worth it.

More than a North Korea style ""press"", I fear an American one.  In America knowingly publishing lies with the intent of deceiving people is Free Speech, that was the actual wording of the Supreme court judgement on the matter.  IMHO, people here are better informed here than people in the US.  Our *less free* press is a *better* press in this case.

We won't ever get a perfect system, there is no right answer, only a less wrong one.  That is what we are going to get here.  Less wrong; hopefully.

I guess maybe I should oppose Freedom of Speech/Press and instead demand ""Freedom of Truth"" or ""Freedom of Good Discourse"" or something.  That is what we really need.  And to get it sometimes we need freedom of the press, sometimes we need restriction of the press.  And we need rules to decide when, we can't go case by case because case by case is more open to corruption than rules, even though rules can never get every case right.

So we end up with imperfect rules working imperfectly and rules that people on all sides actively work to under cut and no one is happy about...

I'm glad you like your vehicle and that's what it's about. I also had some body work done at a Toyota house. I was trying to support them. They charged full price and when they were done the trunk was slightly off. When I was driving Toyota, it seemed like every mechanic was a player wanting to do it on the quick for money. The MB merchanics are all brains and heart, serious. It's a whole different deal on the type of people who work on them. The real ones do it for love and are into it. One guy redid the hoses on the top of my engine with the hard to find correct hose material and went to the dealership and replaced some plastic housing breather parts with new factory and didn't charge me much above the core service I was having done.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I used MS as an example of a genetic trait that would be carried down. It doesn't have to be a specific gene, but the meer presence of a mutation will eventually lead to retardation, genetic degradation and infertility in inbreeding due to the compounding effect.

You do understand that having a recessive gene for an illness is different from a mutation, right?  Once you have an isolated population, you have some stability in terms of the presence of genetic traits, and mutations happen so slowly that if Adam and Eve and all of their offspring are reproducing like rabbits they could get a fairly large population quickly.

&gt;DNA is shown to mutate through generations. There is no perfect genome, which is demonstrated in the current structure of DNA. Satellite DNA shows how large segments of DNA exist for padding or non-genetic purposes or maybe no reason. They are highly mutative areas and can show clear lineage in species separated by geography.

Right, but this doesn't contradict the plausibility of the biblical story.  Again, I'm not saying it's a true story, but claiming that it is genetically impossible is not true either.  The presence of mutations in later generations would actually support a creationist's argument because they would say that current genetic diversity is a result of it.","1354320886"

Whats with toilet doors without a fucking lock. Seriously, have these places ever heard of a handy man to fix these fucking things?

Now if you're talking on a more philosphical level we could go into the various ways in which classifying the Jews as wealthy buys into the general belief that the jews act as a cohesive group, or that in fact any idea of generalization of an ethnic group is a veiled form of racism that really only serves to further divide the homogeneous melting pot that is the United states but I think that's delving just a bit too deep into things yea?","1354320896"

Since you get rid of any rolls below 12 anyway, it's fairly easy to tell how close you are to all 15s. For example, 12 14 16 17 15 13 obviously doesn't get there, and it doesn't take very long to see that without subtracting any stats.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Wow, what a great post!  A lot of people I know have influenced my writing.  First would be David Shields, he was a professor of mine who's also written some best selling books.  He totally changed my view of what writing can be.  David stopped writing novels claiming them to be antiquated, instead he experiments with writing and released a book called Reality Hunger: A Manifesto which is entirely a remix of other people's writing (he's since written more books, but I haven't read them).

In an entirely different direction, I was inspired by my dad when I was young.  He's not a writer, hardly even a reader, but he would read my awful short stories.  The cool thing was, he would tell me what he thought.  If I wrote about something I didn't understand, he would encourage me to learn more about it and rewrite.  This really affected me as a writer.

Finally, I have a cousin who is an aspiring writer, but that's not how he influenced me.  We are both have very sarcastic senses of humor, and when we get together it gets a little out of control.  For the book I'm currently writing, the two main characters are based off of myself and my cousin, and the humor carries in the dialog.  It's been fun hearing people laugh at the open mic nights I've brought it to.

Once again, great thread.  This brings back memories...","1354320898"

On the long weekend (Remembrance Day) I had to give her am IV and try to get food in her, but Sunday morning I found her lifeless and cold.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It isn't clear how you're defining belief, nor is it clear what your criticism is.  You said this in a previous post:

&gt;That's irrelevant. Evolution still does not require, nor does it have any real relationship with ""belief"". Just substitute Evolution with Gravity, to get a sense for how silly it is. Imagine you had an option to believe or disbelieve gravity. That's utter nonsense, regardless of what you mean by belief. Gravity just is. Same with Evolution.

What is nonsense about saying ""I believe in gravity?""

All you're saying is that, ""I have a mental state that contains: *'It is true that physical bodies have a propensity to attract one another.'*""

The *simplest* breakdown of ""I believe X,"" in the terms of a scientific fact, is ""I think it's true that X occurs.""

That has problems in more complicated ways, but that makes the point just fine.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I could talk a LOT about that.  The short answer is this:

I always loved Stu Phillips' music for the original BSG.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that the reason the original show lasted in people's memories for three decades is, in part, because of the quality of his writing.  It was the gold-standard of TV sci fi scoring for a long time.

When the new show came out, we were obviously going a different direction.  While I was excited to have the chance to explore something new and different, it always bummed me out thinking that Stu may feel left out.  After all, the new show borrowed the look, the story, the same character names, etc. But, not the music.

So, in Season 2, there was a chance to introduce the 'National Anthem' of the Colonies.  It was written in the script that it should be the old 'BSG' Theme.  However, I wanted to re-arrange the theme and make it our own.

So, I reached out to Stu and went over to his place.  We sat down and looked at scores, parts, listened to cues.  He gave me all these materials so I could get the theme right.  Make it perfect and really reflect his intentions with my new version.

When I sent him the mp3 of my finished 'Colonial Anthem'... I've never been more nervous.  But, he loved it.  And he and I became very close friends.  I found other places to incorporate his themes into the new 'BSG' as well.  ","1354320905"

What I don't get is that if it doesn't feel as bad, shouldnt I be able to leg press 150 kiloes? Last week 100 kg made my calf feel funny, the tendon became a bit sore, but i didnt get hurt.

"LearnUselessTalents","t5_2u8qf","Cross-eyed will actually work in this case, unlike Magic Eye pictures, because you don't care about the direction of the effect, you just will be looking for spots that don't match.

Usually the tricky part there is focusing on a tight cross. This took me some time. It's easier once you can get the convergence (or divergence, as it were) right.

Magic Eyes are usually done so that you must do the *opposite* of crossing your eyes. ""Uncrossing your eyes"" is the best description I know of, sometimes it's known as ""parallel eyes"". Fundamentally, it's the same as if you were looking *through* the picture, except your eyes focus closer than where you would be looking.

One very important thing is that you have to be exactly aligned with the picture. If the picture is at an angle to your vision, you won't get anywhere. Early Magic Eye pictures had dots at the top to help align the picture -- when the dots come together, you're there. This is true for this trick too.

Edit: Actually, I just did the trick in the pic in OP's post doing it cross-eyed, and I'd almost say the differences are *clearer* that way. But it was very hard to get the amount of eye-crossing just right; my eyes insisted on crossing too far (like I was trying to look at my nose) and I had to ease them ""out"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This may not make sense for those not involved in the sport, but I'll do my best to explain why it was badass. 

I'm in roller derby. I'd been playing for a few months when I decided I wanted to be a jammer (the player who fights through the pack to score the points.) I pushed myself very hard for a month of intensive training to get me ready for the first game where I would make my debut as a first string jammer. I was terrified. 

The game came around, and I jammed about three or four times in the first half. I was making points, people couldn't knock me down because I was used to being a solid blocker. 

Then, they chose me as the last jammer of the game. We were up by 20 points, there were two minutes left on the clock. My job was to keep the other jammer from scoring and run out the time. I get up on my toestops and get ready to run when they release us. I'm pumped. I already have a gameplan that involves running as fast as I can, taking out the other jammer, and reversing directions so she has to come in behind me. 

I take my first step when the whistle is blown and... my toestop breaks. It didn't just fall off, it shredded the threading and I fell right on my face. I got up, having never experienced something like that, argued with my team on the sidelines, argued with a ref, then threw the toestop to one of my teammates and ran for the pack. 

I was able to take out the other jammer, get through the pack, and get lead jammer (the one who is able to call off the jam.) I immediately called it off so another jammer without a broken skate could get out there and finish the game.

Also the quote is ""Me love you long time."" She obviously uses the quote in the movie because her English is sub-par; it's a relatively common asian stereotype. Most references of this are used in a derogatory manner towards different asian cultures (Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Etc.)

The point is that you are holding Shun-16 to a double-standard of words and phrases that have to do with stereotypes and races, by using one yourself to express your opinion.

As a side note, I'm just explaining this to you and don't really care either way (and assume most people don't either, because, we don't know you.)

Highlander is where there is a class limit, one of each class, it's basically a 9vs9. Demo and Medic are highest priority in highlander.


Then a 6v6 is a match with no class limit, except there can only be one demo and medic (because they drastically change the game dynamic). Teams are usually demo, medic, 2sollys, scout, and random.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","A digital camera stores pictures as a lot of small colored dots. Each of the dots has a value for red, green and blue. Lots of dots make up a picture. A pixel is simply a colored dot. Nothing more. So it's not illogical to state that as a part of quality of a camera (the more dots it can save, the less grainy the picture turns out). But it's not the only important thing.

So then, why is it used as a synonym for the picture quality? Because it's an easy number. People don't know shit about cameras. If you tell them that it has a fast max shutter speed, or a wide color gamut or something like that, they don't have anything to reference it to. So instead they decided to go for pixels, since that's a word some people have heard before (you also use it, but to a lesser extent, to describe the quality of computer and tv screens. HD means lots of pixels). Once they decided this pumping out the highest possible amount of pixels became the goal.

The human eye doesn't store pictures in the same way. So we can't really compare it. We could simply look at the number of rods and cones you have (the parts of the eye that absorb color and light), but it wouldn't really mean anything. The eye have 120 million rods, but they can only see light. So no color at all. They are allows you to see out of the corner of your eye. Then you have between 6 and 7 millions of cones. Those are all concentrated in the middle of the eye, allowing you to see details right where you are focusing. 

For comparison a standard camera can have about 5 megapixels, which is about 5 million pixels (or exactly 5 millions. I'm not sure if they use the computer mega or not). High end cameras can of course have more than this, but it won't give you the detail you get from your eye, since they are spread out equally.  ","1354320931"

"Palestine","t5_2qhak","It's really not my fault you don't know how these concepts are applied to the real world.  What you are really saying is that your understanding of the events in Gaza at that time reminds you of your interpretation of the definition of a coup.  This does not mean that the concept of ""coup"" is properly applied here.

Traditionally political scientists reserve the term to describe on of Samuel P Huntington's types of actions: the Guardian coup, the Veto coup, and the Breakthrough Coup.

Classic examples of current administrations which are the result of a coup are Oman, Equatorial Guinea, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Chad, The Gambia, Qatar, The Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Fiji, Mauritania, Madagascar, Mali, and Guinea-Bissau.

You might be more coherent if you tried to talk about the sort of Gaza vs Fatah era as more of a secession, or something like that.  A lot of the emphasis on coup is not just the seizing of one city or something, but a disposition of the current leader entirely.  This is why most people in the field resist calling these events a coup.  If you did a bit of background work, you'd know this.

Not that it's likely that your interested in learning about these issues and applying the concepts more accurately...","1354320932"

With Pan-Am 2015 approaching this will make it a lot easier to find the Argos a new home, epically an outdoor stadium. But that's going to be in 2015 so there is some time for that.

When I was about 19-20 I was out drinking at the pub at lunch time, I had maybe three or four scotches and was a little tipsy having not eaten. I went outside to get some fresh air and have a smoke, I was standing behind a concrete lip on the building and you couldn't see me from the sidewalk.

I heard an old lady scream and footsteps running towards me, without thinking I swung my arm out about head height and coat hangered a purse snatcher. He tried to get up and run but I dove on top of him, it was at this point I realized I just coat hangered a guy who was two years above me in school who used to pick on me. 

Being slightly tipsy and suddenly extremely angry at a few years of abuse and already in a fight with him I decided to give it my all and got back on my feet. He got back up and at this point security had been told what was happening and rushed out to stop him. By the time they got there he was out cold, turns out he wasn't a very good fighter and I should of decked him in high school. 

Police were called, the old lady told them what had happened and I was basically let off the hook on the spot, turns out there were no cameras and no evidence that I was even there at the time of the altercation. Turns out he was a serial bag snatcher and I helped police finally catch him, also the old lady brought me lunch and a few more drinks for saving her from the jerkoff. ","1354320938"

It's only when the second or third generation has grown up in the US that Europeans are white washed.

&gt;They are overly cautious and afraid of progress so they want to squeeze things in to outdated power structures (anti-open internet, anti-UN, anti-collective business).

That is an interesting perspective, but I see it differently.  The power structures as they have been are good enough to get us to this point.  So, first and for most, if it isn't broke...  don't fix it.  Second, if you want to alter something that has worked well enough, it seems reasonable to take your time and make sure you get it right with anything that is a critical part of your life like the air you breath.  The scientific method works very well for this.  Run the numbers on the proposed change to see if on paper the change is good.  Then run some simulations.  Include others to look for errors in your work.  Run a few test cases.  If that looks good have others duplicate.  If that works well and the appropriate community has evaluated and agrees with the results as well as has duplicated them, roll out the change to a test population and evaluate for years...  Then you can roll out the proposed change (to the atmosphere for example).  

Let's talk anti-internet.  People meeting the definition of conservative are slow to change and adopt new things, but that is not necessarily because they are anti-anything.  It may not be needed.  If you have several other means of communication that work well for example why would you need want to waste money and time to do something you can already do in a new way or waste the same resources to be able to do something you don't want to do?  So, telephone and snail mail may meet the needs of those who have no interest in email/skype/internet/computers.  They may be frustrated with having to learn to operate the new device and programs.  This is not anti-anything.  At worst this is just being unmotivated.

&gt;They fear change...

We all fear change.  Change especially changing to the unknown is the root fear we all have.

&gt;they refuse to embrace or support new technologies or ideas

Just because a technology or idea is new, does not make it good.  At one point slavery was new idea for example...  I challenge you to find an example of a new technology that is good and [necessary](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/necessary) which conservatives in mass do not accept.

&gt;...they seek protection from that change from those they see as powerful today (big oil, big tobacco, big coal, major corporations

LOL.  I guess this statement is the left's version of bat shit crazy.  First you confuse the GOP being bought off with people wanting help and protection.  Second, you suggest people who want protection from lung cancer are seeking it from big tobacco or protection from AGW from oil and coal manufactures...  You may want to rethink this one.  Maybe you had a different idea and it didn't come out right.

Finally, to illustrate the difference between conservative and Conservative/GOP let's take the examples of Obama's tax plan and Romney's tax plan.  A simplification is Obama wants to let the Bush tax cuts expire for the wealthy.  This is a change of 4-5% for 1% of the US.  Romney wanted to lower income tax rates by 20% for 100% of the US.  Obviously a change of 20% is far larger than 4-5% and weighing in the percent of population affected only increases the difference in change dramatically.  So, Obama's tax plan was a much smaller change than Romney's and thus more conservative.  In fact, I would call Romney's tax plan radical.  Of course that is ignoring the evidence that tax revenue is too low and Romney's plan didn't add up (or exist).

In conclusion, I think you are way off the mark and look forward to you providing evidence to support your claims.","1354320941"

You have these populations, call them races or not, that doesn't matter, there is genetic variation.  This variation clusters into semi discrete populations.  And self-identified race within the U.S., at least, corresponds almost perfectly with genetic ancestry.  

Luigi Cavalli-Sforza says ""race"" doesn't exist, but then goes on to talk about the various human ""populations"", which just so happen to correspond with the classical racial categories.  Whatever.  You don't like to use the word ""race"", fine, let's not use the word race.  So these ""populations"" are different.  They're different in many ways.  

They're different in skin color, hair texture and hair color, susceptibility and immunities to certain diseases and conditions, differences in bone structure, differences in muscle mass and distribution, fat mass and distribution, and differences in cranial capacity.  

So despite all of these differences, including differences in average cranial capacity, we are to presume cognitive equality between the population averages of these semi discrete populations, even though we recognize profound innate differences between individuals.  

Now, you don't have to think bigger brains are, all else being equal, better than smaller brain.  Perhaps it is Africans who have innately the smartest brains because they have more tightly-packed neurons.  All I am saying is that the presumption that they're all equal, that all of these groups are equal, would be a cosmic fluke, an impossible joke of a coincidence.  

Nature doesn't do equal.

Going back to the boat thing, that is definitely one way to view it. Another way to view it is that women and children are more important to the survival of the species so they must be protected first. I'm not saying this is the correct view, but it is definitely another valid view that I think has a backing in biology even.

I saw a study that found interests do have a link in biology. The more testosterone a person has, the more interested they are in things and how things work. It was pretty interesting. I'm skeptical when people say women are discouraged in those fields actively. Being portrayed in the media is one subtle way of doing it and I can agree with that, but I'm still not 100% convinced.

I do believe certain types of privilege exist. But I also believe there is female privilege as well. Even if women only have 1 privilege over men, it is still a privilege none the less.","1354320946"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Grief can make people a little crazy and it can ruin a lot of great relationships. Try to remember that as important as the financial things are, they're secondary to your relationships. Try to open up discussion about these things if you feel it's torn you apart from each other. Remember it might take more than one conversation to clear the air. And try to empathize with each other. Everyone's in pain right now.

For some, grief comes out in control, misplaced anger, or isolation. Try to recognize this in yourself and your family members and not take things too personally.

It's really common for a family to drift for a while after a death of a parent, no matter how old everyone is. Keep reaching out, take care of yourself, and keep in mind these are somewhat normal reactions to a huge loss. Everyone's trying to figure out how they connect to each other when a central figure is gone.","1354320952"

I had a friend in college who specifically said, ""I want to work on something that is related to Audio or DSB"". They brought him in for an interview on a completely unrelated team in Office and he poorly on the interview and was not given an offer.

"FortWorth","t5_2rsbl","I slightly disagree. I'm sure that these methods turn a larger profit but, on top of that, they probably find these methods much easier to pull off considering they don't have to come at any given situation honestly. I was told a story by a friends grandparents who contacted a home appliance repair ""company"", which they later found out was being run by one of the gypsies who simply posted a small ad with his cell phone number. Their dishwasher had been slightly acting up and they thought it could require some maintenance. After this ""handyman"" came and diagnosed the problem, he got to work and charged them an extremely large amount for his services. He assured them everything he had done was necessary and that his work was guaranteed blah blah blah.

Of course, none of this was true. The problems started back up almost immediately. Upon further inspection of the dishwasher, they found out he had done absolutely nothing that could resolve the problem long term, and had replaced none of the parts that he charged them for. By the time they found out and attempted to contact him, the number was no longer good.

When I hear stories like this, it makes sense to me how they could turn a more significant, and more stable profit simply by lying, cheating, and stealing. I absolutely do not agree with their methods, but they do this because it pays well, and they have no moral qualms with these practices.

As far as Weatherford goes, I couldn't stand it there. I can see how it could make a nice area to live in once you're preparing to retire, but it just wasn't for me. My entire life was spent in Fort Worth and its surrounding areas, so moving to Weatherford was very difficult for me (even if it is just 20 minutes down the hwy).

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","&gt; While they may appear calm and genuine when 'clean' thy can often behave much differently when high or coming off a high. 


An actively using real drug addict will actually only appear calm and genuine when under the influence. Drug addicts will ration drugs so they can be high enough to not get sick; this is when they appear to be relatively clean and normal. No drugs = dope sick, which is like watching an exorcism. Lots of drugs at once = super wasted, which is also like watching an exorcism.

&gt; What you don't witness is the results of your 'charity'. Many homeless people are drug addicts, and use money and cigarettes to obtain drugs.

And let them. Give money or don't, but I personally don't entirely frown upon their desires, wants or needs to get high. I have a home, a job, sanity, a car, family and friends... and sometimes I need a buzz. I can't really judge someone who is homeless, jobless, car-less and possibly mentally ill who has presumably burned many social bridges (or not had them to begin with) to wind up on the street for wanting to enjoy some form of escapism and get high.

You don't have to give homeless people anything, but if you do, it's a gift and it's none of your business what they do with the money after that. Will they buy drugs? Probably. So would I if that were my life.

Doesn't matter what kind it is, if you buy a good car and take good care of it, for a bit more money than say a honda/ford/chevy/econobox, it will last you a long time, not cost you as much in the long run, and you still get the joy and satisfaction of having a fun car that's great to drive.  

My BMWs were investments.  My father bought one brand new in '92, and it's still going beautifully.  Treat it like a utensile, and it will suck the money out of you.  Treat it well and it will be a car to give to your kids when they get old enough.  That is an investment.","1354320963"

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","My son is 6.5months and has been in 12 month clothes for about a month. When he was 3 months in 6/9 month clothes I started to just buy pants and shirts, no onesies or one piece outfits and def no pjs with feet. This has helped make clothes last longer. He has some 9 month footed pjs he fits into but the legs are less pants and more shorts. I just make sure he has socks on to keep those toes warm. 
I haven't invested much into his 12 clothes because I don't think he had his 6 month growth spurt yet. I've bought more 18 month clothes. My kid is long but lean, 29.5 in and 20lbs and also wears cloth diapers. I can easily put him in 18 month old shirts, they are just a lil big so I'll roll up the sleeves. Pants are a lil trickier. He's long, so he can wear some 18 month pants with a roll of the legs, but the waist can sometimes be too big even with a cloth diaper.
My friends kid is 6months weighs more than my son but isn't as long and so mama keeps him in 9/12mon vs my 12/18mon. I think she doesn't like the baggy/big look. I don't mind it. 
For girls, I know someone who puts her baby in larger sized shirts to make them look like dresses and she wears them over leggings. That way the ""dress"" finally gets grown into and baby wears it like the shirt it was meant to be. Kinda smart.

I tried again for another position - one where they actually were looking for someone with my skill set. Getting the job ment they'd actually send to classes and train up and build new skills for a new position. Got a phone interview, did well, but apparently not perfect. Got rejected.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Fruits &amp; Veggies: 
Learn what is in season, and shop that as it will be cheaper. Learn also how to select fruit, because there's nothing worse than buying fruit that goes bad too quickly to eat, or never ripens and you wind up tossing it away. 

Check prices carefully as you walk through the produce section: very often, the most expensive apples (for example) are in the first or most prominent aisle. Walk around and compare prices and you will surely find cheaper in a middle aisle. This goes for bananas too; I often find widely varying prices on bananas that look exactly the same! 

Stay away from prepared fruits and veggies. You pay for the convenience. 

Also be sure to compare the price of fresh versus frozen. For example, berries are often far cheaper in the frozen aisle, sometimes even when in season -- and they keep a lot longer. If you see a good sale on frozen fruits or veggies, stock up. And it goes without saying that generic and store brands are usually cheaper. 

Dried fruits can seem pricey but be a good deal, especially if you find you waste a lot of fresh fruits. Dried fruits have long shelf life. A little dried fruit goes a long way, and it is packed with iron. You can also often find sales on name-brand dried fruits. 

If you have a Trader Joe's I highly recommend them for dried fruits, nuts, and frozen veggies. Good deals! 

Breads &amp; Grains: 

I include potatoes in this category and yes they are a great deal, especially if you eat the skins (good for you nutritionally and packed with fiber). Potatoes can make a good quick and easy microwave meal: top with canned beans and salsa, or cottage cheese and broccoli. 

Keep your bread products in the refrigerator as they will last longer this way. If the bread gets a little stale, toast it, or  make french toast. 

Others have already pointed out that you can buy enormous bags of rice at the Asian supermarket. It tastes a lot better too. Likewise, buy oatmeal by the bulk instead of the microwave packets. 

Cereals are quick and easy: but wait and buy on sale. 

Pasta can be a great deal too --- but again, wait for sales and stock up! 

Canned goods:
Excellent values include canned tomatoes (make your own spaghetti sauce in bulk and freeze it), canned beans (for soups), and canned refried beans (work great for a quick homemade burrito). Again, wait for sales and stock up. 

Eggs: 
Are one of the best values, but I see you don't really like them. 

Meats:
You've already gotten great advice. I'll just add to SHOP SALES. When you find a good sale, stock up, bring it home, break it up into meal sized portions, and freeze. 

Dairy:
Shred your own cheese. The store brand block cheddar is actually pretty tasty. Cheese is a good source of protein, and calcium too. Buy  plain yogurt in a giant tub and mix in frozen berries -- it's cheaper and better for you. Check prices on milk. 

Fats:
Do buy some walnuts in bulk. Excellent snack and good for you. And peanut butter is a great value too. Also buy a bottle of olive oil -- check prices, wait for sale. You can use this to make your own salad dressing (the bottled stuff is expensive and not as good for you). Flax seed is also great way to add healthy fats and fiber to your diet. Buy it by the bag and grind it fresh each day. 

A lot of items I've recommended are not all that cheap to buy and may blow your budget goal for the week, but they will last a long time, and are worth the bang for your buck, nutritionally. You may have to spend more to stock your pantry, or to take advantage of sales when they come around, but overall it evens out. 

Keep an eye on waste in particular. It can be easy to waste food when you are shopping and cooking for one. 

Hope that helps!

Change ""theme park"" to ""sandbox"" and you buy yourself a lot of wiggle room. Focus on PvP over PvE and you buy yourself even more.

Eventually, more companies will realize that empowering at least some of their players to meaningfully affect the game world is the only currently-available means by which to potentially generate enough ""new content"" to satiate their entire player base. This realization will hopefully spur them to think about radically heterogenous gaming experiences amongst their player base, and how that might allow a ""powerful"" player to play a very different game that somehow creates content for a large number of ""less powerful"" players, or at least some changes to which they will need to react.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I don't disagree with anything you said.  The one thing I will say is that it seems very likely that a larger brain would have a larger connection of all the various cell types involved in any brain.  It is true that across Orders in the animal kingdom a heavier brain does not equate to more neurons.  For instance a rodent style brain with the same number of neurons as a human, ~86 billion, would weigh around 35kg.  However within an order it is fairly reliable to say that a heavier brain has more neurons.  Which brings us back to the chimpanzee argument, a human brain is roughly 3 times the size of a chimpanzee's.  Since the human brain is that much larger it also has roughly 3 times more neurons.  Since humans are in the same species, much less the same order, it follows that a larger human brain has more neurons.  
[Here](http://www.frontiersin.org/human_neuroscience/10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009/full) is a study from 2009 that addresses variability in brain size from an inter-species perspective.  Specifically what I'm talking about is in the section on scaling of neuronal numbers.","1354320978"

"Republican","t5_2qndt","While agree with the general sentiment, and I believe Americans are resilient enough to bounce back from whatever ruin Obama achieves, I think we need to understand who is voting for them - because it's not as simple as 'poor and uneducated'.  

Let's use [this](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2012-exit-poll?intcmp=related_) exit poll.

**Race**

* White (72%): Romney +20

* Black (13%): Obama +87

* Latino (10%): Obama +45

* Asian (3%): Obama +47

* Other (2%): Obama +20

Overwhelmingly, Obama won minorities. Those groups are getting larger as well.  Blacks are starting to vote in greater numbers and so are Latinos.  If we want to win a future Presidential election *these* numbers will have to improve - no way around it.



**Education:**

* No HS Diploma (3%): +29 Obama

* HS -&gt; College (79%) : Even

* Postgraduate Study (18%): +13 Obama


So he does indeed win over those without a high school diploma - however, this is only 3% of the voters and is heavily skewed with Latino and blacks...I think you would agree that the more educated you are, the more likely you are to have voted for Obama.  This doesn't mean you are wrong - it just means, he won so many latino's and blacks nothing else really mattered.


**Income**

* &lt; 30k (20%): Obama +18

* 30k - 50k (21%) : Obama +15

* 50k -100k (31%): Romney +6

* 100k - 200k (21%): Romney +10

* 200k - 250k (3%): Romney +5

* \&gt;250k (4%): Romney +13


For income, you see similar same numbers, but flatter (and Romney wins the 250k+ group handily).  Once you correct for race, again, you will agree (I think) that income had no real bearing on who people voted for.  It was race, again, that determined who won.

So while you are right, Obama still attracted enough upper income voters and more educated voters to dismiss a plan to achieve victory through education and prosperity alone.  We need to attract minorities.  Plain and simple.

&gt;Also don't dissect my posts. Dont be so lazy, come up with a proper reasoned reply as a whole.

Right.

How about this, the stories that we pull from the bible have become culturally important and cease, broadly to have any real religious connotations.  The Biblical Christmas story is seen in the same way as Santa, the Easter story seems to have similar weight as the Easter bunny... They have become, regardless of what religious groups might want to think, cultural aspects that have value in a cultural context.  Of course we could replace them, but why? What is the benefit and where is the harm in retaining the stories that are currently there and letting them slip aside?

In short, the UK has seen a long and fairly gentle decline in terms of Religiosity, religion, or at least expressed or devout religion are seen as things that are a tad odd, not as thins that are normal or to be emulated. We have achieved that not by consciously side-lining religion, but by letting it sideline itself.  Essentially I don't see what benefit there could be to taking the direction you propose and I do see a harm in breaking down too rapidly some of the cultural glue that still barely exists to pull together something of an identity for the country.","1354320980"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","If I'm reading you correctly, the real problem here is that you're consuming more than you know you should and the weed smoking is simply a mechanism that allows you to continue this habit without feeling guilty. The fact that you've acknowledged this is a good sign.

A lot of people pack on extra pounds during college and weed related munchies definitely don't help. I used to get blazed, eat a whole box of Velveeta mac &amp; cheese (over 2,000 calories right there), and wash it down with a beer without giving it a second thought so I can definitely relate to your situation. By the time I realized that I needed to make a change, I was probably a good 30 pounds overweight. 

I adopted a few strategies to combat this problem. One thing I did was start eating 5 or 6 small meals a day instead of 2 or 3 large ones. It doesn't work for everybody, but it helped me out mostly by getting me accustomed to eating small portions. More importantly, I also began paying much closer attention to my total daily calorie intake. If for instance you average 2,500 calories per day right now, cut that down to 1,800. So long as you keep that in mind, what you eat doesn't actually matter all that much (although healthier food certainly doesn't hurt). I'll admit this requires discipline, but it gets easier the longer you stick with it. If you really want to do something about your situation, you should be able to summon up the willpower to get it done.

I also began exercising regularly. That was a big a one for me. I was never a very physically active person up until a few years ago. You don't have to throw yourself into a hardcore cardio and strength training program or anything. What I started off with was simple daily walks. I worked my way up from 20 minute walks to 30 minute walks, eventually up to 90 minute long walks. People are meant to move around regularly and it's an easy routine to get into if you set aside time for it. It doesn't sound like much, but just doing this by itself for a few months helped my body image a lot and made my weight much more stable.

Eventually I bought some adjustable dumbbells and started doing strength training exercises three times a week along with my regular walks. The cool thing about incorporating all of this activity into my life was that I could now get away with eating a bunch and scaling up my daily calorie intake a bit because my metabolism was faster and I needed the extra calories and protein to build muscle. I still smoke weed and I still get the munchies, but it's now mitigated by the larger lifestyle adjustments that I've made. I'm actually in the best shape of my life now. 

I would encourage you to take a look at [r/fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/), read the faq, and lurk around a bit. There are some good resources there. Another site I found helpful was [Nerd Fitness](http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/). The guy who runs that site has an interesting approach to fitness that a couch potato and avid gamer like me found pretty appealing. Also, [r/progresspics](http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics) is great to look at if you need some inspiration.

Hope that helps and good luck to you.","1354320982"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; The fundamental problem with DRM for media is that all the tools to unlock the content must be available to the end user. Securing the content and using the content are completely at odds with eachother.

This assumes that the point of DRM is to completely secure the content.  It isn't.  The point of DRM is to add a layer of annoyance that an average customer will tolerate, but that will also be too difficult to overcome for the average customer to copy everything for his buddies.

The only really difficult part in getting DRM to work effectively enough for media companies is the massive, freely available, and easy to use methods of piracy.  That's why IP companies target the people that make pirating easy and individual pirates to have a side fear campaign.

All of this stuff is just for people who aren't tech savvy.  I think that the industry understands that a smart enough guy will know how to break the protection.  They just try to actively manipulate and further limit the amount of guys smart enough to do it.

There are comedians who place more emphasis on performance and others who place more emphasis on writing, and while the latter might do better in this format, the former might have other areas which work to their favor (a high energy comedian will typically do better in a rowdy room where people aren't inclined to pay attention unless you force them to for instance). 

And while you may prefer the one type of comedian to another, that seems to be a personal preference, and I'm unclear why you would care about others' enjoyment of this aspect of comedy (being that it doesn't undermine your enjoyment of the stuff you prefer).  ","1354320988"

I'd love for Lithium to work as my problems are more frequently self-destructive highs than crippling lows.  I'm drinking 3x as much water as I used to.

I already naturally have all of the side effects you say trouble you the most, so I'm hoping that I won't be too put off by the thirst and the gastro issues.

We're upping the dose every 4 weeks, but I'm ok with a doctor who takes his time.  I'm also taking it at night- it makes me sleep, which is good for me as I'm usually insomniac.  I can't get up in the morning at all on Lithium, but a pushy partner and a loud german shepherd make sure I don't sleep in.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was house sitting for a woman I met on craigslist... I was more or less homeless at the time, waiting to ship out to boot camp.

Anyway, lady had me watering her plants and feeding the cat. One night, the cat wasn't coming home, so I said fuck it, left the back door open and went to bed.

Cue middle of the night... I wake up to some rustling in the kitchen and it dawns on me... A raccoon got in. So I get out of bed preparing myself to battle a raccoon, and as I open the door I see my adversary in the hallway. No, not a raccoon.

A giant Mexican dude.

I said the first words that came to mind, which were ""GET THE FUCK OUT!""  Dude takes a step towards me, so I whip open the door and reveal the thing I'd decided to ward off the raccoon with: My hockey stick.

I threw that thing javelin style like I was goddamn Leonidas. Hit him in the face, but I didn't see it. As soon as the stick was clear of the door, I slammed it.

Called the cops. They followed the blood from the hallway to the backyard and caught him up the block. They drove me down and I made a citizen's arrest.

TL;DR: Thought there was a raccoon in a house I was sitting. Turns out it was a prospective burglar/murderer/rapist. I administered justice via hockey-stick-to-the-face and made a citizen's arrest.","1354320988"

I can understand why you do not like how parties work. There are no laws currently requiring party leaders or party whips, so to remove the current whip system is easier then you think. All that would be required to remove the whip system, is to vote for a party that does not use the whip system. 

However, our current party system has evolved directly from how the electorate respond. The system exist because it wins elections. Canadians reward parties/leaders who keep control of their members in parlement. A weak leader, someone who cannot control their own members gets punished in polls.

The other reason we have the current party system that we do, is due to how the electorate vote in Canada. The electorate are most influent by Party Leader, then Party affliction. This is consistent across Canada. The Whip system will exist as long as the electorate allow it to. ","1354320991"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt; They're actually all losing a shit ton of money. I don't know of much people who would pass on so much money just for success in sports.

Actually, I think when at the pinnacle of the game like that, many players will sacrifice a bit to win a championship. But where do you hear that they're losing so much? I thought they (James and Bosh) signed a contract with their former team so they could get more money?

&gt;I think the cap rules are enough. If players are ok with taking less money and some front offices do better work than other, then it should be so.

I disagree. Teams like LA, Miami, and Dallas spend huge sums of money over the luxury cap and all that because they can afford it. This, coupled with the market value of Miami/La over Charlotte/OKC/DC, makes signing decent players impossible for the middle of the road. 

&gt; Well, I think there's a difference between running your players in the ground like Thibeaudo or sitting your starting five out.

Agreed, but older players like Duncan/Ginobli/Parker are much more susceptible to injuries, especially with so much traveling and so little rest between hard fought games. With so many games in the NBA, coaches should be able to sit whoever they wish. As long as they are within the actual rules (start five players) they should be fine.

 &gt; Well, in leagues where the priority is sport and not only business, that's how it goes. Some teams are advantaged, because they have a bigger area supporting them and others have to do with smaller budgets. I mean it's more or less the same now: add the titles won by the big dogs (Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, ...) and it's not that different.

This is what I'm saying, so bad teams have to take advantage of an opportunity to suck now, compete later. The Bobcats tried fielding a competitive team a few years ago (playoff berth). However, that was the complete ceiling of that team, and with no possibility of improvement and being in that complete middle ground, tanking is the only way out for us. If the big teams can play the system to over spend, why can't the small ones play the system by sucking in order to improve later?","1354321003"

As for the ones I dislike, Supergirl and her stupid, stupid boots were the first things to come to mind. The rest of her costume is fine, but those boots are just ridiculous.

Dispersants were used for one reason, and one reason only- to prevent the oil from reaching the shore and destroying the marshes. It was a tradeoff , and the option that caused the least overall harm was to disperse the oil before it reached the shoreline amd destroyed the marshes.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I can relate to your brother. Both my mom and I both have very strong personalities. But my mom often pulls ""I'm the mom and you listen to me no matter what"", and it just leads to conflict and bad blood. It's gotten to the point that I just avoid saying anything that could get me anywhere near an argument with her (all talk is factual, ""this is what happened today"") because if she starts losing an argument she starts screaming at me that I'm an ignorant teenager who needs to grow up and obviously I can never be right. And if I look it up and prove it to her she yells at me to stop being such a smart ass and to stop taking things so seriously (she once screamed at me for knowing that the California flag is a grizzly, not a black bear) and that I've ruined her appetite/day/week/quiet time.

Really, it's not a good environment and I have been ready to move out since I was a freshman. When I was younger I would go to summer camps for 4-5 weeks a summer and...don't tell my parents this, but I wouldn't think of them once when I was there.

Not that I hate her. Not at all. But I wish I didn't live with her. I enjoy not being there, having that space between us. Best way I can describe our relationship is ""good fences make good neighbors"". But there is no fence. It's precarious at best. 

Don't blame your brother. Two strong personalities in one house usually doesn't turn out too well, especially when one has a power role (parent-child) and the pretense of authority to claim ""always right"". It's frustrating to both parties. Going through the same thing every day for 17-18 years can be very taxing. I probably wont get homesick, but I already know that it'll be a while before I start missing talking to my parents every day. Not that it wont happen, but it'll take time to get over the sour blood between us.

Give your brother some time. He just needs time away from conflict, just as your mom does.","1354321025"

Personal preference is not something you can judge people for. But that's different when it comes to claims to truth, things pertaining the state of the reality we live in. How much should truth be compromised for people to get along, where are we to draw the line?  

We should absolutely not go out of our way to be an asshole to others. But at the same time I feel we should absolutely not compromise truth and honest debate.  
If we allow others to be judged by their level of politeness but not by their level of intellectual honesty, then we're making a mistake, even though the natural human, the natural social animal inclination is exactly towards that mistake.","1354321030"

What you end up with, that close, in the torso (even a head shot in many cases), is an entrance wound that resembled being stabbed with a pencil. So, with those types of wounds, you get sometimes no bleeding at all from an entrance wound. What kills is the internal bleeding, blood loss, and shock (or with a head wound, the destruction of life supporting brain structures). The exit wounds would eventually start bleeding, but of course they are laying on them in this video on dirt, so that's going to take a while.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Well, with jealousy the first thing to realise is that it's a symptom, so you need to find the cause.

Here, what you know is: the idea of her having sex with you and another guy bothers you. The idea of her having sex with you and another woman does not bother you. You are also uncomfortable with that double standard.

Why does a man make you more jealous than a woman? There are a few possibilities. Maybe you think another man, being able to ""compete"" with you, is going to be more of a threat than another woman. After all, if the other person is a woman, you know you have something she doesn't, maybe that makes you feel more secure that you won't ""lose"" your girlfriend. Or that your girlfriend won't think the other woman is ""better"" than you, or if she does, it's on a different scale anyways so it doesn't matter.

Another possibility is that with two women there, you might feel like everyone gets something out of it (I'm going with the assumption that you're straight and she's bisexual. If you're both straight or both bi, that's different though). Even if she is straight, with another woman, you presumably would be with two women. With another man, provided you're straight, you don't get someone else, she does. That might be what makes you jealous. As much as you want to please her, you might find it unfair.

To get over the first kind of insecurity (feeling more threatened by a man), you need to be secure in the fact that she likes you for who you are and won't leave you for another man. She isn't staying just because she hasn't found better. She's with you because she wants to be with you.

On top of that, you can definitely provide things another man cannot. Just because you and him will both have a penis doesn't mean you'll be on a big scale ranked from 0 to 100 where you'll each have a spot, and his might be better than yours. You'll both have a unique set of qualities and flaws, and having a penis is just one aspect of you. Similarly, other females might have breasts and a vagina, but in many other ways they might be similar to you, in tastes, personality, how thoughtful they are, etc.

If it's the second one, then you can always try and make things more fair by deciding together that you have a MFM threesome, which is all for her, and which you'll enjoy because you want her to be happy, BUT then you also want to do something that will be focused on something you like, even though she might get less out of it.

It could also be that your jealousy comes from something else altogether. If so, try and identify it, you won't be able to work on it if you don't know what it is.

Good luck!","1354321034"

Teenagers don't always get the recognition they deserve, which is unfair. As you grow older, more people will see you as more mature (despite how mature you may be at the moment; sucks, doesn't it?) and find it in themselves to give appreciation. Keep your head up and focus on what you can do with your own life around you, instead of focusing on other's opinions. 

With telling your mom, I think she may understand more than you think. Mothers have a sort of intuition, so she may be suspecting it already. If not, I suggest talking to her about it by possibly bringing up the idea of finding you a therapist. She will want to help, but most of the time, having a professional help is more organized and safer.

It's all a balancing act in the end, and sometimes you have to drop a few things to save the others. Keep your head up and focus on what is important to you. ","1354321034"

This makes sense if you have a hard class in the morning or something that requires a lot of mental energy.

If the purpose of the Ritalin is to help you in the evening, then you would take it around 3-4 (after you figure out the right time to take it so it doesn't interfere with sleep).

The Ritalin might barely be noticeable because it only works on one neurotransmitter (dopamine) while the Adderall works on 3 (dopamine, seratonin, and norepinephrine). Also in my experience, the first dose of a stimulant in the day is almost always the most effective and I could barely feel my last 10mg Adderall IR. ","1354321040"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I will have a look in a little while and reply with a link to the pictures - gotta finish up some housework first. 

I felt perfectly safe all the time really. I mean I stayed in people's houses a lot of the time and I guess you're kind of trusting them then. Bishkek probably does have some pretty dodgy areas but I never really felt in danger, either in general or because I was a foreigner (travelling through the Fergana valley into Uzbekistan was a different story). I guess I would say you would be in trouble if you walked around like a rich foreigner flashing cash and expensive stuff all over - but I didn't have any negative experiences. 

The Australian Government had a travel warning realting to Islamic extremism attached when I went there, but I didn't see any signs of it. As for regions to avoid, that may be true - I never ran into any trouble but this is taking into account that my government basically says to avoid the whole country. Having a local guide probably helps you avoid areas you shouldn't go to. 

It was cheaper in Kyrgyzstan than it was in both China and Uzbekistan, I guess maybe because there wasn't much in the way of things to waste money on. 

As for advice for people wanting to do the same trip, I would say definitely do it. If nothing else you can become the ultimate travel hipster - nobody beats you in terms of visiting weird places. It was also an amazing, life changing trip for me. My other tip is don't try to go it alone. There is a really great Australian tour company called Intrepid. They do trips through these regions regularly (when politics allows) and are a great knowledge base. They also keep their groups small (8-12) and give you tons of free time so you don't feel like you're on a 'tour'. I've used them for other things and can only recommend them. It would be great way to safely do this - plus you need a guide for Kyrgyzstan anyway (we used one of theirs) so it would make like easier. 

As for the cost of the whole trip, I spent about 10,000 Australian Dollars, with flights costing 3000 (due to flying out of Tashkent Airport in Uzbekistan). I would hazard it might cost more from the US due to the distance. It cost my life savings up to that point, don't regret a single cent. ","1354321042"

It's not easy growing up in that environment, and often you have to be more parent than child.

I can imagine a proof tree (say, in natural deduction with the 5 Peano axioms) of FLT where all the leaves are instances of the Peano axioms. In other words, one that even doesn't use commutativity of addition and multiplication on the Peano naturals, but replaces *every* invokation of those results by their proofs. I wouldn't want to write it down, though!

But I have a background in functional programming/type theory, and you're right to argue that the 'cut-and-paste' theorem uses 'cuberoot(2) is irrational' morally; I'm just saying that it needn't, *syntactically*.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","For a little while, that's the basic idea. At some point though your desire may be to just have more in a Roth, even if some of those contributions are costing you 25% right off the bat. 

Most people here like to put in towards the Roth at the 25% bracket (the next one doesn't start until about $85,000), so don't worry too much about all this stuff. But if you happen to be adopting a ""tax diversification"" strategy - a good choice, by the way - you'll be putting funds in towards both, so you might as well give yourself a little tax break and for the next few years let that $35,351 number dictate how much you contribute to a Traditional (that number changes every year, BTW). Then contribute what you can into the Roth. 

Even as a big fan of pre-tax accounts, and being in the 28% bracket, I still put in about $3,500 towards a Roth IRA and I'll probably start maxing it out next year, because it's always good to diversify your investments, even among how they're taxed.

This kid, Stephen used to play on my soccer team in 5th grade and I was told by the coach that I was a ""great goalie"" and in the championship, my team didn't do shit. I was doing my best but the defense (Included Stephen on the right) was awful. I couldn't block every goal and we lost by 2 points. In gym class, we were playing soccer and he kept telling my girlfriend (who was selected to be on his team) how shitty at soccer I was. As everyone knew, I was still on a great (to say the least) soccer team as the primary goalie. Stephen was a little cunt who didn't know this and he had quit soccer soon after 5th grade while I had played an accumulated 9 years. Anywho, he decided that he would be on offense and came to attempt a goal, he yelled, ""watch it go through his knees!"" And kicked the ball. I was prepared and kicked the ball back, as hard as I could, straight into his face. I hit him hard enough to start a nose bleed and the coach told him that he had to get off the field. I blocked every goal for the rest of the day and constantly looked back at butt-hurt Stephen. I felt pretty badass. ","1354321053"

I think all my AEGs besides my Matrix PDW have 7mm bushings, and that includes CA prolines and G&amp;P gearboxes. Plus you'd also have to get a new shell to actually fit the bigger bushings, which usually isn't a must unless the stock gun comes with a weak shell (e.g a Combat Machine), even China gun shells are strong enough to avoid replacement ASAP. Instead, quality bushings are more important. Kind of like how longer inner barrels don't equal better range, quality ultimately determines the performance.

Take your pick. I don't mean to imply that every single military operation of the United States in its history has been unjust, and I know nothing of your sense of justice, but I would venture to guess that there is at least one operation in that list that you disagree with. America's next war could be like that one. But if you voluntarily join the military, you don't get to pick and choose whether to participate. You just follow orders, even if you think the war is bullshit. Otherwise you get court-martialed.

Edit: Personally, the best and most dramatic example for me in recent history was Vietnam. There was no reason for us to be there, and we didn't conduct ourselves very well:

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I was in the same exact situation. I was dropping my buddy off at the bus station as he was heading out of state for a good while. A homeless guy approaches us and begs for the usual change. I offered some food instead from the convenience store across the station. Immediately, the excuses start flying in. 

Him: ""The food isn't going to last me no more than tonight man.""

Me: ""Ok, well I'll throw in an extra bag of doritos or something.""

Him: ""C'mon, I'd just like some money.""

Me: ""Look, I don't have any change on me. I'm happy to buy you some food though.""

Him: (in a seemingly irritated voice) ""Check in your car, I know you got some.""

At that point we didn't want anything to do with the guy. I told my buddies to get in and locked the doors. Immediately the guy starts apologizing for his behavior blaming it on the situation he's in. I cracked the window and told him, ""I'm sorry man, but its so easy to see what you're going to with that money. I know someone who is hiring though. Here's his number and call him when you want to get your life straightened out. He's cool with people like you just as long as you show you want to work.""

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; You seem to have a very romanticized view of primitive societies.

And you seem to assume we're a bunch of apes. My view happens to be backed up by the entire field of cultural anthropology. A tribal structure doesn't last if there's constant he-man infighting. Furthermore, your view is hundreds of years out of date; Hobbes' idea of life being ""nasty, brutish and short"" in tribes has been demonstrated to be wrong by any number of ethnographic works. 

&gt; We have. The secret is not in trading, it was the creation of money that started the evolution of human civilization. With money came the tools to handle it, markets and banks.

How silly. You don't need money to start an economic system, all you need is a record, and surprise, people are reasonably good at remembering things. This directly leads to an economic structure based on favors. People do this informally all the time - let me borrow your boat for an evening, I'll have you over for dinner to repay the favor, etc. 

So the idea that no trade will happen unless opposing parties have *exactly* what the other wants is clearly ridiculous, as the things people want and need are flexible. And further, as people often have a wide variety of wants and needs, trades can be done on any number of things, or can be delayed. And none of this requires money - as convenient as it may be.

He tries to dodge street corners, cuts through an alley but I catch this mother fucker at a railing and he attempts some Jackie Chan jump over, not realizing he was already caught out of mid air and heading towards the ground backwards. As I slam him into the ground he surrenders and cowers, giving me a gold watch he apparently also acquired. 

I stand up, turn around and there's a cop starring me down.

My heart sinks, and this poor black guy is stumbling away, sees the cop and bolts. I tell the cop ""That prick stole my watch!"" I show him the evidence. He laughs, congratulates me and drives off.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry this is going to be long, but it's by far my best moment of bad-assery.

I played girls rugby in high-school and during one of the games of my rookie season this one bitch on the other team had it in for me. Her and I got into several problems on the field and after she concussed our only available hooker I lost it.

It started when I was on the ground in the fetal position as a ruk was happening above me. I had the ball in my arms, hugging it tightly trying to somehow get it to a team member without the groping hands of the other team snatching it away. The ultra bitch was on the ground too and was scratching at me for the ball. i then saw her remove her mouth guard (STUPID) and start to bite me. I was so pissed, so I figured, fuck this bitch- and I jerked my knee up and knocked her in the mouth. I couldn't be called on it because you're not allowed to be on the field without a mouth guard in the first place.

But she got me back. In the second half, once again I was on the ground. this time it was because of an overzealous tackle on my part. I tried to take down a girl easily 4 times my size, and that didn't work. But just as I'm about to pick myself up, that vindictive cunt runs past me, but not without stepping on my face with her cleats first. I ended up getting a gushing bloody nose. And to make matters worse, at this particular game we were short a bunch of girls and so there was no one to substitute for my position (lock). My coach shoved two small tampons up my nose and told me to kill it. And so I did.

My position doesn't involve scoring or fast running. I'm mostly responsible for passing, tackling and doing whatever it takes to bring back possession. But by the last 5min of the game, I was livid. I was so  furious I disregarded my usual play and instead just charged through anyone in my way. Within the last minute I had the infant sized ball in my hands and an unusually open field ahead of me. So I went for it. I had never run so fast in my life, no one could catch up to even grab my ankles. I couldn't see or hear anything but my own blood pumping and my boiling rage. I remember a couple girls from the other team coming in from the side trying to take me down, but I just deflected them with my sheer momentum. And just as I was less than a meter away from the line I hear a whistle blow and I think, ""Fuck...I'm out of time!"". but no, I turned around to see all the players sitting down and the other team's coach running towards an injured player. It was my nemesis. Next thing I knew my coach was all over me making sure *I* was okay, and all at once I was so dizzy and confused.

 Turns out the girl tried to body check me (an illegal move, we were only allowed below the waist tackles) but instead ended up getting my elbow in her collar bone, and it snapped. Apparently she really hit me hard, and that combined with my adrenaline speed caused the impact to be pretty lethal. I had the wind knocked out of me slightly, but she was taken away on a stretcher. HA! I never ended up scoring, but I was declared MVP for the game and pretty much earned some ridiculous respect on the time. I felt like a machine.","1354321072"

1) I'm currently a first year student in a 3 year degree at university (Bachelor of Communication, if anyone was wondering). How realistic do you think it would be to get a job in the field without a degree? Or gain part time work as a front-end developer while I'm still at uni?

2) HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Version Control. Are these enough to be considered a well rounded front-end developer? If so, would learning PHP be a fool's errand? Should I be focusing on some other skill or language?

Well, just as I did on each of these little jumps, a car makes a quick lane change, which kind of freaked me out. So I grab the breaks. Unfortunately, I grabbed the breaks for the front wheel. So when the tire hits the ground it just stops, and I get catapulted over the handlebars. Luckily, I was in martial arts at the time, and a big part of our training was how to fall safely. So I pull a roll, end up with just a few scratches on my forearms, instead of a face full of concrete. 

Another time a few years later, I was driving to my friends house in the middle of winter. On the way there is had to drive down and hill that was pretty icy, and had cars parked up and down both sides of the street. Well about halfway down the hill, my car starts to slide. Thankfully, I had been spending the last few weeks playing tons of GTA3 Vice City. So my video game reflexes took over and I drove like I was pulling a handbrake slide in the game. Made it all the way down the street without incident. Totally felt like a badass. ","1354321074"

[This image](http://static.happyplace.com/assets/images/2012/11/509bedacdc6e5.jpeg) also shows, the opposite of what you're saying too.

I doubt you'll pay any attention to any of these sources, as the right tend to suffer from confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.  That's how powerful right-wingers keep people on their side.  They use fear and hate as a propaganda tool, and it works due to the lack of intelligence in the majority who align themselves to right-wing ideologies.  

Just turn on Fox News and see how they report the news.  They don't just tell you the news, they tell you what to think about the news.  They tell stories that cause you to fear for yourself, and to hate people who aren't like you.

If he died before going there, there would be no community to take on after him, as his group of followers were much smaller then, and no longer in a position of power in Mecca.  Also, Muhammad was the person invited by Medina to arbitrate for their city.  With him dead, given the personal nature of politics back then, that invitation would be gone and would probably not apply to any successors (if such a thing was even possible back that early in the religion).

The power of the Caliphate came from the unifying banner of Arabian tribes under Muhammed, its open tolerance to other religions, and the timing of its rise to just after the Byzantine-Persian wars.

With Muhammad dead, it could take another generation or two for another religious leader to arise to attempt to unify the peninsula, and by then, both Byzantium and Persia might be in full recovery, with the military necessary to head off conquest attempts.

Also without Muhammad's particular vision of religious tolerance to Jews and Christians, if a unifying force was far harsher in its orthodoxy, any regions conquered by them might suffer significantly more revolt.

tl;dr - timing (due to the exhaustion of Byzantium and Persia), and the high tolerance Muhammad's beliefs had of other monotheistic religions is what allowed the Arab Conquests to spread so quickly and to take root.  Without both, the conquests may have never happened, or they may not have held.  ","1354321081"

That said, many also have stories of being on the brink of starvation/severe dehydration and praying anyone will give them anything; one man said he could barely walk or see straight and couldn't even remember the last time he had eaten.

Stop walking forward after a few steps and then just start vertically jumping.

I might have been doing something wrong but in my experience using the spot on the ceiling that most people use required me to re-position a few steps away from the corner and it was really hard to get it to work consistently.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","In the spirit of diplomacy, I'm sorry I reacted so snarkily originally. It does get a little bit old for me and others to hear people fawning over John Williams who've never heard any classical greats (not saying that's you necessarily, just the association that your question sparked in our minds). However, that should be an opportunity for us to educate, not to attack.

In that vein, here's some more bite-size chunks of music from composers that I think might have the kind of stuff you're looking for, and to give you an idea of what we mean when we say that Williams is drawing from a big number of established sources. I saw that someone shared a couple Mahler symphonies with you, but it's understandable if you don't want to dive into a huge hour and a half long work.


[Mahler's 2nd Symphony, 4th movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsm6lDuM3JA) - heart-breakingly beautiful imo, and only 5 minutes long. Check out especially the mood he sets at 2:48, and the chord at 4:21 is a gorgeous bit of chromaticism.

[Brass Chorale from Mahler's 2nd Symphony, 5th movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUB4vGmGSdY) - sheer raw, symphonic power. Hans Zimmer's got nothing on this.

[Prokofiev's 3rd piano concerto, 1st movement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQaO7v1d1ng) - this work has a rhythmic vitality that makes it stand out for me in the world of piano concertos. Prokofiev is another extremely coloristic composer, moving from flowing melodies and lush harmonies to jarring dissonances and percussive rhythms quite easily.

[""Mars"" from Gustav Holst's *The Planets* suite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I) - one of the most-cited instances of his stylistic borrowing. It's very easy to hear where the Imperial March came from when you listen to this.

[The Promise of Living by Aaron Copland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLVyRvp2Qbg) - one of my absolute favorite Copland pieces (I have a very personal connection to it). Appalachian Spring is also incredible if you have the time for it, but this is much shorter and quicker to listen to. Gorgeous open harmonies and lush orchestrations are what Copland is best known for in stuff like this.

I'm sure others have more examples they can add on, those are just some that came to mind seeing the names floating around in this thread. Again, I'm sorry for being fairly hostile to you at first. I hope you can take this as a chance to explore some music you may not have known about before, instead of just (justifiably) being annoyed at the vitriol you got.

EDIT: one more! I forgot Wagner Check out [the beginning of his opera Siegfried](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUe3jwD-o6o) to see some absolutely fantastic orchestral writing. His influence on the symphonic music that came after him is hard to overstate. For some more lyrical or ""pretty"" music from him, listen to [Elsa's Procession to the Cathedral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgTK-U96k5Q). 4:47 to the end is an absolute tear-jerker for me. You want intricate, winding, chromatic lines that contribute to a beautiful, cohesive whole? There you have it.","1354321094"

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","If she wears mostly silver, I'd recommend a silver watch. Mixing metals is difficult to do well and a lot of people prefer to avoid it entirely. It's great that you thought of that--another important consideration if you prefer a leather strap is the color of leather she usually wears (black, cognac, deep brown, taupe?).

I don't know what her style is, but as a general rule I would stay toward the ""simpler"" side of things. If you avoid styles that are overly trendy (e.g. neon, studs) or an excess of detailing (e.g. rhinestones, charms), it can be something she can wear for years and combine with other pieces. 

A few suggestions:

* [La Mer wrap watches](http://www.lamercollections.com/collection/Brown-LMSTW1004/). They are stylish but still fairly classic, and have a good reputation for durability. [This one](http://www.lamercollections.com/collection/Gun-Metal-Double-Wrap/) and [this one](http://www.lamercollections.com/collection/Mushroom-Mushroom-Layer-Wrap/) are also pretty. I think one of the [gift boxes with interchangeable straps](http://www.lamercollections.com/collection/SILVER-INTERCHANGEABLE-GIFT-BOX-TOBACCO-BROWN-AND-NAVY-STRAPS/) would make a great present. 

* Oversized menswear watches. These have been really popular lately, but I don't think it's the kind of thing that will look incredibly dated in a few years, either. The classic Micheal Kors or Kate Spade in this style is probably out of your price range, but [this one](http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/vince-camuto-curved-crystal-bracelet-watch/3416605?origin=category&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=0) and [this one](http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/fossil-stella-multifunction-bracelet-watch/3270770?origin=category&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=0) are nice. And [This Micheal Kors](http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/michael-kors-slim-runway-bracelet-watch/3292271?origin=category&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=0) isn't actually that far off. This style is supposed to look large on the wrist but as a word of caution if your girlfriend has really small wrists, it might look overwhelming/be uncomfortable.

* Does she happen to really love [red](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/kate-spade-new-york-metro-leather-strap-watch/3410318?origin=keywordsearch&amp;contextualcategoryid=0&amp;fashionColor=&amp;resultback=0) or [blue](http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/kate-spade-new-york-metro-leather-strap-watch/3388164?cm_cat=datafeed&amp;cm_ite=kate_spade_new_york_%27metro%27_leather_strap_watch:542805_2&amp;cm_pla=jewelry:women:watch&amp;cm_ven=Google_Product_Ads&amp;mr:ad=13566440033&amp;mr:adType=pla&amp;mr:filter=42353731793&amp;mr:keyword=&amp;mr:match=&amp;mr:referralID=NA&amp;mr:trackingCode=D0688BC5-9C0D-E211-9A4A-90E2BA0278A8&amp;origin=pla)? Much less versatile, but a very nice watch.

* I really love slim, rectangular-face watches like [this one](http://fashionfinder.asos.com/womens-EMPORIO-ARMANI/Emporio-Armani-Silver-Rectangular-Bracelet-Watch-1331258). They look great stacked with other bracelets.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Rape is a very serious deal. It is a terrible crime that causes both physical and emotional damage. No one should rape anyone ever. Sounds simple right? 

Well where it falls apart is that people, both men and women, say a lot of really fucked up things in regard to rape. For example: She deserved it because of what she was wearing. She didn't say no. She didn't fight back. All men are rapists. All sex is rape. Any sex while inebriated is rape. You have to loudly consent to sex every minute or so or it is rape.

All of these take a simple issue and make a huge fucked up mess of it. It has gotten to the point where a person can't simply say that ""Rape is bad, and you shouldn't do it"" anymore.

With what you said. ""No, you do not assume consent ever."" The issue is bigger than that. A lot bigger. You seem to not understand human behavior or human sexuality. When it comes to sexuality and the ""human mating dance"", a lot of it is non-verbal. In fact, most of it is non-verbal. Stop and think about it for a second. When you have sex, does your partner actually say ""Do you consent to a kiss?"", ""Do you consent to a touch?"", ""Do you consent to me removing your clothes?"", etc...Or do they respond to your body language, tone of voice, the look on your face, etc...Realistically, how many times have you verbally given your consent to sex. How many times have you said ""Yes, you can have sex with me"". 

Now, don't get me wrong. I am not trying to defend rapists or their behaviors. Not at all. I am just trying to get you to understand that the issue is not as simple as you make it out to be. ","1354321096"
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","3 x 5 flat AP Quints increases their damage output a lot on first few levels - makes your ganks much stronger.

Cho and Skarner don't have such a great gap closer like Mao (W) and Amumu (Q) IMO, so getting those few extra MS can help up catching the enemy when your flash isn't up.

This is how I'm looking at it and I maybe explained it wrong, but from what I can see on stream, most people run AP on Mao &amp; Amumu and MS on Cho &amp; Skarner. So they know better, I guess ;)

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","While this is the way things are supposed to work reality shows it doesn't.

You are right about deficit and taxation spending but your assumption that savings equals investment is only viable in a closed economy, which the US is not. Meaning that the USA can access the savings of Europe, china, Japan as well as its own citizens. This creates the ability for both the government to borrow as well as the private sector to spend, there is no crowding out of private investment by government deficit financing 

Secondly as we see now though significant capital exists in savings accounts, or stocks or bonds, it does not mean that it will be used. Banks are not lending, companies aren't investing (they either sit on large cash reserves or pay dividends). Which helps create the current sluggish economy that exists now. 

In this situation lowering government spending has a detrimental effect as it further reduces demand in the economy.","1354321098"

This is not the case. your voice **needs** that support from your diaphragm; even when you want to sing softly. Throttle back the air, and a line sung at piano becomes a whisper lacking pitch control and vocal clarity.

The base of all this is breathing. Be sure you're filling your lungs from the bottom, up. When you take a breath, your stomach should go out, not just your chest.

Of course, if you actually observe a false positive, you should consider a hallucination to be the most likely explanation, as that will happen on considerably more than 1 in 500,000,000 person-days (the average person lives about 25000 days, and Schizophrenia affects about 0.7% of the population, so the probability of having your first symptoms of schizophrenia on a given day is about 1 in 35,000,000, or about 14 times as likely as actually seeing a false positive).","1354321106"

"canada","t5_2qh68","I agree its long overdue for something to change, and more rockets and bombings wont help anything. 

The reality is that attention or not, nobody else is going to make anyone there have peace. There will not be peace until BOTH sides want it more than they are willing to toss rockets and bombs at eachother. We have yet to get to that point and nobody is going to force it. If Israel could have forced peace through military action they would have done it years ago, and if the Palestinians could have forced peace with Israel they would have as well. Both sides tried though and both have failed, Israel failed with bombs and border controls and settlements, and the Palestinians tried with suicide bombings, and several very unsuccessful wars (via Egypt, Syria, and Jordan). 

It is clear that the military and force are not options to settle this. The issue is if calling ""attention"" to the situation can make it better. The reality is that as long as Israel has nuclear weapons (or we think it does) and the US backs it, nobody can do anything from the outside. Arab nations treat Palestinians like shit (the ones who are in their nations) and love to play up how terrible Israel is, but when push comes to shove, they wont stand up for Palestinians. So who is this attention going to motivate? What power do those people have? 

I would suggest that unless there is a large part of Israeli society who somehow does not know what goes on regarding Palestinians and who would actively be able to change their governments course of action nothing will change. The ICC and ICJ are a joke, they dont show up on the 6 pm news, they barely even make the papers, and outside of academic and governmental circles most people dont know what they are.

If Israel hasnt been moved by negative press already, they wont be moved by it in the future.

When they raped TSM at MLG, it was with Reapered as their toplane, from what i've seen he was faaaar better than Flame.

When they played at MLG recently, they had Shy subbing for top, he's also faaaar better than flame.

Blaze without a ace top like Shy/Reapered doesn't seem to be nearly as strong. They are still a good team, but they are not a contender (judging from what i've seen). I think TSM has a fairly decent chance to finally win against a asian team

If you want to learn to roll them without a machine, look up how to on youtube, buy some tobacco or something and just keep rolling ""joints"" as best you can.

"RBAsales","t5_2vm7k","Doing some data sheet looking on pyrex of the kind I went ahead and ordered and it is ok for rapid heating/cooling up to a 120c upper bound which is around 248f.  Quartz is so differnt than pyrex and I have been looking for info on cutting differences between pyrex and quartz.

I know the pyrex is basically score &amp; snap, BUT I have not found any information on how quartz is cut?  Reason I bring that up is I saw a ""scientific"" cutter for quartz tube and I have no idea where that link was LOL 

I have a laser temp gauge my dad is going to loan me and I am going to measure the tempature of the wire on the pyrex w/the SS inside the pyrex and juice in the tank when I get that pyrex I ordered.

If the temp is exceeding 248f then I'll prob start looking at data sheets for quartz, which I have yet to do or look for a higher upper bound on rapid heating/cooling for pyrex as it comes in differnt Hz.  I am leaning torwards the idea that the 32 awg even at 4.oV &amp; 2.4 ohm does not touch 248f and even if it does it is probably for a mere fraction of an instance or so at most I am just guessing.  //no clue//

So if you made $42,707 in one year, only $32,707 is taxable at 15%, so your marginal tax rate on your entire earnings is more like 11%.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The P4 is kind of a special case because it was designed to achieve high clock rates for marketing purposes. They obtained that with extreme pipelining, meaning each pipeline stage was very simple but there were a lot of them. Long pipelines imply a more severe penalty for branch misprediction because you have to flush that extra-long pipeline after a miss. It's not so much that the Athlon was especially efficient as the P4 wasted all of the potential extra speed of higher clock rates on cleaning up branch mispredictions. If the P4 had been able to scale to 10 GHz as their marketing department initially claimed, it would have been the higher performance design. Intel just couldn't overcome the power dissipation problems that arise at those clock speeds.

It's like the difference between a Corvette and an F1 car. The Corvette will wipe the street with an F1 car on city roads because the F1 isn't designed to run that slow. (no downforce, no tire grip, etc) Put the F1 on a track where it can go 300kph and it will lap the Corvette all day long.","1354321134"

Anything from 1980 and earlier is going to be leaps and bounds over any designer brand peacoat in terms of quality and warmth. I can attest to this personally, as I own a WWII Navy Issued Peacoat. The WWII and earlier peacoats tend to fit more slim, but all of them in general are going to be a trim military fit, and let me tell you it is impossible to go back to brand named peacoats from the moment you first put on a vintage issued peacoat. 

You can find them for as little as $50, but more often at around $90 or so on eBay. If you want to find more information on US Navy Issued Peacoats read [this](http://www.thefedoralounge.com/showthread.php?35824-PEACOAT-DATING) post on a different fashion forum online.

"VirginiaTech","t5_2r39x","I'm sorry man but I'm going to have to disagree with you again.  You are extremely forgiving of a terrible conference.  Being in the SEC alone ups recruiting more than going to an **extremely shitty** Orange Bowl and losing to a Big East team (or just losing over and over again in bowls).  USC, LSU, and Alabama (we lost to USC after a terrible PI call and hung with Bama until the 4th quarter) went on the **win the National Championship**.  Being in the ACC **does not** help us financially due to shitty TV contracts from being in a shitty conference.  Move to the SEC and we make **a shit ton more $$$**.  Our recruiting is **great** and we are set to have a better and better classes (**which would only improve by joining the SEC**).  


The SEC East is comprised of:  
Missouri  
Kentucky  
Vanderbilt  
Tennessee  
Georgia  
South Carolina   

Barring another year like this, are you seriously telling me that we would be like Kentucky or Vandy?  Any other year we would be a middle of the pack team in the conference and we could pick up more wins with a softer OOC schedule.  I'm not sure (I can look it up) but I think the ACC splits bowl revenue equally while the SEC lets you retain a bigger portion before splitting it with the rest of the conference.    

**All in all, it is incredulous to say that going to the SEC would hurt our recruiting and revenue.**  

Here's a great example for you of how you can go from complete shit to powerhouse by joining the SEC: **South Carolina**.

Don't fool around trying to build your own accelerometer; you've got a preexisting, high-quality bit of kit for sleep-state tracking right there that's far more accurate and less invasive than any DIY setup.

I use [Sleep as Android](http://sites.google.com/site/sleepasandroid/graphs) to track my sleep phases - I got into it at first because I liked the idea of an alarm clock that only goes off when you're in light sleep just before wake-up time, so you feel refreshed in the mornings rather than feeling like hell because you were disturbed in the middle of another cycle of deep sleep that's just started.  
But it's fascinating to track my sleep hours and quality anyway, suddenly if I've been disorganised for a week I can now quantify it with hard evidence of too little sleep and I know precisely when I should be going to bed earlier.

**It actually detects lucid dreaming and REM sleep, I think!**

Use this or similar (I'm sure iOS equivalents exist), along with [Tasker](http://lifehacker.com/5599116/how-to-turn-your-android-phone-into-a-fully+automated-superphone), to pass a signal to your eye mask (Bluetooth?)

Tokens ""put on the bottom of the deck"" are destroyed, and Indestructible does not interact with Terminus, so the end result would be nothing happening.

The other example the stack goes:

1)  Supreme Verdict

After getting rid of the frame and converting to grayscale, do an overall contrast adjustment first (either through auto contrast, levels or curves) so that the darkest spots become black. Now duplicate the layer and create a mask with soft and hard edges as needed of the parts where the contrast is too low and correct the contrast again. You can enhance the edges of the mask for better transitions afterwards. Repeat for parts where the contrast still doesn't match.

If there are bad transitions left you couldn't get rid of by adjusting the masks (pretty likely for hard edged glare) you could switch to getting rid of those with the patch tool or the healing brush after flattening the image.","1354321143"

It's just that as a fan of TSM from the early stages I want to see them do well and its clear there are issues right now that need to be worked out. 

A coach seems like something that could help, but the main thing might be that TSM used to have a lot more fun playing and you could tell just by watching their youtube videos or seeing them on stream. These days that doesn't seem to be the case. Hopefully the team gets back at least on top in NA and even better if they can find a way to start beating the Foreign teams!

I could pick up on Arabic conversations, not necessarily the translation, but I am able to figure out the context. The Syriac my family speaks has an Arabic influence on it because of ""Arabization"" in the village we come from. A lot of Arabic words were mixed in to our daily speech. 

For example, if you were to listen to my Syriac (Village of Tel Kayf [Tel Keppe]), versus someone in a more northern village of Iraq, their Syriac will be more ""pure""

Also, the languages themselves are similar. The word house for example. In my language it is pronounced ""Betha"" in Arabic, it is prounounced ""Beht""","1354321156"

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","This is a bit different than your scenarios described.

You could call the police and ask for your wife to be charged with kidnapping. No statute estopps you from doing so. There is no affirmative defense written in either. She could ACTUALLY be charged with kidnapping.

You're talking about what ""would"" happen and that is fine. But that statute just limits the options, which is unfair to the raped person. She has no recourse, whereas you still have recourse for the alleged kidnap.

The fact is, be precluding the fact-finding by virtue of your marriage status, justice is miscarried. 

I live with my spouse. I know how it is. We've all been in similar situations to what you described, but the difference is that you back off when she says ""no."" If you didn't, and she was crying, and there was no forcible compulsion but it was quite clear to you that she was completely defeated and deflated; that would be rape in nearly every state. Not Mississippi though.

I admire your willingness to engage on this, but I think you're missing the mark. 

You MUST be in a practice area that isn't criminal law. Any time fact-finding is precluding, the defense is almost always getting stiffed and I don't like in this one instance where we're not.","1354321157"

How do you test the validity of the DSM guide for schizophrenia?  How do you test it for any social disorder?

The heritability of mathematical knowledge is enough ALONE to be convincing to me... why? Because this is the only objective skill human beings possess and is solely responsible for the progress of mankind, bettering of our world, and technological development.  It's also something that the world should and does find extremely valuable, and honestly, this is the only thing that limits our understanding in any reasonable way.

I realize others may want to (in my opinion and experience) incorrectly apply a variety of other factors, like spatial reasoning, learning, language skills, etc, so the g-factor is a great method to encompass this.

Analytic approaches to a psychological factor? Seriously?  Why don't you propose a set of variables to start from in developing this...

The research on this area is extremely well developed, thatÂ´s the problem.  ItÂ´s been studied in more instances, and through more regular tests of wide populations than any other human factor I can think of.  In fact, compared to other psychological illnesses or qualities, the heritability of intelligence has been so thoroughly studied that denying the findings strikes me as going way beyond wishful thinking and into self-delusion.  You're talking about thousands of highly controlled and systematic studies, all demonstrating this problem.  But beyond that, you have a wealth of entrance exams into everything from Law schools, to the MCAT, to the ACT all testing a variety of things... all display the same deviation of gap.","1354321161"

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","Dark Worlds get the same hate Chain Burn does. Both have strategies that are extremely good, but viewed as cheap. I run Chain Burn and know that a good portion of my opponent's deck will be useless against it; backrow hate. The same goes with Darkworld; Veilers, fiendish chains, skill drain.
It's a great deck for game 1, and it is easily sided into for game 2 and 3, but the hate comes from casual duels, Its usually just a one-game duel. I'll give you an example:

I'm using my LancerFrogs and my friend is using DW. My hand consists of a Swap Frog, 2x Creature Swap, 1 E-con, 1 Soul Exchange. I can work with the Swap Frog so its not completely a dead hand. He goes first and sets his spells/traps and activates Dragged Down. I pick Beige and he gets rid of my Frog. Great. I draw LaDD. Great! Beige gets SS. He activates Dealings, I draw Ronintoadin and discard a Creature Swap. He discards Grapha, Summons it, by returning the Beige from earlier and ends turn. I draw MST and then he activates Eradicator Epidemic Virus and picks spells.

...

Rage quit ensues and we start game 2. 

Pretty much combos like this is why Dark Worlds get hate. I personally don't like playing against them, but acknowledge that its a good deck.","1354321162"

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","The best advice I read when I was diagnosed a year ago was to not try and replace foods you eat with GF equivalents as you will largely be disappointed. GF bread products you'll find in the store (with rice or tapioca flour) are a pretty terrible affair unless you happen to live near a good GF bakery. Try to get excited about trying *new* foods rather than simply substituting things.

It's also pretty hard to disclose your condition without coming off like a picky eater or a fad dieter. I'd advise you to mostly keep it to yourself when possible as it quickly gets tiring explaining that yes, it's an actual thing and no, it's not an allergy. That said, I found it surprising that waitstaff in most restaurants are generally helpful with menus and food preparation if you just simply tell them you're GF. Don't assume anything that seems gluten free (salads, soups) actually is -- ask questions and don't be shy. If anyone gives you a guilt trip or teases you, fuck 'em. Your family needs to understand this, too. 

There's going to be situations in which everyone but you is eating (boss buys pizza on a Friday, bar with no GF options, etc) so you should stock up on some food and carry it with you. Snacks like [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000643671) are good to have on hand.

One thing that made the transition easier for me was that I like to cook Asian and Indian food, and most of that cuisine is GF. Learn to stir-fry, it's pretty easy and there's endless combinations of veggies and meats or tofu. You're going to be preparing a lot of your own food so you might as well become handy in the kitchen (if you're not already).

For perspective, here's some meals I often make:

Stir fry - any combination of tofu/meat, broccoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms, snow peas, cabbage, bok choy, jicama, etc fried with some tamari (not soy sauce) and rice vinegar, served with brown rice.

Polenta - [preformed rolls](http://www.amazon.com/San-Gennaro-Polenta-Traditional-18-Ounce/dp/B00474H92M/ref=sr_1_2?s=grocery&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354320470&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=polenta) (these are available at most grocers), sliced into 1/2"" and pan fried with some olive oil.

Casseroles - endless variations, usually whatever veggies I have mixed with some cheese, home fries/potatoes, and a couple eggs. Bake in 350 oven for 30 min.

[Japanese-style curry](http://norecipes.com/blog/karei-raisu-japanese-curry-rice/) or [Indian curry](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/marrakesh-vegetable-curry) - simple as boiling a few small red potatoes (or use frozen home fries) and dice them, sautee with some sliced onions and carrot, add some curry powder or cumin/coriander/tumeric, add tofu/meat, simmer in coconut milk for 20 min.

Tacos - fry meat or potatoes, onion and carrot, along with the juice of a lime and a bunch of chopped cilantro, served on warmed corn tortillas (the small soft ones).

Regardless, the bottom line is that spending on these programs is increasing at a much faster rate than GDP.  Unless structural changes are enacted (and not simply cuts), the growth of these programs will swamp our finances no matter what other changes we make.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt; Their reasoning mostly comes from their anger towards Israel. They believe that the Holocaust has become a political tool to justify Jews taking away Arab lands in Palestine in order for the creation of Israel.

   ...    				            

&gt;ding ding ding. don't bring too much of this sort of logic around here or they'll burn you at the stake. 

It's an assertion, not logic. And there's no evidence of this anyways.

I think the reason why they don't believe the Holocaust happened is because mainstream Muslims and Arabs tend to be conspiracy theorists. They bought into the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and European antisemitism. It has to do with a fear of Israel, not outrage. There's no evidence they care about Palestinian welfare either, they just enjoy being outraged. ","1354321181"

I mean bibers break up was huge news and all i could think was how do these adults report this without cracking up, reporting on a 18 year olds relationship lol. I would ask myself each time these thoughts crept up - Is there any proof that I should feel this way? Is this helping or hurting? 

If he was embarrassed he would of already left once he got exposure. I don't think you are wishing for him to fail but more so for things to not change. Maybe sit down and ask yourself how you would handle if he did leave you for a pretty rich girl? What if he cheated? Ask yourself what you would want to do sometimes it helps me to imagine a stressful situation and plan out how i would act and what i would say. And in the end if he does do those things just leave and be grateful you got away from it and wont end up in those crazy tabloids.

You are gonna have to make a real effort to start pushing these bad thoughts away and maybe a therapist might help. Remind yourself as long as he is treating you well and being a good boyfriend its better to reward him than push him away. If he does start to get more famous it would probably be a good idea to sit down and say hey things are going to change and I just want to discuss how we will handle them. Example  - a fan gives him a # do you want to know? how do you want him to handle that? Should he just throw it away or show you then throw it away?  Should he drink alcohol around fans that obviously have an attraction, what if a fan kisses him and he can't stop it and so on. You think the small stuff wont matter in situations but it does.

Below is the email I sent.

Mr. Boehner,

I am writing you this although I expect this will fall upon proverbial deaf ears. I am asking that you not continue the obstructionist politics that you have been perpetrating for the last four years. I find the political posturing of the house of representatives to be appalling. I ask that you allow democracy to prevail. We as a people voted  for the president because of the policies you refuse to negotiate. You recently accused the president of not making a ""fair and balanced"" approach. Yet, the only people I hear not willing to budge on their terms are the house legislators. Had districts not been redrawn, I doubt we would even be in the position we are. Sir, your stance was wrong during the last debt ceiling crisis and it continues to jeopardize those you are supposed to represent. How dare you Sir. Such audacity and reckless abandon to hold the American people hostage over your lack of diplomacy is unforgivable. Allow democracy to prevail. Do not balance the budget on the backs of those who have already been through too much. Step across the isle with a hand extended and do what your constituents elected you to do. Be a leader.

Sincerely,","1354321189"

By keeping them you lose the backpack space to store them and the immediacy of the metal they could form. There are currently 127 droppable weapons by my count so you likely won't be running out of backpack space unless you're loading up on crates (127 takes ~2.5 bp pages). As to the buying power, you can always pay in weapons or quickly scrap a few weapons if you're desperate for metal so keeping them in weapon form is not really a hindrance.

Until you don't have backpack space, I would keep the unique weapons. Honestly it keeps the game fresh to be able to swap out for a weapon you haven't played with in months (or ever) and experiment with it.","1354321193"

If a skilled worker has the money to support themselves for several months while they look for work, why not let them in?

The idea that you are protecting American jobs from migrant workers is ridiculous. Population growth equals economic growth. Economic growth equals job growth.

What happened was that back in March 2011 when the entire Arab Spring was happening (protesting in Egypt, Libya etc.) the civilians of Syria started to protest against the government of Assad. He was a very ruthless dictator and treated his civilians very poorly. Instead of compromising with the civilians who are protesting, Assad decides to get his police force (and eventually military) to start shooting at crowds of people. Hundreds of civilians (most likely thousands) were killed in the very first few months of the uprising. The first rebel group came from the individuals in the Army who decided they are going to refuse to shoot their own countries civilians over a protest and they defected to protect the civilians by fighting the Syrian army. Eventually other groups (terrorist cells, other army defectors, with support from Middle Eastern powers like SA)/civilians joined into the uprising and this is where we are to this day.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I don't think I have a firm enough grasp on what my life has meant to me yet to really answer this question well, but my grandfather had one of my personal favorite funeral songs ever.  His service ended with Lord of the Dance.  Every year we would take him to the Harvard Christmas Revels.  It's a Christmas pageant in Cambridge where every year they pick a region of the world and act out a series of skits and songs from the traditional Christmas/winter solstice celebrations of the region.  Regardless of the region though, every year to break for intermission they play Lord of the Dance and everyone dances out into the main lobby for the break.  Playing it at his funeral just really presented this poignant idea that this was just his intermission.  I'm not religious and I believe that when you die that's pretty much it, but the idea of a person's impact on their family and community lasting long after they themselves are gone is one I can totally support.  He was an incredibly impressive man and the idea might have been lost on me with someone else, but because of who he was I've held onto it since as one last nugget of wisdom he left before saying goodbye.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","The nail caps I've seen get chewed off too many times to recommend for any cat but it can be worth a try, and cat nails are incredibly easy to clip on your own. Of course you may need a partner at first to hold the kitty.

 Just have the other person hold the kitty upright with one hand scruffing it. (Don't worry it doesn't hurt, it immobilizes them to an extent and if the cat were to flip out its a good handle to get the cat safely to the floor. Also it gets control over their head, cat bites are very nasty) Then just clip off towards the base of the nail (where the nail starts getting significantly skinnier). Don't worry about making him bleed (If you do just put some flour on the tip of the nail to stop the bleeding) keep in mind you'll probably only need to clip the front nails. If you wanna do all, go for it.

 But get cocky (cuz you're the best, right?)and don't get worked up if he fights, you gotta be Fonzie and keep your cool because that helps your kitty not get scared. Same goes for whoever holds him. Whenever you notice him scratching the ottoman, clip the nails again. They grow out in about a week or two's time. Until then even if he continues going after the furniture, he shouldn't be able to do damage. Unless he's super determined to kill it, which he's probably not.","1354321211"

The manner of the TSA's operation doesn't jive with the fourth amendment, to wit:

Nor, as I stated already, does it jive with their own mission statement:
*""The Transportation Security Administration protects the nationâs transportation systems to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.""*

Freedom of movement is certainly not what comes to mind when pondering the wonderful job of security theater put on by our servants in the TSA.

I see you already tested lighting them. Unless you think you didn't provide enough voltage to test them (extremely dangerous as you may burn the thing for good), I feel that you might be out of luck. The only thing left to do is try to saw the thing down the middle to try to remove the top plate, and either examine the circuitry there or replace it with your own.

Edit: I'd like to add that at this point frying the circuitry inside is not a concern since there is no way to find a way to use it anyway, so doing what other users suggests in upping the voltage slowly might be the only option. Best case you get something to light, Medium case there is hidden circuitry and it fries (but that is of no concern to you), worst case the bulb lights for a second and burns out.","1354321223"

"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","So, you aren't going to find the One True Model that explains All Of Human Behavior, because humans are too complicated. My list of super useful, applied models, biased towards macro, is:

1. Smets-Wouters (2007) and Christiano-Eichenbaum-Evans (2005) are better than unrestricted VARs at explaining what happens in the economy after monetary policy shocks. 
2. Gertler-Karadi (2011) and Gertler-Kiyotaki (2010) are our best stylized models of financial crises. They're very new, though, and need some kinks worked out.
3. Krugman's work on international financial crises is top-notch. 

On the micro side,

1. Baron, Ferejohn, Austin-Banks, Smith, and a few others have spent two decades doing really exciting work on how legislatures operate, applying rational choice theory to political games. These are great models, because (imo) they accurately capture most of the first-order properties of the institutions they try to analyze.
2. Matching theorists (Roth, Sotomayor, Gale, Shapley, Sonmez, Unver) have developed important mechanisms that work when prices don't. 
3. Simple game theory does a surprisingly good job of describing people's behavior. You might see objections that it doesn't work ""in the lab."" That's a distraction. When the stakes are not five dollars but a marriage or a career, when the actors are not undermotivated first-year psychology students, when the people involved have time to think through their options and come to a conclusion, game theory and rational choice theory *work*.
4. The standard model - max U subject to budget constraints and information constraints - has a lot going for it.
5. As much as people whine and moan about the efficient markets hypothesis, the truth is that buying index funds remains the go-to standard for someone who isn't interested in pouring their heart and soul into technical analysis and day-trading.

Standard disclaimer: I'm biased, etc. I'm also not up-to-date on the political science literatures outside of political game theory, so my coverage of political models proper is necessarily limited.","1354321224"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Oh, definitely. But I had an interesting time there. I didn't keep a journal, so it's faded. This would have been around 2006.

Was there with a guy who liked to photograph old, abandoned industrial sites. Kind of urban archaeology. We tried to get into what looked like an abandoned flour mill. Being ignorant Canadian tourists we had no idea what was in the area. Turns out the flour mill was [this place](http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM77DF_Lazerland_Invercargill_New_Zealand). The owner caught us on camera, and came out to see what the commotion was. When we came across it, either that art wasn't on the outside or we didn't notice it in the dark.

I'm a small man, and the guy I was with (whose name I've since forgotten) was tall, but had an obviously big camera with him. Anyway, long story short, instead of calling the police the guy gave us a tour, and we ended up spending a couple nights in the mill on the second floor where he'd set up a rec room, once he found out we were sleeping in the guy's car/camping. 

Later I stayed at a hostel, where the folks let me stay for free in exchange for housekeeping duties as I was out of money. Took a couple temp jobs around town to get money together to continue my travels.","1354321241"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt; do you see Africans or Whites committing atroticities today en masse?

Israel. And a couple decades ago, the Soviet Union. The only reason it doesn't happen as much is because it's not profitable any more. If it were still profitable, white people would still do it. We actually outsource our slave labor to Thailand and Bangladesh in order to make precisely the self-gratifying argument that you're making.

&gt; That's because WESTERN culture is ""hostile"" and ""War-like""? 

We're just more clever about it these days. We claim it's for the sake of national security, so we invade countries like Iraq, claiming they have weapons of mass destruction, which they never did. Really, we just want better access to their oil. We bombed Libya to aid in a tiny uprising, but we're not helping Syria who is going through a much worse situation. Why? Because we care about oil and natural resources; not human dignity like you seem to be claiming.

&gt; if Whites are so evil, if our culture is so war like and oppressive, why can't brown people stop coming here by the boatload?

You don't seem to know much about early 20th century history. We're the ones who fucked their shit up. From roughly the 1600s to the late 1800s, the Middle East consisted predominantly of quiet farming villages. Then the West discovered oil there and got our hands dirty. We struck up civil wars and sided with extremists, putting them in power, making dirty deals. This happened largely in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and [my favorite example: Iran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup).

So they come here by the boatload in order to escape the terrible conditions which we instigated in their regions.

Notice the state that Turkey is in. Turkey emerged from the Ottoman Empire, and was never subject to Western meddling, because they already had a well-developed ""Western-style"" civilization. There was never a chance for us to meddle in their affairs, and because of it, they're doing quite well.

&gt; jungle mind set that pervades Haiti, Detroit, New York, Somalia and wherever you find large amounts of blacks.

Aw yeah, because New York is totally in poor condition. All those Wall Street brokers are just swinging on vines. And Detroit's issues certainly have nothing to do with our WHITE WESTERN car companies getting TROUNCED by the EAST ASIAN (Japanese and Korean) car companies. Nah, that can't have anything to do with it.

"drums","t5_2qie5","With these kits, just think about what you're getting:

Both come with cymbal stands (2 or 3), snare stands, throne, pedal, hi-hat stand (and the WHD even comes with sticks!). I don't mean to sound like a snob, but they are beginner's kits. They don't seem right for someone looking to perform and record with a band. The hardware and accessories they both come with are probably worth around Â£150-200 (assuming their acceptable, if not good quality). This means tour getting around Â£300 worth of NEW drums, which is not a lot AT ALL. 

Can you salvage anything from your current kit? Any hardware? If you have hardware to keep, check out shell packs that are just the bass and toms. If your budget is Â£600, spend Â£350-400 on shells and Â£200-250 on the snare. DO NOT SCRIMP ON THE SNARE.  

The best principle is to go to a drum shop and try something out. Don't commit to buying until you find something you love the sound, look and feel of. If you chose badly, you'll hate playing it. Chose wisely, and you'll never look back. Also, as a rule it's worth buying your shell pack separately from your snare. It's not uncommon to pay the same for snare as for the rest of the drums, but you will really notice the difference between a snare that comes with a new kit and a snare sold on its own.

I would strongly recommend looking around the second hand market - you'd be surprised what people will part with! I recently bought a new kit for exactly the same purpose as you (plus I'm tired of having to move my practice kit for every gig I play). I found a 1993 Premier Artist Series Maple kit, hand built in the UK. It was a 4 piece shell kit and cost Â£200. I added new hardware (mostly Big Dog), skins and a Gretsch snare. All in cost Â£600ish. 

Good luck, and post an update when your done!","1354321247"

You can imagine someone pulling the rug out from under you... the only thing you are going to do at first, is try to catch your balance.

Even if the things you say make sense, *there is really no way to speed this process up.* It takes time. He is getting major negative feed back and when you come back at him right away with more points, it does not help him get *there* one bit faster, because he hasn't had time to 'contain all the feels.'
___________________________
Of course you *basically* know all that, and it's exactly why you made specific mention of the fact that Molyneux *is still* all the good things that he is, that is the ultimate conclusion you are trying to lead him to... there just isn't really a shortcut all the way there. If there is I haven't figured it out yet.

But the good news is that you can accomplish more with less effort, that is, after making a few points you can just say, ""I understand that this is a lot to process."" And then let time do the work.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","It's exactly the same as intervals inside the octave but the number is 7 higher for each octave (octave is a somewhat silly name since it spans 7 notes rather than 8, but whatever).  A perfect 11th is a perfect fourth above an octave.  An augmented 13th is an augmented 6th above an octave.  Exactly the same.

In chords, though, it doesn't exactly work this way.  You can imagine an extended chord as a tall stack of thirds: the 1, the 3, the 5, the 7, the 9, the 11, the 13.  This is all of the notes in the scale, since the 15th is two octaves, but you can theoretically keep going as far as you want.  In our system of music theory, we like to think of all chords as stacks of thirds, just rearranged or with notes missing.  So a C7 might be C G Bb E, and C9 could be C Bb D E.  Technically a chord like G13 would be G B D F A C E, but you're more likely to find it voiced G F B E instead, in a different order with stuff missing.  They're still *named* with the 9's, 11's, and 13's, but for all intents and purposes, you can consider them actually 2's, 4's, and 6's, respectively.  So if you see Cadd9, that's a C major chord with an added D, the 9th (also known as the 2nd; it doesn't matter what octave you put it in).  Why not just C9?  Because that would include the *minor* 7th (because that's the convention; if you want the major 7th, it's CM9 or Cmaj9 or Câ9), and the composer clearly wants no notes other than C, D, E, G.

So, to summarize: when you're talking about notes, a minor 9th is an octave plus a minor second.  When you're talking about chords, a minor 9th is exactly the same as a minor 2nd.  Make sense?","1354321259"

But in my third year of university I started noticing my anxiety affecting my actions, like I avoided taking a seminar class that sounded awesome because I would have to present to students older than me.  I also would start to lose my breath and get a trembly voice whenever I was expressing something that I felt was important.  My heart would start racing and my chest would be full of pressure if I even thought of situations that made me anxious.  I had a couple of panic attacks too, so I decided to try the medication route.   I am on cipralex now and things are pretty good.  I'm a lot calmer, and with CBT I am getting better at expressing myself and stuff.  Some of the sexual side effects blow for a lot of this medication but for me it hasn't been that bad.  It really is worth looking into though if your anxiety is effecting your life considerably.  I can only speak for my case of course but I've only noticed positive imporovements, I was scared of like ""becoming different"" or whatever but nothing about me's changed besides my comfort level with social situations and my calmness level in general.  hope this helps.","1354321264"

You can't equate the two.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I have had 3 people act shocked when I revealed I am an atheist this week. 

I am nearly 25, college degree, have a career in the military, etc, so I am not exactly worried about being disowned or fired. I don't start arguments with our chaplain, I have no issues with PRIVATE religion...

But this last weekend, my father decided to drop the line ""atheists have no morals"". No idea why. Cue back pedaling when I told him I don't believe in a god. 

Just today, our chaplain assistant at work was talking about ""moral leadership"" classes, and how ""see, atheists have no morals because..."". I stopped him right there and said, ""now wait, you've known me for almost two years. Did you know I am an atheist?"". He was shocked. I go out of my way to help people, donate, volunteer etc, and he goes ""well, where did you get those morals?"". To be honest? From recognizing how to treat people right. It's innate. I was not raised with religion or in church. I went to church for my own education a bit in HS, but left it when the preacher condemned homosexuals.

Since realizing my lack of belief, I have become a BETTER person - to me, we have no heaven, no hell, no accountability... So why not use this time here to help make other people's time here good? 

That chaplain assistant was very shocked to meet a ""reasonable atheist"". I suspect he has never actually met or talked to an atheist, similar with my father, who was talking about how ""fucked up"" atheists are but couldn't name one he knew besides me. ","1354321267"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Like I said in my original comment, I acknowledged it was for a cheaper bike overall. And of course the CBR250RR lacks power below 6k RPM or lower. It would be silly to think the powerband of the engine extends the whole rev range. I don't think how much cylinders a bike has actually reflects on the maintenance time and cost. Getting to the valves takes the most time, not the actual valve work. You'll probably never need to replace any of the head unless you're constantly revving the hell out of it. And all that nice stuff is just KTM's way of swinging the average joe to buy their bike. Are Brembo's seriously that much better than the brakes on competing bikes? The quality of the suspension only really is important for track use as well (Setting sag and whatnot, which I guarantee many people haven't done). The reason KTM has all those fancy parts is so they're not Japanese in anyway, after all, the big four Japanese brands is their main competition. I'm not saying the 390 is a bad bike; Just there are better ones out there in my opinion. Everytime there is slow, relatively small displacement bike posted here, people go nuts over it with so much fanfare. ","1354321269"

"VictoriaBC","t5_2rbsy","As you probably have figured out already from other postings the issue is not Shaw or even the router, it is an issue with wifi in apt buildings. When you have 17 other access points all with decent signal you are going to have a bad time.   
The best advice would be to try the 5Ghz band instead of the 2.4Ghz band. The 5Ghz band is not used as much, its signals don't propagate as well and there is many more channels so you are likely going to be much better off.  
The only issue is  that the 5Ghz band is not as widely supported so it may not work for your devices. Wired would obviously be much better.   
I have used this wireless router from Shaw before, it is just fine, nothing special but does the trick. The only way you MIGHT see some improvements on the 2.4Ghz is by moving to a $150 plus wireless router, and that is only maybe.   
There are some other possibilities, but I would try the 5Ghz band first and see how it goes.   
Changing the channel might also help, channels 1,6 and 11 are the best as the don't overlap, but your case there is no really good choice. But you may find that some are more active then others.   
Good luck","1354321274"

"surfing","t5_2qmde","You can duck dive a longboard.  It's a slightly different technique.  Instead of forcing the deck straight down, push harder on one rail, and make a kind of scooping motion, using the water to hold the board under.  

However, you should not be riding an 8'6 gun in ten foot surf.  I'm 6'2 210 and ride a 7'4 until it hits twenty feet plus (faces).

Anxiety is a real bitch, I can relate to you on this. I actually went to the E.R. for a panic attack and got prescribed Paxil. (I'm now off and better than before.)
It's all about the wiring in your brain. You can fix the anxiety by just changing how you see things.

Think of it this way:

* You're a college freshman
* You want to be happy
* You know it's not a walk in the park

Time management helps out a LOT.
Start off by planning out how you're going to spend the next hour or two.
Have homework? Baby steps, write down your goals.

Have to study for a test for next week? Start out today. Read a chapter, go over it, write down a few key things here and there.

You're still trying even though the semester is closing, at least you're not giving up. **KEEP TRYING.**

&gt; You want to be happy

You want something? Go for it. You have to fucking realize that the only person stopping yourself, is you.

Getting rid of technology may or may not be the right direction.
Personally I use technology to my advantage. I use my phone to keep track of things I have to do throughout the day. Tasks, reminders, bills, etc.

Maybe there isn't a point, maybe there is. There's only one way of finding out and that's if you fucking try.

"hardware","t5_2qh18","&gt; 1950s are ancient.

I recently bought a PowerEdge 1950 off eBay which only had two 10K drives (the other two were fake inserts). I took two Samsung 830s and modified the fake drive inserts to use the 830s, pushed them in, put them in RAID 0, and watch in awe of the newly found speed.   

For $525, I have an 8 core server, 16GB of ECC RDIMMs, 256GB of SAS 10k RAID 1 and 256GB of SSD RAID 0, with dual power supplies.    It is hard to bet that price/performance with quality-hardware still.

I did benchmark the SSDs and they are definitely limited by the IO, but for home dev-server use, it is great.

I am a little pissed by the 1950 only having x8 half-length PCIe, so I couldn't upgrade the video (25 watts is not enough for any video cards out there).","1354321289"

- this could be a great time in life take some electives that you were always interested in, party a bit more than usual, focus a bit more on the opposite sex (my preference)- this is the route I took and I have no regrets

- if your major isn't really business oriented ( not sure about math), then I'd recommend you try to get some value out of that last $25K. Take a few relevant classes-  information technology, management, marketing, computer science, engineering , public speaking,  project-based classes that m

-  if it's not too late , take on a project-based extra curricular...solar car, consulting club for non-profits

- read a few books -  see the books thread in this subreddit.  Read the minto principle, although for a book on communication, it's actually not an easy read 

- regarding the excel/ms office skills-   If you haven't already mastered these by growing up with ms office in school.... then you are confirming my belief in how ineffective our education system is in building relevant skills to help grow the global economy.

"applehelp","t5_2rfbh","Crucial is a fine brand, but other equally fine alternatives do exist. In my experience I've found G.skill RAM to be the cheapest with the most/highest reviews, and have had great success using their RAM in many builds.

That said, try not to get too hooked up on brands. Find something with a number of positive reviews with a price that fits your needs.

I like to use a site like [PC Part Picker](http://pcpartpicker.com/parts/memory/#R=5,4&amp;s=301333&amp;t=9&amp;n=2&amp;z=8192,16384&amp;xcx=0&amp;sort=d7) to pull pricing data from the major e-tailers to get a big picture look at my choices.

As you can see from that link, the 16GB G.skill kit has the best price/GB ratio, but if you prefer to stick with 8GB then the Muskin or Crucial kits might prove to be a better deal. Note that the number of reviews shown on that site aren't necessarily representative of all website reviews - you might click on RAM with 13 reviews and find that that same set has 200 reviews on NewEgg alone. Still, it helps to point you in the right direction.

EDIT: also note that, if a site doesn't list shipping prices, it probably costs you something, otherwise it would say 'Free s/h'.","1354321291"

It was annoying fuck out of me and I couldn't get out of bed, so I was trying to shift the IV dolly, and at one point I overextended and the cannula came out.  Blood starts pissing out of the wound for about 5 seconds until I realise how much is coming out and I apply pressure.  The nurses came and patched me up and put the cannula in again, and all was good.  One nurse stayed behind cleaning the blood off the floor.

I noticed she was retching.  I asked what was wrong.  She told me ""I'm haemophobic.  I'm actually on the point of a panic attack.""  I apologised profusely, then asked her if she had really chosen the right career path.  She said yes, emphatically.  The only thing about nursing she couldn't stand was seeing blood.","1354321295"

It seems not to affect you, but the act of having to put down your tablet and go get your laptop is annoying. Even if you have them both with you, you have to find a place to put away your tablet, then get your laptop out, turn it on, and then you can start using it. Whereas with the Surface you just switch to the desktop and flip out the touch cover if you need it. It may not be a big hassle but it is just more convenient.

One thing that I didn't understand was that you are saying that tablets are the future. Then shouldn't you be happy that MS is making a tablet that is as powerful and as capable as a laptop? MS is taking a step in making the laptop obsolete. Basically MS is taking a desktop and making it as small as a tablet, while Apple and Google are taking a smartphone and making it as capable as a desktop. We both believe that tablets are the future, we just differ in which approach we believe will get us there best.

And here, if I want to go to a private hospital, I still have that option.

With universal healthcare and free education at all levels, I have much more satisfaction and time to pursue the freedoms of life that you Americans hold so dear. I want the government to regulate environmental policies because I want a better world for me and the next generations. It is always better to make a better world. I can enjoy my freedoms better. The same with public transport and welfare. 

Of course, any system can collapse. But it doesn't have to. Checks and balances can be provided by two opposing philosophies, implemented whenever one is about to break down. It has happened in history.

There is no electoral outcome that would prove this, as a properly counted electoral outcome is a free and fair election. There is no combination of votes for particular candidates, or any combination of results from a free and fair election that could constitute removal of consent.

Complete and total voter fraud perpetrated by the government would have to be the deciding factor- that votes were made and not counted, people were prevented from voting, the result was ignored in favor of another of the government's choosing, etc.","1354321314"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","It would help if we had an idea of your current skill.  I'll assume you're familiar with the basic mechanics and are capable of at least moving around undetected.  If not, worry about that instead of anything else I'm about to say.

The most basic strategy I can offer is to aim for distracted targets.  If they're focused on something else, they're not watching their back.  This is different from simply not focusing on you, since a lone player has nothing stopping them from turning around and noticing you.

Your most important target is always the Medic, if there's one in the first place.  Following that are Engineers and Snipers since you're usually the best equipped to reach them.  Heavies, Soldiers, and Demomen tend to populate the front lines and all run slower than you, but they'll kill you pretty fast if you're caught.  Scouts, Pyros, and enemy Spies are all secondary targets at best; Scouts run too fast to pursue, Pyros are your counter, and you usually won't cross paths with other Spies.  (Spy vs. Spy duels are a sight to behold though, or perhaps not if they spend most of their time cloaked.)

It's also important to recognize when it's time to use a different class.  Spy is mostly psychological, and enemies are more than capable of adapting to your tricks.  If you start becoming less effective, either mix up your strategy or change classes to something more suited to the situation.  Demoman in particular is excellent at clearing out Sentry nests that a Spy may find difficult to penetrate.  (Read: Anything with a pet Pyro.)

This is all in general.  If you need any item/class/map specific tips, you'll need to specify.","1354321318"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","Massive Spoilers: 
To start, the Manhattan Projects is a government program whose described job is to create nuclear bombs. What they really do is more complex. Among other things, their work involves portals to other worlds and advanced alien life forms. The comic includes characters such as Albert Einstein, Joseph Oppenheimer, FDR, Lt. General Leslie Groves, Harry Truman, and Yuri Gagarin. The time frame for the story is probably around the 1940s-1950s. 

Starting from issue #1, Groves recruits Robert Oppenheimer into the Manhattan Projects. [](#s ""He is later revealed to be Joseph Oppenheimer, Robert's psychotic twin, who has killed and consumed Robert. "") When Oppenheimer is brought to the project facility, the Japanese launch an attack via a Torri, which is a two-way portal powered by a person's life force. They send robot samurais into the facility via the portal to try and kill all of the American scientists. However, their plan fails and the Americans gain control of the Torri and use it for their own means. They also manage to capture the Death Buddhists who were powering the Torii. Albert Einstein is introduced and is seen staring at a large rectangular block in the shape of a door. At the start of issue #2, Wernher von Braun and Richard Feyman are introduced. Von Braun is part of the German science team working underneath Hitler, and is shown as having a robotic arm. Feyman reaches the American facility, where he is given orders to take Einstein along with him to Los Alamos by way of the Torii, which is being powered by the Death Buddhists' life energy. When they get to Los Alamos, more scientists are introduced, including the irradiated scientist, Harry Daghlian, and the alien Enrico Fermi. Feyman then gets sent to Germany to acquisition any German scientist of use. He reaches Oberammergau, the German Science Stronghold, with the help of U.S. ground forces, only to find that most of the German scientists killed themselves, leaving only Wernher von Braun, who agrees to work with the Americans. It's shown that one German scientist escapes, only to be captured by the Russians later on. Wernher begins working on a spaceship for the Americans. Groves and the scientists receive knowledge that FDR has passed away, and Truman (who is a complete nutjob in the comic) is called to be sworn into office. FDR's body is brought to the project facility, where the scientists hook him up to an AI construct. This creates an AI with the memories of FDR, depicted as a large television screen with FDR's face. Truman, who was left in the dark on the Manhattan Projects, receives a call from General Groves, who asks for orders to drop a nuclear bomb on Japan from the Enola Gay. Truman does not give the order, but Groves pretends to not hear him anyways and lets the bomb drop. In issue #4, Groves, Oppenheimer, and a German and Russian official, are seen in New Mexico awaiting the scheduled arrival of aliens, which occurs once every decade. The aliens that do arrive, however, are not the ones they were expecting. This new species of aliens tells Groves that they killed and consumed the previous alien species, gaining all their knowledge. They also tell Groves that he has something (the door Einstein was staring at, called ""A Pulling Way"") that they need. A flashback occurs, revealing that Einstein created the door after he dreamed about it. He opens the door, revealing another Einstein (I'll call him Einstein #2) on the other side. Einstein #2 attacks the original, knocking him out and dragging him through the door, leaving him on the other side while Einstein #2 takes his place. Feyman is recruited by Einstein #2, who has no knowledge on how to open the door, to work on getting it open, which he achieves within a few minutes. This gives them the ability to travel in between worlds. Meanwhile, Oppenheimer and Groves kill the aliens they met in New Mexico. Oppenheimer and Groves are the lone survivors of the incident, and Oppenheimer consumes one of the alien bodies and gains its knowledge in the process. He reveals that the aliens are part of a collective hivemind, meaning that all the aliens of that species know what happened. At Los Alamos, the scientists come up with a plan to travel to that alien's planet in order to prevent an alien invasion of Earth. Feyman reveals the interplanetary portal to the rest of the team, making Einstein #2 regret not killing Feyman after he opened the door. Three scientists travel through: the irradiated Daghlian, Fermi, and one other scientist. They all wear space suits, which Daghlian has on all the time since his irradiated existence poses a threat to everyone. The other scientist's suit is compromised, but the atmosphere is breathable. They attempt to bargain with the aliens (called the Siill), but when that fails, the other scientist breaks Daghlian's suit, irradiating and killing himself, the Siill hivemind leader, and thus all the other Siill in existence. Issue #7 ends with the American scientists contact the Russian science team and set up a deal, working together to expand into the universe. The Russian and American governments, however, don't like this and an attempt is made by troops stationed at Los Alamos to stop the American scientists Daghlian and Fermi from leaving. They shoot Fermi, who then turns from his human form into his alien form and kills the squad before leaving with Daghlian.

Just about the only thing they still have is that small amount of control.  Some people call it *dignity* but it's really not.  Their ship is sinking, the mast is broken, deck is swamped, rudder is smashed, but they cling on with both hands the wheel and scream into the storm that they are in control of their destiny even as the horizon rises like a watery veil over their eyes.  Whatever rules, big or small, they have to follow to get a night in a cot, a bowl of food, some bit of clothing, they all chafe at their imagined dignity.  Small and decrepit as it is, it is really all they have and they can obsess over it.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Have you talked to anyone at school about this? Have you been on academic probation and is this your last chance? 

If you haven't talked to anyone, then you should definitely talk to the dean of students. The rules/guidelines can be tweaked for extenuating circumstances. If you follow the published rules and don't talk to anyone, you will get kicked out. If you talk to someone beforehand then it could really help and change things completely. 

Also talk to your professors, most are on your side and want you to succeed. Ask for extended deadlines or anything you need to pass. If you don't communicate, they'll assume you don't care. If you are struggling, they'll be willing to help. 

You may want to withdraw (medical leave of absence)  from all your classes right now and go back next semester. Your GPA won't be affected and you won't be kicked out. But you'll graduate a little late. Don't feel bad about this, I know so many people who took a term off to deal with problems and you aren't judged for it. A little time could help, even if it's extending your winter break. 

You should look into counseling. Your college probably offers a number of sessions each term for free. Take advantage of this while you can! 

Don't give up, you can do this! Sorry that I don't have more comforting words. I struggled with depression all through college too, so I understand. Good luck! I hope things get better for you. ","1354321332"

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","I go through a lot of the same things as you too! However I have been in therapy for 6 years with a 1 year break. I think anxiety can form from a lot of different things that we go through. I've also been dealing with suicidal urges for close to over a decade now, and it really is a shitty way to go through life. Sometimes even if you tell healthcare and mental health professionals about it they don't even really care as long as you aren't currently at risk. I have suicidal urges nearly daily, but I can't act on them so they end up being ignored.

I live in Canada, and have all my life, so I'm sorry I can't give any suggestions on the cost of meds/therapy front, but it could be worth looking to see if there are any local programs that can help low-income students with healthcare costs and medication.

I really know how hard it can be to take that first step, especially if you're a student and you have a heavy workload. Things can be so easily put off, but things are almost assured to get worse if you leave it like it is. 

I struggle too with my medication and I always have. I know how it can feel a bit demeaning to have to rely on pills, and even if the doctor always assures you they're non-habit forming, it still feels like there's a risk. I also don't know how common it is for other people, but I was on Paxil for five years or so and then it suddenly stopped working. But I think that even if it does stop working and wears off, if it was helping in the first place then it was worth it. Pills won't completely help with anxiety or depression but they can help give you that little extra push to make it through.

Sorry about my walls of text, but I feel like I have a huge amount of information to share, and I keep thinking of new things to put in. I've been in and out of outpatient programs, and through more therapists than I would like to admit, so I feel like I know a lot about the whole process and that I should pass it on. I keep relating things to myself since it's sort of a way to own your statements and it's usually better to say ""I've been through x and I felt it was y"" than ""x is y"" since it's harder for people to argue (and some of them will).

Anxiety can be an evil, sickly monster and I wish you luck with dispelling yours! Just try and keep in mind that it's rarely if ever an over-night thing and that these things take time and a lot of work. Good luck!","1354321340"

Does this mean that the value of gas isn't actually jacked up price? Sure. But the value of gas doesn't matter and the only thing that matters is what people are willing to pay.  
  
I don't know why you keep insisting that the price of an item should be what it's worth. It's like, you want a perfect economy but that's asking for the impossible. Let people bid whatever they want.

Walk on sidewalks. If sidewalks are not available, walk on the edge of the road or on the left shoulder of the road, facing the traffic flow. Use pedestrian bridges when they are available.

http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/TN/htm/TN.552.htm

Sec. 552.006.  USE OF SIDEWALK.  (a)  A pedestrian may not walk along and on a roadway if an adjacent sidewalk is provided and is accessible to the pedestrian.
(b)  If a sidewalk is not provided, a pedestrian walking along and on a highway shall if possible walk on:
(1)  the left side of the roadway;  or

"Python","t5_2qh0y","That's an interesting approach, thanks for open sourcing it. It's always interesting to see how people solve this problem and i'm betting there is a ton of wasted effort because everyone has to roll something like this once you get to a certain size and complexity.

I solved the same problem in a similar way, my settings dir has an ""available"" directory in it with all the settings files for all environments (so database.production.py, database.staging.py, database.foobar.py, paths.production.py, paths.... you get the idea)

My deployment code includes fabric tasks to configure the code by symlinking settings files from available into the settings folder.

So I can do things like:
    fab config:production
to set production settings or a more complex configuration like:
    fab config:spider,production,database=foobar
which uses the spider settings files if found, the production settings as a fallback for settings that do not have a spider variant and specifically sets the database settings to the database.foobar.py file.

It's very useful to be able to switch a specific setting in my dev environment (or even in production in an emergency) with a fab config:setting=environment command line command. And it's perfectly scriptable as well.

I made the django part stupid (no magic in __init__, it just imports what it should) and the fabric part smart so that I got the needed functionality while still keeping things as simple files and symlinks, which my debian using days taught me was a powerful pattern for configuration file management.

As someone who has thought about it and went a different way I'd be interested in hearing the pros and cons you've found with your way of doing it.

I should open source my system as well, this was a good prompt to do that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah I will say that the applications of trigonometry in trades mostly relates to being able to do calculations with the basic functions of Sine, Cosine, and Tangent as well as the inverses. Further study of trig extending into things like identities (which I actually never did until college) aren't really useful until Calculus as far as I'm aware.

Also I will say that trig is quite a deep subject. I never really learned trig well until I got into Statics. I mean yes I did trig well enough in high school and had I not gone into engineering I'd probably be saying ""yeah I know trig."" However after kind of living and breathing trig as part of physics I can say now that trig does take quite a bit to really understand.

Another thing I'll point out is that we live in a physical world. As a matter of personal opinion I'll say that having a good mathematical understanding of the world we live in might in fact be of far more utility than advanced knowledge in abstract algebra such as Linear Programming, Matrix Math, and solving systems of equations.","1354321347"

I don't know what your budget is, but some random ideas:

- do you know her Hebrew name? You can get it in a necklace in some nice Hebrew scripts

- I love most things from moderntribe.com though it may not be her taste

- is she into nature? You can plant a tree in Israel and receive a certificate in her honor

- you can get a mezuzah made in Israel or by an Israeli artist for her to hang on her doorpost

- if she likes Disney princesses, this is a cute necklace: http://www.moderntribe.com/judaica/jewish_jewelry/jewelry/mirror_mirror_necklace

- a dreidel from Israel if she doesn't have one already (they have a different letter on it than ones outside of Israel)

- you can get an art print or a photograph of Israel or by a Jewish artist

- does she have a set of candleholders for use on Shabbat? You can get some really nice traveling set (meaning they hold tea lights) that you think match her style.

If you write back with a few more details about her out of Judaism, I can probably find a Jewish connection for you if none of the above strike your fancy.

Also, Chanukah is about the Jewish people holding on to their Judaism.  It is about not giving in to the larger forces around us that make it hard or difficult or different being Jewish.  Even when they destroyed our holiest of places and tried to keep us down... we survived, we rebuilt, we held on to our Judaism.  When I dated a non-Jew, the only thing I really wanted from him was respect for my Judaism and how it was a big part of me.  I wanted him to share the holiday with me... not just say ""it's nice.""  Nice can mean lots of things--it's what you say about the boring lecture you just sat through and the tough, dry meat your friend's mother just served you for dinner.  

Maybe research a latke recipe or sufganiyot recipe and buy the ingredients to make and share together.  Ask her to explain how we light the candles and what the brachot mean.  Ask her about her memories of Chanukah growing up. Ask her if she's ever had some difficulty in America being Jewish, or if she's felt ""Other."" Maybe learn a few songs.  Chanukah is really, in all honesty, a VERY MINOR holiday for us.  It is only big in America to try to put a lid on Christmas just a little bit.  When Purim, Pesach, Shavuot come around in the spring... continue to show interest and respect for what my Judaism means to me... and I'd be puddy in your pocket.","1354321355"
"electrohouse","t5_2ry9g","I can't help but think that everyone here needs to see that this video is, at it's core, a commercial. Most people don't have the same opinion as us EDM heads who have watched every deadmau5 interview and listened to every extended cut of almost every track he's released. This is just catering to the masses, hence the ridiculous light setup and the badly made short cuts and remixes of his most recent popular tracks. Maybe Nokia intended for the lighting to look like crazy christmas lighting to promote more holiday sales of their phone, who knows? 

I think the more people step away from this video as electro-house fans and see it as a way to bring attention to a new phone, the better. The video's cool in my eyes, it's a pretty well-orchestrated merging of technology mediums, and if I were Joel, I would be stoked to get a shit ton of free, brand new phones and a lot of money from a big company. However, I'm not Joel, and I don't think I would have let a commercial featuring me end up looking and sounding like this, but that may be the reason why my tracks on soundcloud have hundreds of plays and Joel's have hundreds of thousands.

Otherwise, the comparison with Wall Street is a silly argument intended to provoke an emotional response.  The problem with prosecuting these executives was always the high bar necessary to prove *criminal* fraud -- so instead they opted for the much more accessible target of *civil* fraud.  Most of these cases have been resolved acceptably.   It's a political question of what *can* be done, not what *ought* to be done.  Unfortunately with the statute of limitations on fraud, even if new evidence comes to light to prove there was criminally fraudulent behavior, it's likely no one will ever be prosecuted.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","This is a very generalized and misguided point of view, don't take this as a direct attack but I am assuming you are not a cat person? 

Starting from just personal examples, the cat I own is a rescue from a shelter and he has a very strong loyal streak.  He will come when I call, even if someone else is petting him in the house, and will not go outside even if I leave every door in the house open.  Even people whom he has gotten very accustomed to (my roommate for example) will often say how crazily dedicated he is to me.

In a more broad sense, cats are more independent than dogs on average yes but they are still pack animals at their base.  They also can be completely content to set up in a territory that they feel is their own and guard that like a home.  Social contact is extremely important to cats (try adopting a kitten from any reputable shelter after telling them that the cat will be home alone for large amounts of the day, a good one would not allow you to take it home), but you are correct that just because he loves others does not mean that the neighbors do not treat him well.

TL:DR; Cats also tend to be pack animals with similar needs to a dog, just because one is more independent does not mean that they eschew all contact.","1354321364"

Really though, there'd be cost overruns by Boeing anyway. The companies are sort of just fighting over integration naming rights. In the end so many parts get subcontracted out that all of the companies are involved.

Beyond that, in the end it's the fault of the military for putting so many requirements on the project. I bet if the F-35B STOVL variant wasn't commissioned the project would probably be doing okay. Similarly, if they hadn't advertised future-cool helmet integrated display they would stop wasting engineering on it.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","There is a lot of boilerplate code with Java (I.e, code necessary to make your program function). This is why online courses that aim to teach you programming don't touch it - there is just too much extra fluff needed.

For example, hello world in Java:

    public class HelloWorld {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(""Hello, World"");
        }

    }

Compared to Ruby:

    puts ""Hello, world!""

The reason Hricle stated is also a valid reason why online courses don't use Java. Interpreted languages just have that 'instant turn around' satisfaction.

Then all of a sudden Bolt comes out of nowhere and destroys the record effortlessly and proceeds to destroy it again. The competition has even rose to the occasion (somewhat).

I know no one besides Carl Lewis has accused Bolt of taking anything (mainly because of his size which is stupid since plenty of big guys before couldn't run this fast) and I'd like to believe he's drug-free but has anyone ever even been close to the improvement Usain Bolt made in relation to the competition?

I only ask that you keep one thing in mind: this story is about a group of very prominent footballers who object to holding an international tournament in Israel on human rights grounds.

They have every right to that opinion, and that opinion, whether or not you agree with it, is entirely valid.

I'm not blaming the conflict on anyone because to try to do so would be  pointless. There is more than enough blame to go around as far back in history as you want to go.

I do, however, happen to agree with these players. 

I do not believe that the current Israeli government is an honest partner for peace, and I do not believe Israel should be hosting a major international tournament as long as they maintain an occupation and blockade over a large population of stateless refugees.

Hamas, as I said, are bad people. But someone else's crimes do not give me, you, or anyone else the right to act in ways equally criminal.

Again, to be clear: I'm not calling anyone 'right' or 'wrong' in this conflict. I *am* saying that until this appalling situation is approached with a sincere desire for a just and equitable peace, that hosting a tournament like this in Israel is not appropriate. This is my opinion, and I accept that others have other opinions.","1354321382"

No, I'm not.


&gt;Once a woman is pregnant, she is in control of what's in her body. It's simple and easy to understand.

Then why are you saying that my sperm isn't mine once it leaves my body?

&gt;If you think you've been duped, you don't have recourse to force an abortion any more than she could force you to have a vasectomy.

Never argued that point here.

&gt;Find one verified case of a woman impregnating herself through rape... and if you find one, compare that to the statistics for how many times you and your buddies date rape their female friends and pass on whatever rot lives in your tiny penises. You really are a ridiculous and pathetic lot...

It's not about how many times one happens compared to the other, its about when it does happen. I'm not going to sit here and tell you women don't get raped more than men, what I'm going to tell you though is that it does happen.

&gt;Moron's like you are the reason online communities have the deserved reputation as being misogynist and ignorant. Your sperm, your baby, your bill....

Correct, it was my sperm, and if it was STOLEN from me then why the fuck should I pay someone for stealing from me? 

You're such a troll its ridiculous, why don't you step down from your high horse and realize that YOU came HERE to ARGUE. You hear opinions that you don't like and you start insulting people. I'm sorry that I think that I shouldn't have to pay child support if I was raped. If you were raped, and didn't get an abortion but wanted to give the child to the father I guarantee you wouldn't think you had to pay child support either, even though you didn't opt for getting an abortion. 

Why you're even in this subreddit baffles me. It's probably to troll and get a rise out of people. Congrats, you got a rise out of me. Now please leave :]

When you actually consider it, if the majority of people spent their time reading instead of getting drunk every weekend, the world would likely be a better place because people would be able to think more critically and discourse would be more informative.

As for attention-seeking, everyone who uses social media for any purpose other than actually conversing with someone is seeking attention when you get down to it.  We want people to ""like"" what we're doing, or comment on our photos.  The content doesn't matter.  I'm not defending the guy posting about what he's reading.

This crime, in my opinion, stems from disrespect and immaturity. It is a poorly thought out ""prank."" Now, please don't think I'm saying that this isn't an offense.

There was an episode of ""The Cosby Show"" where the teen girl and brother go to a party, and the brother keeps her away from a douche-guy she wanted to meet.

When they got home, she complained to the parents, and the brother explained he was protecting her. She replied that if she had been allowed to talk to douche-guy, she would have figured it out pretty fast, and then spent the rest of the party time trying to meet someone else who *might* have been a winner.

I had to agree, at the very least she was trying to overtly interact with guys, and one at a time. Guys don't take hints, and if you ""open yourself up"" to a guy, but he isn't interested ion you...he just saved you weeks of ""dropping hints"", and you can move on to other options that may actually pay off.

Gcat has to play an eventual role in the Condesce's conquest of Earth. This poses a problem, because the Condesce's conquest began after Jane entered, and...presumably, Gcat entered with Jane. The implication is that Gcat goes from Earth to the Medium, and then travels with the Condesce from the Medium to Earth.

This is bad for the kids. It means that their primary antagonist is temporally protected because she has to live to conquer Earth. This happens when the Condesce's timeline goes Medium-&gt;Earth. If it goes Earth-&gt;Medium, it doesn't make sense how gcat is here right now.

Basically, Old Nan = Shiera Seastar.

I did go to film school, I went to Full Sail University in Orlando Florida. Please talk to me if you are thinking about going to film school. I will tell you what i would do differently if I could start over. 

Now that you know about locking yourself in the edit you have moved one step farther. if you had gone with a simple over the shoulder shot or a single of the person you can dictate the pacing in the edit. Ill say it forever that if you cannot edit, you will be a lousy shooter. You have to know what pieces you can make work in the end. Editing will help you know what you can and cannot get away with. 

WHen I mean shoot a scene wide i mean get out and get wide. Allow the audience to see where people are and what is going on. Put it on 24mm and get back like 100-150 feet. Put them in a nice sillouhette and let the scene start from there. Start watching some of your favorite movies and see how they enter into a scene. Try and figure out why they start where the start and why. It will help you tremendously with trying to figure that out on your own. 

As far as the boots shot i didn't really like it. I thought it was pointless and it didn't add anything to the story. Try not to shoot something that doesn't  help the audience figure out the story. Everything should have a purpose and a place in the movie. I would have simply setup a rack focus shot on the boots, but I would have had the shovel with the character as well. That would have sold the shot because the audience knows the shovel is going to come into play somewhere. Also stay away from shooting handheld with 7d. I will talk more about that later. 

As far as breaking the 180 i know what you were trying to do but it didnt work. I would try and stay away from breaking the 180 as a learning cinematographer. It will only make you look amateurish and unskilled at this point. I think you would have been better off to have you second actor spin around and then cut to a closeup of him and sit on his reaction as he breaks down from the news. Then cut to a wide shot showing the two of them. Then cut to a closeup of the main character.

I think you would have been better to sell the emotion from the acting side of things vs trying to suprise your audience with a 180 break. breaking the 180 takes your audience out of the movie as they go woah something is different. I think it would have played better to let the actor sell it and just hold on his closeup for an uncomfortable amount of time. The audience i think would respond better to that and not be taken out of the moment.

You see people with real money instantly buying items... really? This is the first time I've ever witnessed someone actually buying an item. I don't know where my friends got their items, and I don't care either. I don't know who has the best gear in the game, and if I did I wouldn't know where they got their items. This isn't an MMO, it's a single player game (for the most part). There is never the feeling of superiority like there is in WoW. You play for yourself, and you feel accomplished because you built your character however you wanted, with money or without. You should just play the game, don't spend any money, and enjoy it. I don't see how anyone elses gear has any effect on anything you do in Diablo 3.","1354321398"

I've been with the company for many years and am quite confident in my fitting capabilities. Also sometimes I get told no because they are unsure of how you are going to fit them. Many women surprisingly think you need to be naked to get an accurate fitting, when all you need is a lightly lined bra. Sme women are just not comfortable with a stranger handling an intimate area. But really it's quite painless and takes two seconds vs, who knows  how long it will take trying on 10 different bras in all different sizes. Plus it's free! Can't say much for vs. although I have been fitted there just to see wha they would fit me as. Completely wrong. I wear 32 d and they sized me at 36c. Maybe I had someone new though.

How the fuck can you call that ethnic cleansing?  Arabic is an official language of the country for goodness sake.

I went to far with ""nothing ethnic about it"" but accusing the state of ethnic cleansing is fucking ridiculous, in the light of what I just told you.

Now, what do you say?

"science","t5_mouw","First, thanks for the reply!

I fully understand he wasn't making claims, nor did I think this brain was self-aware. My post was more directed at other's making philosophical claims based on this development. 

Regarding the halting problem, thanks for elaborating on it. I explained it poorly. It was mainly a tie into the non-algorithmic argument. 

Regarding philosophical zombies, I don't need to demonstrate that myself, or anyone else, isn't a zombie. The argument is satisfied for myself, since I considered myself self-aware. Likewise, it can be satisfied for you, if you're self-aware. It does not disprove anyone else being a zombie, but that doesn't negate my argument. While one doesn't know about anyone else's self-awareness, they know of their own and thus could consider my argument as stated above (even if it also applies to other humans.)

Regarding your third point, it'd point towards reasoning of mental state, but I'm not sure I'd determine that as self awareness. I think it is a fundamental limitation of AI and reaching that point is impossible, but I believe we approach this with very different schools of thought.

Good luck with the reddit-ban, no worries on a lack of replies. I appreciate the opposing view and input with someone that (seems) to have more experience in this field.

Finally, note Wall Street/Big Finance interests are ultimately behind things like: NAFTA, CAFTA, permanent most favored nation trading status for China, off-shoring of manufacturing jobs, easing of lending standards that led to the subprime mortgage crisis (no, it wasn't poor black people behind it. Poor black people have ZERO power and influence in our system. Fuck, even middle class WHITE people have ZERO power and influence in our system, you think our glorious congresscritters are going to do the bidding of a bunch of dirt poor MINORITIES? It was BANKS behind it all along, cause they stood to make a pile of money off of subprime mortgages. Messrs Barney Fag and Charlie Rangel weren't ""helping poor black people"" so much as ""sucking Wall Street cock""), the Financial Services Modernization Act, the Commodities Futures Modernization Act - in short, ALL the pieces that set the stage for the financial collapse of 2007.

And whose side is Barack Obama on? I think this answers the question:

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2009/04/obama-to-banker/

Obama isn't so much ""picking his battles"" as he is ON THE OTHER SIDE, you fool. HE IS ON THE SIDE OF THE BANKSTERS.

&gt; and Obama's big choice was to fight the Healthcare system.

lol. No no no. You simply don't understand how our political system works. Read this:

http://www.amazon.com/Golden-Rule-Investment-Competition-Money-Driven/dp/0226243176

What was the Dem liberal base's demand when it came to health care reform? It was ""cover more people, control costs"" right? In other words, make health insurance corporations or for-profit healthcare producers take a haircut. Instead, what was actually delivered? An order to middle class Americans to buy health insurance, from these for-profit corporations, *at rates profitable to them.* Far from forcing them to take a haircut, Obama &amp; the Dem leadership ensured they would continue to rake in steady profits for the time being.

How do you end up with such an outcome? The standards narrative is GOP obstructionism. But let's examine this narrative a bit more carefully. What was the GOP base's demand of its representatives? It was ""Stop them. Make sure Obama and the Dems do nothing.""

How do you have one side going ""make health insurance take a haircut"" and another side going ""do nothing"" and end up with a ""middle ground"" that is... ""health insurance makes even more profits than before""?

And another thing. Dem party leadership is veteran, career politicians - Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, Rahm Emanuel... hardly political noobs. You seriously expect people to believe that these career politicos had no idea that Republicans would oppose them, and so any ""reform"" would have to be pushed through over bitter GOP opposition, or would end up being some sort of corporate welfare scheme that would make the problem *worse* (because it is more wealth transfer from the 99% to the 1%, from middle class American families ordered to buy health insurance to investor class who own health insurance companies) than before?

So no, sorry, but you have the narrative completely backwards. The only logical explanation is that the Obama admin and the Dem leadership *were working for health insurance and for profit healthcare producer interest from the get-go.* As per Ferguson's thesis - it appears that health insurance/healthcare producer industries had a problem on their hands, and so they ""invested"" in some politicians (that would be Obama and the Dems) and got them to ""solve"" that problem for them - mainly by transferring more wealth from middle class to them.

So I repeat: the whole ""healthcare reform"" bullshit? Bankster whores putting on a charade.


P.S. Oh the timing of the gay marriage thing is easy. ObamaCo knew they'd need to throw their liberal base a bone, to get them to forget how he screwed them over in his first term. So they sat on gay marriage, DADT, etc., until the 2012 elections came up.","1354321413"

I'm also entertaining the idea of an ellipse, but the only construction method I know requires string or rope under tension, so it wouldn't lend itself to use with a  router - or even worse, multiple passes. Perhaps there's a simple steam engine linkage that would do an ellipse or other interesting shape...

I'm not sure why I didn't think of multiple passes. When I started making the arc jig I went full depth. It was so loud that I stopped and waited until I'd picked up ear protection (really not a bad idea to use every time, but it had been so loud that I couldn't continue).

It turns out that I have some spiral rotozip bits for drywall, but no 1/8"" collet. I suspect that a spiral bit wouldn't be as noisy either.

I've realized that there's another benefit to covering the edge of the plywood - I can insert something conductive to eliminate static. Today's electronics aren't nearly as sensitive, but it always freaks me out when I zap an electronic gadget.","1354321415"

You're judgement on what constitute a well put together human is subjective. To say you know how every well put together person works is arrogant and false. 

You can't have sex and remain just friends with that person, but thats fine and there's nothing wrong with it. To say that I, or anyone else, cannot do it is stupid. ","1354321418"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Reading your other reply and a post of yours in another thread I think I get your angle a bit better now, though. I wanted to set your mind at ease that it's OK to require a high level of trust from the person (i.e. I fully stand by what I wrote up there), but it seems you really want to do this and are asking for practical suggestions for how you could achieve that level of trust. That about right?

I'm not sure how practical this really is in your exact situation, but when my SO suggested that we should get on birth control to be able to drop condoms (which I had been thinking about as well, but felt reluctant about asking/pushing for - it was a relief when she brought it up first), she asked me to go to the gynecologist with her so we could hear about options and side-effects together. Due to that it's always felt like it's _our_ plan, and I know what's going on with her and can appreciate her situation, and she can talk to me about it openly and I have no reason to worry she'd keep anything from me related to it.

I'm not sure how realistic it is to expect to visit the gynecologist with your Third, especially since you say you'd like to maintain a certain level of detachment, but a general thrust in there is that information facilitates trust, while lack of knowing is fertile ground for mistrust. So maybe make sure you've got your birth control knowledge down pat (in case you feel your own situation has left you with gaps) so you feel you can ask the prospective Third the right questions and gauge her responses for whether she has the right attitude and is truthful about her birth control situation?","1354321422"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Lets talk about waves. Like in the ocean. You're on the beach, and small waves are lapping in the shore. You can feel them hitting your feet and legs, but they're not disturbing you. Maybe a boat goes by and makes a wake. The big wave it makes rushes you and maybe even pushes you back a bit. You might also experience large natural waves that are enough to push you around or even surf on. Then you've got your tsunamis: biiiiiiig waves that are really just one big pulse caused by an earthquake. They're a huge crushing wave caused by a huge disturbance on the bottom of the ocean.

Ok, now EMPs. Electromagnetic waves are caused by things like electricity moving in a circuit, or if you wiggle/spin a magnet around, and a few other things too. Radio waves and other communication signals are like the gentle, low energy waves on the beach. You can ""feel"" them with an antenna or other piece of metal, but they aren't really moving much around in terms of electricity. EM signals from a battery or a generator are stronger, they can push electrons around in a circuit and make things happen. These are less ""waves"" and more ""pressure"", but it's related. If you send a strong enough EM wave to a circuit or piece of metal, you can make electricity flow through it (related to wireless recharge systems and such). EMP is like a tsunami. These are huge pulses of electromagnetic energy released as a weapon. A giant pulse is generated with various devices, but always requires a large amount of energy to be released. The EM shockwave slams into electronics and causes a burst of electricity much stronger than they are designed to handle. This can fry wires or even entire computer boards due to the absorbed energy. Electronics damaged this way are probably broken forever, but simpler circuits (lights, power lines) might just blow a fuse.","1354321424"

That and fungal actually roots the units.  If you had 20 high templars, you cast a few storms but then all of your templars die because the enemy isn't rooted, and storms don't stack so they would just get on top of the high templars and kill them.

An incarnation of my hatred shall ever follow your kind, dooming them to wander a blood-soaked sea of darkness for all time!

He is merely mentioning the curse, not casting it. *Ganon* is what happens when ""Demise""'s curse takes effect. It's actually just what happens when someone takes on the Triforce of Power or something related to it (such as the trident). This means that we could actually have Vaati as Ganon.

Demise himself is similar to Hylia, in that they keep reincarnating and taking a human form in order to wield the triforce. Hylia keeps coming back as Zelda (and thus gains the Triforce of Wisdom) and Demise keeps coming back as *Ganondorf* (and thus gains the Triforce of Power). Since they were previously gods, they naturally have the highest in their respective fields (wisdom and power). So the triforce goes to them. In their downtime, the Triforce is up for grabs.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I just want you to know that pretty much all of the following discussion we're going to have is going to be coloured incredibly poorly in your favour by the fact that you failed to catch the *Oz/Sherlock Holmes* thing. I was mixing metaphors intentionally because both writers tried to stop writing their flagship series. Baum with the magic barrier, Doyle with Holmes' death at Reichenbach Falls. 

But, the main thing that I want to point out is that, yes, film was--and in many ways still is--an infant compared to oral storytelling and the written word. *ShÅ«tur eli sharrÄ«*, ""Surpassing All Other Kings"", the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written some 20,000 years ago. And the techniques of storytelling have only improved. That's what I mean when I say that film was fresh from suckling at it's mother's teat. 

And I feel that anyone who says *anyone's* filmmaking is flawless should ask for their money back. If you took Hitchcock on a jaunt through time to sit in on modern filmmaking classes, or just snuck him into a few theaters, there's no doubt his filmmaking techniques would have changed dramatically. You'd also have created a temporal feedback loop and possibly destroyed the world, so you should feel hypothetically terrible for doing such a reckless thing. So yes, he gets a pass. Filmmaking now is more mature than filmmaking then. And techniques aside, there are just thousands upon thousands of things that you just couldn't *do* with the technology of the 1960s. I'd been saying it looked like a throwback because it felt like less of what was capable at the time. But, as I've said and/or implied, my knowledge of filmmaking is mostly self-taught and from the last fifteen years or so. Maybe it was amazing and well down by 60s standards.

The slow approach of the poorly lit killer is a perfect example of what I mean. Done right (which... it's Vince Vaughn in a wig, which is *terrifying* in it's own way, isn't done right) it can be incredibly effective. It increases tension much more than the lunatic with the knife. It gives you time to think about what's about to happen, and let your mind start coming up with it's own horrors. It's an example of film techniques growing and expanding. Also, I was actually saying Vince Vaughn was creepier than Anthony Perkins, though perhaps not in the way intended. He just doesn't have that same ""I'm a normal person"" face. He has that ""I'm that asshole from college"" look. He's more oval than round, too. The problem there isn't with lighting; it's with casting. I *do* think Vince Vaughn would hurt a fly, then he'd try to get it to do a keg stand.

As for the shower scene, I actually did watch both of them on Youtube. I feel that the first one suffers not because it didn't show blood, but because it didn't show contact of any kind, while it still had the knife. *This* is one of the problems I have with old movies, that I'll get to in a minute. If you *can't* show something, don't *try* to show it. Don't have a knife cheesily passing by someone. Show thrusts and stabs that look realistic. You don't *need* to show the gore, but if you *are* showing someone getting stabbed, don't then show me their unmarked flesh. Movies trade in verisimilitude. They're lies, essentially. And you want your lie to be as good as you can make it. Anything that breaks the lie breaks the suspension of disbelief. I actually was surprised with how much ladyflesh the movie showed, even showing her naked from an overhead view, but it still didn't feel real to me. Again, acting techniques have evolved. The scream was what really got me. It felt cheesy. I know that sensibilities have changed, but I judge things based on how I see them. Verisimilitude and the suspension of disbelief are the most important things to me. And my main problem with Hitchcock's famous scene is that sometimes the best lies are the ones you don't tell. For someone who's technique is so focused on contrast and lighting, it's almost shocking he didn't use shadows on the wall. And after that, the scene where she falls into the tub, then grasps at the curtain and collapses, it just seems poorly acted. *Over*acted would be a better term, another reason I can't stand old movies. I judge them too much. Although one really weedly thing is that when she grasps at the curtain, her hand actually changes position when it cuts to another angle. It's such an obvious thing that it bothers me. I'm too tired to remember the proper term. I've been too tired all day. I'd say the main problem with the new one is that the wig is fucking stupid. And it copies a very dated scene. It doesn't update it, it just literally remakes it. *That* in my book is as egregious a sin as using the Wilhelm Scream in the middle of a serious fight scene in a serious movie.

It is both. If there's somebody who *tells you what to do*, and you can't disobey him, that's what the word ""dictator"" means.

The word originates in Rome. The Senate was democratic, even if only a few percent of the people actually got to vote, but it did things really, really slowly. In times of crisis, when they needed decisions made in a hurry, they elected one or more guys to the post of ""Dictator"", which literally means ""guy who tells us what to do"".

"funny","t5_2qh33","I don't agree fully that once birth control reaches to a point that it'll all be good. There's other reasons why incest is looked down upon. Sex is way more than just physical. It's very emotional and psychological as well.

For one incest could potentially be damaging to someone's emotional development. If a brother sleeps with his sister, what does she see her brother as? Lover or brother? Both are separate roles and it could be confusing and potentially hurt their relationship. And just like with real lovers, it might not work out, and the fallout could impact a whole family not just them. 

But back to emotional development. A case of this could impact each other's sexual views from then on out. Especially since brother and sister might end up doing things when they're young and not fully developed. What if they break the incest and from then on no one else can meet the emotional bond possible between two relatives?

Incest between a parent and a child could really be much worse though as the parent is an authoritative role. This could lead to an unbalanced relationship where the parent has more say and more power in the relationship. Children in this kind of relationship can't escape easily, or don't even think it's possible. The child could unknowingly be trapped in an unhealthy relationship their whole life.

Of course it is possible that both people could adjust to their new roles healthily and it end up a healthy relationship. This seems to be the rarity though.","1354321447"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","See RelativisticMechanic's answer: you will always see light traveling at the speed of light, no matter what your own speed is. By the way, you asked about traveling ""at"" the speed of light, and that's physically impossible for you to do; maybe you can see why, as it's a direct consequence of what I just told you.

See, let's say you want to move at the speed of light. That's a constant speed, and if you're traveling at a constant speed (technically velocity) you have no way of determining if you're moving or at rest. So as far as you're concerned, you're at rest. But on the other hand we already know that something traveling at the speed of light does so for all observers. So we have a contradiction: if you're traveling at the speed of light, do you observe yourself to move at that speed or to be at rest?

The answer is that light *can't observe*: there's no such thing as the reference frame of something moving at the speed of light. More precisely, it turns out that anything with mass (like you) has to travel *below* the speed of light, while anything without mass has to travel *at* the speed of light.","1354321452"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 5 years ago when I was around 20 I was at the movies with my then girl friend. Now when I go to the movies I like to slouch back on my chair. So we are watching the movie and towards the end we notice some douchebags are throwing pop corn at us. It lasts for the last 10 minutes of the movie and with every piece that hits us I get a little bit more angry. Anyway so the credits role and the lights come on and I stand up to see which cunt was throwing popcorn. Turns out there are only four people behind us in the whole cinema, one group on a double date. They were about 16 and the guys were sitting together and the girls were also sitting together. 

Now I am actually a pretty big guy (at this stage I had played rugby for over 13 years and had played for my state). So as I stand up, these two kids fucking shit themselves, they realise I am not the little kid they thought I was because I had been slouching the whole movie. The two guys just gaze off at nothing and refrain from making eye contact, as I just stand there glaring at them. Finally after about 40 seconds one of the punks finally looks at me, they are all dead quiet...I grab the box of popcorn (almost full) out of his hands and tip it on him and his friend. They, are literally frozen, afraid to move and covered in popcorn. I then throw the box in the guys face, again without him even moving a finger. My girlfriend then drags me out all while these kids are totally shitting themselves... I realise I was older and bigger, but fuck those kids, felt like a total bad ass.","1354321454"

I believe that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, that he existed before everything *but* God.  I believe that God sent him through Mary to teach us, guide us, and die for us as payment for our sins.  God sacrificed His Son for us.  John 3:16.  Jesus followed the will of Our Father, God, and allowed himself to be sacrificed as that payment.

I believe that Jesus is divine, as he is God's Son.  I also believe he is human, as he is Mary's son.  He died on the cross as payment for our sins, God raised him from the grave, and took him to Heaven.  Those are my beliefs based on my interpretation of the scriptures in the Holy Bible.  :-)","1354321454"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","This happens to me also. However what I've noticed is that if I wait like 8-10 minutes after I ejaculate to go pee instead of right after it solves the problem. If I go immediately after it seems like it takes forever for me to stop feeling like I have to pee. So I would either 1) pee before, or 2) fight the urge to pee for about 10 minutes then go. I'm not a doctor, but I know that your body closes off part of the urinary pathway (or atleast makes it much more difficult to pee) when you are engaged in sexual activity (kind of like a valve). Based on what I've learned in my anatomy courses, my logical guess is that there is a time period after an orgasm that our hormones go back to normal homeostatic levels. During that time period if you try to pee, the ""valve"" may not be opened all the way and your urethral tract doesn't empty all the way. The small amount of urine could give your brain that little annoying sensation of having to pee. ***This is not scientific fact, just my logical guess based on college anatomy classes. ","1354321458"

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I think it varies greatly person to person. Some people will have more difficulty playing with two hands on a piano while others will find it equally as challenging to strum a guitar with one hand while arranging their fingers with the other. With guitar in the beginning it will be hard to press your fingers down appropriately, grip and use a pick, how to hold it comfortably, and how to strum to different rhythms. Once these are accomplished, guitar becomes much easier. For piano, while playing with two hands is difficult, it is in a sense like playing a guitar. Each hand is operating separately. This is not to say piano is easier off the bat. Both have unique learning curves that make it hard to classify one as being more difficult than the other. For me, having played both instruments for ten+ years, neither one is harder than the other because of the scope of difficulty. Try learning to play some Chopin (I can't) and piano becomes hard. Try Zeppelin's ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" solo and all and you have an equally challenging piece to learn.","1354321472"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt;film is my favorite art form because it's all encompassing of the others

Video games would like to have a word with you. But I'd say that... well, yes, I am kind of ignorant when it comes to film history (for the most part, I'd reckon I know more than most people). And I don't know nearly as much about the techniques and terminology as I'd like. But don't think I'm completely incompetent just because of the modern sensibilities. The reason I can't watch old movies is because they're dated. I can just *tell* where techniques have come a long way. It's like eating some really good, buttery popcorn and then getting the authentic original style that's nowhere near as flavoured. I'm bad at the whole ""yeah, but this invented that"" thing. Because I don't think older means better. I think that newer things are on average better, and that anyone who would have surpassed Hitchcock in his day as ""most influential"" only fails to do so today because no one is the ""most"". To become the most influential in a world of five techniques, you only need to create two. In a world of five hundred techniques, you'd need to create two hundred.

Basically, the main reason that I dislike older movies is because there isn't that verisimilitude. Yes, many CG movies lack verisimilitude as well. But CG is now at the point where Harryhausen was with his famous hits after only a scant decade of in-depth use. 

I really do need to step up my academic approach to media, and maybe take more notes. I have startlingly poor memory when it comes to things like this, and unless I actually discuss something--which I rarely get a chance to do--I'll likely forget it, even if I'd have called it my favorite. You mentioned close ups at the start. One of the first movies (*The Sneeze*) was a close up. The movie I think that did the best close ups I've ever seen was *Hard Candy*. And while there are some complaints I've people heard make about that movie that are perfectly valid, that camerawork is *gorgeous*. You feel intimate with these people. And considering they're a potential pedophile and his potential victim/tormentor, it works so well to cause unease, and yet it's such a subtle thing.

Panning, dollies, handicams, harnesses, rigs... colour correcting, colour treating, CG touch up, CG effects, digital editing, digital film... and that's just technology. Daniel Day Lewis or Gary Oldman would blow old actors out of the water just because of the sheer library of acting techniques they have. The very psychology of acting has advanced so much. I haven't even seen it yet because I'm too damned poor to keep going to the movies, but something like *Cloud Atlas* could never have been made before. Hell, I don't think something like Helena Bonham Carter playing Hermione pretending to be Bellatrix could have been done. The behind the scenes work on that is just amazing. Then again, on any blockbuster series like that, near the end you get to say ""okay, let's just try some crazy shit"". *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button* couldn't have existed before it did. I can't think of a portrayal of evil on par with Sir Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter before *Silence of the Lambs*. There's a reason no one remembers Brian Cox's portrayal in *Manhunter*. 

I would probably have a conniption fit if I tried watching *Metropolis*. I will never understand why people at the time could make a decent fade, but they couldn't use in picture subtitles, and it would take half a decade before people figured out how to splice a scene without having the entire time of day change. Not to mention the overacting that comes with a silent film, the aesthetic being almost everything I hate about science fiction of the era, and the way I just can't get over Maria's robo-boobs. The grainy film, the frame rate, the editing, all these things stand out to me in movies so old, and I've always had trouble with lying to little kids that their art looks amazing. And for all his talent, Fritz Lang was part of that little kid stage of filmmaking. That said, the make up and lighting are beautiful, and human Maria is quite the looker. The use of light and contrast show that he was definitely someone who understood his medium. I mean, I just watched the scene with Maria dancing frenetically while the upperclass look on with lust in their eyes, and I just can't take it seriously. The speed of it is just wrong, the music doesn't match, and it's just so... overacted. Also, I don't speak German.

I would strongly disagree that the movies you've listed are ""of a higher quality and more entertaining than almost any movie ever made, today, in the past or in the future"". *Casablanca*, which I have seen, and was actually disappointed with, has dialogue that doesn't even rival most TV shows. Especially the nerd or artsy focused ones, like Whedon or Sorkin's forays. And both of those have immense problems, not the least of which is the overwhelming desire to interrupt an articulate and powerfully presented speech with ""shut the fuck up and let another character talk, Sorkin"". In fact, I kind of feel like that way of thinking is one of the major flaws with institutes of the arts. There's this notion that older is better. I mean, Hell, from a strictly cinematographic point of view, *2001: A Space Odyssey* (which, again, I haven't seen because scifi, but I do have a frame of reference for it due to it being a vastly influential cultural... monolith. eh, eh? See what I did there?) crushes *Metropolis* into little tiny pieces. There's just a much bigger sense of scope and scale than I'm getting from scrolling through *Metropolis*, or even from the iconic scenes that I've been aware of through cultural osmosis. Then again, Stanley Kubrick is also insane, and that helps with art.

An attitude of older things being better, despite the technology and knowledge being so limited is frankly ridiculous. And, for someone who intends to be a filmmaker, rather counterintuitive.

Also, I've spent over two hours on this comment. Man, I really have no life. I was supposed to be taking an assessment so I could start my job some time today, too... eh, I'm only half awake anyway.","1354321477"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","When I first learned about it the way I understood Hawking radiation was that the particle/virtual particle pair were created at the border of the event horizon and one escaped.  Think about it this way - since energy can not be created nor destroyed to preserve the balance the new particle that radiates has to be balanced out by a negative energy particle that ends up in the black hole.

So while the black hole itself isn't actually radiating it IS absorbing negative energy which has the same effect as though it were radiating.  It is also interesting to note that the amount of radiation is inversely proportional to the mass so when the black hole does eventually evaporate entirely a huge amount of energy is released.

From wikipedia article on [Micro-blackholes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_black_hole):

""In 1974 Stephen Hawking argued that due to quantum effects, black holes ""evaporate"" by a process now referred to as Hawking radiation in which elementary particles (photons, electrons, quarks, gluons, etc.) are emitted.[6] His calculations show that the smaller the size of the black hole, the faster the evaporation rate, resulting in a sudden burst of particles as the micro black hole suddenly explodes.""","1354321478"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Well, yes, language. The more you condense it, the less correct it is.

Let's say ""There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" that are independent of the judger, picking one side is attachment (and often predisposition), to transcend the duality switch back and forth until you see both sides at the same time"".

Zen, here, does not consider ""true"" and ""false"" to be axiomatic, but ""distinction"", as do the [Laws of Form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_Form#The_form_.28Chapter_1.29), from which you can then again build the rest of logic.

"anime","t5_2qh22","In other words, all dedicated actors/actresses who invest in their characters are chuuni. Chuunibyou is an attitude problem, not just because you have a nice imagination. There's a thing called the public and private self. 

The persona Hououin Kyouma is a textbook example of Chuunibyou itself, but it's also at a the same time the front Okabe Rintaro uses when he's with certain people. In that scene he's just using that persona to justify his attempt in bad English, as shown by his reversion to Okabe when he realised that it's possible to communicate in Japanese. In that case, it's Hououin who failed at English, not Okabe. It's not what's said that matters, but the context and the attitude that determines whether a said person is Chuuni. 

My biggest problem is, there are tonnes more scenes where Hououin Kyouma is at his Chuuni best, yet that person chose the one that's least chuuni - like. But whatever, since reddit only remembers English lines anyway. ","1354321487"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","1. You can graduate. You're not stupid. The key is you have to believe that in order to pursue the goal. So just recognize, if nothing else, that thinking you're dumb isn't helping. It's just not productive. You want to graduate so just take it on faith that you can for now.

2. Dump your SO. You don't ""have trust issues"" - you have an SO who can't be trusted. You say if you could just graduate, you'd be near each other. Maybe some wiser part of you is sabotaging school to keep that roadblock up in a ""HELL, no!"" move.

3. Seems like your dad (unintentionally) set you up for some of these issues, namely tolerating cheating and self-criticism/pressure. I'm guessing some part of you wants his approval and to not see him as a bad guy. The good news is you can still love him and reject these things.

4. You're probably not ugly. Reddit, like anywhere online, has its fools, and I'm guessing people who like to rate others via ""AmIUgly"" are up there. This is the most ridiculous measure of beauty. Confidence (even in photographs) can make a difference. Just think of someone you know isn't perfect looking but seems warm, self-assured and attractive (celebrities or acquaintances). If you walk around thinking you're not even average, you'll hold your body (from your facial muscles to lack of eye contact to your posture) in a way that reinforces that belief. You'll be less approachable, and thus be less approached, reinforcing this.

5. Your boyfriend is an asshole. Straight up. He wants to JUSTIFY why he cheated on you. He thought you were hot enough to fuck. Your attractiveness isn't the issue here. He wants excuses and he will likely cheat on the next girl, no matter how attractive she is.

6. You have GOT to stop talking to yourself this way. You're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. What would you really like to do if you woke up tomorrow and you were surrounded by friends, knew your next boyfriend would be faithful, and all of Reddit told you that you were incredibly hot? Now go do those things, because these negative beliefs are the only thing in your way.","1354321495"

Get Backers was just generally rougher around the edges, I had to make more consistently make leaps of faith to justify the premise.  It didn't start badly, but the execution from there was mediocre.  

As for a direct comparison between the two, the world magic/powers were similarly constructed and plenty of action to go around.  DTB just had more depth beyond that IMO, there was more political movements behind the story and the powers had at least some form of balance to them with the compulsions.

I'm not sure how these two sentences are related?  The example question you link to seems to me to be explicitly asking for best practice and appears to be written by someone who has a reasonable understanding of the fundamentals, and the reason you ask it is stated clearly at the start.

For the questions I'm talking about answering neither of those things is true.  Of course one of the main advantages of StackOverflow IMO is that it differentiates between answers to questions and comments on questions, so this whole thing can be less of an issue.  A few questions I've commented on recently which are more the sort of thing I'm talking about (and mostly I commented and *didn't* answer):

* [How do I disable right click on my web page?](http://stackoverflow.com/q/737022/8655)
* [Drag and drop HTML5 and browser cache](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13264403/8655)
* [Two Tables in Html](http://stackoverflow.com/q/13049685/8655)

I also, being nosy, looked at your [top rated answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/538060/proper-use-of-the-idisposable-interface/538238#538238) and note two things:

* Your answer to the actual question is quite a long way in, after a lot of 'editorializing'.
* At the end you say: ""For anyone who likes the style of this answer (explaining the why, so the how becomes obvious)""  This amuses me (I do like the style, BTW) because all I'm saying here is that questions should also explain the why.

Finally, I found this typo amusing:

From the predator point of view with humans it boils down to pure strategy from that point on : Show yourself as strong and you might have some people interested, some that might be prey, to get closer to you, from that point on you can do whatever you like.

That's a bit the same for Civilisation in fact, if you want to conquer : be strong to gain allies, don't show yourself too strong or too weak, the idea is to have people that will come to you. Once you are allied unleash your full potential and conquer them over when they expect it the least before they have doubts about you.

In real life I guess that strategy doesn't work well if you don't change your circle of friends or places constantly... At least I think... but that's just a guess.","1354321506"

You have to admit Fitz, as good as he is, cannot put the entirety of the team on his back. The Cardinals sucking every year since the Super Bowl run have shown that. Now, in this hypothetical scenario, Aaron Rodgers, who was a backup for his first 2 seasons in real life, would most likely be thrust into the starting position early on.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","A pub is a public server, the servers you join when you just want to play for fun e.g. the Valve TF servers or Lotus Clan

Highlander is a competitive format played by pre-established teams of 9 players each, and each team has one of each class.

6v6 is a competitive format played by pre-established teams of 6 players each, and each team is composed of two scouts, two soldiers, one medic and one demoman.

It's cited as an example of something you shouldn't play pyro in because the team composition stated above isn't hard and fast, but it's the best combination of damage, mobility, and survivability. Therefore, if you're playing pyro all the time (or ""maining"" pyro) in 6v6 you're not contributing to your team, because the two scouts would likely just rip you apart. This doesn't mean that pyro (or any class for that matter) is not played in 6v6; players will often switch classes (""offclass"") in certain situations. Good examples are the last point in a 5 point control map, where one player may play heavy, another engineer, another pyro to block the uber, etc. On offense (and defense) snipers and spies will be used to gain an important kill to diminish the opponents' strength and help win the ensuing fight.

Hope this helps and I didn't come off as patronizing/condescending :D I personally just got into competitive tf2 a couple of months ago and have been fervently watching shoutcasts on youtube. If you're interested, youtube.com/fatmop is a great shoutcaster (nicknamed Sal) and watching some of his casts are a great way to understand competitive tf2.","1354321509"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I would definitely start out at Mt Baker Vapors, Alice in Vapeland, or Virgin Vapors for your first liquids. Solid selection of flavors and they are all really quality. 

As far as equipment, I tell most noobies to start out with either an eGo-c or an eGo-twist. they are solid vapes, portable, and not too expensive. I started with one and I loved it. Basically look for a starter kit that coms with 2 eGo-twist batteries or 2 eGo-c batteries along with a couple CE2 clearomizers (aka stardusts), plus a charger. That's really all you need to have a really solid first vape experience. Of course you'll also need to buy liquid. Altogether I wouldn't pay more than $100 for the starter kit. If you can find it for like between $70-$100 it's a good deal. 

DON'T GET A KNOCK OFF. Some people like to buy the knock off batteries from China and stuff, but some of my friends and myself have had some bad experiences with these knock off batteries either shorting out quickly, or getting way too hot, or not functioning properly. ","1354321515"

"Porsche","t5_2recr","Once a year or every 3000-5000 miles, whichever comes first. It's 10-12 quarts of oil, 2 crush washers, and a new filter. All told it comes to ~$120 for a DIY oil change since it needs special oil.

The plugs don't have to come out except when you end up replacing them. I don't know the interval for those off the top of my head, but I just rebuilt my motor and replaced the plugs during the process. Honestly, it's not that bad to change them, the one on cylinder 6 just takes a bit of massaging to get out. Same thing with changing the rear shocks on the older ones (before Porsche got rid of the torsion bars).

Once you start working on an air cooled 911 you realize it's just a car that was clearly designed in the 60s and updated as time went on. There's less of that in the 993, but it still exists. There are some very old school design features that stayed with the car throughout the decades (like the heating system they didn't revamp until I believe the 964).

Parts can be expensive, but compared to the cars in its class, not too terrible. Just don't expect parts to be the same as the average Honda Accord.

In the end though, short of rebuilding the engine, anyone can work on them. They're well designed, logically put together, and reliable cars. There are few if any reasons you'd really need a mechanic to work on it. I've replaced literally every system on my 911 and the only thing I've had a mechanic do was the transmission rebuild and an alignment &amp; corner balance. ","1354321517"

That being said, women are taught that only the sluts go with 'bad' guys. We're told over and over and over again to hide our feelings and lie, to make people feel 'better'. We must always be nice, we must always be fair, we can never, EVER be mean, which includes telling it like it is. And the men don't exactly help.

FGL is starting to allow HTML5 games, but nobody is buying them yet. Penetration is very poor, performance is way behind Stage3D and Unity, and viral spread is nearly non-existent. There's just no real incentive to use a weaker language with a smaller userbase and fewer development tools.

The ""build for mobile"" trope is also deceptive. Yes, you can use HTML5 to build a game that will be playable in a mobile browser, but the number of people who visit casual gaming portals from a mobile browser is negligible. When a mobile user wants to play a game, they shop for apps.

Unity is pretty much the only reasonable alternative to Flash for casual web game development, and it's still playing the plugin penetration catch-up game. HTML5 is for web design, Flash and Unity are for games. Yes, you *can* use HTML5 for games. You can make games with *anything*. But if you're at the point where you're trying to pick the best tool for the job, your options are Flash and Unity. I recommend Flash for 2D and casual gaming, Unity for 3D and larger projects.","1354321525"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","The Lockean approach to property rights doesn't argue that labor necessarily grants the laborer property rights in the object that he is laboring upon.  The Lockean homesteading principle says that in the case of unowned, ""virgin"" land or resources man's labor can act as a means by which he becomes the first owner of some property.  This act is called an act of original appropriation.

Locke argues that if every man has ownership over their own body, and over one's own labor - when encountering property without an owner the mixing of your labor with the unowned resource entitles the acting man to a first property right in the newly developed resources.

Some Libertarians (Block, Hoppe) would argue that we come to own ourselves through a similar homesteading process over our own bodies.  New life homesteads itself through the process of asserting its control over its will and material being.  

If you accept that the way we come to own ourselves is through the homesteading process that I have just described, I would suggest you consider that property rights in un-owned objects follows a similar logic.

Suppose I venture into some unclaimed, unowned, wilderness.  Upon arriving in a clearing, I begin to gather wood for my home.  I chop down the trees, I mill them, I successfully construct a stable structure.  Would a stranger - upon coming across my homestead in the wilderness not have a duty to honor my ownership of the home in a way that is distinctly different than he would treat the trees - untouched by my labors - that populate the forest around me?

Given that all property and land begins as unowned and theoretically comes to its first owners through the homesteading process, described above, we can thus proceed to secondary exchanges of homesteaded property.  

**Labor cannot transform the ownership of property that already has an owner.**  If you operate my machinery, working in my factory, laboring over the machinery that I have paid you to operate does not give you some kind of claim to the ownership of this machinery.  Exchanges of property from the first owners occur as normal transations.  A first owner of property could exchange his newly homesteaded property for other individual's property or services, he may gift it to another person at no cost, or he may abandon the property.

**In the case of abandoned property**, if no property owner can be found, after some impossible-to-determine amount of time (continuum problem, determined by social norms) a piece of property becomes claimable once again through homesteading.

Another continuum problem presented to us by the system outlined above is ""how much labor is necessary to homestead virgin territory or property?""  Clearly we wouldn't naturally accept a flag on the moon as acceptable for ownership of an entire heavenly body, but an individual who kills and cooks a wild rabbit as a source of food would probably intuitively jive with our concept of homesteading and first appropriation through labor.

I hope this is helpful in some way!

I too, feel that in some ways I was better off suffering through it. I certainly don't have as much anxiety about relationships as I used to in general now and, as aforementioned, in a weird way I feel it helped ""cure"" my overall despondency and depression. And looking for positivity after that failed relationship led me to a job I'm quite happy at, and I might've never pushed for it had I not been in a funk from heartbreak. So I definitely think I pulled some positives out of the situation.

I think my trouble is that I don't really feel I have control over the hauntings. Sure, I can not think about it and not watch movies or play music that reminds me of those times, but even then I'll still have the occasional exaggerated nightmare involving her. In a lot of ways I feel like I have a mini-PTSD regarding her, and I feel I definitely started focusing on improving myself more than I used to after the break-up to build up my own confidence and happiness and so on. But it still doesn't seem to get rid of past ghosts...

I felt that trying for a more ""normal"" relationship with someone else could've helped me heal, but I've not had success there. I surely feel I've tried by going on dates and by making sure I expressed my feelings clearly rather than hiding them away as I used to, but even then nothing seemed to work out even if early signs were good. Since my studies are in engineering, any available girls are generally not due to the skewed gender ratios. And of the ones that are available, they often seem very standoffish and have a variety of communication or self-image problems that do cause problems when I would try to act upon what I thought was mutual interest. Because I'm European (and, specifically, from a former Soviet Union country), my culture is such that I really prefer to avoid BS and just be honest and communicative instead, as that generally seems like a good route to take in relationships. But any U.S. girls I've tried to date seem to have their neuroses and rarely can give straight answers. European girls are a rarity in engineering (and more often appear in the more liberal arts studies), so that's a rare opportunity despite a high chance for cultural compatibility, so I've wondered if I should try dating an Asian, as I generally find people of that culture closer to European than ""American"". Certainly an option, though I feel that cultural and language barriers would be a hurdle to overcome...","1354321543"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I'm a tall, well built man with a large cock. Most see me as being more of a dominate being, and mostly I am. In relationships I don't like woman who are out to control the relationship, so I usually tend to take the more dominate role. Most women seem to like this so it works out.
In the bedroom this relationship seems to go into hyperdrive. My current girlfriend loves for me to be on top. She loves the fact that I am bigger and stronger than she is, and that I directly illustrate this fact to her while I fuck her. I love it as well and consider it completely natural. We have intense, kinky and passionate sex a lot. 
Given the nature of our relationship I have a hard time telling her that one of my fantasies is to have her strap on a large dildo and penetrate me with it. To look me in the eyes and take my manhood with one painfully humiliating and excilerating thrust! The thought of a woman doing that to me, taking control and doing something to me that has happened to her countless times before, excites me! The thought of her getting off on the fact and action, gets me off even more..
But here's the deal, I like fucking her wild. I like being dominate and powerful in the bedroom. I like the sex that we have and I worry that if I actually went through with it, actually let her peg me, the dynamics in our sex life and everyday relationship would change. So up to this point I have not pushed the subject. She knows it's a fantasy of mine and I think she'd get into it if I did push it, but so far it has only been me expressing my desire. She has never expanded upon it so neither have I.
So what it comes down to is yes, I'd let her strap on a rubber cock and fuck me, ONLY if she wanted to try it. Only if she REALLY wanted it, had thought and fantasized about it and truly realized and loved the idea of how sensual the transfer of power, and the idea of herself holding it, would be
Will it happen?? Probly not.. Cuz the fact is, having a cock and penetrating another person with it IS a powerful thing and to be powerful, especially in the bedroom, requires a person to be insistent and persistent of their ideas. So unless she gets off her submissive ass and decides she wants to fuck me so bad she's willing to push through my doubts and insecurities about the subject, and shove her control all up inside of me, it won't happen..

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","This is a common misconception. I think radical feminism (which is egalitarian) is conflated with cultural feminism (which views women as better than men). Check out [this essay](http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/WarZoneChaptIIID.html) by Andrea Dworkin where she repudiates the idea of biological superiority. Julia Serano explains the differences in Whipping Girl:

&gt; ...cultural feminism sought to reverse traditional sexism by claiming that women were naturally creative and cooperative and therefore superior to men, who were seen as inherently destructive and oppressive... While radical feminismâwhich asserted that neither sex was inherently superior to the otherâactively engaged the mainstream public (and men in particular) to challenge and change their sexist ways, cultural feminism was a more insular movement, focusing on creating women-run organizations and women-only spaces rather than organizing public demonstrations. And unlike radical feminism, which attempted to accommodate a variety of different female perspectives (in fact, issues over âdifferenceâ in class and sexuality consumed much of the movementâs energy), cultural feminists forwarded the idea of âsamenessâ and âonenessââthat all women were part of a universal sisterhood, united by their female biology.
This concept of female âonenessâ was perhaps most responsible for cultural feminismâs exclusionist, even separatist, tendencies.

A significant number of self-identified radfems on the internet are essentialist and transphobic (and a few do and say really horrific things), but that's not a necessary part of being a radical feminist.","1354321547"

Just out of curiosity, were you thinking that if you won't get an erection, then there's no point to ""sex""? Or were you just flat not in the mood at all?

I've never understood ""sex"" as revolving exclusively around a hard-on. Did you? Did she? Was she asking for something more specific than you've described?

I can definitely say from experience that it doesn't take an erection to have fantastic sex. More than that a partner who's stimulating you even when you're not getting hard is not only jsut as good - in some sense, it's better, because your ""performance"" anxiety (and I'm using your word, here) just up and evaporates. And, ironically, that lack of anxiety can surprise you with an erection you thought wasn't impossible, occasionally. 

That's love. 

So did she want to have sex with you despite that she knew and accepted that you wouldn't be getting hard, or did she not beleive that, perhaps thinking that //she// could //get// you hard if she jsut did the right things?","1354321549"

2:  Again, I don't have to refute that statement if you (or this blog) don't have to prove it...  What does the 1 in 6 represent?  What population. Are the women widows, single mothers, divorcees on child support and alimony?  And yet again, sources prove useless, and not primary documents.

3:  I didn't mention higher level education in the first sentence.  And the second implies that despite their disadvantage socially, women still attend college 10% more than men (I assume it is worldwide, sources still prove useless), not that it nullifies the first.

4: We agree.  Yipeee!

5: What I get from that ""fact"" is what then?  That women live longer?  That they die less frequently in wars?  That they are less likely to be killed in violent action or on the job than men?

We will see where it goes from here, but I know now that I have the strength to end it all if it goes downhill again. My number one concern is my children and their well being.

Knowledge in the field empowers anthropologists to critically analyze human decision making withing the context of culture and society.  This knowledge can be used an infinite number of times over to analyze analysis itself. This, in turn, creates an extremely layered analysis of analysis of observation.  Specifically, much of the work in anthropology is based on observation, but this work in and of itself is open to anthropological criticism based on it's own cultural subjectivity.  I think this criticism is valid, but there are two things to consider.  One is the opportunity cost, analysis might be better spent on analysis closer to the data.  The second is that it is this very analysis that steals the perception of objectivity (that we agree no one has) from us.  Unlike other fields, we are our own biggest critics and I think it is costing us more than it empowers us to create impact.","1354321556"

Also, there is no favoritism toward Vettel. He is a three time consecutive champ and they love him so it only appears they favor him because he wins so much.

It doesn't look to me like their argument for territory occupation had much logic at all. **Also, Palestine wasn't necessarily the first choice the Israelies came up with when the Zionist lobby met for the first time in the late 1800s** : 
[The Israel Lobby is just the tip of an older and far larger iceberg known as âpolitical Zionism,â an international movement that began in the late 1800s with the goal of creating a Jewish state somewhere in the world. In 1897 this movement, led by a European journalist named Theodore Herzl[3], coalesced in the First Zionist World Congress, held in Basle, Switzerland, which established the World Zionist Organization, representing approximately 120 groups the first year; 900 the next.](http://www.ifamericaknew.org/us_ints/history.html#_ftn5)

&gt;While Zionists considered such places as Argentina, Uganda, and Texas,[5] they eventually settled on Palestine for the location of their proposed Jewish State, even though Palestine was already inhabited by a population that was 95 percent Muslims and Christians, who owned 99 percent of the land.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","There is a great American InDian university where I lived. Sipi. An amazing school. Indians got way better educaion for their bachelors than I did at UNM. 

I also think lots of the fact that Jewish people in Germany are living better than the American Indian is due to the fact that Indians really have zero desire to intergrated into the greater USA society. They are their tribe first and Americans second. 
 
I was talking to a crow when I was in college. She told me that her identity is her tribe. And just that. When pressed, she told me that she was Indian. And I asked her if she felt American at all, she said yes, but at a distant third. 

I ran into many Indians at university. My little brother was a Zuni. My pledge brother was a member of the tribe outside ramuh, New Mexico. It is very interesting talking to them.  All they want to do is to go back to the res and live there. They had zero desire to travel the world or set up shop in the big city. 

I think the culture of the American Indian is partly to blame for the lack of wealth seen in Indians. My own grandfather was a member of the Iroquois nation (Seneca more specifically) and he was kinda shunned by his people for going off to war and becoming a machinist. 

But of course that is my own anecdotal evidence. In your experiance with American Indians, what do you think is holding them back from Greater wealth and greatness? Do you think it is still the policies of the past holding them back or current govt policies? ","1354321565"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","My advice to you would be to toss your old Niv-Mizzet card because it makes the deck illegal in standard play. Also, I would try to cut down on your high curving creatures as well as just running less creatures in general. Charmbreaker Devils is probably a little bit too expensive to run. I would add Jace, Architect of Thought if you can afford it as well as more dual lands, Desolate Lighthouse, Think Twice, and probably replace cards like Spelltwine and Arcane Casting with cheaper spells and counter spells. The problem that you're going to run into with this deck is that too many of the cards just cost too much mana, which makes the deck operate a little bit too slowly. Faster decks that are playing several cards in the first few turns of the game can win before your deck has a chance to really play anything. Thus, you want cards such as counters to help control what your opponent is able to do and slow them down so that you can get your threats out. Snapcaster Mage is also a great card that you could be running to help keep tempo with your opponent. Also, with what your deck is trying to do, I think you should probably run an additional land or two, since you need to be consistently hitting your land drops for the first 4-6 turns of the game in order to play your threats.","1354321565"

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Well, being from Canada, I haven't familiarized myself with all the new rules and all their consequences. If you put good effort into being an instructor I'm sure you could do just fine and the students would get their money's worth. Attitude is everything in aviation - and life. If you didn't do the CFI route, aren't there small air taxi and commuter companies in the states that you could work for? If I'm correct, it's only the airlines that require you to have 1500 hours? In Canada it's completely different. If this became a rule in Canada I don't think it'd affect hardly anyone at all. Most pilots in Canada either go the instructor route or they work on the ramp at an air taxi or commuter company and then get a flying position with that company. I can't think of an airline off the top of my head that would take a pilot with less than 1500 hours. Depending on where you go on the Air Canada site you'll see a requirement for either 1000 or 1500 hours. I don't know what's up with that. WestJet is 1500, Porter is 3000 (they will take you with less if you have a good recommend but my friend just went there and he was the lowest time guy in the class with 3000 hours.) Jazz is preference to ATP and 1500 hours - with the amount of pilots who are more than qualified I doubt they'd dip below that 1500 mark. So... it's really not a problem in Canada. 

In my opinion the 1500 hour requirement is a bit of a bandaid fix. From my experience, hours of flight experience doesn't mean a lot with regards to how good someone is as a pilot. A good pilot has good hands and feet, can make decisions calmly while under pressure, thinks quick but has slow hands, is disciplined, continually reviews procedures on their own, self-studies, etc. It's hard to teach that. By the time someone is old enough to be a pilot, their habits and ways are somewhat engrained. If you want a good fix to the problem you'll increase required training and expand the scope of testing while making the passing mark higher. The cons to that are that you'll require TONS of government money to review current training programs and to come up with suitable new standards for training and testing and the other con is a there will be some people who are bickering about the 1500 rule who wouldn't make it through training. There would be no 100 hour private pilot licenses, even if you had the money. That's how you really get good pilots - but that ain't gonna happen! This isn't the military. 

I do feel your pain. It sucks that a blanket rule gets passed on to everyone when I'm sure there are pilots out of college that would make a good right seat regional jet pilot. With regard to an increase in poor instructors due to the 1500 rule, if it happens then that's unfortunate but everything will have cons to it. 

Go to PilotCareerCentre.com and look at the jobs in the US that are available. I'm sure you could find a small company that you'd be able to get a flying job with after finishing training.","1354321569"

I think that applies here as well even though it is a much less harmful substance.

As far as getting in trouble for it, I know my schools policy concerning drug testing (they don't unless they find reason to) and I know I will have to stop before beginning residency. After the pre-residency test I'll look at the hospital policy on drug testing current employees and go from there. I don't drive around with it, I don't advertise that I use it.  

I've found that getting high has been nothing but a positive thing for me. Sometimes I get high and sit and read pubmed and wikipedia for hours and I retain that information.

If you like relazing physics puzzles and are a fan of lullaby songs and themes, this is a game you will love.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","YOU are telling ME that there are a number of defenses in other cases? This is LITERALLY what I do every day.

How is this for a defense, insufficiency of evidence. That's the most common one. 

How is your argument any different than a knifepoint robbery by someone you recognize from the neighborhood? It is EXACTLY the same, by your argument.

&gt;If consent is all that is left, then you essentially are requiring the husband to present himself well enough on the witness stand so as to defeat the charge.

Now you're exposing yourself as someone who doesn't do a lot of trial work. You don't even need to have the guy testify. You just need to call her testimony into question on cross. That is exactly what cross is for. 

This is no different than almost any other case that doesn't have a Wade issue on it. 

If the complaining witness knows the defendant, which happens ALL THE TIME, it is the exact same argument. 

&gt;Is a simple he-said-she-said argument sufficient to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt?

Have you never heard of a one-witness case? If you think that the answer to your simplified question is ""no"" then you wouldn't be fit to serve on a jury. Think of how ridiculous that question is when you start thinking like trial counsel.

This is an outrageously simplified question. Why does ""he said"" even have to enter the equation. Like I said, you can challenge every single word she says. All you have to do is prove her a liar on one or two other things and a couple jurors will be nodding at you. Acquittal.

A politician sets themselves up for ridicule and scapegoating when they run for office and this is something they must be prepared for, but it's not really their fault. They're not omnipotent, nor are they heartless bastards who cheerily trample over the common man for their own gain, despite what the pessimist might think. Most of the opposition when Fianna FÃ¡il were in power didn't make much noise over the impending economic collapse either, did they? If any other party was in power at the time, the same thing would have happened, and that's a fact.

This recession is not confined to Ireland. It has hit the United States, Greece, Portugal, and many other countries in just as serious but perhaps less publicised ways. It's very much a problem for the West in general. 

What I'm saying is you must think globally to understand the recession. No man is an island, nor is any country nowadays an island in the metaphorical sense of the word. We're all intertwined.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","[That Telegraph article](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100192335/the-vichy-evening-news-formerly-known-as-the-guardian-has-gone-bonkers-over-leveson/) is spot on 

&gt; To listen to the Guardian, or Ed Miliband, or the Hacked Off campaign, or any of Lord Justice Levesonâs other cheerleaders, you would have thought the Prime Minister appeared in the House of Commons yesterday, ripped the report to shreds and tossed the pieces in the air, screaming âYou thought I would take notice of that old fool! Me?! David Cameron!â
&gt;
&gt; In fact, he accepted most of the findings. But he also said that legislating to implement them would set a dangerous precedent, and so he would like to see whether it was possible to get them introduced on a voluntary basis. A robust regulatory body. With robust powers. Just without the need for statute.
&gt;
&gt; Now to any sensible person, that would seem to be perfectly reasonable response, carefully balancing the principle of press freedom with the need for press restraint. But no. To some on the â formally â liberal Left this is a great betrayal. The prime minister has, according to one Hacked Off spokesman, âfailed the victim testâ.
&gt;
&gt; Sorry, but itâs not his job to pass the victim test. The excesses that have been exposed by Leveson were disgusting. And people like the Dowlers have been through unimaginable torment. But we cannot tear up a centuries-old principle of press independence solely out of sympathy for them. And certainly not out of sympathy for Steven Coogan, Hugh Grant or Charlotte Church.
&gt;
&gt; The Prime Ministerâs critics are this morning pointing to his pledge to implement Leveson so long as his recommendations werenât âbonkersâ. Well, a lot of what Levesonâs suggesting is bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; For start, letâs look at the demand for statutory legislation. Levesonâs supporters are currently tying themselves in knots trying to claim that what he proposes is in some way not statutory regulation, just âstatutory underpinningâ. This is sophistry. It if it requires legislation from parliament then it is statutory regulation. That's all there is to it.
And who on earth would seek to drive through press regulation via the statue book, when precisely the same level of regulation can be secured on a voluntary basis? That is bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; Then look at Levesonâs proposal for Ofcom to have ultimate oversight of this new regulatory body. The current head of Ofcom is a man called Ed Richards. I used to work alongside Ed Richards when I worked in Parliament. Heâs an excellent regulator of unimpeachable integrity. But heâs also a former senior adviser to Gordon Brown.
&gt;
&gt; Lord Justice Leveson was at pains yesterday to underline not just the importance of the press and politicians having an independent relationship, but â and he stressed this â to be seen to have an independent relationship. Is that seriously going to be achieved by giving a former aide to Gordon Brown ultimate responsibility for regulation of the press? That too would be bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; Then thereâs the proposal on contacts between the media and politicians. Leveson says that leaders, ministers and shadow ministers, and their âagentsâ, should publish âa fair and reasonably complete picture, by way of general estimate only"", of âcorrespondence, phone, text and emailâ communications with journalists. Whatâs a general estimate? Whatâs a reasonably complete picture? Is an aide to some shadow minister who rings me and says âYouâre not going to believe what Ed Milibandâs done nowâ going to have to record that conversation and declare it? Bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; And it goes on. For police officers meeting journalists âguidance should more specifically set out the dangers of consuming alcohol in a setting of casual hospitality (without necessarily specifying a blanket ban)â. Whatâs going to be the drink-journo limit? One pint? Two? Bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; On âOff-the-record briefingsâ, Leveson says âIn relation to the term off-the-record, I believe that serious consideration should be given to its removal from the lexicon of police and media contactâ. He says âThe term 'off-the-record briefing' should be discontinued. The term 'non-reportable briefing' should be used to cover a background briefing which is not to be reportedâ. Discontinued? By whom? Is he saying the press should reflect that in their copy? That to write âoff-the-recordâ will be to breach the new statutory regulatory code? Weâve seriously reached the point where specific journalistic phrases are to be regulated? Utterly, utterly bonkers.
&gt;
&gt; There is much in Leveson to be welcomed. And there is much to be scared of. The idea that we should now give Leveson a blank cheque, and rush to cast his findings in stone and statute, is insane. Most, if not all, of those demanding its full implementation havenât had the time to fully read it, never mind fully digest its findings.
&gt;
&gt; Iâve only managed to skim Leveson myself. It may well pass the victim test. But it certainly doesnât pass the bonkers test. David Cameron is right; his critics at the Vichy Evening News are wrong.","1354321584"

I was in a similar position to you. I lived off campus one year and was taking a French course. However, at where I stayed, we only had one car to share between a few people. This caused me to miss quite a few of my French classes (it was at 9:00am, my others were in the afternoon). In total, I probably missed 40% of my French classes that semester. I was certain that my professor absolutely hated me, even though I did well on all the written and oral exams. After I knew this was going to be a common occurrence and already missed many classes, I took the time to talk to her after one of our classes. I explained to her that I'm not intentionally skipping and that I am in this crappy predicament and love her teaching and the class. Surprisingly, she was very supportive of me and said that everything is fine. She was very appreciative that I went out of my way to notify her because even though she did not make attendance mandatory, she factored it into our final grade. Now, I don't know if your professor will react the same way. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. But it doesn't hurt to tell them the truth.","1354321595"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","On its face, there is nothing wrong with it; animals eat other animals, that's just the way it is. However, we don't live in a world where eating animals is the only way to get the required nutrients. Animals (at least the ones we consume) are fully sentient beings, and, therefore, deserve moral consideration. Can you justify killing another fully sentient being for no other reason that pleasure? No, I don't think you can. In this world, eating animals is not ethically justifiable.

We are uniquely capable of appreciating reasons to do some things and not others and rationally assessing the consequences of our actions and beliefs. Because we live in a dynamic world with new kinds of moral problems developing all the time, thereâs an ongoing need to develop and refine our sense of morality. Our collective moral progress depends upon the extent which we are able and willing to examine our most cherished beliefs and share moral insights through education. 

Was eating animals perfectly ethical at one point in time? Absolutely.

Is it ethically justifiable now? No, its not.","1354321596"

If you want to cut military spending then do it, but you can't spend the money you cut elsewhere. Otherwise all you are doing is digging a hole and filling it up. You feel like you made a difference and feel better, but you are in the same position you were in before. You didn't solve anything.

Just a side note: We saw today on the front page that an economist is claiming infrastructure has a multiplier of 2 which would be higher than any other sector. We can't say this is true though, since it is only one study. We have to wait and see if this holds true under more eyes.","1354321599"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;I don't know. I've never met an intactivist who wasn't also a hardcore feminist, so I might disagree with your assessment that feminists care little about male circumcision. 

This entire community is full of intactivists that aren't feminists. If feminists care so much about male circumcision, then can you please show me some instances of feminists doing literally anything about it? Feminists seem to have no problem organizing ""Slut-Walks"" and rallying protests over minor issues, but I have yet to see any feminist organizations do anything for male circumcision. Not to mention, I haven't met a ""hardcore feminist"" that cared whatsoever for men's rights, period.

&gt;I've also never heard a woman declare that a man must be circumcised before she has sex with him. 

It certainly occurs. 

&gt;I have heard, however, that ""uncircumcised penises are gross and dirty,"" ""sex is better with a circ'ed/uncirc'ed penis,"" ""boys will make fun of you in the locker room if you have a foreskin..."" 

So, how are feminists helping combat this? We are bombarded daily about how women are held to ""ridiculous standards"" by men, but the women who claim this get a free pass?

&gt;Generally I ignore ignorance and stupidity because it is ignorant and stupid. But yes, I can see how that is judgmental and oppressive. 

That is the problem. Feminists ignore men's issues. I don't see many feminists ignoring ""rape jokes"" or ""slut-shaming"", but they're more than willing to ignore men's issues.","1354321602"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Tariffs were the primary source of income, although excise and property taxes also were a revenue source.  The [1789 Hamilton Tariff](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large/Volume_1/1st_Congress/1st_Session/Chapter_2) was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the US Congress, mainly to pay off war debts.  Excise and direct taxes tended to be relied upon more when military conflicts or a reduction of imports required them.  Not all of these were especially popular, with events like the Whiskey Rebellion occurring in direct response to an excise tax.  Tariffs led to regional conflicts between the North and South exemplified by the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 and the subsequent Nullification Crisis.  

The first federal income tax appeared during the Civil War as a temporary measure.  In 1894, the WilsonâGorman Tariff included an income tax to balance out reduced tariffs.  The Supreme Court later ruled in *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Company* that this was an unconstitutional direct tax, as it was not apportioned based on representation.  The 1913 ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (Income Tax) would supersede this ruling, and income tax revenue would soon surpass tariff revenue.","1354321613"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;OK but I still find it understand why transgressions against it must be rectified, if it is not good or right to obey or bad not to. 

I think there are two distinct explanations. First, that even if the NAP is not directly tied to morality, it tends to approximate morality when it applies and in non-life boat type situations.

Secondly, it is possible that a violation of the NAP is only morally permissible if it is later rectified. For example, if I need your boat in order to escape a desert island, but am unable to ask for your permission, it could be morally right to just use the boat only if after the fact, I find you to return the boat and compensate you for its use.

Rothbard writes about similar situations here http://mises.org/daily/1628

&gt;I find it very hard to separate law from justice and justice from morality.

My guess is that this is true only because we are speaking about libertarianism and in this case talking about what libertarians believe the law should be as translating into morality rather than the opposite.

Do you think that religious people ought to believe that the law should make all sins illegal? For example, is a Christian or Muslim who believes homosexuality is immoral and a sin a hypocrite if they don't want to criminalize it?

If you think of all of the possible combinations of legality and morality, there are 4 scenarios - legal and moral, legal and immoral, illegal and moral and illegal and immoral. Legal and moral and illegal and immoral are easy cases. 

As a libertarian, I should think the case of being legal and immoral shouldn't be too hard for you wrap your head around. Just because something like prostitution or drug use should be legal, doesn't have to imply that all people should consider it moral.

The difficult one is this case that I can see you are struggling with is the idea that something should be illegal, yet moral. Even if you believe that violations of the NAP, things that should be illegal, must also be immoral, it doesn't mean that legality and morality must be the same thing because of moral obligations that go above and beyond mere legality.

&gt;I'm not sure I fully buy into the NAP 100% so I'm more libertarian-esque than libertarian. I'm more familiar with classical liberal stuff like John Locke and Frederic Bastiat...

I think that explains things. Would you be interested in a reading a book?

The disparity between representation and vote is greater with FPP than PR. If they were a very small minority they could never gain power under PR. If anything, a Party has greater chance of gaining power under FPP than PR, not the other way around.

It is true that if 10% of the voting public identifies with a party, then they have a much greater chance of gaining around 10% of the representation. But again, that's democracy.

"news","t5_2qh3l","The difference between Portugal and US is that the latter legalized marijuana. Portugal has just decriminalized the usage. The US drug laws have been way too harsh to this point, jailing people instead of giving them any help, but I feel the legalization just goes far too much to the other direction. Decriminalization would have been a healthier choice for now, to see what happens.

At the same time, The Netherlands is trying to ban the use of drugs and they have been ""allowing"" them for a long time.

From my perspective, I would say the amount of people smoking marijuana will grow. I know people who won't do drugs where it's illegal, but they have done it in Amsterdam where it's legal. I'm going there next year and I have to admit I have thought about it, but still probably I'll skip because I don't feel it's right as my country doesn't allow it. It might be different in the US where A LOT of people smoke if it's legal or not anyways, but I guess the next years will show the results of the states that legalized marijuana.

About the traffic drug testing, my friend 15-20 years ago crashed with a bicycle to a moped in full speed, both literally flying through the air. My friend was drunk, the other guy had taken drugs. My friend took the blame of it, because the police conducted only alcohol breathalyzer tests... It has come a long way from those days of course, but I still think the offender has to be taken to tests and can't be tested by the police.

Anyway thanks for the end compliments, the discussion is what I'm after rather than a flame war, because this way I get to see the point what the other side is trying to offer.

What, exactly, is wrong with the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy?

&gt;Isn't false dichotomy somewhere on the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy?

I never set one up.  If you make a case for *p*, you make a case against *not p.*  Creationism has an implied premise 'Evolution does not occur,' and as such, evidence that it does is detrimental to it.

Also, I never ruled out the possibility of other options.  I feel like you don't fully understand the fallacies you're accusing me of.

&gt;You are posing a challenge, but the response to such challenges are irrelevant to you.

No, you didn't *respond* to any challenge.  You dismissed them as challenges a creationist wouldn't use.  They remain challenges -- this didn't make any of them disappear.

&gt; This is the quintessential of exactly what a failure the enterprise of modern philosophy truly is.   Oh sorry, did I just jump to a conclusion? You're right ... I cannot assume you are of a philosophical persuasion can I?

I'm unsure what you mean by ""this.""  And it's clear now what you're issue is with this thread; you seem to have an aversion to philosophy.  I don't understand that at all.

&gt;Really? And who is your audience? Who do you think is listening to you?

True... and you improve their market.  If you pirate, chances are extremely high that you play a lot of different games, right?  Chances are very high that you talk about the games you play, too.  This makes you a source that other gamers, less technically capable ones, listen to when they talk about games.  They listen, and when they hear about a good game from you, they buy.  Word-of-mouth advertising is well-known as the most phenomenal form of advertising because it is almost unbelievably successful.  Publishers don't want to admit to it (due to entirely unrelated problems where most of the public is incapable of processing and reasoning about any issue which has any but two absolute sides) but pirates sell an awful lot of games.  That's why I don't see piracy as an effective means of putting pressure on publishers.

I'm in the same boat with you, I rarely play games any more.  I do continue to buy indie games both to support a better future for gaming and because they are often the only group putting out games that interest me (probably more a consequence of the ridiculous level of censorship in the gaming market (which gamers mostly approve of and hardly ever question) than just market response).  I was a big gamer for decades, which is why it really saddens me to see the gamer culture turn into what it has.  I am not devoid of hope, but it certainly seems that any improvement in the gaming medium will be done in spite of the majority of gamers, not because of them.  Most of the problems that the gaming community faces (inability to take action based on principle, belief that since their one action can't change everything it justifies making bad practices the most profitable ones, etc) spread far wider than just the gaming community, but gamers seem the hardest hit.  Every other medium has people who fight censorship, in the gaming community the attitude is ""well, some games ARE bad for kids and parents NEED to have ratings to tell what is appropriate, and I don't give a shit about 'artistic' games anyway"".  Every other medium has already gone through the whole 'publishers want money for nothing and want to get rid of property rights' battle, and it was a vigorous fight whereas in gaming it's a foregone conclusion and the publishers have already won.  

I really WANT gaming to become a thriving artistic medium just like other mediums, and so it makes me sad when I see things like this War Z debacle happening and know that no amount of Internet bitching ever amounts to any significant loss to the publishers because gamers still buy the game or pirate it and talk it up encouraging more sales.","1354321636"

"Ebay","t5_2qh7g","If I mess up, I usually give them a little extra back to keep them quiet. You will not be able to include it in a refund, if was a cheap item, I send them separately $1-2 extra for the trouble. If they have to send something back (I messed up a ring size for instance), I will give them $5 or more depending on their trouble. I don't make many mistakes but I make sure the customer knows that I care about their time. This is a bit over the top but I have maintained 100% feedback after doing this for years, my philosophy is that one day I will have to dig my heels in on a big issue and will take the feedback hit when it is worth taking a stand.

The real point I wanted to make about the cheap toys is that there is tons of stuff out there to sell where you make way more money for the same effort. If you are willing to take some pictures and do a little research there is a nice little income to be made.

Do a Google search for ""estate sales lansing"" (that is where Ebay says that your items are located). There are sales on tomorrow. I would be willing to wager you could spend $100 and make $200-300 if you do your homework. Go to a sale, make a list of things that look interesting, take pics if necessary, go back home and look them up on completed listings. If you have a laptop with a wireless card or very good with your phone you can do this on the fly. Doing research on your phone is difficult but it can work. Be prepared for 19 out of 20 things you thought had promise to be losers, it takes time to know what a good buy looks like. Sometimes it is old magazines, there are particular woodworking mags that sell for $3-5 each and you can buy a huge box sometimes for $5. Old technical books can good, particularly ham radio stuff. If something looks unusual then your spidey senses should tingle, often times a strange item can mean big bucks but you have to figure out what it is. Make sure you go look all over the item for damage and markings such as name brand, model, serial number, etc. Serial numbers can be a big deal on old stuff, where it is in the series can change the value considerably. You don't have to be an expert on items, just observe enough to properly identify what you have from all the various guides available online. Estate sales usually reduce the tagged price by a certain percentage each day, typically 50% or better on the last day. Some estate sales will negotiate, others will not, ask quietly with an item in your hand if they can do better on the price. Stay away from large items unless you can make a big profit, I would rather sell 5 little things at $20 profit than deal with a big hard to ship item for $100. If you are looking at an item and you cannot describe what it is in an Ebay listing, it will be difficult to sell, do your homework on what things are called and how the condition is assessed. Good condition on a 100 year old book is different than the latest fad diet book. 

Anyway, you might not be interested in this type of thing, but it is a good way to make money.

This is because of activating the trigeminal nerve while chewing, also activates the other branch of the trigeminal nerve responsible for propioception. 


So to sum up, chewing while driving will help keep you alert (I do it when feeling sleepy, it works). Not sure about the exam acuity tho.

She is technically correct and she used the word correctly. It is sododmy. Whether you believe this type of sodomy is moral or immoral is up to you but it is still sodomy because of the fact that this method of sexual activity wasn't meant for ""procreation"", but rather purely enjoyment.

I basically agree with you. The problem is that our society views being ""bigger"" as bad and separate from normal. So when people point this out (or weirdly go out of their way to omit talking about your size when it is relevant to the discussion) it other-izes that person.

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","Jetpack behaviour is filled with inconsistencies, the most bothersome aspect of the jetpack is the low power and the 72kph acceleration cap. It's also more effective to rock back and forth when using the jetpack then simply holding the jetpack on, which is stupid. The jetpack is also quite limited in its direction, making gaining speed quite a drag. Numerous other issues not worth adressing.

Skiing has multiple ""broken"" elements. Carving tops out at 100kph, refuses to work below 60kph or above 160kph (IIRC). There is a lack of friction in skiing, which makes keeping speed way too easy when you got regenerating health + disc jumps, the only limit being the map itself. The physics are also too forgiving in terms of collision and awkward landing, makes movement too skill-less.

Air control exists and is strong and free. This makes it easier to dodge shots without requiring nearly any skill as well as makes movement way easier.

Weapon inheritance is fucked. At the very least chains should be 100%. I think everything should, but tribes vets mostly disagree with me due to numerous factors, some make sense, some don't.

Rock bouncing was effectively removed, and I think people would love to have it back.

Splash damage and impulse aren't linear, but instead it's one of two effects, depending on how close the explosion is, full or lessened effect. This removes control.

And perhaps the most irrational: flag drag.

For syrup, plugging the nose, chugging, and then taking a chaser works pretty well.  If you can say ""do it with Mommy/Daddy!"" and drink the ""medicine"" with your kid, that may help too (obviously don't actually take their medicine!

I mean if these issues were new and you'd been together for years, I could understand thinking he should be by your side the whole way through. That isn't the case though. Keep in mind, being single does not mean having to be alone. You can find friends by talking to classmates. Invite one to hang out with you. Do something fun. Go hiking with someone, grab lunch, drink coffee, listen to local hipster bands or whatever it is you're interested in. Social anxiety keep you from doing that? Try forums. Look up events that are local for hobbies that interest you and meet friends that way. The world is full of opportunities for friendship. You need to differentiate between being single and being alone though. Hell, call a cousin, a parent, a sibling, or an aunt/uncle just today hi and chat for a bit. ","1354321668"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This is just a form of fideism. Basically if you are a theist you have to find a way to make faith trump or at least put it on an equal level with reason. Think of faith and reason as two circles. In moderate fideism reason and faith overlap but some faith is beyond reason. Reason in this view is ministerial to faith. It helps to justify some aspects of faith but not everything about faith can be know with reason. In extreme fideism reason and faith do not overlap at all and are contradictory. If faith is contained within reason than reason is said to play magisterial role to faith. 

**Martin Luther said human reason should be âministerialâ rather than âmagisterialâ in its theological uses.**
A magisterial use of reason in theology would involve employing it like a magistrate standing in judgment over the Christian gospel to determine whether or not it is true apart from dependence on the Bible and the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, human reason is ministerial when it is guided by and in service of Godâs wisdom (made available to us in his Word and through his Spirit). So for Luther, as for Aquinas, theology is the queen and philosophy is the queenâs handmaiden.

&gt;âThe magisterial use of reason occurs when reason stands over and above the gospel like a magistrate and judges it on the basis of argument and evidence.  The ministerial use of reason occurs when reason submits to and serves the gospel.  In light of the Spiritâs witness, only the ministerial use of reason is legitimate.  Philosophy is rightly the handmaid of theology.  Reason is a tool to help us better understand and defend our faith; as Anselm put it, ours is a faith that seeks understanding.  A person who knows that Christianity is true on the basis of the witness of the Spirit may also have a sound apologetic which reinforces or confirms for him the Spiritâs witness, but it does not serve as the basis of his belief.ââ William Lane Craig, Reasonable Faith (Crossway, 2008), 47-48.

TLDR; If you accept faith as a valid reason to believe something you have to downplay reason because religion doesn't make sense. ","1354321668"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","&gt;This logic is baffling.

It's used to explain the whole ""defensive player deserving it"" concept. If he's the most outstanding player in CFB, he should be the most impactful player at his position.

RGIII was more impactful in college than Luck was. Luck was a better QB, though.

Johnny is the most impactful QB in CFB this year, though you could argue who the ""best"" is.

Te'o isn't the most impactful LB this year, and certainly not the most impactful defensive player. UGA has a shot at the title because Jarvis won the game against Florida for them. Te'o didn't win Stanford or USC, and you can watch his tape and see that.","1354321668"

"funny","t5_2qh33","If intelligence can be inherited (I don't think this can be denied without willful ignorance) then it's perfectly reasonable to question if races vary in this regard fundamentally, because genetics of races are indeed different.  It also is perfectly reasonable, though perhaps distasteful, for people to advocate smart people to have more kids as a result, even if they actually reproduce a whole lot less.

Also, we see the success of Asians (even on their own, starting from poverty) and it's certainly a curious topic... China, is the 3rd highest testing country when compared to the OECD list but most graduates are extremely poor and their education spending is about 1/10th the USA per student.

SES seems to be a bit of wishful thinking given the body of contrary evidence.  Though you do have some psychologists that like to do ""paper studies"" where they attempt to account for factors they hope cause these differences, but don't actually study anything.

For instance, if you have a race of parents that are all 80-85 IQ (the current black population) can they produce on average 100-105 range kids? Heritability says no... as do the studies.

The question then becomes, as we blaze ahead spending more per student than any other nation to teach them and getting way worse results and actually a negative gap increase (the gap between blacks and whites is rising again)... what exactly are we spending money on?","1354321668"

The treble roll off is too much for my tastes, and there's too much midbass, it seems to bleed into the mids. It also seems a bit slow and the soundstage isn't great, but all of this is coming from AKGs, which are known for being pretty treble-happy and fast.

The only things I like about them really is how well made they are, and they have a select few songs they actually sound great with in my collection. Really dark, with a strong underlying midbass throughout the song.

I'm fine with a decent amount of bass and mid bass, but it can't muddle up the rest. In fact, one of my favorite pairs of headphones was the Klipsch Image S4, known for having a decent bass bloat, but they also have some killer treble IMO.

What began as minimal, small-ensemble score, ended up being a full orchestra augmented with taikos, ethnic woodwinds, bagpipes, electric violin, rock and roll, Italian opera, elevator music, Bob Dylan, gamelan, choir, biwa and more.

Sample libraries. The more you use them, the more your music sounds generic and like everyone else's.  So, the more you use them, the harder you need to work to add your own personal flair.  Don't get me wrong, they're an essential tool.  But, I think it's unwise to rely entirely upon them.

Working on BSG and Eureka simultaneously was fun, because scoring one was a relief from the other.  It actually balanced out my brain.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt; allegations that the children's birth father had sexually abused two of his daughters and had held a knife to his wife's head while she was holding their baby

Charming

&gt; it is believed social workers do not want the parents to know exactly where the children are living because of safety concerns

So they may be a danger to their children.

&gt; The children's parents, Roma who moved to Rotherham, told the Guardian they have been in and out of family courts trying to get their children back after they returned from an earlier foster placement unable to speak their mother tongue.

If they've had their children taken away at least twice, that suggests to me that they probably aren't very good parents. 

If they don't want their children speaking English, why do they want to bring them up in England where there will presumably go to English schools and if they're here for any length of time will think of themselves as English? Seems a bit unrealistic to me.

In any case, what's wrong with their kids speaking English? The whole basis of the EU from the cultural point of view is we're all Europeans now, and we welcome other European cultures. And iexpect the way the EU is going, speaking English will be a lot better for people's prospects than speaking Slovak. If these people don't like the English language and British culture, **why don't they just fuck off out of our country**?

&gt; But a family court judge ruled three of the children should be returned to the parents after the birth parents successfully argued that the council had failed in their duty to ensure the children enjoyed the linguistic right to learn and speak the language of their birth.

A bloody stupid right: if parents want their child to learn Slovak, bring them up in Slovakia; it isn't rocket science. And given that there are people in the UK from al over the world, it's unrealistic that if their children are put into care, that social services will always be able to find a foster family with the same language. Again, if immigrants don't like that, we're not forcing them to stay.

I am not against foreigners, and I think immigration, if done right, can benefit Britain. But I see no reason to bend over backwards to people who feel contempt for British people and our culture; they should either integrate or leave.","1354321677"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There are no natural rights.  You have no rights unless society protects them.

What is a ""natural right"" in one place does not exist at all elsewhere.

Setting up punishments for things that people do wrong is regulation.  That's the end of it.  If society didn't believe you have a right to not be victimized by the nobility society would not protect you.  You'd be on your own.

The idea of natural rights is a false one.  If you were born in the wilderness and abandoned you would know nothing of them.

There is also no such thing as a free market.  Only a market free from *certain* types of regulation.  All markets are regulated to some extent.","1354321689"
"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'll take a shot at this. I'm going to have to take a pretty narrow shot though. You ask many questions and I cannot answer them all (I just ain't that smart). I'll stick with the question in the title and leave the rest for now.

Before I get to my point though, I'd like to point out that I am a creationist, though I haven't looked through the material recently concerning young earth, or the various other collections of interest about the anthropic principle, intelligent design and other sub-topics. I'm just going to stick to my problem with evolution and why I remain skeptical.

First is, it appears to me when I run across ""news"" with regard to evolution it always involves some ""change or challenge"" to what I understand the theory of evolution to be. (Perhaps we are not talking about the same theory of evolution.)

An example: ""was dinosaur 'x' warm or cold blooded?"" I've seen whole television specials on networks (like Discovery, etc) that should be reasonably well informed. I suppose I could sit down and think through the last few of these I've run into, but you get the idea. There are parts of evolution that seem to be debated among scientists.

Does that make evolution wrong? Not at all, but it does mean that the sorts of ""dammit those idiots just won't accept the unassailable truth about the origin of species""-confidence seems more like bravado than it does rational thought. From my point of view, there is no such thing as ""the theory of evolution"" there are a collection of theories about aspects of a entire branch of science. Many of these individual aspects of the larger science might prove to be wrong without the whole ship coming down; but the fact that there is legitimate, scientific study (you all haven't packed up your books and gone home because we know everything about evolution) means that there is more to learn and that the acrimony and hubris in the face of what is yet unknown is uncalled for.

When someone asks me why I don't just accept the truth and stop being an idiot, I am reminded of my parents collection of the ""best articles from the Encyclopedia Britannica"" (that's not the title, but it is something like that). This same sort of hubris is contained in articles from decades to a century ago wherein it was insisted that things like female orgasm don't exist and other such nonsense. It is not hard to find quotes from scientists of a given age insisting that something was SCIENCE that was later rejected or at least revised significantly with new findings.

None of this says evolution is wrong. It says the scientific method is best when the scientist is humble in the face of the unknown rather than confident in what he thinks he knows. Evolution sits in one of those places (because of the political, religious and philosophical implications) that seems to generate overcompensation. 

**TL;DR I'm not against evolution, per se; but have strong reservations about aspects of the theory which appear to be in flux and the rhetoric I've seen from those invested in the theory.**

Side note, science (that is, the scientific method) depends on two things. First, radical empiricism (which I have philosophical problems with) and inductive reasoning. I like the utilitarian value of science; but I have no problem refusing to give science the persuasive force of deductive conclusion or accepting other theories of knowledge.

The videogame fanon is not exactly a serious one.

Whatever you do, play Ass Bros, the game's setting is the best in the series, the story it's most focused, and the highlights of the game are these assassinations that you can complete in any order, and however you like. And the opening is the only one in the series that works.

If you're going to play AC2, do it before you play Ass Bros. Some of the best narrative turns in the game are how things change going from 2 to brotherhood, and the ending of AC2 is fantastic.

"javascript","t5_2qh30","Hate to be the downer, but these aren't ""widgets"", they are microblocks. In SVG they'd be called ""symbols"", small collections that you can reuse. Its cool that you have applied this to voxel blocks, and potentially you could trade/sell them with each other, but that isn't what makes Minecraft or any other game interesting, unless the purpose of this game is to be a voxel modeller.

I sometimes wonder when people use Minecraft to show off their ""skills"" at what point they should just crack out Blender to make some cool 3D models to show off. The problem is that in the 3D space, there aren't common file formats that work in all browsers (though X3DOM looks semi promising) and so the ""game"" also acts as a sort of universal ""browser"". Plus, its fun to see what you can do with the limitations that you have (limitations means people have to be more creative).

Minecraft was very fun for me for a couple weeks and then that was it, once I knew I could start from scratch and get diamond within half an hour, the modelling / crafting was the thing that kept it interesting... if anything though, the 3D aspect gets annoying after a while, endless walking around trying to find things etc.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","I worked with cases like yours in another state, so some of this information may not be entirely accurate to SC.

You have a right to request a hearing on the issue.  At the hearing, you have a right to present evidence and argue your case.  You can bring whoever you want with you to the hearing, including attorneys.  

For an unintentional overpayment, there are two main arguments.  1) It was not an overpayment.  It sounds like that is not a valid argument in your case, as you are clearly over income.  2) While it was an overpayment, demanding repayment is contrary to notions of justice and fairness, and therefore you should not be held responsible for repaying the overpayment.  This is your better argument.

It is called equitable estoppel (EE).  EE in WA (where I am) is established by case law, so it may exist in a different form in SC.  However, the gist of it is that the agency acted inconsistently, they acted with all the correct information given to them, you have clean hands, and demanding repayment is inequitable.

It seems to me like you would probably meet all these general factors.  You provided all requested information, and they had it when they approved you.  You caught their error, and informed them (clean hands).  They told you that you could utilize the SNAP benefits already on your EBT card, and now they are demanding repayment (inconsistent action).  You cannot afford to repay the overpayment (inequitable). 

However, even if your argument for equitable estoppel fails, you can still negotiate for a payment plan.  In WA, this was done with the Office of Financial Recovery (which is separate from DSHS (our version of DSS)).  I had some clients who were able to get repayment plans of $25 a month for *intentional* program violations.  For unintentional, it can be a few bucks a month.

There are often legal aid offices to help with these kinds of issues.  Try 211 and see if you can get a referral.  My knowledge of EE could be way off for SC.","1354321710"

This is the same reason why cancer patients will sometimes lose friends or their significant other, because people don't know how to handle the threat of death. The main reason there is such a stigma surrounding HIV is because it occurs predominantly in the gay community, and it's pretty obvious that a large portion of the population stigmatizes gay people.

But, then the marriage movement gained some serious momentum nationwide. Legislation for marriage was introduced by Greg Harris (longstanding legendary gay politician, he also sponsored the Civil Unions bill) in February 2012. There are also a few lawsuits happening right now, I think Lambda Legal and the ACLU are involved, like Rudas_Iskariot said. So it's a matter of whether it goes through judicial or legislative branch first, I think. 

So, ""how close"" is hard. But I agree with Rudas that next couple years is likely. And whether the Supreme Court takes the Prop 8 case (which they didn't comment on today, as they were expected to) could be very important.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Being mature means being able to sit down and talk about things without flying off the handle and then ignoring the other person when they try to talk to you. And despite what you are implying here, this situation is not that big of a revelation. There are a lot of people who, for one reason or another, remain legally married to their exes for extended periods of time following formal separation. It's not an uncommon situation and certainly isn't a reason for hysterics, especially when the people in question live in a mandatory waiting period district. 


OP is legally married still, yes. But as he already explained, he is completely separated from his former partner and only waiting for the slow wheels of the court system to turn. He is not cheating on his wife. He is not cheating on his girlfriend. This should be an easy concept to understand for most people. The gf knew he had an ex-wife and probably knew the timeframe of their split up. After OP explained about the mandatory waiting period, that should have been the end of the discussion.


How the discussion between OP and a mature person would have gone (paraphrased, of course):


GF:  Are you still legally married to your wife?


OP:  Yes. Not sure if you know this, but where we live has a mandatory waiting period. We're definitely separated, though; which you already know because you've been to my house we spend most of our time together.


GF:  Well, I can't believe you wouldn't tell me something so important!


OP:  I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to keep secrets from you. I just didn't see it as a big deal. I think of her as my ex. We're not together and I've obviously moved on. I don't think of myself as being married and it doesn't really affect me, so it didn't occur to me to bring it up.


GF:  When will you be divorced?


OP:  Things should be finalized _______. Like I said, it's just paperwork. I don't think of myself as being married anymore.


GF:  OK.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Everything is subjective, just like your statements. We don't need to sneak around, because a rat isn't going to kill us if it sees us in its house. We do live off gathered food, it's gathered in grocery stores. Additionally, we learned how to cultivate foods well enough that we don't have to worry about our survival. *And* we can cultivate a multitude of foods out of their traditional season. 

I once saw a rat at my work (I worked at a gas station). It was winter, it was walking very slowly. I put a quarter in this little vending machine, and got some mixed nuts. I crushed them up, and took them to the rat. When I got closer, I saw that one of his hands was really messed up, its breathing was ragged, and it looked very frightened. I felt so bad for him, because I knew he was going to die. He tried to eat the nuts, but couldn't with one hand. I felt horrible. My point in telling you this story, is A) to humanize myself, because I do have feelings for animals &amp; you're talking to me like I don't. And B) to illustrate how humans are superior. That rat cannot heal himself, he will die. We no longer have to worry about a serious injury as much. Sure, it'll suck.. But you'll probably make it through. A friend of mine lost an arm in a car accident. She still manages pretty well, but if she'd lost an arm 200 years ago, she'd have died.

No I'm not saying humans are better at being humans than any other animal. That statement doesn't even make sense. We can be superior, we are superior at a lot of things. I'm not saying what we do is more important, which seems to be what people are getting out of my argument. We can be superior without being more important or having delusions of grandeur.

What you are asserting is that everything is objective. Rather the opposite, everything subjective. Value-judgments cannot be eradicated. We are constantly judging everything and everyone around us. You cannot tell me you've achieved complete objectivity, simply because you passed judgment on the value of my argument. You made a value-judgment, as you say they do not exist. We are all variations of the same consciousness, experiencing itself subjectively. Everything. *Is.* Subjective. Yes, it's easy to say things just are. But that is a very defeatist attitude. Our world is pretty fucked up and you're prepared to just say, welp that's how things are? Sad.","1354321727"

He basically did what sensible conquerors of large functioning governments usually do - he took the org chart of the Persian Empire, crossed out  ""Darius III"" at the top and wrote in ""Alexander"", crossed out the names of some (but not all) of the Persian nobles in the next level down and wrote in the names of some Greek generals and administrators, and told everybody, *""Carry on, guys.""*

The Persian Empire was a *much*  bigger polity than anything the Greeks had ever tried to administer previously.  There was already plenty of confusion due to the war, conquest, and Alexander's continuing campaigns. Better to leave everything in place as much as possible, at least for the first few years.

There are 7 walmarts within an hour of where i live. There isn't another market in the entire area, besides one target that is three cities over. If this company decided to get up and move to say california or new york, this town would become a ghost town. It's somewhat scary to think of for people that live here. They also have progressive LED maps that show the growth of the company like this, except theirs show the entire planet. I know the CEO and his son, he is payed close to 15 million dollars a year. It's our own little taste of the future.","1354321729"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I'm don't think this is correct.  The choice not to dimple cars is not about manufacturing cost.  If it were advantageous to dimple cars but expensive, then [high-end cars that undergo hours of wind-tunnel testing](http://vimeo.com/50360124) would incorporate dimples.

I think the cars that have vortex generators employ them to keep flow attached so that it will pass over a wing, to get more downforce.  I think in the turbulent scheme, where cars traveling at highway speeds stay, this comes at the cost of drag and thus, fuel economy.  So it doesn't help most cars, but only cars that have wings in places where the flow becomes detached.

Other things to consider are that pressing dimples isn't really that costly.  Yes, there is cost, but changing the geometry of the tools for manufacturing body panels isn't a big cost driver.  There would be some upfront cost in analysis of how to define the dimple pattern, but once aero characteristics are satisfied, the design gets incorporated into the tooling for the panels, and then sheet metal gets pressed, or plastics get molded, but either way, dimples wouldn't add much manufacturing cost.

Finally, cars don't purely look like they do because of cost and aero characteristics.  Styling plays a huge role in car cales, and the ""dimpled"" car look hasn't ever caught on.","1354321732"

"funny","t5_2qh33","At least she bought a cup.

I'm in a college town, lots of undergrads like to study in the Starbucks and sometimes they don't even buy anything.

I thought that was bad, but then I noticed some of them brought thier *own food and drinks* and ate them inside the Starbucks so they could use the Wifi and enjoy the atmosphere.

But honestly, I can't even be mad at those people because last winter they all got one up'd by this one dude. He came into the Starbucks and brought his own food, some sort of pasta in a tupperware, he then asked the barista to microwave his tupperware (which they did) so he could eat his warm baked pasta at their table. It was full of spices so when he ate the pasta it really smelled Italian, so that section of the coffee shop got invaded with smells of cheese and basil, which clashed with the naturally coffee aroma you expect. As a final kick to the balls, the dude then goes up to the barista and asks for a glass of water with ice (which is free). 

Let's review.

- Used their WiFi and occupied their tables

- Brought in food from outside store, which is against their rules.

- Made the area smell bad.

- Bothered the baristas for their microwave, taking up their time while paying nothing.

- Ordered water, again wasting their time and resources. 

But no one kicked him out. People in Wisconsin are too nice, we're almost Canadian. But anyway, my point is the girl above who bought 1 drink and stayed for 5 hours, she was at least considerate enough to buy something.","1354321735"

Tengo la ilusiÃ³n de que en el sur, no es ver que ellos pueden hacer por su estado o mÃ­nimo su ciudad, es simplemente decir que puede hacer el gobierno por ellos (pues para esto estÃ¡ que no?), sÃ³lo levantan la mano.

SÃ³lo piensan en que MÃ©xico estÃ© igual de jodido y en ""derrocar"" al malvado gobierno para que llegue uno que les regale todo, es precisamente por que han crecido asÃ­, desde siempre han estado rodeados de recursos, por lo que a lo Ãºnico que estÃ¡n acostumbrados es a levantar la mano y que la comida les llegue.

AquÃ­ incluso en la iglesia a la que asisto, nos dicen que no se puede estar viviendo de la lÃ¡stima de Dios (misericordia), que Dios nos quiere ver prosperados, y que hay que esforzarse para eso y que Dios nos bendecirÃ¡.


Son simplemente ideologÃ­as distintas, a mi me enseÃ±aron desde chico a que nadie me va a regalar nada, que todo me lo tengo que ganar con el sudor de mi frente, y eso es lo que he hecho.

Ahora, si un niÃ±o piensa que se merece todo, es el camino perfecto para volverse un delincuente, por que, eso de que ser pobre te obliga a ser criminal es una competa estupidez, si fuera cierto, por quÃ© existen narcodiputados si ganan los mejores sueldos del paÃ­s?

Ahora, si te fijas, la migraciÃ³n a los estados norteÃ±os es de las principales causas de delincuencia, es un simple choque entre culturas, si alguien viene de un estado que estÃ¡ en la pobredumbre, que estÃ¡ acostumbrado a que le regalen todo, etc, a un estado donde es mÃ¡s prÃ³spero con mejor nivel de vida, la persona va a querer que le regalen todo, y como no lo va a conseguir, va a robar y a delinquir.

Aclaro, no por ser pobre, si no por su medio y sus ideologÃ­as de donde esa persona creciÃ³.


Yo por supuesto que hago cosas para contribuir al paÃ­s, pago mis impuestos, reduzco mi cantidad de desperdicios al mÃ¡ximo, reciclo, soy cortÃ©s y educado al manejar, me he ido a plantar arbolitos a comunidades alejadas de la ciudad, he armado frankeinsteins de computadoras (funcionales 100%) para primarias de bajos recursos, digo, no es que me las quiera dar de la madre teresa, pero no digas cosas de que soy elitista o racista si no me conoces.

Esto lo he hecho por amor a mi estado (BC o NL), lo regionalistas que somos los norteÃ±os nos ha ayudado a seguir siendo los mÃ¡s fregones del paÃ­s (al CONEVAL me remito).","1354321756"

If something is correct it is correct, yet you want to not trust the thing that is correct because you don't like the person saying it. Both stupid and wrong.

"MECoOp","t5_2tkk1","Gotta agree that good old fashioned firepower never fails no matter the enemy.

I would like to give honorary gun status to throw, however. That move is essentially a biotic sniper rifle headshot that reloads in a second.

I think tech powers can really only hang on tech teams. A solo tech class without guns is just kind of lame. Maybe if your team is making tech/cryo/fire explosions go off every second they can hang, but one fire explosion or tech burst by itself really doesn't do a whole ton of damage. It's especially noticeable on bosses. In this respect, I think biotics are a lot stronger on their own without having to depend on their teammates to do everything for them. Boosted strength biotic explosions do way, way higher damage than tech bursts or fire explosions vs. bosses.

Also I always get salty about how biotics don't interfere with tech classes at all, but a harpadarp tech player can completely neuter biotic players' potential. It makes tech classes feel like noob magnets to me; idiots seem to gravitate to the most intrusive, obnoxious classes to biotics and spam their mediocre primers over everything, drastically reducing the rate BEs can be triggered.","1354321759"

He allowed those that already ordered to keep their purchases since we'd already paid but now you must buy it when it is released on 12.12.12. He tends to open around 9am and he said he bought $10k worth so you should be OK getting a pack.

Unless my useless collection of knowledge of internet bullshit in the years ~2002-present day is off, and I'm moderately certain that it isn't, Laurelai wasn't involved with 711chan outside of knowing some of the staff members.  To call the website a ""Laurelai adventure"" is rather far off.  The website was ""run"" by about a dozen admins and even more moderators, just about all of which belonged in angry internet hacker circles which LL was apparently involved with somehow back then.  I don't really know what sort of relationship she had with them, but at one point she allegedly complained to the 711chan webhost about something so they probably didn't get along very well.  As far as CP goes, 711chan had a jailbait board and a loli hentai board, so it was basically as bad as reddit circa a year ago.  CP by the truest definition (as in naked children and such) was not allowed much like pretty much every other website out there.  They were also never taken out by the FBI, unless that happened in the past several months.  At one point the website was shut down by it's hosting service after they received a letter from a police detective asking to remove a video featuring some sort of animal abuse that 711chan was hosting, but that's the only police involvement 711chan has had AFAIK.  The website went down (for good probably) in late 2011/early 2012 because nobody wanted to pay for it.  If it came back up and was then taken out by the feds, it was kept fairly low key.","1354321761"

My husband once said something that I thought was interesting - that women notice that men are aggressive and dismissive. He pointed out that men are not just that way to women, but to other men. That men don't really sympathise with other men and will treat other men just the same. And that the reason why some men seek out female friends, because not everything is a challenge to most women, and they are more empathetic.

I don't think it's something organised, but rather how men are socialised with each other. But there's often no way for a woman to get that information without having a man who's willing to chat about it, and who notices it. ","1354321763"

Our political system is stuffed full of people who were educated in a profession that, rather they are right or wrong are taught to argue and not compromise until their last dying breathe and here we are expecting them to actually make decisions and compromise for the betterment of our society? Ignorance.  
I've read plenty of bills and I keep up with politics regularly and I can read bills, amendments, etc. just fine. If you paid attention through high school, then there shouldn't be a problem reading anything in the political arena.  
I understand coal is vital to the economy but at some point, coal is going to be gone. Forever. Then what? We need to stop relying solely on Coal and begin transitioning to a mixed system of multiple resources instead of coal coal coal. It's not good for us, it won't be good for us in the future and it's a detriment to our ecosystem. Just look at West Virginia. People keep shouting about coal all the while, working in those mines are killing them. So essentially, they support being over-worked and killing themselves all because they've been brainwashed to believe that they cannot do anything else to make a living.  
The issue is pushing to improve the economy in the state and in the eastern part of the state to be able to survive without coal or along side with it. You should never rely so much on a single resource to power your state infrastructure or to support a large portion of the state's economy. It will only end in disaster, not wanting to address it now is simply delaying the inevitable.","1354321770"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Not pissed, more like amused.  Thanks for elaborating.

It sounds as though you didn't like the film for many of the same reasons that I didn't like it.  It's sort of a bland travelogue through the Boomer years that repeatedly touches on rousing 'crowd-pleasing' nostalgic highlights without revealing anything new about American culture or history.  Gump's tenacity, generosity, and optimism are inspiring, but in many ways he's a two dimensional cipher, and not a compelling one at that (as opposed to say, Andy Warhol).

However, unlike some critics, I do not think that social politics are so necessarily all-pervasive that even a narrative as apolitical as Gump's can somehow be gerrymandered into representing a specific ideology.  And I think the danger of seeing absolutely everything from a politically-charged lens is that it becomes too easy to demonize the mildly disagreeable human expression of other people as 'enemy goods.'

So I would never call *Forrest Gump* fascist propaganda.  I suppose you could argue it's 'capitalist propaganda' and an 'ad for Hollywood' because its production and financial success briefly perpetuated the mainstream film industry in *concrete* rather than only theoretical terms, but very likely that was not the sole intention of the film.  It's more likely that the cast and crew simply wanted to get paid to tell a story on a grand (and expensive) scale.  I really don't believe there were sinister ulterior motives involved or that the indoctrination of society at large was high on the filmmakers' list of goals.

Intent aside though, if you could somehow demonstrate that the film, *Forrest Gump* had actually swayed the political beliefs of its viewers more than momentarily, that would be compelling information.  If it's not actually *performing* as propaganda, it doesn't really matter what the purpose was, does it?

Additionally, the charge of fascism, specifically, is off.  Clearly Gump is not a fascist.  He's a lone individualist if anything, who consistently defies the limits that society, his peers, and authority figures place upon him.  He's anything but a follower of the herd or a thug in a mob.

Sure, he's not the most *analytic* thinker and often acts based on instinct (because he's mentally handicapped, not because he consciously rejects learning, self-improvement, or the hard realities of life [again, quite the opposite]).  He's simply ignorant more than uncritical.  How is that representative of one ideology among dozens?  

No doubt, there are people who believe(d) in all kinds of distasteful ideologies (including fascism) or simply don't hold much of an ideology at all (like Gump*), but who think fairly critically in general.  A lot of people are very intelligent but will maintain a few blind spots regarding certain concepts, allowing their general worldview to remain woefully distorted.  Or more innocently, they may simply be ignorant of facts that would poke holes in their beliefs.  We can't fairly call these people uncritical thinkers when they are not fully informed.  Likewise, there are probably many people who superficially memorize the rhetoric of the political doctrine which you subscribe to without reflecting upon their beliefs very critically.  

An uncritical thinker is likely not to have very nuanced views, but I don't believe that we can say they will definitely and consequently fall into one, specific political camp.



So I agree that *Forrest Gump* is a bland, rather uncritical look at a very tumultuous and complex era, but think calling it fascist propaganda is melodramatic and simplistic.




*perhaps one could argue Gump's ideology is based on self-preservation, perseverance, loyalty, and romantic love, but that would not constitute a recognizably 'political' ideology

...................

From what I understand (though not having read it), the book portrays Forrest Gump as a much more complex character with plenty of faults and his rise to fame as a more satirical commentary on American culture.  Obviously, this was lost in adaptation.","1354321781"

1) Non-ruled side of the card = General English Meaning

2) Other side - Top - Stroke order starting from the left, one stroke per image, and moving to the right until your finished.

3)Right in the middle, a big finished version

4)below the big finished version of the kanji - Readings. On reading = ã«ã¿ã«ã, Kun reading = ã²ãããª

5) Below the readings, i like to put compound words including the kanji, and their readings. Try to include at least one with kun reading and one with on reading.

I found this really helpful, but time consuming.

1) Pick up a managed 10/100 switch for your front-end connectivity.  Create all the VLANs you want, play around with SNMP, etc.

2) Pick up an UNmanaged 10/100/1000 switch *just for storage*.  Plug in the second NIC on your VMware boxes to the gigabit switch and plug your NAS into the gigabit switch.  You only need one VLAN for storage anyway.  If you want to access the NAS (at non-gigabit speeds) you can even connect the gigabit switch to your 10/100 switch so you can access it from other PCs.

Good luck!

"libertarianmeme","t5_2te5l","Here's a simple question people should ask themselves or to perhaps help people understand some libertarian concepts better.  Does being allowed to smoke weed with some rules and regulation give you more freedom than not being able to smoke weed at all?

If you're truly a libertarian you'll always prefer the option available, or the one that is forced upon society which provides people the most freedoms, but whilst there is more freedoms to utilize or to aim for, people should still fight for them, and aim towards absolute freedom.

Therefore, if the monopoly of force (the government) tells us ""Hey you can smoke weed, but only on OUR terms."" then to me that is still a much better scenario than not being allowed to at all. But, because we are libertarians we should still fight for the ability to smoke weed on OUR INDIVIDUAL terms not theirs. 

We should always lobby for the bar to be moved until absolute freedom is achieved. Hence why many libertarians see a stateless society free from all coercion, relying on voluntary decision making or the non violent decisions of free individuals (aka ""free market anarchism"" or ""anarcho capitalism"") as the logical conclusion, or the end game society  should strive to achieve.","1354321788"

Every character was interesting, flawed, and relateable -- except the one-dimensional Evil Harpy Bitch character that was his wife. I'm glad to hear it improves, but I think I'd need to know how much and how quickly to consider giving it another shot.

I liked Weeds for awhile, but I wouldn't go into it expecting progressive politics. By the fourth or fifth season, the main character is unequivocally portrayed as a bitch who is ruining her children's lives with her selfishness and sluttiness. NO THANKS.

I've never even considered the gender politics of Arrested Development which, now that I think about it, is kind of an amazing fact. Not sure what that says except that the characters are not really defined by gender, though they are of course overwhelmingly rich and white. The only thing that leaps to mind is Tobias' closeted gayness being constantly played for laughs. Not sure how I feel about that.","1354321789"

In order to prevent my sisters from falling on that path, I cut my hair really short and joined a gang of guys claming to be one too (which would pretty much work IRL since I was never girly to begin with and I am pretty flat-chested.) We went around looting houses and beating people up for money and whatever food we could find and later split the shares to take home to our families. 

My secret came out later when one of our ""leaders"" came back from a break and saw me. He recognized me instantly because I had him for classes since fifth grade. He kept my secret until my gang decided to raid a house that turned out to be mine and I was worried because the only people home were my sisters and grandmother. I couldn't just speak up and say it was my house, because I had told them I was an orphan so as to protect my familes. The guy from my class spoke up, spilled my secret, got my ass in huge trouble, but later got me out. I was still in the gang, but as a girl this time, and they extended their level of protection to my family as well.

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","[](/gilda)Go no further, friend!

I'll be you resident 'Comic Book Guy' and give you my ever humble, brutally honest, spoiler-free, and possibly biased review of what I though of IDW's My Little Pony comic.

I loved it!  The artstyle was nice and there was a good amount of background detail which got a couple laughs out of me.  The humour was not entirely in line with the show's, the characters make a lot of references and a few non sequiturs from ponies who we're used to seeing be played more straight-faced, but they're still enough in character that isn't jarring.  

The length was great.  I believe there were about 30 pages of content and there was a fair amount of time spent between the exposition/action/background.  That being said I can see how this comic will be slightly confusing to someone unfamiliar with the show.  Everything moves pretty quickly and   I can see an uninitiated reader getting left out.


I won't give it a rating, but I'll say that as both a brony and a comic book nerd I liked it.  While reading it I had no problems and the few flaws I did find were after some reflection.  It was a book written and drawn *for* Bronies and as such I don't think it will win over any new fans.","1354321798"

How unfair (for me)!"" to ""_Why_ (what are the actual reasons) won't they look at me? How unfair (for everyone, but especially women, that we're living in a culture where many are scared of random people while walking down the street)!"", and I've been meaning to try and write something on just how crazy of a realization it was for me of just how fucked up things are. Maybe this'll finally be the kick in the pants I need.

Also, I just know already the assholes are going to start some bullshit counter-group using the NO MA'AM thing from Married With Children. Which, considering just how shitty that group was in the show, would be oddly appropriate I suppose.","1354321803"
"keto","t5_2rske","&gt;someone who has been doing keto for a while can't use the sticks to check for ketosis?

Yes, this certainly can be the case if a person is well hydrated.

&gt;Is it reasonable to chalk the high number this early on just to my having just started and flushing them from my system, do you think? 

It is highly likely yes.  I've never used keto sticks because I've had many other friends use them and say they aren't useful at all- due to the aforementioned issues. 

So no worries on this one.  Just keep your carbs below 50g. (Edit: Some in the community think 20g's for the first two weeks is a must, I've never done this and have plenty of success.  See what works for you.  I stick in the 15-45g range usually for most days.)  Another tip though, is to really make sure your getting your potassium/sodium/magnesium.  I eat avocados (and many others do), due to the high potassium content.  Make them a staple, they really help with the nasty side effects.  Sodium is pretty easy to get in, most high fat foods are salty. If low, drink some broth.  Mangesium I supplement with because it's pretty safe to supplement with at night. 500mg of chelated mangesium.  Trying to get it all through food is tough, but plan it out.  I eat lots of dark green leafy vegetables and small servings of nutrient dense fruit.  

Good luck, and feel free to ask away if you have any other specific questions. Come back and let us know how you progress!","1354321803"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was asked to participate in a parachute demo jump into a major truck race.  We flew a 3 person flying V formation in our wingsuits with smoke.  The jump came off perfectly and the view as we flew in towards the grandstands, before breaking apart and deploying, was amazing.  It was surreal to be flying over thousands of cars, a track, and grandstands.  We deployed our canopies and I set up as the first one to land.

As I landed I was so focused on what I was doing that I couldn't hear anything.  Then as soon as my feet touched the ground this roar of sound just poured over me.  I looked up towards the grandstands, gave a wave and a fist pump and stopped a moment to revel in the cheering before highfiving the other guys as they landed.  It was a pretty awesome feeling knowing that those thousands of people were cheering for me and us.  Later found out they had over 40,000 people through the gates that day.  Then we got to hang out in the pits for awhile, watch the race, and eat snacks.

TL;DR Did a parachute jump into a truck race. Felt like a rock star.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Aphro doesn't dominate his lane at LAN events, or tournaments in general with the other top teams coming into play, but he doesn't generally out-right lose them either. Aphro can pretty much hold his own with the other professional ADCs out there, but the problem is the rest of his team cannot. The next time you watch them playing the top professional teams, just keep an eye on how much the other lanes always lose in every game, and how much attention Aphro's lane gets from the opposing jungler. They don't always get crushed in the other lanes on Fear, but they almost always lose every other lane, and Aphro and Muffin are stuck trying to win their bot lane, with the added handicap of, little to no pressure on their side of the map, and added pressure from the other side of the map. 


Some people over hype Aphro because of his SoloQ play, (which is very entertaining to watch, and does produce some really big risky plays) but he really isn't a top 5 ADC or anything. He can hold his own against the rest of the bot lanes out there though, at least from what I can see. Because of this, fanboys either think he's on one extreme side of the pro spectrum, or the other. He's either the greatest, or shit, and really, he's right in the middle as far as the Pro Players go. IMO.","1354321811"

This is probably the hardest question to answer, because I have a hard time piecing together events during firefights; my brain remembers small insignifigant details but it's a huge fucking blur as to what the hell was actually happening, so I'll do my best.  It's not hard when someone's shooting at you to shoot back.  Natural survival instincts, plus training, take over, and there is nothing else you want more in the world to keep living, and to make sure that no one around you dies. If you've ever been in a situation before where something sudden and shocking happened to you and you didn't really know how to react and kind of froze in place for a second, its the same physical reaction, except that in military members, there's a deeply ingrained training that takes over and you don't freeze. 

It was hard in the first fight, because I was scared out of my pajamas, and my whole body was shaking while I was falling into familiar patterns training had given me (aiming, firing, ducking down again, breath, re-aim, fire, etc) But it was easier the second time; not because I was more comfortable with it or because I was okay with killing, but because I wanted to live and I sort of knew what I had to do to survive.  Like, ""hey, I've done this before, just do it like last time and you'll live.""  That desire was so fucking strong nothing else was in my mind at all, no guilt or hesitation or anything.  My head felt like it was too hot, kind of exlpoding, probably due to all the adrenaline and cortisol being pumped through my system.  I felt very focused; calm; I could feel the rest of my body wanting desparately to freak out, but it was like a voice in my head walking me through the steps.

I think for me it was a different experience than infantrymen who actively seek out people and fight/kill them, because both times we were defending ourselves or our friends.  Once someone shoots a bullet at you, your emptahy kind of switches off, especially if they're a complete stranger. 

That feels lackluster. Sorry if it's not a good enough description :( I don't feel like it does the experience justice at all but that's what I have right now.","1354321814"

He told us a story that essentially approximated the Joseph Smith vision. He said that the reason he knew the church was true was because he had seen a pillar of light, with an angel, floating above him. What made it more uncomfortable is that he started getting mad at us for appearing unnerved. He told us that ""he wished we wouldn't look at him like that"". And he went on and on about how it was a very real vision.

Everybody's tails were between their legs. I was very uncomfortable, and was about to walk out of the building.

When I tried to buy an oil filter from them, the stupid girl had to go to the back three times to *try* to grab me the right part, with her boss yelling at her all three times that she was holding a filter for the NA Forester. I got paranoid after that and double, double checked the part number online before I did my oil change.

The stick alone doesn't justify enough to really have a crisp picture, there's nothing interesting about it. The third one looks good even with the ghosting stick, I would prefer it to be not blurred but i'm sure you had a hard time convincing it to sit still :p","1354321823"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","You should try to get out of this if you can. Its bad all the way around. Especially with interest, that car will cost you far more than what you make in a year.

Additionally, you dont need a new car, you just dont. Get a reliable used car and treat it well.

Another thing to consider is that cars cost 51 cents per mile driven. This includes gas, repairs, maintenance. If you cannot avoid 51 cents per mile on top of these payments (which you obviously cant) you should not get it.

One more thing, Dont mistake my tone for being mean, or harsh. I am risking downvotes to show you that cars are **not** an investment. They are a money pit. You **never** get your money back out of them. The ideal solution is to walk or bike to work, or get a job where you can walk or bike to. For the cost of $100 you can get a spiffy bike, get free air from gas stations as needed, and instead of putting all the money you earn towards car debt, pay off your school debt, or save it. I wish I had known about the true cost of car ownership before I bought a new car (like a total chump!)

It is crucial to look at this from a long term perspective.

Here is a really good article on car v bike comparison
http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/04/18/get-rich-with-bikes/

One final thing, dont get caught in the trap of ""Well, I work hard... I deserve this!"" That is fine for small things once in a while, but working hard does not translate into things you should buy.

EDIT
Sorry if this is going on a bit, but it may not be to get a similar job closer to where you live. Those entry level positions are usually hiring, and maybe there are some options near by that will help you save and pay off your debt faster. If its 2.5k tuition, for 4 years, that is 20k. You hate to see 20k turn into 30k over 10 years. Paying off debt is the best investment you can make. not paying 20% interest beats the pants off of earning 5-7% interest through investments.

The question asked appears to be if the government ""should do more"", which is incredibly vague. I'm guessing that a number of liberals imagine deregulation on drugs and marriage is doing more, in the sense that it is doing something different. Same with pulling out of the Middle East. Sure, these same people probably wants an expansion to the national healthcare system, and environmental regulation, stuff like that, but it's not necessarily *bigger* government, just more focused towards what they believe to be useful.

So here's the good thing: I think these figures show that younger Americans want *better* government, and the idea that the current government is absolutely broken in some ways in common amongst us. Can't this be a starting point, where we can question them with what better government can possibly mean?","1354321833"

A few added minutes here and there to increase the integrity of the game and reduce instances of a bad call costing a team the game.

for most jobs, if you don't have a car, you are unemployable. 

a car is a necessity.

and even if i could tolerate taking mass transit to work, and still have my car, it would cost me EVEN MORE to LIVE in toronto. Insurance companies do not charge you LESS insurance if you tell them you take transit or bike to work; furthermore to have your car sit idle at home while you take transit you still have the added cost of having the car. mass transit would solve congestion, i get it, but it would cost far far more than a new highway, new road tax, or even a toll road. with rising fares and escalating transit issues its unlikely transit will even be the solution to the specific problems imposed by living in Toronto.

you may not believe it but i'm going to tell you the God's honest truth here; working 45km away from home, to make 16 dollars an hour, barely feeds and clothes a single person in Toronto with the cost of just living life. there are a lot of people in this same boat; moreover most of us are unable to rise in pay, let alone trim the cost of living by moving to a new home without going basically into a hole of debt that the 1% would be jealous of.

south of bloor, because of the tightly packed areas its a nightmare to find even a minimum wage job. 

that is whats wrong with the city. it costs 30$ an hour to live in the suburbs and raise a family, and scrape by with no retirement package. at 30$ you are spending every dollar just to keep your head above water.

downtown the threat of impending doom must be even greater. i do not envy you people in this regard. 

but the reality is that roads must be obstructed with parking because no matter how you slice it, there will always be more cars. you cannot ask travellers who come from out of province to park their cars in stouffville and Cab it to downtown. you cannot ask the cab's to go out of business in favour of excessive amounts of buses. you simply canot outlaw or outwit cars. people need to get places and they need to ship things, and they need space to carry their belongings that public transit seldom affords. relying on buses for space accommodations and timely service is a joke. if a person were trying to advocate public transit based in any way upon these they would be laughed to scorn and rightly so.

no, the only way to live, be it in Toronto or new zealand is with a car.","1354321841"

Him getting killed (or just shot) was just stupid, in the sense that it didn't add anything to the film. I felt it cheapened it.

Everything was tied up almost perfectly before that.

No, it doesn't make you a bad girlfriend.  If you look at history, making it big in the music business is something we all imagine we'd like, but it seems to make people mostly miserable and drive them to early graves and insanity.

FYI, he's not going to make it big.  True stat: for every thousand musicians who are ever signed to a major label, only 3 of them ever have a hit record, and for every hundred who have a hit record, only 1 of them have a career that lasts longer than 5 years.

Sometimes I just rip the entire sky from the image in the bracket where it was best exposed and use it instead of using anything from the HDR images. In addition, I find almost everything to need just a dab of sharpening (edge mask sharpen or smart redux sharpen as they do a better job than the included tool and don't degrade the rest of the image as bad).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's assume that your average American weighs about 175lbs.  A lot of that is bones/other crap.  So let's say the average American has about 100lbs of edible material.

Since no data is available for calorie count of human meat, let's use steak.  A 16oz. sirloin is roughly 850calories.  So let's round and say that to maintain a 2,000 - 2,200 calorie diet you need to eat about 2.5lbs of human meat per day.

So you get:

6,000,000,000 humans x 2.5lbs x #Days = 100lbs x 350,000,000 humans

15,000,000,000 x #Days = 35,000,000,000

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Why are people using their B'net email address for anything other than Blizzard?

Solution: Create a new email address, use it for *nothing* but Battle.net, don't give it to ppl so they can add you to Real ID - that's what your Battletag is for - or if they are gifting you something from the Blizzard store (any email you have access to will do to receive the code, it doesn't have to be your b.net email) and **do not** use it to sign up to/for anything. You're right about D3up (and so you should be lol) as they aren't the problem, obviously. But if you really must buy gold then don't buy it from WOWgold.com using that email either.

Don't add this email to your address book or contact list - these are harvested all the time by the likes of Google and Facebook (amongst others) and once this is done that email is 'out there' on the wild wide web and available for all sorts of uses.

If an email is received from 'Blizzard' on any email **other than the safe one you use only for Blizzard** (except in the case of gift codes from friends) then you know straight away it's a fake and can be safely ignored. I have a special folder in my email client full of the damn things and the only time I even look at them is if I want to check source code.

It's not rocket science, it's actually really simple logic, but as long as people keep doing dumb shit then smart scammers &amp; phishers will keep reaping the rewards. Using Facebook, Google accounts &amp; the Chrome browser are three of the **dumbest** things I can think of anyone doing and stupidity has it's own brand of Karma imo. especially if you don't **learn from your mistakes**.","1354321858"

Why all the preaching/evangelizing/converting?  Because we are instructed to do so.  It is that simple.  How exactly God uses this activity is up to him.

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","I played DotA from 2005 to 2010. Just got tired of it, the feeders, the ragers, the blind hate, ugh. Worst online community. In no other game has a person made new accounts purely to message and harass me, saying they want to rape my mom and hope I get cancer and die alone. DotA 2 I've been in for a year with about 70 hours in it but eehhh.... there's a lot they added or changed I just don't remember anymore. The new UI is still confusing to me. Took me ages to figure out how to change settings in game. It feels.... slow, somehow. There's a lot more noise with heros saying stuff and announcers and explosions and all of the items are different. There's heroes I don't remember or changed too heavily. I still kind of want to get into it. 

Compared to DotA, LoL is 'easier'. Everything moves faster, you have a built-in TP scroll and a few 'flavor' spells you can use on every champion for defense, offense, or trolling. I like how caster scale to late game as opposed to DotA where you're a god until lv 16 then it's all over. Fewer levels, less gold needed for things, matches are shorter. There's no denies. There's a surrender function. The new honor system. That's what I prefer about LoL.

There are some things I prefer about DotA. I like the fact it has more monsters in it as opposed to 'fighter human' variants. Item actives are a lot more varied  - Orchid and sheep stick... good times. Juking through the forest was hard to pull off but very satisfying. Stealth mechanics are fun for the player, something LoL has always had a love/hate relationship with. 

There are some parts I am ambivalent about. DotA has weaker towers. Both a good and a bad aspect, towers can actually protect you in LoL but makes tower diving much more exciting. There's also much more gameplay revolving around a hypercarry who can single handedly win a game - like PA, Clinkz, AM, ect. Great if that's your team, but if your carry got shut down hard or just sucks there's pretty much no way to keep PA from three-shotting your tank and laughing at the rest of your team. In LoL that's pretty much impossible save a handful of champs  - you need to team fight and work together to win. Satisfying as a group if you pull it off well, horrendous if everyone is a big baby. This aspect sometimes makes games drag out another 15 minutes than is necessary. 

Ultimately what made me swap was I had no friends who played DotA anymore and a bunch of people picked up LoL in mid 2010, so I swapped to that. ","1354321862"

"OutOfBody","t5_2rai8","Hi,

The illusion is everything. When you OBE, you stop paying attention to your body, but this is essentially akin to being asleep (Note in certain rare instances you can both OBE and be 'in' your awake body at the same time, the dual-location feels really weird).
In the OBE realms, it becomes rapidly apparent that belief spawns physicality. The illusion becomes real, but it's your illusion. Negative beings will attempt to influence your fear, to cause you to lose control, to attempt to manipulate you.
Only you can allow hurt or imprisonment with yourself. Remember that.

In the mean time, if you don't want your dark visitors hanging around, chase them out. Do not allow them to be in your room, or in your house. The best way to do this is loud and verbally, something like 'Dark spirits, leave my home and never return!'. If you don't have the intention to push them away, you won't be rid of them. To believe you are weaponless is to be disarmed. You have the power, you allow your own illusion. So learn to master illusion, and you will never come to any harm but that at your own hands.","1354321863"

2 He does sorta in all out combat, just look at his battles with Tsukishima and Ichigo he stayed in the exact same spot the entire time. I f he would want to move out of there he would first have to clear a part of his bankai out of the way.


3 This is true, but fighting with that kind of bankai bright petals flying all around you its impossible for them not to block part of your vision.


4 While his bankai petals are good for defending swordslashes and getugas and such. They seemed to be flicked away quite easy and against the force of her bankai I dont think they will be enough to block it for him to remain undamaged or even survive.


5 Sui Feng has a fighting style which requires her to be in his safe zone anyway. A weakness like that is hard to miss once you are in there and Sui Feng is pretty perceptive. Ichigo could get in is not just because of main character hax.


6 Argued in 5



7 again in 5. A normal fighter woul not spot this, but she wants to fight within his safe zone. That is the best place for her to attack. Once she is in there and he does not attack he or start damaging himself. Sui Feng is more than perceptive enough to figure that out.



8 He could flash step, but at this point his bakai is dangerous for him to, he can't just do a quick shunpo cause he might get hit by the petals. It is a situation where his own bankai is trapping him.

Where did you get second strongest bankai? I'm sure the higher captains have more powerful ones and in my opinion Daiguren Hyourinmaru from Hitsugaya is also stronger.

Sui Feng is among the physically strongest captains. Just looking at the datasheet she has strength and speed maxed out. That means her strength could only possibly (in the gotei 13) be overpowered by Kenpachi or the Captai Commander. This plus her SHunko which heavily raises speed and power gives quite a lot of power. A kick from that is dangerous to anyone.","1354321864"

Well, time will tell. Considering that Rob Pardo said in an interview that they feel like they announced Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 too early (which one has to agree with considering how f**king long it took until the games were released afterwards and all the problems in development and hype that cost) I have to imagine they'll not announce this project 3-4 years before it's likely to be released but rather 2 maximum.","1354321865"

honestly, if you want to look at luck i would imagine the more punches you throw the more ""lucky""  a ko would actually be. ko'ing someone on punch 100 rarely happens. the majority of kos happen early in fights not late. 5th round kos are very rare compared to round one or two.
