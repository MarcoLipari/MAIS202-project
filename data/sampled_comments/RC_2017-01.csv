To be fair, in some ways that's due to equal parts technological superiority and limited rules of engagement. We thankfully haven't been involved in any significant conflicts with peer or neer-peer countries recently, and everyone else knows it's pretty pointless to fight us in the air because it'll be a complete turkey shoot (ground to air is a bit different). On the other hand, conflicts like Syria show exactly what can happen when you don't have control of the air, even when the opponent has a relatively rudimentary air capability. Fast movers would be very useful in preventing people from getting barrel bombed, but that's a decision that is made way above the tactical level. ",1483228800

The marketing campaign actually isn't shady, because it's not actually false advertising whatsoever. It just is irrelevant advertising. It would be false advertising if they phrased it as ""other monitors are _not_ vista compatible"".

Also, it's not that people are children, it's more complicated than that. For example, a lot of people are just exhausted by other things in their life, and they don't have the energy to learn certain things, so they fall back to trust behaviour. They trust that what is advertised is in their best interest. This exhaustion could come from any number of things, such as having 2 jobs, having lots of kids, and all sorts of other things. I myself know my energy is not limitless, and at times I need to just not put the effort into learning something, even though I learn a LOT all the time.

Another thing to consider is that a lot of people are programmed to think they're stupid, so they revert to the mentality that they can't learn computers, or other ""complex"" concepts. I'm not even talking about learning things like programming, I'm talking about say, learning a new OS. It's mostly interacting with menus, things that actually take very little work to learn. But plenty of people are programmed by advertising, their family and other sources to think they're incapable of learning things or are stupid. This also comes from how people in IT treat others. Are they actually stupid? Well, if they're a very good accountant for example, but have more to learn with computers, I would argue they are probably not stupid, just maybe have some barriers to overcome.

People are more responsive to things when you put more effort into how you approach them. Trust me, I'm an Elder of the Internet ;)",1483228802

**Top 4 DRPM:**

Rudy Gobert: 4.79

Draymond Green: 4.16

Andre Bogut: 4.03 (only plays 24 mpg though)

Giannis Antetokounmpo: 3.87

When Giannis is on the court the Bucks have a DRTG of 102.2, which would be 5th best in the league.

When Giannis is off the court the Bucks have a DRTG of 108.2 which is equivalent of 5th worst in the league. (Last time I checked I believe this was the greatest gap in on/off defensively for a starter)

And then he's also averaging 2 steals (T- 5th in league) and 1.8 blocks (8th in league).

He's been the 3rd best defender in the league overall this year objectively.

All of his DFG% metrics are among the best in the league as well. He's 3rd in Isolation defense, as well as you can see a great rim protector from this graph as well. He does it all now, basically just like a little worse  draymond now in terms of being able to guard every position effectively, guard the perimeter, guard Bigs, as well as rim protect.

Our team is an absolute horror show with him off the court.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","The problem is the distribution rights to IV are currently owned by 20th Century Fox and will presumably be forever unless something changes (such as Disney showing up with a briefcase full of money). Disney will get the distribution rights to the other five Lucas Star Wars movies automatically in May 2020.

Presumably Disney will cut some kind of deal with them around the release of IX and we'll see a 4K nine (eleven?) movie box set soon after.

On the technical front, [estimates say](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/05/could-disney-finally-give-us-the-remastered-unedited-star-wars-we-want/) that it would cost Disney less than a million dollars to fully remaster the theatrical version of the OT. It should be a pretty straightforward project, even if Lucas did indeed destroy the unused parts of the O-neg like he claims.

In any event, I've heard rumors that Disney really likes collecting money, and this seems like a pretty easy way to get a lot of it really quickly.",1483228804

If you took 1000ug, especially for just your third trip, you'd be blasted off in to hyperspace.

Nobody with a position of authority is claiming Russia hacked our election in the sense that they changed votes or rigged machines. Yes, there are people who say that's what happened, but they are regular citizens.

Talk to a local attorney and you can probably give the vehicle back and receive all your payments back. If the title is actually salvage and they did not disclose this to you anywhere, that is a big no no for dealers. Feel free to call your salesman or his manager to address the situation and see if they offer any solutions.

All historians will agree that blockade will not change any country's decision on things essential, such as sovereignty. Look at Iran, Cuba, China, Russia. These countries aren't even face with the issue of surrender, and none of them folded. I can't imagine Japan would fold to a blockade.

Second, Japan may not be rich in minerals and oils necessary for war, but it has been mostly isolationist for centuries, they haven't starved since then, and they won't be starved now. The only thing a blockade would do is kill wokan and children, and then make a land war slightly easier but probably a lot harder as man would be steeled after these losses. It is unimaginable to think Japan a nation size of Japan would surrender to starvation when North Korea hasn't.",1483228818

Also, it's pretty slow as you need three to four successful extractions per level to level up and that is 2 hours each session, assuming you extract.

My eyes are still burning from all the crying about petty bullshit and ringing them with glitter to sit in bed which boyfriend said was very ""empowered"" of me. 5 minutes to midnight we were still frantically searching for a Lithuanian or Israeli Russian TV stream so we could at least look at a clock countdown but everything was seemingly overloaded so we gave up and watched a metal finger guide us through sarcastic Bible verses (something to the tune of ""he who closes Channel 1 is an enemy of the children of Israel"" or whatever) and then some obscure Syrian news report while the laptop clock turned to 00.00 and I opened a bottle of a drink called ""Buzz"". The store didn't have champagne or fizzy wine except this and lambrusco. I played ""Auld Lang Syne"" and ABBA's ""Happy New Year"" on Youtube and gave a sociocultural lecture to boyfriend how in Europe this is a celebration of regrets, hangovers and a wasted year. This ""Buzz"" thing isn't enough to give even my fucked up liver a hangover though, it's like beer strength. You had one job...

The district part of it revolves around the literal districting of the city. The City is (presumably) the last vestige of human civilization left, and a number of different cultures intermingle there. Think of the districts as more informal, ie ""Chinatown"". Those informal delineations nonetheless are chock full of cultural differences (some holdovers, some newer, more alien mixes) and naturally, people that are different from each other tend to trust each other less.

I'm trying to focus more on classism than racism, but the latter is going to exist.

Think of it like ""Oh, you're from the *Ardin* Quarter."" Real world: ""Oh, you're from [insert ghetto part of town here]. I guess you wouldn't understand."" Theoretically there's freedom of movement, sure, but class warfare is an important tool of the elite.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The solution is to nerf Poppy's damage. Tanks have to be that tanky because they're supposed to be getting hit by 2 or 3 people with multiple types of damage. If Draven (or any ADC) was 3-5 shotting Poppy (who's 2 levels up, etc., etc.) imagine how instantaneously Poppy would die in a team fight when she's also getting hit by mage burst, probably mage support burst, probably some AD from the jungler, etc. Tanks would be utterly worthless.

EDIT: and there's usually an outlier on the tankiness scale that's a bit too tanky, maybe this season its Poppy. I seem to recall seeing a Mundo clip from Season 3 where he was standing under tower tanking it for like 2 minutes straight, pops ult and heals to full (without breaking turret aggro), tanks for another minute, pops ult and heals to full, tanks for another 30 or so seconds, it was obscene. So Poppy probably needs some nerfs to her tankiness too but at the end of the day you shouldn't really see a tank outright lose a 1v1 to anyone (though they shouldn't ""win"" it either).",1483228825

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Decades ago i was 10 years old. On December 31 I was over at my best friends house, spending the day playing. Out of the blue he invited me to stay overnight and celebrate the new years eve, watching the ball drop with him and his family. I was only 10 years old and naive me never heard of celebrating new years eve. My friends description of the event only confused me more. ""Times Square. Watch a ball drop, etc."" 

Still, I agreed. I called up my mother to get her permission to stay over (My friend didnt live in my neighborhood. I had to take a bus to get to and from his place). Mother gave her permission. My friend lived in an apartment. His older adult sister had her own apartment right down the hallway on the same floor of his building. It was there where we all were to celebrate new years eve. They had not only my friends family, but many other friends and also plenty of food, snacks, and drinks.

Now, I was being raised in an abusive, dysfunctional home. My parents split up when I was young, about 5-6 years old. Mother got custody of us kids and she was a mentally ill, mean, abusive psychotic. But my friends sister was sweet as pie to me and everyone around her. So, the countdown came. As soon as the ball dropped and it was the new year, everyone in the place cheered, hugged and kissed and even my friends sister gave me a kiss on the cheek. I was stunned and surprised at the outpouring of happiness and affection this occasion caused. I knew nothing but misery in my home.

Fast forward one year later. Again, the night of December 31. I'm home this evening (no invitation forthcoming from my friend). My mother tries to send me to bed at my usual bedtime (9pm). I ask her to let me stay up to watch the new years times square celebration and watch the ball drop on tv. She agreed to let me. 

Actually, I couldnt have cared less about new years eve and the ball drop. My true, real motive for wanting to watch it on tv was that I hoped it would recreate in my sad, depressing, miserable, abusive, dysfunctional home the same joy and happiness I witnessed over at my friends sisters place the year before, if only for a minute or so. But it was not to be.

We had no friends or family over. No refreshments of any kind. Just the tv. It was only me and mother in the living room, watching the ball drop. Mother was sitting on the couch, i was sitting on the floor. As soon as the ball dropped, the VERY second it dropped and it was the new year, my mother swiveled her head to look at me. Did I get a ""happy new year""? Nope. With an angry expression on her face, she YELLED at me at the top of her lungs, ""ALL RIGHT, ITS OVER!!!! GO TO BED!!!!!"" Without a word, I got up and silently made the trek to my bedroom while thinking of the obvious, stark contrast between my sad, miserable home, and the happy home of my friends sister. 

At the home of my friends sister, they welcome in the new year with a party. Family, friends, food, champagne, cheers, hugs, kisses, love, joy, and happiness. (""5, 4, 3, 2, 1...Happy New Year!"")

At my  home the new year is welcomed with my psychotic mother yelling at me. (""5, 4, 3, 2, 1...""ALL RIGHT, IT'S OVER!!!! GO TO BED!!!!"")

I have NEVER celebrated the new years or watched any of the live times square coverage since then. And it will be the same thing tonight.

Except that isn't his last 50 battles. What you're checking is just 50 battles at random. I don't watch his videos personally but from looking at his channel he seems to play a lot of dumb teams. this would mean there is a lot of behind the scenes failure that you arent looking into. It could be wholly possible that 75% of his battles are against nicknamed pokemon and we are only seeing the few without.

&gt;I highly doubt he posts only trainers with no nicknamed Pokemon on purpose. 

Nobody said it had to be on purpose, it is wholly possible it is just a coincidence. Again another factor you're missing.

I can see why some folks might be keeping notes and taking lots of screenshots, but whether or not you'll need to will come down to how you think, and more specifically how good you are at visualization, most specifically visualizing rotations and translations in 2D space. Also I suppose to a lesser degree, how good you are at remembering mechanics once you've learned them.

This isn't the kind of game where you really must make notes about details so that you can use them later. You'll run into a new puzzle type and a handful of simple puzzles that teach you how to solve that type of puzzle, and I guess some people make notes on that, but for me once I learned a new mechanic I remembered it pretty well, and if I forgot I could always go back to the early puzzles to remind myself.

The cases where I did end up making notes were more of a scratch-paper kind of thing, like, I'm having trouble visualizing this so I need to map it out so I can think it through more easily. I ended up with a handful of envelopes on my desk covered in scribbles while I tried to think through a tricky path or complex mechanic.

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","My point is that the OS should have one fixed monotonic timescale and that users should be able to choose the one they use and it should be managed through a library. TAI, UTC and local time should all be valid ways of referencing time. The only sticky point is that you need to be sure when you do this that there can be an arbitrary number of seconds in any given minute, minutes in any given hour, hours in any given day, days in any given month, etc. recalling that one year we removed a large number of days from the month! 

I suspect such a system is ""normally we have 60 seconds a minute,60 minutes an hour and so on"" but here are some deltas and the library reads those deltas and computes differences for you. 

This not only keeps the user happy but keeps the kernel's timekeeping explicitly separated from the users so that the needs of the user doesn't interfere with the needs of the OS in the same way that the needs of one group of users (assurance that their computers won't all crash at once) is currently interfering with the needs of another group of users (assurance that seconds are being measured as accurately as reasonable or that they can compare the time on any of a group of computers and they will be as close to each other as reasonably possible, even if they are using different time sources within the same time network). 

Towards that end I think POSIX needs to define the internal representation of time, something based on TAI, but should also define the external representation of time, something that translates from the new ""UNIX time"" to human time similar to how GPS does it. ",1483228828

Speed of use does not make a better mechanism,  but considering speed does force me to make a simpler mechanism.

Living things that can take advantage of what's in the air and use it to survive are the ones that succeed.

One common example of this is the dinosaurs. They were able to be gigantic  (and thereby consume more food) because there was MUCH more oxygen in the air during that time. An animal that large couldn't be successful in today's atmosphere, and that's why there aren't any anymore.

"ITCareerQuestions","t5_30560","Well, only applying in your hometown could be part of the problem, but this resume is also pretty awful. I'd give it about a C-/D+

Some suggestions to bring your resume up to acceptable levels:

Move your education section to the bottom. The only time you want the education at the top is when your education is the best thing you have. You actually have internship experience, so your education needs to be at the bottom and your experience at the top. Also take the associates degree off your resume. Now that you have a bachelors degree there's no reason to show you started at a community college. Listing the associates does nothing to help you.

Moving on to the skills section... Currently this is also pretty awful. Remove any ""skills"" which are just positive opinions of yourself like saying you have leadership ability. That's pretty stupid because it's not quantifiable. The skills section should really show things you know how to do. List operating systems, programming languages, application software, servers/services, etc. 

Your experience section is kind of thin. I'd like to see a few bullet points under each one of these. This is what gets you hired.

The projects section is so generic that it tells me nothing. If you need more space to describe your experience, then you may be best off just removing this.

You either need to be more specific with the projects or remove them. It's a bunch of vague things. 

Fix your resume and then post it again and I'll give you more suggestions.

When a hiring manager (like me) looks at resumes for a position, we'll often get 100 of them, and end up looking at them for 5-10 seconds to then try to pick a more realistic number to actually read.

I've been at this long enough looking at them for 5-10 seconds is usually long enough to pick about 20 to actually read (for maybe 2-3 minutes each) and pick about 6-8 to do phone interviews.

Of the 6-8 phone interviews, I then pick about 3-4 people to bring in to talk to.

Your resume doesn't currently get past the 5-10 second test, and would just end up in the ""no"" pile without any thought.

But looking at yours more deeply because you posted about it, I think you have serious potential, but the resume simply does not express it.

You really need to fix thing thing up. If you apply for any more jobs with the resume as it is, you're just wasting your time.

Edit: I just looked again and an enormous amount of time passed from when you got your associates degree (2009) and 2016 when you finished your BS. What went on during that time period? I see your jobs didn't begin until 2015. What exactly were you doing from 2009 until 2015?

This is a real question people will ask.

If you remove the associates degree like I initially advised people will just assume you are about 22-23 years old which I assumed initially, but you're substantially older. This is going to leave a lot of questions. What else have you been doing? You likely have had some other jobs which you should put on your resume since you don't want holes.

If you leave a hole this big on the resume, it'll be a pretty big red flag.",1483228838

And never go for the risky aerial shots.  Most other players WILL go for dumb risky shots, and it's amazing how much you can rank up just waiting around to take advantage of your opponents' mistakes.  ",1483228838

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","&gt;  her two brothers idiots didn't seem very family like.

My god. This is why I dislike the Bra hate. People grasp at straws to hate on Bra, even though she is written well: a bratty, arrogant teenage girl who has the power to destroy galaxies. And yet people try and say she's not a good character and is a Mary Sue.

I call my brothers' idiots all the time. They do the same to me. We do it both in jest and in seriousness when they've done something idiotic. That's not un-family like. Millions of family members do that everyday.

She's not different than Vegeta was through most of the series. In fact, she's 10 times better. She has the same personality traits Vegeta had when introduced: arrogant, condescending, full of themselves, and incredibly powerful. Except at the time Vegeta could only destroy planets. Bra is at least solary system. That goes to a young person's head.",1483228838

This girl who we ended up being friends with was really nice.. but one of the days she saw that in our tent there was this emoji pillow that belonged to one of the girls in the group. She took it. She also said she wanted my ""makeup"" which was just like moisturizer, eyeshadow, lip gloss. She took that. Too get back at her, (looking back on this now it was kinda mean)it rained the night before. So, there was mud everywhere. We saw her playing outside with our stuff. Well, she had our stuff in her hand at a table. We were wearing gloves. Then we threw mud balls at her. She was kind of a ""girly girl"" so she got mad. We took our stuff back. We got yelled at but this 7 or 8 year old girl was stealing! They left the day after. Yeah we were in so much trouble 😂 We were scolded at for ""not following the Girl Scout law""

"witcher","t5_2sebi","Personally I think that it would be strange to make a ciri witcher game for all the reasons people have mentioned here, her being overpowered and her not being an actual witcher. I honestly loved ciri in witcher 3 and I'm on the same boat in wanting another game with her

But perhaps what would make more sense is a game with an original story about another witcher, perhaps a brand new witcher, where you can also put ciri in a major role.

What the fuck are you talking about? You thought I was some Western sympathiser of Kurd and that you could get away with your ""I lived in the South-East"" bullshit? I experienced Turkish discrimination first-hand, and so have millions of other Kurds. And they still do today. 

For Kurds, there was no difference between being ruled by Kemalist or by Erdoganists/Islamists. The only difference today is that the Turks in Western Turkey get to experience what Kurds have been experiencing for the past 100 years.

At least you realize this and can nip it in the butt before things really get out of control. I have read about people on Reddit taking several 25 gram doses throughout the day. That's absurd. Smoke weed, it really synergies well w kratom, and really lessens the amount of Kratom needed to be effective. A little Kava every now and then is wonderful too. That, however, can also can be a slippery slope. Make sure you're exercising a lot/enough too. Kratom isn't the cure to addiction, but it's IMO the best harm reduction tool there is. Use it wisely.

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","I'm calmer, more even-minded. I don't immediately start crying when I wake up in the morning and realize how trashed my life is. I am less angry and am getting in fewer violent confrontations on the street as a result. I actually have a bit of peace of mind for the first time in a long time. I never knew what normal was. So I am just thankful my life doesn't seem to be spinning out of control and that I can assume that I won't, over the course of a day, swing into one of those really nasty black depressive moments when all seems lost and I lose my ability reason and work at a level that is basic to functioning in the workplace. Any thing is better than what was before. Thank you science. ",1483228844
"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","I think I only did it with two and lots of gors and Minotaurs. One army was a full and the other was not. I think I recruited a 3rd at the end but that was it.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I disagree with this almost as much as I disagree with your boldin opinion. He overproduced at the beginning of the season so expectations skyrocketed. He's underproduced since then, and although you can't completely remove blame from him, he is far from a liability. 

He's been double teamed like a number one receiver even though he's not a number one receiver, and that's because the lions lack a number one. Mix that with the fact that he's a deep ball specialist on a team that lacks the pass protection to give the QB time for routes to develop and one of the worst run games in recent memory, and you end up with a guy that won't find a way to contribute on the score sheet. He's still out there being accounted for by the defense though. If you watch the plays beyond just the highlights and stats you can see it. ",1483228844

Also, i don't know how u missed it but Itachi let Sasuke win. He actually was so powerful that he completely and utterly dictated how the battle would go. He pushed Sasuke enough so Orochimaru would reveal himself. Which he effortlessly beat again to get rid of the cursed seal for Sasuke. 

Nagato and Minato were both trained by Jiraiya. Luxury which Itachi didnt need. Self trained from day 1. No teacher could teach him shit. Everything he did was effortless. Minato fell to the nine tails. Itachi has the eyes to tame that little kitty.

"mmt_economics","t5_2t76b","&gt;On point 2 - no one pays their taxes in ""real money"". In fact, most IRS offices will not even allow you to pay in cash. You MUST pay in bank deposits.

Yes, and the bank has to pay that amount to the government in the form of reserves from my understanding.

&gt;Your other points are just claims that I don't ""understand"" MMT.

I am saying you are in effect discussing a straw man instead of what MMT actually says.  I didn't use the term because I don't think you are doing it deliberately but due to you not reading carefully.

For example here

&gt;MMT has a long history of stating that private sector saving is equivalent to the size of the deficit (S-I) = (G-T). They say that the private sector cannot adequately save without government net financial assets. This completely contradicts the fact that investment adds to private sector saving and is the key driving component of private sector saving. In fact, as of 2012 the quantity of domestically held government bonds (NFA) was just 4.3% of private sector net worth.

You are talking about net worth when MMT is not talking about net worth.  They are only discussing financial assets when they make claims about government deficits being equal to private sector saving.  It is extremely important to distinguish between financial assets and real assets and getting the two mixed up leads to absolute incoherence.

For example here.

&gt;Is there any doubt that the wealthiest 400 Americans, with a net worth of $2.3T in 2014 could afford to employ the 9 million unemployed?

You can't directly pay someone from your net worth, you need to convert that net worth to money of some type.  So if all the rich people did that we might have a problem.  The only way it would be possible if the rich people borrowed from the banks with their net worth as collateral.  If that weren't possible for example due to some of their assets not being acceptable as collateral then they couldn't employ everyone.


I notice you ignored my critique of point three. You say unemployment is caused by low private investment as if that counters the idea that it is also caused by government deficits that are two small.  It could be the case that if everyone invested more we would have full unemployment but it could also be that we could have full employment despite a lack of private investment if the government ran larger deficits.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Please, McCain has done more to try and unite the country than some politicians ever have. He's reached across party lines when it comes to sending messages and setting priorities (even if he doesn't necessarily agree with the method of how to accomplish those priorities).

[Look at that man deal with criticism of Obama only a month before the 2008 election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrnRU3ocIH4). I mean just listen to him, ""you have nothing to be scared of,"" while still defending his candidacy. As soon as someone brings up the whole ""Obama is a closet Arab"" thing he doesn't skip a beat and immediately starts tamping it down.

I mean look at him: he's already trying to unite the country before election day, knowing there was a good chance he wouldn't win. I'm left leaning, but shit, if it weren't for Palin he could have won my vote. Obama was a rockstar, but McCain was someone with experience, he was level headed, he was reasonable, and dammit if he didn't command respect just in how he conducted himself on a day to day basis. He was a hard guy to dislike, and I have no doubt Palin was the poison pill that killed his chances.

So here he is, and I'm sure he'd be grumbling quite a bit if Clinton won, but he's reaching out across party lines for what he feels is in the best interests of the country, politics be damned. Hell, he was sort-of against LGBT rights until his daughter came out. And then like so many other people who were anti-LGBT until a family member came out to them he kind of came around and started to understand what LGBT rights were all about. As a member of the LGBT community I can deal with that, I can even understand it. He saw the error of his ways and he realized that changing his stance on this one issue didn't mean selling out all his other values.

By taking a stand on this one issue he's doing significantly more to unite the country than either Trump or Pence. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and I salute McCain for taking a stand on his side of the aisle to agree with that. Yeah, Trump was elected, yeah, it's official, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be routing out Russian influence for future elections, and I think McCain understands that.",1483228848

For me at least taking the recommended dose did not make me high at all, like maybe the tiniest bit woozy but nothing exciting. I suppose you could become ""addicted"" to just the pain relief it provides if your pain doesn't go away or you develop psychosomatic pain from your injury but that's something that needs to be treated surely. Just withholding pain relief from suffering people and telling them to deal with it doesn't sound like a good plan to me.",1483228850

Maybe because its not fair to the solvers, I don't know.

I have met the NVidia guys at quakecon and they are pretty good guys. Nvidia and EVGA give out tons of stuff. I suspect some BYOC sales go to cover that, but not nearly all of it. Nvidia maybe have just not announced the winners but still given out prizes. Maybe they have a reason for it. I really doubt its purely to Fuck with people.

I would ""Nicely"" ask Tom if he has any info about the winners. Although they have CES in like 4 days so I would expect a response in maybe 2 weeks.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","&gt; oh hey, aren't mods usually marked with a little [M] by their username? or is that opt-in? 

It's opt-in. The four of us are generally very active as regular users, so we seldom tag ourselves.

&gt; the flair thing seems really petty, backhanded, and passive aggressive to me.

Could be, but at the same time if we don't try and have some fun with this, modding can drive one crazy with all the brigading that goes on. And speaking of...

&gt; trivial example: if someone if posting on every thread telling the OP to go slit their wrists, it seems pretty beneficial to have the ability to ban that account.

&gt; i think banning someone is a better way of dealing with hopelessly offensive behavior than putting a sticker over their comments that tells people to disregard what they're saying. 

Without going into to much detail, our mod team (and many regulars) have all been banned for Thought Crimes from various sites and subs, and so we vowed to take a different approach to modding. We developed a full hierarchy of tools specifically for this sub that allow us to not have to ban people, and they operate on something of a sliding scale based on the level of trolling and disruption.

Taking something someone said and (in a humorous way) giving them a representative flair is on the mild/passive side of the spectrum. If someone is being as abusive as your example we have much stronger tools to discourage participation without resorting to removing their ability to continue to post. (Threats of violence will be removed under our ""Graffiti and Sharp Objects"" clause)

It's been successful way beyond our original hopes, and our regulars enjoy the levity in our approach. It's why it's earned the nickname Weaponized Snark, because that's exactly what it is. 

&gt; there are some subs that ban you for publicly arguing with a mod, so it is super cool to not worry about that happening here!

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","dissidia's fun for what it is, but i personally like it because it's an honest attempt at creating an origin for the chaos timeloop of final fantasy 1, they basically explain it away by saying there were two chaoses the entire time, dissidia chaos who was a living weapon created by cid in the ancient past, and garland, who dissidia chaos saves, drags into the past and transforms in his own image as a favor due to their friendship in dissidia, it also creates an origin for the warrior of light and the crystal he carries, which i thought was a nice added touch. dissidia ends at the implied beginning of ff1, albeit, one with only 1 warrior of light.",1483228854

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I work at a coffee shop, and I get the chance to interact with asshats every day. For the most part, we just smile and do what we can to rectify the situation, but I have seen some of my coworkers get away with more than a few borderline, if not absolutely fireable offenses when interacting with said asshats, such as: running around the bar to fight a customer whilst swearing loudly, indirect insults said just loud enough to be heard by said customer, or just being passive aggressive as fuck. Most of them deserved, and rarely punished. 

The worst was when we had a lady come in with a line to the door and only two baristas working (my shift and I), raging over ""burnt, moldy tasting coffee."" It's worth noting that I had personally cleaned the machines and urns earlier that day, and the coffee I poured her was maybe 5 minutes old if that. So I did my whole shtick of pleasantly offering a fresh replacement, plus refund, plus a freebie for next time - no go. She proceeds to stand there shouting how it's ""always"" like this, every other store she goes to is fine, and how incompetent, lazy, and unwilling we are to fix the situation. So I offer (with the line still fully intact, mind you) to clean the machines again in front of her, along with all the previous offers (fresh cup, refund, freebies for next time) and she STILL keeps shouting, not hearing any of my attempts to make it right. I'm shaking with rage at this point, about to lose my cool, I look at this woman and just say plainly ""so what do you want me to do, MA'AM?!"" She blows up again, but this time my shift (who is making drinks and trying to work the line around her the whole time) saves the day with a stern ""you know what, we told you what we can do, and if none of that's going to make you happy, then you can leave."" Still stands there shouting, this time with a lot more abusive expletives. My buddy picks up the phone, says ""I'm calling the police,"" and I see the rage build up into this crazy lady's red face just before she throws the cup of coffee in her hand behind the bar, directly at us. 

Thankfully she was a shit throw, so neither of us were burned. My shift took that opportunity to tear into her. Like, really fucking pissed. He shouts ""that's attempted assault, get the fuck out right now, can somebody please write down this bitch's plates?!"" She turned and ran out to her car and peeled out in front of the store. 

Turns out he never really dialed the cops, and no plate number was taken down, but we at least got great tips and extra-kind sentiments from the customers still waiting in line who saw the whole thing go down. Also a plus, we never had to deal with that cunt again. We filed an incident report, but I've never seen a coworker get in trouble for refusing service to people being outright dicks. 

Also, her husband still comes in and buys coffee. Guess it wasn't too bad after all? ",1483228855

3.)  Again, maybe a weapon that can increase overheal amount.  I dunno, I'm gonna have to mess around with that idea when I get the chance.

Well, first off, we might need to buff the demoknight loadout just a *small* bit.  Don't want it to be too powerful.  The Loch-and-Load?  Maybe.  It's fine where it is in pubs (and maybe HL) due to the prevalence of sentries, but it seems to be underpowered (UP for short) in 6s and maybe HL.  Quickiebomb Launcher, I also don't know the status of.  Same with Scottish Resistance, seems both of them  are more or less balanced.  Most of the melee weapons could use a rework of some kind.  Skullcutter is pretty boring, so maybe add some sort of comp-focused gimmick to it.  Possibly revert the Clad-....the Cla....goddammit, I don't know how to spell that sword.  Anyway, possibly revert that sword's stats to having a larger charge duration, so that it becomes a viable weapon to at least use in pubs.  RIP.  Yeah, that's all I can think of.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","There are scads of grammar rules, though.  Such as when do you use past perfect or past participial?  Conjugation of verbs is far from consistent as well, and in English there are no gender-specific forms.

There are many native English speakers who struggle with the language as it is.  Consider ""they're"", ""their"" and ""their"".  ""Two"" ""too"" and ""to"".  Numerous times do I see native English speakers write ""a lot"" as one word...and it should be simple enough.  It literally means, ""one lot"".  Or how many people say, ""on accident"" instead of ""by accident""?  Grammatically, ""by accident"" is more correct.

And there's another thing.  All the suffixes and prefixes we throw into the language, and the rules don't always apply.  ""-er"" means ""more"", but you don't say, ""correcter"".  ""In-"" means ""not"" same with ""non"", (as in inconceivable), but not always, ask Dr. Nick: ""inflammable"" doesn't mean ""non-flammable"".

We also use auxiliary verbs such as ""might"" or ""may"" which diminish the obligation.  ""I might go out,"" doesn't necessarily mean that I will go out, it means that there is a chance that I will also stay in.

And how many people know when they should use, ""could"", ""should"" or ""would"" properly?  Not very many, I imagine.",1483228860

Still kind of boring at times, but having a clear objective really helped to carry me through the boring parts. The voice acting was still pretty terrible, though. 

The ending felt kind of anticlimactic. I was expecting it to be ""bigger"" than it was. Instead, it just kind of ends and that's that. Don't get me wrong, they did a good job of wrapping up the story, but when it ended I felt like ""oh, that's it, it's over? Okay."" I didn't feel any sense of vindication when the Origami Killer dies or sadness when a main character dies. Indifference is a pretty good description of what I was feeling, if that makes any sense. It was nothing compared to Life is Strange, which left me just staring at the main menu for a good 20 minutes, trying to process all the emotions. 

One other small thing I noticed: Even though this game is clearly set in America, all the electrical wall outlets in the game are European outlets. Also, some doors in the game have signs saying ""Fire door keep shut"", which is a strictly European/U.K. thing. Seems kind of strange they would overlook something as simple as wall outlets. Surely they're aware outlets are not the same around the world?

That's important- becoming a parent does constrain things, but regardless of how one feels about this, they move on because they have to. There's this narrative- especially fed by the idea that women long for babies whereas men have wives and babies like accessories- that women somehow don't mind the struggles of parenting when really they have just adapted to them.

But there's another aspect to this trend that's not really about the babies. There's traditionally an expectation that wives will support their husband's dreams. Even in relationships where the wives work as well and the couple self-reports as egalitarian, wives still do the majority of the housework while men have more leisure time. So when a baby comes and suddenly the wife's energy is spent on caring for the infant and resting, a husband who was seeing his wife as a caretaker will resent the child for taking away his caretaker rather than seeing himself as responsible for also being a caretaker to the child.

Teachers in my district started getting RIFed a few years ago and I overheard a teacher tell another one who was getting laid-off to ""just move over to special ed because it's just babysitting."" The next year, the recipient of that advice offered to sub my class while I had to take a few days off. I had a rough class that year (students who had emotional disturbance, autism, oppositional defiance, and ADHD to name a few and still under the mild/moderate umbrella, but I still ""only"" had 14 students).

But in both of those scenarios there are existing laws to cover that harm that they were doing. Creating a law to punish the reason for that behavior is only going to punish people who were doing the drug without hurting anyone else.

Both of your examples (along with almost any other drug related problem) can and do happen from alcohol use. I don't know if you drink, but it's very likely that you do. Either way, I don't think that you would say that a person is creating a victim by drinking alcohol. Why not extend the same logic to drugs? It doesn't mean you have to change anything about what you do. Just acknowledge that the drugs themselves don't create victims.",1483228863

"politics","t5_2cneq","i already touched on what the government gains from lying to us but it goes even further than that. They gain a disgusting amount from this:

1) Media control. This narrative is going hand in hand with the fake news shit which they are using as an excuse to push laws that allow them to empower and influence media outlets for their own interests. Obama just signed a bill supported by this anti russian push that lets them gain more control of the media. By saying ""Russians hacked and influenced our election,"" they get people to turn a blind eye to this and think, ""Well okay as long as it's to stop those nasty, evil russians.

2) Geopolitical power. The past 10 years or so the US has been pushing for a pipeline through the middle east to Europe. It is competing with a russian pipeline for the same purpose. Our middle eastern allies like Saudi Arabia do us favors while we do them favors and the same is true of russia and their middle eastern allies like Syria. The syrian war is a result of this conflict because the US wants their people in control because of saudi arabia and because it allows us control of the region to build our pipeline.

By calling out russia for hacking our election it gives them approval to push more against russia without people being upset by such destructive foreign policy. It also enables the potential for more direct subversion and antagonization of Russia (war, sanctions, etc) that reduce their ability to challenge our goals.

&gt; No one is pushing a ""narrative;"" the media is reporting facts, details, and statements from experts associated with the investigation into the Russian hacking attacks

REALLY? No one is pushing a narrative? You believe this is all just done on the up and up? The media that was caught colluding with the hillary campaign and the media that literally used to be on the government payroll and is about to be right back on the payroll through a new bill just passed? They're just telling the facts? Even though they ignore many other facts and push everything fitting their goals? You haven't been paying attention.",1483228864

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Futuristic dystopias had been imagined since the birth of electricity, bolstered by the computing revolution, and wrong. So completely, and utterly, wrong.

They often took two routes. In one, the government became an oppressive entity, controlling and demanding, crushing the vibrancy of life into robot-like slavery through the threat of legal violence. In the other, corporations did much the same, though with private security companies bordering on armies and monopolies on basic necessities.

The truth is that they are lame. Faceless entities are easy to demonise. However, they are weak, crippled by people, inside and out. When societies across the world made information power, and made information digital, security lagged behind.

Democratic governments became unable to hold together amongst the constant leaks of their private conversations. The more they constrained themselves, the more sensational every leak became, regardless of the contents.

Autocracies met more bloody ends. Paranoia between leaders and their military worsened as every utterance of unrest, including inside the army and government, had to be dealt with, only to stir further unease. The cycle continued, until the people of the country rebelled, and broke apart to merge into neighbouring states, or establish a new, weaker government.

Meanwhile, the monolithic companies that seemed untouchable became scrutinised and fined, and, as the global unrest rose, they became targets for political parties looking to seize power. With many of the developed countries becoming impossible to operate in, the manufacturing abroad collapsed, along with the companies.

Now, governments are for enforcing the most basic of laws, and protecting sovereignty. Companies rely on robotics, and operate more-or-less as an extension of the government, producing food and consumer goods to keep the people content.

What has arisen, from the ashes of the old system, is a reliance on anonymity. Those still in power speak in code under codenames to each other, and they fear what will happen if their codename is revealed. Those who slip between the cracks of digital security are much the same. The only difference between the two is who they fear: the people, or the government.

So it has come that, more than anything, to hide every single identifying information is paramount. In this dystopia we live in, there's power in a name.",1483228866

In Australia,  we have a Generation Y which overlaps Gen X and millennials.  I happily identify with Gen Y,  I don't identify with X or millennials.  

My boyfriend is only 2 years younger than me,  so we're from the same generation. But his family is several social classes above me and grew up in urban UK while I grew up in rural Australia.  We compared how old we were when certain technology came into the house. 

He was born with a PC in the house,  I was in my third year of school when dad bought one.  He was 6 when they got the Internet at home (dial up)  and 8 when they got broadband. I was 10 when we got dial up,  and we never for broadband until I moved out at 19 into an area that had broadband.  First mobile phone was at 12 for him and 19 for me,  I was 22 when I got my first smart phone, he was 17. From day dot he would use digital encyclopedias to complement assignments,  I was at the library checking out books until I was 14, and our library got personal use computers with Internet.  But the city library had computers for a decade. 

I'm 2 years older,  but I was 4+ years behind on tech because of accessibility and affordability. 

Long story short: I don't feel like I belong to any generation because people are always talking about technology and how it defines you.  But it's not just when you were born that shapes your relationship with tech. What other measures are there to define a generation? ",1483228870

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","You just missed one of the best times to play graveyard, but it's still a good card if you learn the in's and out's of it. 

**Deck:** Graveyard, Bowler, Archers, Mega Minion, Ice Golem or Ice Spirit, Tombestone or Skarmy, Fireball, Zap

**Bowler:** Use bowler as an defensive card and use him as your tank to your graveyard push. Never use him as your starting card unless you have to because he's a perfect counter against Elite Barbs and they're so common now you have to expect them like every game.

**Archers:** These girls can be used when your opponent drops a Skarmy or Graveyard. You can also do Ice Golem + Archers to kill Elite barbs. Most likely you will be using them on defense like the bowler.

**Mega Minion:** The Mega Minion can be used as an supporting troop to the bowler. He's pretty much your tank killer. 

**Ice Golem/Ice Spirit:** If you're lucky enough to get a good enough cycle you'll find your self playing a Ice Golem/Ice Spirit and Graveyard. The Golem tanks enough for your Graveyard to take out the tower if your enemy does not respond to the skellies appropriately. The Ice Spirit kind behaves as an mini freeze if it gets to the enemies tower. You put down your graveyard first then wait about half a second, then place your Ice Spirit. 

**Tombestone/Skarmy:** Everybody knows how use tombestone... I hope so.. maybe. Well Skarmy on the other hand can act as a zap bait. When your Graveyard start to overwhelm your enemy, if they have nothing to play they usually zap your Graveyard skellies.

**Fireball**: You don't want to do this at first usually but when you play your Graveyard your opponent might play a troop that might seem Fireball worthy, but really you're over committing. You want to Fireball when you know the troop you Fireballed will die. You don't want them to use them to counter push.

**Zap**: Same thing I said about Fireball goes for Zap.

Most of Trumps life he was partying with the elites. He's always been great with everyday people but media and the wealthy always treated Trump good. Once Trump became a threat and not a joke the elite media and establishment turned on him. The media, celebrities, and political elites casted him out and banished him down to us deplorables. That's when Trump travled the US and saw what was happening to the working class. People in his own campaign told him not to talk about vote rigging, Soros, Bill dicking bimbos and more. In comes Bannon, from bringing Bills victims to the second debate (which changed the polls and direction of the race) to sounding the alarms on stealing the election, to draining the swamp to exposing crooked Hillary... Steve Bannon played a huge role in manning up and not running a traditional campaign which would have lost him the race. Then as the Comey letter came and Obama care skyrocketed Trump switched gears and stayed on message. Also props to Roger Stone for getting Trump on The Alex Jones show. That hidden vote the media couldn't account for was the patriot movement. We didn't vote for Obama Bush Romney Kerry Clinton because we knew they were two sides of the same coin. We did make a push for Ron Paul in 12... so props to Ron Paul, he also played a big role no one is talking about. The 2012 Ron Paul movement got thousands of people involved in becoming delegates, the RNC changed the rules to force Romney on us. Those same rules benefited Trump this year haha.

A gun and marijuana are completely different, literally applies to hand grenades.

A person needs to use a gun to kill people, though a person can kill someone without a gun just as easily.

Marijuana, on the other hand, changes the way your body works, your perceptions and offers a myriad of various consequential affects which either allow or prohibit a person from effectively functioning - IE; operating a vehicle.  

A person makes the active choice of using a firearm, and smoking a joint.  Once a gun is put down or away from the person, that person's actions, inhibitions or anything even remotely contributing to their bodily function do not change, none of that ever changes.  (Maybe adrenaline from shooting a firearm?)

Once a person smokes a joint or eats a pot infused cookie, the affects will become indistinguishable from that persons conscious actions.  Same with alcohol, or any drug, since a person who is under the influence is still responsible for their actions.  ",1483228878

An inspection camera will find breaks or hard kinks in the duct. 

Your long term solution will likely involve spending money:
1. Replacement of all of the flex duct with hard duct. This can be done on a run by run basis. It will be disruptive in the house because you will have to open up the walls.

2. Cut off the first floor from the attic unit and install a basement unit sized to condition the first floor. Install dedicated hard duct that supplies up from the basement.

Both of these options will cost money.

Mostly we were treated very nicely, and in return we behaved ourselves - tipping generously and not making too much of a mess.

One situation I do remember was at a sports bar in early July. We had been seated for roughly 45 minutes with our drink orders untouched, let alone food. A couple of my friends had tried to get the waitress's attention, to no avail.

Walking back from the bathroom I heard our waitress talking to another, explaining how it was ok to let us [""pindoses""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-American_sentiment_in_Russia#Pindos) wait because she felt we didn't deserve normal service.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","It's all about sustained vs. burst energy output.

To, minimum, destroy an earth sized planet, would take 2.24 × 10^32 Joules of energy.  Let's assume that's the base line for the Death Star.

The Death Star bursts out this energy in about 2-3 seconds.  No where do we see the Death Star ***sustaining this level of output for greater than 2-3 seconds***.  It's a tremendous amount of energy, but it only available for short periods of time.  

Goku, on the other hand, can easily peak out this level of energy and **sustain it for several seconds, up to a minute**.  This is not a problem for Goku.  Maybe when he was fighting Vegeta this would be somewhat of a challenge (Not really, as Kaio-Ken would easily break the Death Star in a struggle),  but afterwards this would be relatively easy.

Goku stomps due to ***how the Death Star was built to operate***.",1483228887

It seamlessly blends character introduction, character growth, symbolism, and moral dilemmas into one (or like 11) expertly crafted world(s).

"medicine","t5_2qhff","I'm not claiming that AI systems are about to overtake doctors, and in fact I say they aren't going to do so *at all* in the next two years (and after that I'm not willing to make predictions yet). But your arguments aren't correct. 

Modern AI systems, particularly visual ones, are great at context. That is how they work so well. 

If you never tell the system what a birthday party is, it won't be able to use the *word*. But it will know that balloons, party hats and cakes occur together, in certain patterns. It will understand the *concept* of a party.

And if you do give it the words, it can absolutely identify birthday parties accurately. Look at caption generation for images, for example. The is a picture halfway down [this piece](http://wp.me/p7mecx-eK) of a captioning system in action. The article explains a fair bit about how these systems incorporate context as well if you are interested.

Ultimately, this means that AI systems of the future could absolutely discriminate between pneumonia and carcinoma in situ. This is no different than discriminating between dog breeds, and current systems do that easily. They could also make complex decisions in the anaesthetic situation you describe. This reactive human-like decision making is shown in systems like AlphaGo and self driving cars. These systems use some sort of general principles to make decisions, even in situations they have never experienced. They don't just ""balance numbers"", even in the slightest.

Even human doctors work this way. As doctors get more experienced, they do more and more pattern matching, based on their accumulated experience. There are tons of studies to show this, and we all experience it ourselves - how often do your senior colleagues have to think through a problem in the OR? How often do they just ""know"" the right thing to do at a glance?

Doctors are actually less effective when they have to rely on a conscious knowledge base.",1483228892

Then again, I could be wrong about all of this. After all, some idiots think a puppy biting them or chewing on things they shouldn't is cute too.

This is a rebound relationship for her after a failed multiple-year marriage.  Part of her motivation in pursuing me was to ""respond"" to her ex-husband finding another woman.  I have very little relationship experience.  I went into this with a ""let's try this out"" mentality.  It was dishonest on my part to stay with her as the hookup stage gradually ended and something else rose in its place.

My life plans do not include any permanent romantic partners, kids, or family connections.  To the best that I can tell, she is looking for another husband or someone to treat as such.  We generally have a good time when we are together - this has been covering up the fact that we are fundamentally incompatible.

You have to get in a specific head space of the character who is an angry yeller type of person and get yourself open and vulnerable and prepare for half an hour to get to the right spot in your mind and you give 110% and then some asshole ruins all that work, and you don't know if you can even get that moment back. And your on hour 15 of filming and youre fucking tired and haven't slept in 40 hours, and some idiot makes a three second mistake that is going to cost you another hour to set up and film the shot, and you explode.

Dogs with thick, long dropped ears are prone to ear infections, because the heavy ear leather traps moisture. Doberman ears aren't long or heavy, so infections are less of a problem; however, cropped ears do generally stay cleaner than uncropped ears do. Additionally, a cropped ear is less likely to develop a hematoma (a blood-filled pocket on the ear leather), which typically requires surgery to repair.

Smite is a MOBA who's main selling point besides mythology incorporated and the third person POV is multiple gamemodes. You aren't forced to play a 5v5 game mode if you are interested in the game but want to play it casually. Duel serves it's niche as a gamemode that you can actually outplay your opponent and be rewarded because of it instead of losing because the opposing team has a better team comp or several better players. 


There are high tier gods for every gamemode and ridiculing Duel because of it is absurd. Those high tier gods are countered by gods in similar tiers and even lower tiers. 


Duel also exists as an alternate method of obtaining the end of season ranked rewards if players cannot commit fully to playing Ranked Conquest or finding consist players to party with in Ranked Joust. 


Lastly, who is affected by Duel's existence? No one is being impacted negatively by it and if players dislike the mode, they can simply not play it. Removing the mode however would negatively impact the players who play it and enjoy it.",1483228898

"linkedin","t5_2qtyx","Here are some ideas:

1) Change the photo: I'm not saying you need to commission a professional portrait, but the selfie in the passenger seat of the car is not good. Even some other non-professional one would be OK, but not the car selfie with one eye cocked. I feel like a photo from your time in the navy would be good (especially since you want to get jobs in private security), as that will catch a lot of peoples' eye and many people like to hire former military, especially in that industry. But since that was 10 years ago, if you look totally different now than you did  then, it might not be a great idea. But you need a new photo.

2) Update your title: If you have an eye-catching title like VP of International Business Development, then sure you can make ""your"" title the same as your current job title. But if you're doing loss prevention at Nordstrom (and if you're looking to move to another job), I recommend making your LinkedIn title something about your industry (like ""Private Security Professional""...that's not a great one but it's better than the current one sounds). People can still see your current job title in your Experience Section, even if it's not on your LinkedIn title (under your name).

And actually, your profile does a pretty good job at painting the picture of you as an all around private security guy.

3) You had an early honorable discharge from the Navy--that may be fine, but may be a red flag for some people. If it paints a better picture to add some more details (like if it were due to an injury), you may want to. If it won't help to add more details, then don't.

4) Another thing that caught my eye is that you scored 96% on the national police officer test in 2015? That sounds good, but then one might think, ""so why isn't he a police officer/in training?"" I'm not saying you should be (a lot of reasons not to go into that line of work), but together with the 10 month honorable discharge from the Navy, it might make people think, ""if he's capable of being a navy intelligence specialist or police force candidate, why is he working in retail security (in a non-supervisory role)?"" On a related note, why is your employment so short at most companies? 4, 6, 10 months...is it possible you're working for a staffing firm that is placing you at multiple places for security gigs? If so, list the staffing firm as your employer (longer time period) and you can list the various clients in the description. If you're really jumping around so much for retail security/doorman positions, then it really looks bad like something's going on. If there is a good reason for hopping around (like if they were short term contracts each time), then you should list that in the description for each. Otherwise it looks like you have issues holding down similar jobs (each one was not exactly a big promotion).

5) Background images can be a great tool, but in the case of yours, it's hard to tell what it is. Is that a bar you enjoy or are a bouncer for? If there's something related to your professional interests, great. It can also be something personal (like a picture of you or others doing a hobby you enjoy if it's not unprofessional looking...) but the current one is not good (and the way it's laid out after upload it doesn't really look like anything).

Hope that helps!

"lifeisstrange","t5_32tf7","&gt; Is it just a nightmare with no significance except to be a highlight reel of the game and I'm reading too much into it?

No, it's a nightmare, so literally in her head, and as such obviously subject to psychological interpretation. Just as the entire game is to metaphorical/allegorical. There are other meaningful ways to interpret fiction beside ""it's all in the head"". A story about growing up, about the world, life, yourself within those, a story about humans and interhuman connection, about love. It does not have to be about dealing with grief, and I don't see it as such.

My ""magic"" argument was just to show that your accuracy claim to do with ""explaining"" things is based on nothing, and that ""magic"" argument obviously only extends to those things you think are strange and must thus be explained by saying they are not real; the argument is not that the entire story's message would then boil down to ""magic"".

I don't want to argue in terms of different interpretations here or point any out; I have done enough of that, don't really have the time right now either as it would end up with me rambling on endlessly. Out of various things I'd disagree with here, I responded only to your claim that your interpretation is more accurately describing the reality of the game than others, which is pretty ludicrous given that it says nothing we see in it is actually real, and that Max would actually be going through something completely different. I could talk about how inherently that theory doesn't make sense on a psychological (for example: dealing with grief in stages is a myth, and dealing with grief by dreaming up a world in which you confront yourself with said grief over and over is equally as provably not how psychology works - in such cases where we cannot deal with the grief, we flee from it, not exponentiate it in our mind) and narrative (if the story was about overcoming death of a loved one, it would not tell the story of the bond to said loved one growing beyond and transcending everything) level, but I just wanted to respond to that claim.

I do think the ""dealing with grief"" interpretation is valid to an extent, and even though I absolutely do not see LiS as such a story, I gladly accept it can be that for other people, especially if it resonates with and even helps them on a personal level. And however much I dislike the idea of just taking a story and claiming ""it's all a dream!"", if you like that interpretation, sure, keep it. But the idea that it would be more accurate? That's you asking for replies like mine.

&gt;I think that those two being the same thing, at the end, is defensible.

How? If all is in her mind, time travel not ""real"" part of the story, how can reality function exactly (and meta-confirmedly via. the photo-transitions) like that?

&gt;Also I don't know what you mean by the second sentence.

Up until 4/5th of the game, the writers were telling a story in which Chloe survives in all endings. That means your interpretation of the story to be about dealing with Chloe's death loses a lot of validity because all of that writing, and its manifestation in the game, up until that point never conceived of the idea of that death that you think the story is all about. It would still play a role in-narrative since Max and Chloe assume she'd die... but not only does this make any ""grief"" theory even more questionable that does accept the story at face-value (those have to deal with the paradox of Max having visions before even metting Chloe, and saving her without knowing who she is), it all but excludes the possibility that the story was intended to be about Max dealing with Chloe's death in her head, because that death did not exist.",1483228902

I'm not saying Halifax doesn't have green spaces (point pleasant is amazing, but still has issues) but the point is that Halifax seems to be going in the opposite direction of Dartmouth in terms of beautification and public spaces.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Along with what others have said, you may also need to assign it a drive letter (also in Disk Management; if I recall correctly, right-click the drive in question).  I used to usually have to do this in Win Vista, 7, and 8 when I'd add a new drive; even if already formatted, my new drive usually wouldn't show up in Windows outside of DM until I did this. 

I haven't replaced or added any drives with Windows 10 yet but the process oughta be the same if required. Just a heads up in case formatting the new drive doesn't immediately fix the issue. 

This is also handy if you wish to reassign drives different letters for organization's sake; I liked keeping my optical drive(s) letters after all my HDDs. Example: if I previously had 2 HDDs set to C: and D: and a DVD drive set to E: then added a new HDD, often by default the new drive would either automatically be assigned F: or F: would be the first option available if I had to manually set the drive letter. This drives me crazy, so I'd set the optical drive to be F: before installing the new HDD so that the new drive would be E:. 

Similar idea if adding a new HDD that is taking over the duties of an older drive but still want to keep the older drive for something else such as for backing up data. Set old drive to an unused letter, set new drive to the old drive's letter, then clone old data over to the new drive and anything that relied on that old data being on a particular install location will still work just fine (usually; like anything, sometimes something may act goofy) except now that data is on the new drive (which is likely larger or faster or both). I've done this a few times over the years when phasing out old data storage/gaming drives for newer ones due to needing more space. Note you wouldn't need to do this if changing your OS drive; there's simpler methods for that, and Windows should always automatically assign C: to the drive you boot from; I used to see this in action when dual-booting later versions of Windows. 

Haha, I didn't intend for this to end up being such a long post for what was supposed to be a quick answer, but it can be a handy thing to know how to do for a few different reasons if running multiple drives.  ",1483228903

I was suicidal, in and out of hospitals for both serious and not-so-serious attempts, out of touch with family and friends, literally dreading every moment of existence and hardly able to show up to work. I switched to a job that's good hard labor and within the last two years my life has changed so dramatically that I am no longer the same person. This advice applies to any decent labor position- construction, animal husbandry/slaughter, landscaping, janitorial, detailing, etc. Bonus points if you have some building maintenance  or automechanic skills (even just knowing how to change oil or fix a blown fuse/a leaky or clogged pipe, etc)... these jobs are always hiring, they're incredibly satisfying, and when the day is over and you clock out, you don't take home any of the stress or work. Go home, have a beer, smoke a blunt, whatever. The longer you work in these fields, the more you get paid and the less hard you have to work. Your coworkers will be happier people with all kinds of unique backgrounds, so no more boring elevator banter and strained friendliness, you will look forward to being around them. The jobs are more fun too, working with your hands and doing new things will always keep you interested and not bored, the day will zip by most of the time. Oh, and ladies please don't shy away from this either. I am a woman. Don't underestimate you're strength or ability to do traditionally ""men's"" work. At first it's incredibly intimidating, and you will have to work a little harder to prove your abilities, but it's so incredibly worth all of it. Every ounce pays off double, I swear.

Normally, you sue the driver. You have no relationship whatsoever to their insurance company. They have insurance so that the insurance company will (I presume) pay for their defense, and, if you win, will pay you whatever you win, up to the limit of the policy. If the policy doesn't cover the full amount, then you will have already sued and won for the balance, and can take whatever legal remedy is appropriate (garnishment, seizure, whatever).

&gt; 

There's tons of proof for why evolution, or global warming is real, yet there are still plenty of people who still refuse to believe in these - very real - things. 

People refusing to believe in something doesn't say anything about it being actually real or not, even if the ""unbelievers"" are in the majority. It doesn't matter if one person or one hundred percent of people believe something to be real, it doesn't make it any more or less real.

The simple fact of that matter is that the Clinton campaign suffered death by a thousand cuts, some self inflicted, others from her opponents on the right, and even a few from opponents on her left.  There was no single cause, no event that one can point to and say for certain ""This is why she lost.""  
  
I've said as much before, but I feel it bears repeating: One of my biggest concerns in the wake of this election is that we, my fellow progressives and Democrats, will learn the wrong lessons from our defeat.  If we look back on 2016 and conclude ""If we just had a better firewall we would have won in a landslide."" or ""We never should have run on social issues."" then we'll have learned the wrong thing.  
  
*Each cut* must be examined and understood, *every straw* weighed from our broken camel's back, before we can say with any certainty what we must do tomorrow.

If it's four years for the SOL (and some places are), and you're correct about the date of first default of 9/12, then finding a payment record could be vitally important, as the suit may be beyond the SOL for filing.

Being outside the SOL is not a protection, it's an affirmative defense - you still need to file an answer with the court, or it'll default against you.

And it seems like this time there is a viable alternative for normal use, though it needs a good amount of R&amp;D still. I've been reading a lot of reviews on the AirPods (haven't tried them yet) and from what I'm seeing, they're better than people expected from Bluetooth. Not quite groundbreaking, but they did develop some improvements that make them better than what we've seen so far. While most other Bluetooth headphones are wired to each other and receive a single Bluetooth signal, Apple's are separated and receive independent signals which results in almost no sound latency. They sound better than expected, last longer than most, and have a further range than most. Their W1 chip works really well so there's really no connection issues at all.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","She's still alive. I've moved to the other side of the country and we rarely speak. An occasional text at most. It was actually incredibly easy to pretty much cut her out, because she doesn't make any real effort to contact me either. 

My husband's family live in the same town as her and when we visited I would try and reach out to see her, but even if we're there for a week or two I would only see her once, for about an hour at most. She doesn't seem too interested in seeing me, or her grandchildren so I gave up trying. I'll tell her I'm in town, just in case we run into each other, but that's it. 

What kills me tho, is that my children won't have a real grandmother. Growing up I never met my Dad's parents, because they live in another country, and my mom's mom was always very mean, distant, and generally treated me and my sisters as though we were something to be tolerated. (I learned later it's because she's racist against my dad) For a long time I thought the kinds of grandma's you see on tv, the loving happy to see you hugging kind of grandma wasn't real. But then I met my husband's mom and grandmother. They're the kind of mom and grandma I'd always wanted. I was so happy that my kids would have them. But then 2 years ago his mom died from a long illness. We were crushed and now my kids won't have a real grandma either. So I've sworn to be the mom I always wanted, and to be the grandma I always wanted when they have their own kids. I've got a long way to go, as the oldest is only 8, so I'm jumping ahead a bit.

Sorry for the long reply, and for practically telling you my life story, I just needed to get this off my chest.",1483228919

I haven't seen much of it either, though I will give you one case I ran into personally. I was talking with a friend about Rogue One, and he said something to the effect that he had been concerned that the movie was another sop to SJW and he questioned the reasons behind having a female leading character. I was really rather surprised by that. 

I grew up on Star Trek, particularly DS9. I guess I came to the conclusion early on that whether you were right for the job was more important than what bathroom you use. So I was a bit puzzled by my friend's concerns.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 6 or 7 years ago I was going through a major rap phase. I loved me some rap and I loved it LOUD.

One night, I was headed over to my friend's house to pregame and then head out to a local bar. While driving over I was listening to some rap song kinda loud. Not so loud it was shaking the car or anything but if you pulled up next to me you could hear it. Well, 3 bikers pulled up beside me at a 4 lane stop and are yelling at me to turn my music down. I thought something was wrong with my car so I turned it down. They continued to yell obscenities at me so I decided to turn my music back up... but much louder this time as I drove off. The bikers decided to dangerously take turns cutting me off and yelling at me. At the next stoplight there was a cop so I lowered my music slightly and the bikers stopped harassing me and drove away.

After spending some time at my friend's house we headed out to the bar. An 80s rock cover band was playing that night. My friend knew someone in the band so we listened for a bit and met up with a few of her work friends. After being there for 10 minutes I feel someone tapping my arm. It was one of the bikers from earlier, ""You're the n*gg** wannabe bitch from earlier! We told you to turn your fuckin music down!""

Forgot to add, the character stats panel also tells you what your ideal primary stats should be. It will outright say what each stat does for your class.

"G502MasterRace","t5_35vaa","It's just a shame because I need a new mouse since my old coolermaster one has seen much better days. I did look extensively into this mouse before pulling the trigger even though it was on sale. I knew prior that the mouse wheel wasn't the best in the industry, but after holding it, the metal, for me, isn't so bad. While I could do without the side to side buttons and scroll wheel lock/unlock (like the 402) I figured the braided cable and sensor would be worth it to try out a free scrolling wheel. I don't mind the toggle but as I said It literally looks wobbly when I spin it, and tons of vids online show it spin perfectly straight. 

While I did see that post before, I don't have a 400s nor do I have the money to buy one just to get the mouse wheel out of it to mod my new mouse (which I'm not sure I'm comfortable with doing, don't even have replacement mouse feet) and of course I live in Canada so RMA shipping fees would hit me like a phaser on stun. 

My wheel doesn't even roll backwards on it's own when it stops spinning, (like some people's) it looks like the wheel is installed on the axle lopsided. instead of 90 degrees on both sides, it slightly varies causing a wobble when spinning.

A video called ""G502 master race infinite scroll"" on YouTube shows it spinning much better than mine and even sounds better. Mine sounds different like mine's wrong or something.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","Misinterpreted what I said. Let's say you're having an argument with your SO. Your base reaction might be to protect yourself and your own resources. For marriage you must not do this. You must step above your instinctual/base reaction/selfish desire to try to communicate with your so effectively and use your cognitive abilities to come up with a compromise. That's simply what I mean. Of course, deciding to forgo marriage entirely doesn't mean you won't face these situations in your life. For instance, in your career you will often have to bite your tongue and deny yourself from acting on some base desires Because you know they are at odds with your ultimate goal. In a relationship it's similar, but even harder still since ""biting your tongue"" is just what you need to do to stop yourself from saying something wrong and listen to your partner and give them a chance to speak. But then you need to go further, as far as actually tempering your desires/expectations/wants because that's detrimental to your partner. At least you can go home after work and blow off the steam, but a marriage won't work without genuine compromise ...You can certainly go off to clear your head and such but in the end you and the partner should both feel satisfied with the outcome. Even if it's not what you originally intended. Anyway the basic premise here is not giving up your ""goals"" for other people (how did we get to goals???) But rather your selfish desires. Also you will probably change your goals slightly based on this other person. Like say they really value exercise but you've never been into it. You agree with them that it's important even though it wasn't your goal before and now it is. People who forgo marriage aren't necessarily not doing similar things in their life, but the simple point is that, if you're *incapable* of compromise (you must always have your way , must always be right) you aren't cut out for the trials of marriage which tell you you must step above that level of thinking and control/temper those basic desires in light of a greater goal you want to achieve (peace and harmony in the relationship)

Most people I know who are getting married are doing so with no assets and same earning potential (all my friends who met their boyfriends in our engineering college). Their dual income provides them with cushy lifestyles. I know 5 people who are married with a house in the 25-28 age range. Kinda nuts sure...But most people in my age group can't afford that lifestyle. The married engineers seem to be doing well for themselves.

I'm a light sleeper and I wake up two or three times a night *every night* whether it's to pee or get a glass of water or if my stupid cat is pawing at my door.  

That night though, slept like a baby.  I don't understand why I had to have a perfect uninterrupted 8 hour sleep on that particular night.  Our rooms were right next to each other, I'm utterly confused at how I couldn't have heard him doing what he did.  

Two years later and I'm still trying to remember if I was awake at all during that night; if I got up to pee real quick and just forgot.  

Watching his mother approach his body in the morning and hearing her scream gave me such an irregular feeling.  I always thought that a moment such as that would simply be an intense amount of sadness.  

But watching a mother panic at the sight of her dead son gave me such a primal fear, as if I was stripped of the securities of civilization and I was back in the jungle, with fear and uncertainties all around me.  For several days after that, I dreamt about finding exotic alien-like bugs in my apartment, like my apartment was turning into an Amazonian jungle.  And I dreamt about finding his body again, several times.  After that, I kept dreaming about him coming back and how his suicide was just some silly misunderstanding.

It definitely left me with scar tissue, these things don't ever resolve with time.  You learn to live with it.  His family and I are doing as best as we can to endure.  

I stopped visiting them after a few months because all they ever did was try to gather more details about the event (if he did it with the lights on or off, if he was drunk, why he chose to use a dog leash, etc).  I didn't want to keep reliving that moment and I didn't want to keep constructing more of that event into their minds.

Second thing you need to watch is USB ports and how they are internal connected to the laptop motherboard.

These are colors because they actually exist on their own wavelength. Brown, black, white, and pink are NOT true colors, because they do not exist on their own wavelengths. They are either combinations of two or more wavelengths (that deceive our brains because our brains cannot separate wavelengths), or the absence of all wavelengths.

If you wrote 可口可乐 in pinyin, it would give ke3 kou3 ke3 le4, that people would still read ""可口可乐"", and while it doesn't make sense, it still does, in a sense. It roughly makes ""can mouth can happiness"", which sounds stupid, but people know it's a foreign brand name, so they don't pay attention to the meaning of the words. 

That's also why writing someone's title is often better than their name (the original point): Chinese names have meaning, but western names ""converted"" to Chinese do not, or have very strange or awkward ones, as the ideograms still have meaning themselves. For example, Alexander becomes 亚历山大 (ya4 li4 shan1 da4), or ""the Asian calendar's mountain is big""; even if the Chinese will know that it's a foreign name, ""The will of the blades"" still sounds better than ""the Asian calendar's mountain is big"", don't you think?",1483228944

1. 4.5-5 hours battery life running basic apps (chrome, slack, Evernote, etc) on stage they claimed 10 hours on professional tools. 

2. Weird design choices - the headphone jack is on the right side, but if you use a halfway decent set of headphones the chord attachment is most likely on the left ear. This means the chord goes across your keyboard. It's really annoying. Not creative pro friendly. Secondly, the machine is beautiful, but the edges are super sharp and show wear fast. I had mine for a month and used it for normal business purposes, and it looked way more beat up than it was. 

3. Spinning Wheel - I got a ton of these, even when I was up to date on all the software updates. Completely unacceptable. 

4. Audio bug - this is rare, but it happened on mine. I would be mid Skype call, song, or video, and the audio would shut off. Headphones, Bluetooth, or built in speakers - nothing. I'd have to restart and it would work again. 

5. Dongle drama. I actually don't mind the dongle thing, but make sure everything works. I have a sweet ASUS external monitor with an OEM display port to lightning chord that worked on my previous MBP. Got a lightning to usbc dongle, and didn't work. I ended up having to get a multiport and run it through an HDMI. Worked but not ideal. 

6. Trackpad too big. This is a personal thing, but I got a ton of palm rejection, and the trackpad was just too big. When I first saw it, I was really excited about it. By the time I returned it the size of the trackpad was annoying.  ",1483228947

My 84 GTI had a straight up full analog differential and would spin the left wheel like mad, do wheel hop under full acceleration, and would turn harder to the right because the left front wheel had more power.  The right driveshaft on a MK1 VW is almost twice the length of the left!  In theory it would have been easy to correct by having equal length driveshafts and a centered transaxle (like Subaru) but in an economy car with an offset transaxle like the Rabbit/Golf that wasn't going to happen.  This wouldn't have fixed the understeer but would have gotten rid of the squirelliness of the platform.

1.5:  Crack the bottom (where the air pocket is) against something hard, remove that bit of the shell.  Put the egg back in the container of cold water and let sit for a little bit, then start removing the rest of the shell.  Make sure you are peeling the little skin under the shell away, as leaving that results in a messy peeling job.  I usually hold the egg in my right hand and use my left thumb to slip between the egg and the skin under the shell.  Dunk the egg under water if you're having difficulties removing the shell.

Anyway, the fact that Donald Trump won the election really is a big problem that demands explanation. He's the most obviously incompetent lunatic to run in modern history. This is not just ""the wrong person"" like a normal election, this is one of the single most-wrong people conceivable for the presidency. I don't think it would have been possible for Donald Trump to win back in the 80s or 90s, which suggests something is up.

I think the fake news thing is maybe a contributing factor, or maybe not, but in any case we should be allowed to discuss it.

&gt;People who almost always immediately propose censorship....

I haven't seen anyone proposing censorship in any meaningful sense, other than perhaps Scott Alexander banning discussion of fake news. I mostly just see paranoid conservatives accusing everyone of censorship. Why can't we have a calm discussion? Why do you refuse to even consider whether fake news is a real problem?",1483228954

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Overwatch is great because of an effort by a lot of streamers, players and gaming companies to make content. And driven by an active reddit community.

The announcement at Blizzcon about the new league format was not well-received.

If you follow the scene, the teams don't want the maps they are being forced to play (by Blizzard). Basically most things relating to Blizzards contribution to the OW scene have been not positive. Balance suggestions aside. I will give them credit that they have been somewhat decent with Tigol Bitties at the helm. But he's from the beginning of the Wow days, before the Activision merger, and I think he has a genuine interest in making the game *good* and not just *profitable*.

They drove SC2 completely into the ground when it had a chance to be huge.

HotS is a joke in the community and Blizzard cannot make up it's mind whether it wants it to be a fun, easy, casual game or a competitive one. The result is most of the top teams have abandoned the game.

The Hearthstone team is notoriously slow to address any sort of balance problems in the game and has hardly cultivated the pro scene. Tournaments like Batstone, any of the 10 different formats that Amaz puts on, and other *community-driven* events are keeping the game afloat at a ""sport"" level.

Blizzard is actually negatively contributing to their own e-sports scene by my calculations here.

Simple things, like if the player wants to be the son of a noble, then your going to have to know how those the 'nobles' interact with eachother; is it a hereditary title or is it based on merit?  Does your world tend towards peace or violence, and if so why?  What place do magical creatures have in your world; are they dominate or are they in decline?  What is info that you think your players need to know before they start rolling dice (are some races shunned?  Are some locations more dangerous than others?  What makes this place a good place for adventurers to find themselves in?) and what are some things that you don't want the players to know; or rather what would you like them to discover?",1483228958

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","JK Rowling made a very nice Christmas tweet that really helped me.  In part it reads:
""I’ve also heard from people who are going through very tough times. These always seem worse at Christmas.  At this time of year, we’re bombarded with images of perfect lives, which bear as little relation to reality as tinsel does to gold.  If you’re lucky enough to be with the people you love, warm and safe, with enough to eat, I’m sure you feel as blessed as I do.  But if your life is currently full of difficulties; if you aren’t where you want to be, either literally or figuratively, remember that extraordinary transformations are possible. Everything changes. Nothing is forever.  Thinking back to my worst Christmas, I found it hard to believe that my unhappiness would pass. I was truly afraid of the future.  You never know what the future holds. Astonishing reversals of fortune happen every minute.  So if you’re sad, or lonely, or bereaved, or ill, separated from your loved ones or in any other way suffering this Christmas, I send you love and wish you luck and better times. Millions of us have been where you are now.  Remember, Christmas Day is, in the end, just a day. It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself.""

That last one is really the heart of it all.  To reiterate to today, New Years Eve is, in the end, just a day. It isn’t a test or a scorecard of you or your life, so be kind to yourself.

I spent many many years doing nothing, making false promises, and seeing nothing come of them.  Even today it's really easy to get stuck in a mire of ""I'm still overweight, I don't have a girlfriend, this year was wasted"" but it's very hard to pause and go ""I started gaming with friends every week, I started some D&amp;D with reddit strangers that goes every week, I took 3 trips for myself, I spent a lot of money just on myself to make me happy"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; But if someone has a minimum wage job and no kids, they are definitely not poor. 

I hate to break it to you, but 7.25/hr (Federal minimum wage) is barely livable even for a single person. And there are other factors at work - the companies that offer these wages don't usually provide enough even up to 30 hours a week, and they dictate the schedule as it suits them. That makes it extremely difficult for someone who is on minimum wage to get another job. 

Yes, there will be the good manager here and there who will work with his employees and turn a blind eye to employees who have a second job at a competitor (a good number of companies terminate employment of those caught doing so) but unfortunately department and grocery stores aren't in the business of attracting such good people.

Even if someone earning 7.25/hr works 40 hours a week, that's about 1,160 a month before taxes. Rent around here is 800 for a single bedroom, anywhere from 600-800 if you split a two bedroom apartment or house with roommates. Assuming the best case scenario, $600 rent, $100 in utilities, $60-80 in food per month, that leaves only a few hundred dollars for student loans and healthcare. And that is assuming, best case scenario, where they do not own a car or have any credit card debt to pay off. This is a ""best case"" scenario that is becoming very rare, as rent prices rise and public transportation is stagnant or cut. And if someone doesn't have a car, that 40 hours a week includes 6- 8 hours a week traveling to and from the job. It's not impossible for someone to work more than 40 across multiple jobs, but it's getting harder.

It took me years to get out of minimum wage, even with my parent's help - it is *not* easy, even when you submit a hundred resumes and have a dozen interviews. In the end, I signed up with a hiring agency, and they found me the job. And it turns out, that how a lot of companies staff their call centers and such, the days of news paper and internet job postings is pretty much over for general labor.",1483228960

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I've heard that pepperoni production is actually the cornerstone to the modern corporate state, wherein spicy and long-lived meat products tend to disproportionately end up in the hands of the stake holders and our corporate meatpacking overlords..

Some say that the way forward is to impose a progressive pork product tax that redistributes such comestibles, including salami and some sausages, in such a way that the ""bologna elite"" are forced to contribute delicious and savory meats to those who have less. In fact, due to automation of pepperoni production, there's talk of a Universal Basic Sopressata allowance, to ensure that those who are displaced due to the concentration of pepperoni among the top 1% of meat eaters can also enjoy ""the fruit of the pig.""

I think it's appropriate to ask not ""What can we do for pepperoni manufacture, but what can pepperoni manufacture do for us.""

I know there's a lot of talk about feeding recycled and predigested pepperoni to the poor, but given it's change in color, odor and nutritional properties there are many of us who feel that this should only be distributed to politicians and vegans.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Batman's the second worst super-hero ever made (the first, of course, being superman). Anything he's done for the comics industry has been largely to it's detriment, in that his archetypal form is so over-used and over-explored that it's drowned out unique stories.  

Hell, if someone invented batman without him already being known, they'd call him a really bad Marty Stu. He has no weaknesses, he has no disadvantages (a ""fear"" that never seems to come into play, an obsession that helps him, and his friends don't seem to care about his personality problems), and he's peak-everything: a brilliant inventor, a perfect detective, a flawless martial arts fighter, he's rich as god, he is incredibly handsome, the list goes on and on. 

Everyone can point out ""good"" batman stories, like the Killing Joke. But that's a case of talented writers taking up an existing property and working around it's faults, rather than any inherent gift the character has for being the center of good stories. 

In some alternate universe, there's no batman and no superman, and we have a much richer comic's industry today because of it. ",1483228960

Friend, if you havent, give it all to Jesus, and let it all go. Don't feel shame over anything thats in the past, you live and you learn. No matter what you do, you can never go back, but you can move forward. To be 'forgiven', means 'forgotten'. Its as if you've never sinned before and are completely innocent in His eyes. Stop playing back your sins, don't bring them back up to yourself or Him after asking forgiveness. Accept His forgiveness and don't look back. Be glad for a new day, each day is a start over day, a clean slate day. Its a new day, with new compassion from the God of new beginnings. If you can be innocent in Gods eyes, who elses opinion matters? You are human, humans make mistakes. But you are innocent, free from your past. You are a redeemed child of God that has every day moving forward from here to live for God, free of your past, to do so much good. To show light to a dark world. To do better. Each and every day can be used to better your life and the lives of those around you through the power of Jesus our Lord. Its not how many times you fall that matters, its how many times you get back up for God that does. Being forgiven, it is as easy as that. Its definitley the easy part of the equation, realizing we make mistakes but our God does not, and it is by His grace alone we are saved. Moving forward and attempting not to make the same ones, that can be the tricky part. But through God all is possible, stay strong, friend.

Joining the Five Nights at Freddy's subreddit was one of the best parts of my year.

I felt bad drawing it too -- since I hadn't drawn much fanart before it, they were suddenly taking over my page and I was worried about what people would think about it.

But man, the sub has been great. I've been making a lot of friends, developing my art style, and I genuinely feel part of a community which is a feeling I love and haven't had since 2010. So... yeah. The FNAF artwork in there means a lot to me, and I just wanted to share that here.

It addresses how evolution works by showing what evolutionary theory predicts and what evidence we find when we go out and look for it. It doesn't however try to neccesarily debunk creationist claims. Edit: this deals with whale evolution, which is interesting because of how many different scientific disciplines are needed to fully understand the evolution of whales. Whales also have LOTS of fossils and vistegial organs which means lots of evidence for past evolution have been left behind.

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","A little while ago I started a medically supervised diet to help me shed the rest of my excess weight, since I have issues with sabotaging myself by being overzealous with calorie restrictions in the short term. They took a ton of measurements, and most of those weren't much of a surprise... except for one. They measured my resting metabolism using this machine that had a hose I had to breathe into for ten minutes with my nose clamped, and it clocked my resting metabolic rate at a whopping ***3765 kcals/day.***

On the one hand, it was kind of embarrassing thinking to myself that I have that kind of metabolism and still managed to get fat. On the other hand, it's kind of nice because HOLY SHIT LOOK HOW MUCH FOOD I CAN STILL EAT WHILE LOSING WEIGHT. But most of all, it's a reminder that healthy food choices matter. I don't even feel like I actually am depriving myself (...that much), if anything I feel like I'm eating MORE since there's so much greenery on my plates, but eating healthier foods more frequently throughout the day makes such a huge difference. And cheating on the diet has the very quick result of actually making me feel worse--within hours I feel grumpier, upset with myself, and not even satiated. The post-shitty food crash actually feels way worse than normal hunger. It's great for helping me rewire the way I think about food and ""indulging.""

Cities the lie along the hypotenuse of this triangle will be separated by a distance north-south and east-west but still have the same sunset time.

"truezelda","t5_2tfzp","I agree about the correlation between OoT and TP, and WW and MM. However I wouldn't say that WW and MM are similar due to padding at all but for another reason. OoT and TP are more about the main adventure. That means doing main story quests and then going to the next dungeoun. The main game is longer and there are more dungeons, but once that is over you are basically done. The exploration is basically non-existent and the side quest are few and are generally pretty bland.



Now we have WW and MM who have shorter main games, but then make up for it by having a lot depth to the world. These games have more places to explore and a whole lot more content to find and do outside the main story. I actually spent more time getting 100% in MM and WW then I did in OoT and TP. 



That's one of the reasons why there are such varying opinions on which of these games are the best. Some liked the main story and dungeon aspect while others prefer havjling a more organic and content-filled world to explore. I like all aspects of the series but prefer the later, and that's why MM and WW are my two favorites.

The athletes are all individually great. None of that's in dispute. But where's the emotion? They're all reined in, playing in Saban's system. Executing a tactically sound strategy and doing what's asked of them. It's a really efficient, well-oiled machine in which the cogs themselves are almost inconsequential, because if one breaks there's another piece waiting in the wings that can execute just about as well. To watch Bama is to watch ""Bama,"" not a particular team; not particular players.

To be a total homer about it, contrast Bama's current reign to Miami's glory days. Those Hurricanes teams were having fun. They talked trash, danced, made the sport fun to watch. Each team had a flavor about it because each team had a superstar, had a personality. It was fun to hate them, sure, and their braggadocio made it easier to hate them, but at the end of the day they were putting on a show that anybody would appreciate. These Bama teams are the antonym of that, in terms of spirit and in terms of individuality.",1483228969

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","Traffic from SCV to Burbank area would be quite heavy, the commute for your SO would be about 45 mins to an hour each way. 

I'd recommend looking for housing in Burbank, Glendale, and the nicer parts of NOHO. You would basically have an open freeway for the commute into Santa Clarita, driving into Valencia would probably be about a 20-25 min drive.

Living in Santa Clarita doesn't really offer much to young couples. More of a family area, you'll have better entertainment options in the Valley. I grew up in the SCV and lived there until early this year (I'm 23) anything worth doing required a drive into the Valley or Hollywood area. 


I haven't see many recommendations for Northern parts of the Valley (San Fernando/Mission Hills/Sylmar/Granada Hills). This areas puts you in a midway point between SCV and Burbank. This part of the Valley has been increasingly gentrified recently. New buildings being built, lots of new retailers/restaurants coming to the area and pretty close to everything.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have retractable genitalia.

During intense exertion or extreme situations, and to a lesser degree during very cold weather, my testicles and penis completely withdraw into my body. As in I have to work my dick back out of myself to take a piss. 

Small dick jokes are inevitable, but the fact is that it's a bit on the large side, and the skin does not retract: it folds in on itself like a slinky. And I'm uncircumcised. So if I'm walking in the woods on a frigid day and I have to piss I have to work the head of my dick out  through a hollow leathery pig's snout with one nostril. And it feels about like you'd imagine.

And when my balls get sucked up into my pelvis occasionally they don't lift quite straight and I have to massage the left one into position by rubbing on my pubic hairline so I don't get torsioned. It feels about like you'd imagine.

**EDIT**: While it is quite cold enough outside for me to walk around for a bit and then take a picture of my shriveled dick for your edification, this course of action does not commend itself somehow. **BUT** from the comfort of my chair, [here is a drawing of the situation.](http://imgur.com/a/nJy9B)

Abstaining in a relationship is definitely a breach of monogamy.  Celibacy does not count as monogamy.

I would argue that it's also a breach of fidelity, through similar logic.  If you're refusing your spouse, you're not being faithful to them.  Faithfulness is more than the lack of cheating.

&gt;Neither does it qualify as an action

Saying 'no' to sex is an action.  It's a choice made.

People with anxiety think that the impressions they make on others stick with them for an exaggerated duration. If you say something douche-chill educing (unless you really fuck up and become a viral video meme that everybody laughs at), it will linger for a minute and then people will forget about it, because people only think of themselves. I get the vibe from most people who suffer from anxiety that they don't care about themselves enough, so they fill that space with how others feel about them.

When you realize how little importance you really have to other people, it's a relief. For the most part, people only care about what you can do for them. If you really start caring about yourself, you won't have the obstacle of caring what anybody else thinks. You'll pull yourself together and then you'll be that person everybody looks up to.

"Astronomy","t5_2qhor","Photos are taken through filters which correspond to different wavelengths of light - in the case of consumer cameras, this is generally red, green, and blue, because this matches the way our eyes work - they filter light through red, green, and blue pigments, and your brain combines them into a color image. These images are combined to form a color image. In a consumer camera, this is done either on camera or in RAW development.

In a scientific camera, it's a little more complicated. Because only one filter can be used at a time, different colors of light are taken in different images. These images are combined to make a final, color, image. If the filters used were a RGB set, this produces an image that is roughly what the human eye would see, if it were sensitive enough to do so - though cameras lack the big drop in sensitivity our eyes have toward the longer end of the spectrum, so they see reds more vivid than we do, without correction.

It gets more complex still when you have other filters - Hubble has over 50 filters to choose from. These include narrowband filters that only pass very specific wavelengths given off by specific gasses, and IR and UV filters that pass light our eyes can't even see. It is impossible to represent colors we can't see in an image, so these are converted to colors we can see in the final image.

So the answer is that yes, colors in the image come from real hard data, and not artists interpretation. But cameras can see more color than we can, so sometimes images aren't quite the same as what you would see.",1483228975

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My first day on rotation at a children's hospital when I was in r.n. scbool.... there was this 5 year old kid whose mom had essentially just left him in a swing his whole life. He never developed his hip joints right and had no patellas because he never even learned to crawl. His mom was there with him all the time but she was useless, and her laziness was why the kid was where he was at.  

So she was supposed to be doing some  therapy and administering his meds and bathing him on her own. Part of this kids overall treatment was mom doing this stuff. I suspected she was just checking off the boxes on the daily chart without doing them. I flat out caught her dumping his meds down the sink instead of giving them to her kid. I pretty much lit her up and went off on her right there in front of her kid. I knew it was a bad idea but I couldn't stop. She stomped out to complain to whoever while I composed myself. I went to the nurses station and asked the director if I was done, she said, oh ya, we all suspected it though. She said it would be better if i quit, but that she would kick me off campus and out of school if I didnt. So I quit the nursing program right then.",1483228976

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I am loathe to judge anyone for their passion - and people of any age love video games - but it's difficult to see how this tradition survives any incremental amount of maturity in the near future.

This is first year in college and first time back home so I can see the appeal in continuing a beloved (if rather strange) high-school tradition among old friends. This year especially must mean a lot since it's their first time away. 

However, I guarantee that it won't happen next year, especially since they are all at different colleges.  People mature at different rates but the first one to let go of this will throw a wrench into the whole thing.  

Heck, who knows if one of them already realizes that it's time to move on but silently went along this year anyway.

I do think they will look back on this tradition with fondness (at least for the high school years). ",1483228976

**Stewie** 4+: ""Gay jokes are funny"" the character. Often has no unique personality outside of ""Gay lol"" and just hangs out with Brian as they speak casually to drive the narrative. Occasionally brings back his intelligence for specific plots, such as time machine etc.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Many years ago, I worked for a local Walmart. One day, during my lunch break, a coworker and I had just stepped outside to walk across the street for lunch and a customer doing ~40+ MPH nearly ran the both of us over in the crosswalk directly in front of the grocery-side doors. Naturally, I had a strong reaction and flipped a half-bird only to get fired the next day as a result of that customer being brazen enough to file a complaint.

Camera footage of our near-paraplegia evidently wasn't relevant. My coworker coming to my defense wasn't enough either. I suppose the customer's ability to drive recklessly through the parking lot was more important than an employee's legs that allow them to do their job. To be fair, it was probably more to do with that being Walmart's first outlet to terminate me for not wanting to retain my recently-received, non-optional manager's position without appropriate compensation.

Most of the times I also have gold in healing since I focus on using my orb properly, still my damage output is significant. I main support and so far Zen is my favourite character, becouse of the damage output in comparison to other supports is just outstanding yet you have a good healing output with an amazing ultimate. I'd say the most important about Zen is the positioning and knowing when to use your ultimate. 

Just btw, my personal statistic - I main Lucio and I'd say I'm quite good at him, I have 35% win rate with him, while having 75% win with Zen. My healing output is slightly lower with Zen but my damage output is significantly higher.

* This ""evaluation stage"" looks like it's a mass replacement of the higher ranks under the guise of fairness. It is all completely up to the GSL's personal thoughts and opinions. Nowhere in it does it details what exactly will be evaluated, only the who. 

&gt; I will be working on faction relations to repair broken bridges and make negotiations to better the future of Nova Balreska

* What broken bridges? As far as I'm concerned Nova Balreska is in a stable state right now in terms of diplomacy. Rather it looks like you are trying to reverse everything that Nova Balreska had worked on getting by being willing to grant Hallengard their independence in exchange for an unreliable alliance. Instead it looks like you are showing great leniency towards your homeland and trying to help Hallengard in contrast to what is best for Nova Balreska. Why would the voters want such a person as their leader?

&gt; To Whitecrest, I extend an offer that, unless we end up on opposite sides, you will be consulted before enlisting the help of certain mercenaries in roleplay-based events. It is also your choice whether you wish to terminate current agreements held with Nova Balreska.

* Isn't this pretty much saying you will listen to anything and everything Whitecrest tells you? It seems you want Nova Balreska to hold a position of inferiority towards the Kingdom of Whitecrest despite the reality being that we are equals, if not somewhat superior.

&gt; To both, I offer potential joint-operations if you wish to participate, and any party may back out of joint-operations if they feel it's not working out.

* Breaking news: We already have joint-ops with both Whitecrest and Hallengard. You are essentially offering what we already have. Might you also give us the right of breathing and eating while you're at it?


One final point I'd like to make. Just why should Nova Balreska consider voting for you when, in the past you had chosen to drop out of two formal elections? On top of that you have never been a part of Nova Balreska until only recently when the election popped up. To me, this looks like another one of your attempts to ruin another faction by dropping out.",1483228981

I think they could've benefited from putting a scroll menu during battle for techs, magic flasks and weapons.

I was def salty about ng+.  Pretty much no incentive to do it for me personally, as like you said the game is too easy as it is.

Very nice post, it's a solid 9/10 for me too and I'm excited to see how they tweak it and how the dlc turns out.  Also Happy New Year :D",1483228985

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","I understand your take on this, especially since the top RBs right now on Bell/DJ comp fairly similarly to Cook (at least in style, not size).  But for me it's the opposite, I'm pretty sure Cook at the very least will be decent and probably more.  It's hard to predict something like Bell/DJ though.

Fournette has a size/speed combo that is just absolutely disgusting and yeah he might end up just running power for 4 yard gains, but if he gets himself on a team with a quality zone scheme he is going to be hitting holes with more power and speed than Zeke is now.  He is a TD threat every play and when he gets a reach block on the IlB and it's just him vs a DB or 2 in the open field, I'd like my odds with fournette.  That to me is probably the game breaker between the 2.  But sure if Cook ends up with an outstanding offensive situation and individually is an A level NFL back, he could be right up there with the best.

If I had to bet, I think we're going to see just how bad playing on the LSU offense held him back.  He is a freak, and no disrespect to Cook or Chubb for that matter who is right there too.  Fournette can do things prime AP was doing.",1483228988

"VEDC","t5_2x2h6","TLDR: Reading things things at night when you don't want your pupils to react to the light.

Go into your bathroom, close the door, and don't turn on any lights.

Your pupils will eventually adjust to the lower light level and allow you to see more detailed outlines of objects.  If you were to turn on the light for five seconds and then turn it off, you'll essentially loose that ability until your eyes adjust again.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;It’s worth noting that some have doubted whether probing intuitions, like Pritchard does, is useful. Nagel thinks it is: “Epistemic intuition is not infallible,” she wrote in a 2013 paper, published in Current Controversies in Experimental Philosophy, “but at present it looks reliable enough to continuing serving its traditional function of supplying us with valuable evidence about the nature of knowledge.”

This is something I've never understood about the enterprise of philosophy. My background is in linguistics, and the goal of theoretical linguistics is to build a model of human language *as a system* that has the same output as a human being *using* language. Which means that the whole point is to make a model that *matches* human intuitions.

Because a language is a system that is used by humans, humans have an internal grammar that operates with some rules and produces some objects (sentences). *Language doesn't exist apart from human minds!* So, the question of whether intuitions are fallible is just bizarre. For us, they're right by definition, because they're the thing we're trying to model.

What is the goal of philosophy? (Or, more narrowly, the type of philosophy people like Jennifer Nagel are doing). They're apparently *not* just trying to model/describe human behavior or the systems (categorization/perception/knowledge/belief/etc) that human minds generate the way a linguist or a psychologist would.

"ripcity","t5_2rt2i","Plumlee is 26 in his fourth season of continuous improvement.  The list of passing centers goes Al Horford with 4.9 assists a game, then Plumlee and Marc Gasol tied with 4.2 each.  After that the next highest is Brook Lopez with 2.8, so Plumlee is in the top tier of facilitating 5's, which clearly has value in a league that more and more often demands ball movement from every position.  

He's not an elite rebounder, but he's shown flashes that would convince many GMs that the ability and potential is there.  He has a .568 TS, and is fantastic in the Draymond Green role of facilitating a 4 on 3 if defenses attempt to trap the ballhandler out of the pick and roll.  He sets mean screens, and is a triple double threat on any given night.  He's one of the best centers in the NBA in both transition and the pick and roll, with both Dame and CJ.

Defensively, when playing in lineups with Aminu and Harkless last year and in spots this year we've seen Plumlee can actually be a part of a good defense, and while he obviously isn't a defensive anchor, he doesn't tank a defense alone.  The problem is that we have two poor defensive guards chasing guys around screens while Plumlee tries to drop back and has to contain both the roll man and the guard as both Dame and CJ get stuck on screens, which he isn't really equipped for.  He is a minus on defense, but a large enough plus on offense that teams will offer a contract with the expectation that he can improve as he has shown he has the ability to.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","There is no indication in the books that Snape ever applied for the job. It is always assumed that he wants the job, he always dislikes the teachers who are in the job, and he only goes into the job when he knows that he will be forced to leave within 12 months due to the curse on Dumbledore and their euthanasia pact. It is also stated through the books that Snape was obsessed with the dark arts which cost him his friendship with Lilly and in Harry's first potion lesson he expresses his love of potions which was a talent both he and Lilly shared. His desire for the post is always referred to as common knowledge but the origin of that knowledge is never disclosed which leads the the conclusion that he may or may not have wanted the job. It needs to be remembered that with luck Snape is the opposite of Harry. Everything Snape does is constantly misinterpreted or doesn't work out due to bad timing. You need to be careful when drawing conclusions about Snape for this reason. Especially when it is a ""common knowledge"" or ""everyone knows"". Who knows? Who did he tell? Or is the origin another misinterpretation of his actions? No idea if this is covered later on the pottermore site as I only know the books.",1483228992

The WWE World Title/Championship has never been higher than Rock vs Austin feuds. Lowest point has to be either Great Kahli as WHC champ, or Miz holding it to build Rock vs Cena. A shame, because Miz probably deserved better at the time, and on reflection now, should get better run with it. 

The IC titles lowest point was when they just got fucking rid of it for 6 months because Haitch. Highest point is possibly the Ultimate Warrior holding it with the World Title. Jeff Hardy did wonders for it at times too. 


Tag titles is tough to say. High points were in the 80's and early 90's. They had some great tag teams then. In recent history the Edge &amp; Christian, Hardy's and Dudleys feuds over the belts were insane. Low point is easily when the nexus had Otunga do a finger poke of doom. 

Women's low point; when it literally was held by Moohlah for decades and barely defended. It's never been better than right now. ",1483228993

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;  I disagree with your point that Shirayuki doesn't belong in the castle, though. 

In my short review, I think this point wasn't express out well due to the brevity of it. It's not like I thought Shirayuki didn't belong in the castle, but in that that's what the show was trying to show us because she was an outsider. I felt that she did fit in but the show went out of its way a lot to show it like [Shirayuki Spoils](/s ""Izana and how she is just pretty much connected to Zen and no one else."")

&gt; I guess what I found compelling about them is that they are a breath of fresh air in a genre that I feel is horribly stale. Shirayuki is shown on multiple occasions to be very strong, determined, and independent which is rare in the shoujo genre.

I don't disagree with this point. Shirayuki was a strong woman who didn't need no man [Shirayuki spoils](/s ""except when she was about to shown off like a prized possession in episodes 2 or 3.""). But after one or two episodes, we pretty much know who she is and the kind of person she is. As far as I've gotten there haven't really been any strong moments apart from episode 2 where this gets challenged.

&gt; Zen, he was a strong somewhat badass character who wasn't shown to be needy of Shirayuki's love and he was able to achieve things all on his own and make a lot of important things by himself. These things are also rare in the genre. 

I did like how they weren't dependent on one another like every other shoujo love anime but like I've said with Shirayuki, I felt that all is said and done about their characters after a few episodes. Nothing will ever likely change apart from the fact the fact their relationship will develop further.

&gt; Obi was interesting and a complete bro to both Zen and Shirayuki. The others had some funny interactions and I felt there was a good sense of how well they knew each other and the way they could play off each other was fun. I enjoyed the snide comments and the pep talks they gave each other.

I actually loved the interactions with all the side characters because I felt that it was the only thing that was fresh outside the episodic episodes which just focused on say ""This is who Shirayuki is. A nice and helpful person.""

&gt; While they all served to make the characters better imo, a lot of them just didn't have that interesting of a narrative. World-building, something I usually love in medieval settings, wasn't super impressive but that might be because I was expecting fantasy elements and never got any. It seems like an interesting world, but we're mostly only shown the castle and are only sometimes shown things outside it.

Yeah unlike similar sorts of medieval type of shows, it just doesn't really explore what makes the setting so novel. We get neighboring politics here and there with occasional travels which is pretty much the scope of what the creator sets out to show the world. In the end, they are ancillary in eyes of the creator since it's just pretty much a show that's just based around our two leads. I find this disappointing since in most shows, the side characters really help to bring out fun and great character moments since it's not just relegated to two characters who barely throw shade at each other.

&gt; The last thing that bothered me was how hard they pushed the 'choose your own path in life' thing. They did not have to state it that many god damn times haha.

This was pretty much the crux of every Shirayuki-centred episode hahaha.

&gt; I do plan on watching season 2 but since I watched the blu-ray version of season 1, season 2 blu-rays aren't out, and I refuse to downgrade in quality I'll have to pass on watching season 2 with you for now. Hope that's understandable.

Not a problem man. Feel free to hit me up once you do get them because I'm still willing. ",1483228995
"tf2trade","t5_2s0s4","Your post has been automatically removed by this bot because your title is incorrect.

**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted

The full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers"" is inappropriate. However, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos"" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).
5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.
6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).

**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it.

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","Still, someone can own the thing that people know is pretty good (be it your own name), and consequently something else will not be purchased, even though it's an equivalent or superior quality product or service under a different name.

The rivalry is in the purchasing choices, when it comes to brand names, and it's not derived from individual effort that went into creating the brand, but being there to create a brand when it's opportune and easy to make it well known. It doesn't actually need some extra legal protection to be potentially unearned in those components, as long as an opportunity (not even a right) to recognition exists.

But yeah it's a difference. Still, the societally created value that goes into recognizing something as good enough to buy a (branded) product with little or no second thought (edit: or for reasons that subjectively or objectively seem hard to find in other products, be it the presence of a specific userbase or the very recognition of a product by others, as a value itself.), is extremely relevant today, as unearned component in the value you may extract via sales, a soft monopoly so to say. Be it the good name you made for yourself if you're somewhat famous. Via direct and indirect marketing methods and opportune/lucky timing and existing sales channels that you might have access to for some reason (even if it cost you a lot of rights to a lot of what you do, for a period of time).

As for outright abolishing idea ownership, I think we can take steps in that direction via the introduction of fees on publicly traded companies and higher commerce tax for private companies, or similar. And go from there. Just seems a little tricky to abolish large sectors of the economy as they exist today, where society can arguably benefit from temporary idea ownership, think Research and Development. And where some trust goes into product names. Abolishing named products means effort for customers, that might not be needed, if we just put fees on well enough regarded undertakings. But yeah, we should look to make it a three way dialogue between researchers/artists, rightholders/owners/etc, and customers, not the one sided thing where rightholders have a real big influence on policy.

I'm not actually sure how we'd go about abolishing the naming of products by the way. I mean content curators could become the go-to instance to figure out what's worth buying. But big brands kinda do that already. I think to fully abolish this soft monopoly, we'd have to more or less abolish the concept of customers being able to tell what they're buying in favor of some randomized process where some quality control ensures that everyone gets something good enough, compared to what they expect (but how do you do this with products like google search and its advertisement space, facebook communication with your friends, playing league of legends with the large playerbase and quality ranked experience. You need *someone* to co-ordinate the unified userbase (and we can *not* predict behind what a userbase will stand, what the new next best thing might be in some cases for some userbases) for a mutual benefit. But we can always look at part of those undertakings as societally owned.). I'd rather go with some valuation/feeing approach too, even if it's not straightforward. As much as reduction of excessive rightholder rights is a thing as well.

Simply exclusively controlling a website url is a problem if abolishing of idea ownership, de-facto owning of partially unearned mental infrastructure in customer heads, is the idea. So is having a unique face and voice and head on your shoulders that creates consistent enough ideas that appeal to people who give you money for that and are happy enough to repeat that cycle even though there's maybe millions of similarly minded people.

edit: [I guess this is a good read in the context, too](https://alexdanco.com/2015/12/17/taylor-swift-ios-and-the-access-economy-why-the-normal-distribution-is-vanishing/). I found it to make quite some sense, personally!

edit: also to be considered is that not all brand value can or should be liquidated to pay value based fees, by tomorrow, thinking amazon. Revenue taxes might just be a thing to focus on for a while till we figure something out there. And maybe offer lower tax rates to publicly traded companies where the shares are owned to significant portion by the state; that might bypass the issue of having to liquidate/sell off parts of the company if it's not very profitable despite extremely high revenue like amazon (a company that fits that description usually just passes all the value to customers or investments to go towards a future improvement to the process, and that's okay.). Anyway, not a simple story, but worthwhile to consider from many angles, I think.",1483228997

This is a bit of a weird one. I currently have a number of headphones I use for serious listening. Mainly I use my Audeze LCD-2s and shure se-535s and love both. I also have the B&amp;W p5s I use for basic listening, podcasts, YouTube, etc. 
I am looking for a basic iem/earbud for similar uses, out for a walk, podcasts, etc. 
I will only use them directly out of my iPhone/iPad. These I won't use with my Dac/amp at all. But I want a pair that sounds decent, but more important is really comfortable. and being durable is important, as I want a pair I don't have to care about. 
Again, these will be more for podcasts/videos etc, not serious music listening. 
Regarding budget, since I will beat on these pretty bad (I have broken 3 sets of basic apple earbuds over the last few months) I would hope to find some under $50, preferably under $30, but open to suggestions.

You may be surprised to believe that the vast majority of people don't resort to violence when displeased. They have empathy for the other person and don't want to cause physical damage to them if they haven't caused physical damage to anyone else.

A sociopath disregards empathy and runs around harming people. They don't know any better as they don't adequately understand empathy.

I do understand how such play could be ""interesting"" in a sense, but ultimately since it's entirely based on the notion of not ""unnecessarily"" increasing war weight, you are inherently admitting to manipulating the game in a way that maximizes your chances of winning by means other than skill, i.e. Fighting a match up you know you have the offensive advantage in.

The ultimate proof of this is that if all players did the same and you fought a war with all players in this configuration, the result would be stalemate after stalemate, i.e. this tactic of yours is only valid if other people play as intended.

So while I'm not going to necessarily question your motives I think it is demonstrably the case that you are complaining about being criticized for doing something most people consider unethical because, frankly, it is, in a sense, unethical, relying on the ignorance of others as it does.

Perhaps it is better just to say you don't care if what you're doing is taking advantage of the system in a way most people consider unethical. ",1483229007

Not quite bodybuilder level muscle, but looks like you could break a baseball bat on him and he'd chase you down and mess you up bad. With that said, one of the kindest, funniest folks I ever had the pleasure of working with, and his Dad had been stationed in Okinawa during Melvin's youth, and Melvin had picked up skills making authentic Japanese food.

Melvin hadn't been working at the store long, but he was very quickly one of our best. Busy weekend morning, he wants to eat before we get really swamped. Starts making a meal that would feed a normal guy for a couple days. Manager makes a funny comment about the amount of food, and I chime in ""He better eat good, he's a growing boy!""  I thought it was hilarious because the dude was a giant compared to me. Look at him expecting a laugh or smile or annoyance at my terrible joke, and he's looking at me like he's about to tear me apart. Calmly makes it very clear that he'd appreciate me not using that language or any similar towards him ever again, and goes and eats his food. 

I'm completely confused. One of the other cooks, who's older and heard the exchange, waves me over and proceeds to explain that back in the day, it was common to call black men ""boy"" and treat them like they were still slaves. 

We made it through that shift, and the next time I got the opportunity to chat with him, I explained that I didn't know it was a racial slur and would have never knowingly insulted him like that. He pretty much says he knows, and if he didn't, he would have at least gotten fired that day, if not arrested. It just causes certain feelings whether intentional or not. 

From that day on, me and Melvin were cool. He even cooked us a Japanese dinner one night on a slow shift. Last I heard, he had gotten a sweet job as an aircraft mechanic in a big city nearby. ",1483229009

"galaxys4","t5_2u4bh","# Question Answers:

**1\.** What is the process for flashing a new ROM?

This will be shown in my instructions below.

**2\.** What's the best way to back up my apps and data before the flash?

The best way would be to make a backup through TWRP. This would backup the whole partition however it would only be able to be restored on the same ROM you were on when you made the backup. If you want to make a backup of apps and data that you can restore anywhere, you would want to use [Titanium Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup). However this app requires root so if you want to use it ask me for rooting instructions. However I suggest just starting fresh on CyanogenMod and just use the data that Google automatically backs up for you (contacts and stuff like that).

**3\.** Is it required to root the phone? If so, how do I do that?

No it is not, however if you would like to do so for Titanium Backup just ask me and I can give you rooting instructions.

**4\.** I've read that I need to first flash a ""recovery image"" like TWRP. What's that about and how do I do that?

A recovery is a mini-OS that lives in another partiton on your device. It can perform basic functions such as installing, wiping, backing up, etc. Your device comes with a stock recovery that is used for updating and factory resetting, however this is programmed to only install things signed by the vendor. So you would need to flash a custom recovery like Team Win Recovery Project, TWRP for short, to be able to flash custom things. TWRP is one of the more full featured recoveries so it is preferred. How to install it is in my instructions below.

**5\.** Do I then use the backup I made to put my apps and data back on the device?

Depends on how you backup. If you made a TWRP backup then you would have to start fresh and the only data you would have kept is the data linked to your Google account. If you used Titanium Backup you should be able to restore your apps and their data seamlessly. However as said before I suggest just starting fresh.

**6\.** How long, roughly, should the entire process take?

The manual work would take at max 15 minutes top as long as there are no hiccups. The automatic stuff can take up to 20 or 30 minutes in total depending on your device, however it is usually shorter than that. So manual work and automatic work combined I would say it would take around 20 to 30 minutes if you just do a standard clean install (without backups).

**7\.** Are there any ""gotchas"" that I should watch out for?

Everything is usually straight forward and I'm here to help if you need. However keep in mind that this will most likely void any warranty you have and that we aren't responsible for what you do to your device. Also keep in mind that there is always a possibility that you would loose your data.

**8\.** If the process fails, how easy is it to ""back out"" of the update to try again with a different loader or ROM, or to put the original stock 4.4.2 back on until I can try again? (I don't want to end up with a useless bricked phone.

Hard bricking a phone is *very* hard and is almost impossible unless trying to be done deliberately. If it fails to the point where you would want to go back to stock, you can simply reflash the stock ROM. You can just ask and I can give you instructions for it.

Automation is arriving and it's going to be coming in full force. Arguing for minimum wage only pushes the market to quicken their delivery of automation. 

Even if the entirety of the existing market becomes automated, there will still be methods to acquire profit as an individual. How exactly? We won't know. The market is continually moving. It's a really unsatisfying answer, but we can't predict future markets, especially with an element that's partially dominating only specific sectors of the market.

And not having the money or time off to travel probably affects lots of people around the world, but I don't think it's absurd to suggest it's a uniquely American problem, especially if we clarify that we're speaking in the context of first world, developed nations only, which maybe I should have done earlier.

[This article](http://www.theexpeditioner.com/2010/02/17/how-many-americans-have-a-passport-2/) brings up some important points about American travel habits. Just 46% of Americans overall have a passport and there appears to be a correlation with region (which means there is probably a correlation with income too). Americans only have two nearby options for traveling ""abroad"": Mexico or Canada. Other than that, you're paying for a flight to Europe, which for many Americans is cost-prohibitive.

But according to [this](http://www.sas.com/en_ca/customers/passport-canada-forecasts-demand-delivery-with-SAS.html) site, 57% of Canadians have a passport. I don't know how many of them are just traveling next door to visit us and how many are visiting Europe, but more than half their country is prepared to travel outside their borders, well more than Americans.

According to [this](https://lightwater.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/ok-so-how-many-uk-citizens-have-a-passport/) article, 74 percent of UK residents hold a UK passport. And according to [this](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/11/21/british-people-far-more-well-travelled-americans/), 50% of Americans report they have never traveled abroad, while only 8% of Brits report the same.

We could parse these numbers all day trying to determine what they mean, but I don't think it's *absurd* to suggest that not having the means to travel is a uniquely American problem. It's in the numbers that we apparently travel less than other countries.",1483229010

2. More dance! I wasn't able to dance as much this fall as I normally do and I felt it in my body and my mind (mood, focus). No more of that!

3. Eating smaller portions. I've realized that I make food choices that incorporate everything that I need, but I just eat too much (and honestly to the point where I feel sick and don't enjoy it). This has been a pretty positive mental change for me - coming to college was a huge shock because I'd never had so much food to choose from so I definitely ate like I was never going to eat again.

"GalaxyS7","t5_2wi0z","Knox isnt an app or anything it's an underlying security platform. It doesn't consume any resources in fact it does the opposite. It's the reason why your device can be fully encrypted without suffering any performance hit. It gives your device crazy security features as if it's something out of a Sci fi novel. Even the government uses it, and Google licensed a reduced implementation of it to use for Android for work as their professional security platform.  

In fact I suggest you use it. It's a hyper efficient hardware based encryption platform. There's a private mode which is great for storing sensitive data that you don't want to accidentally intermingle with the rest of your files or risk accidentally uploading to the cloud or something. You can even install a full on secondary Android system on another encryption layer. The beauty with the way it's designed is that both are running directly from the hardware so apps installed in both environments check out on the server side as being installed on their own separate devices. It uses encryption layer acrobatics to recycle anything that's in common between the encryption layers so that it only uses the resources of one instance while recycling everything between the separate environments. Only the differences between the two environments actually take up any resources, so running two completely fully functioning Android devices at the same time on the same device doesn't impact your performance at all, in fact it could increase your performance since you can install half the apps you use on your core environment and the rest on the Knox environment so each environment would only be half the weight. 

I have mine set up so that all my personal stuff and stuff I care about is secured in the Knox environment. I can disable my lockscreen pin and hand my phone off to someone for a week worry free since all my stuff is protected in the Knox layer which they wouldn't be able to access or modify.

I've been in retail for over a decade, been called an idiot, an asshole, told I had no idea how to do my job, etc...it's pretty easy for any person with a modicum of maturity to keep their emotions reigned in and not start cursing at the people who bring the money in the door. Not to mention that it's insulting to actual assault victims to call *almost* getting slapped with a notebook an ""assault""... 

Edit - another thing - the lady in question is probably never going to spend money at a burger king again after this incident, and it's a safe assumption that, after hearing this story, some of her friends and family will follow suit. Depending when this happened, if it gets onto social media, even more people could potentially stop spending money there. It isn't like fast food is an industry without fierce competition. From a business standpoint is it really worth keeping some shitstain like this employed? This lady wasn't treated like shit by that kid, she was treated like shit by Burger King. At least, that's how she'll see it...and that is all that matters.  ",1483229015

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","It's fine if you don't have all the specifications laid out. Just wanted to know before we start saying stuff and it doesn't meet your requirements later down the line.

The load cell you specified looks like a full bridge version so an instrumentation amplifier would be ideal. Since you want to use the full range of the load cell and the ADC using the power supply as a reference then we will need an amplification factor that results in the output of the load cell at full load to be near the supply voltage.

You are correct that using a 5v excitation voltage would result in 15mV at full load. To convert 15mV to 5v, you would need an amplification factor of ~333. There are a plethora of instrumentation amplifiers which can be used but I'll just pick an often used one such as the [INA333](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina333.pdf). It can work at 5v and gain is set using a single resistor. The gain equation is G=1+(100k/Rg) so using substitution we would need a ~300 ohm resistor. The output of the instrumentation amplifier can then be connected to the Arduino's ADC. Filtering, if noise is too much for your application, can be done in between with a simple RC filter or in software.

The resolution of your ADC is 5/1024=~4.9mV. Because there are variations in each component (offset in load cell and in-amp, gain resistor tolerance), you will need to calibrate the device in software with an offset before using it in your application if you need good accuracy.",1483229023

"galaxys4","t5_2u4bh","# Flashing Instructions

CyanogenMod offers flashing instructions [here (it is on Archive.org because the wiki is down)](https://web.archive.org/web/20161224205358/https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_jfltetmo). However these are vague. So I provide my own.

The following instructions are for Linux only. Please don't use a virtual machine as these can cause problems communicating with the device. There is an alternative method for Windows or macOS. Just tell me if you aren't on Linux, I can easily change the instructions.

First we need to download the tool that flashes to the devices different partitions. On most devices you use a tool called fastboot, but Samsung devices aren't like most devices (excluding the Galaxy Nexus). The tool for Windows is called Odin, it's Windows only and leaked from Samsung so you need to get it from a trusted source. Thanks to brilliant backwards engineering someone made something like it for other platforms (including Windows) called Heimdall. You can download the latest version (as of 12/31/2016) [here](https://bitbucket.org/benjamin_dobell/heimdall/downloads). Make sure to get the correct Heimdall version for your Linux install. You should be able to install it using the given deb or rpn files. Now we need to download the Android platform tools. These contain multiple tools (including fastboot as I mentioned earlier) but we are after ADB (Android Debug Bridge). It has multiple use cases and can be used in recovery or just in the normal system. You can download the latest version (as of 12/31/2016) of the platform tools for Linux [here](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r25.0.2-linux.zip). Extract the ""platform-tools_r25.0.2-linux.zip"" file and there should be a ""platform-tools"" folder. Treat this folder as your working directory and download all other files to this folder. Now we need to download Team Win Recovery Project, or TWRP as most people call it. TWRP is a custom recovery. A recovery is a mini-OS that is stored on another partition of the device that can do basic functions like flashing and wiping. TWRP is one of the more full featured recoveries as it has stuff like backup and restore built in. Devices do have stock recoveries but these are programmed to only flash files signed by the vendor, people don't often notice this but stock recovery is what the device uses when you run an OTA (Over-The-Air) update or a factory reset. You can get the latest version (as of 12/31/2016) of TWRP for your device [here](https://dl.twrp.me/jfltetmo/twrp-3.0.2-0-jfltetmo.img.html). Make sure to click ""Download twrp-3.0.2-0-jfltetmo.img"" to download the actual file. They also offer an md5 checksum, which you can use to check if the TWRP file is corrupt or not, but this isn't needed. Now to download CyanogenMod itself. Custom ROMs, along with a bunch of other things come in a flashable zip format that gets flashed using a custom recovery. CyanogenMod has 2 build types, snapshots and nightlies. Nightlies are more common and are built every night for each device, but these aren't checked for bugs and have limited support. I recommend these, just as long as the user backups regularly using TWRP. Snapshots are on a specific release schedule and gerrit branch, they have been bug tested but can still have bugs. I don't like these because they are often behind on features and security updates. You can get the latest nightly (as of 12/31/2016) for your device [here](https://download.cyanogenmod.org/get/jenkins/189267/cm-13.0-20161218-NIGHTLY-jfltetmo.zip). Or the latest snapshot (as of 12/31/2016) [here](https://download.cyanogenmod.org/get/jenkins/175169/cm-13.0-20160820-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO0J3-jfltetmo.zip). The last file we need is Gapps. Gapps (Google Apps) are basically all the Google branded apps like the Play Store and it's needed services. They come in multiple variants depending on how many Google Apps you want. I usually recommend either the stock package (installs Google Apps like it's on a Nexus) or the nano package which is smaller and installs just the needed apps. You can get the latest nano package (as of 12/31/2016) for your device [here](https://github.com/opengapps/arm/releases/download/20161230/open_gapps-arm-6.0-nano-20161230.zip). Or the latest stock package (as of 12/31/2016) [here](https://github.com/opengapps/arm/releases/download/20161230/open_gapps-arm-6.0-stock-20161230.zip).

Now to prepare the device to be flashed with TWRP. Go into settings and look for ""Developer Options"" or something along those lines. If it isn't there, go into ""About phone"" and tap ""Build number"" 7 times. Then go back up into settings. They should be there now. Enable ""Developer Options"" (if it has a toggle) then enable ""USB Debugging"". This allows us to use ADB on the stock ROM but it usually isn't needed (we enable it just in case). Also enable ""OEM Unlock"" if it's there, this would allow us to flash unsigned images to the device however not all builds have this setting so you may not need to enable it. Also go back into security settings and disable reactivation lock if you can. Because sometimes it can cause issues. Once you have these options set. Say goodbye to your stock ROM and just pull your battery.

Reinsert the battery and then hold the Volume Down, Home, and Power keys. This should put the device into download mode. Accept any warnings then plug the device in. Open a terminal to the ""platform-tools"" folder. Run the command `heimdall detect`. It should say something like `Device detected!` and give no libusb errors. If it doesn't detect the device or it throws a libusb error. First try another USB port or USB cable. Or try running the command with `sudo`. If none of these work then tell me. Now you can type `heimdall flash --RECOVERY twrp-3.0.2-0-jfltetmo.img --no-reboot` to flash TWRP. Once it says it successfully flashed. You can hold the Volume Up, Home, and Power keys. Keep holding the keys until you see the Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP) splash screen.

It's going to ask you if you want to modify the system, you can just allow it to do this by swiping the slider. It may also ask you anytime during the process if you want to root, don't let it do this as CyanogenMod has root built-in and TWRP's root method is likely outdated. If you want to make a TWRP backup do so now. Now click ""Wipe"" and swipe the slider to factory reset. This won't actually factory reset your device but it just clears the partition that user data is stored in, along with the caches. Once that finishes you can click the home button. Now click ""Advanced"" and click ""ADB Sideload"". Swipe the slider, you don't need to wait for it to start as it will start once it gets the command from your computer. In the terminal window run `adb devices`. After the message about starting the daemon you should see something like `&lt;SERIAL NUMBER&gt;    sideload`. If you don't then tell me. There are multiple methods to flash CyanogenMod with TWRP but this is my favorite as it doesn't leave the files on the device. Now just run `adb sideload cm-13.0-20161218-NIGHTLY-jfltetmo.zip` to flash it. Or `adb sideload cm-13.0-20160820-SNAPSHOT-ZNH5YAO0J3-jfltetmo.zip` if you are using a snapshot. The percentage is inaccurate so don't worry if it goes over 100%. TWRP will say once it finishes. Don't reboot yet though, we still need to flash Gapps. Click the home button and go back to the ADB Sideload menu. Swipe the slider and this time, run `adb sideload open_gapps-arm-6.0-nano-20161230.zip`. Or `adb sideload open_gapps-arm-6.0-stock-20161230.zip` if you are using the stock package. Once it finishes you can click the ""Reboot System"" button on the device. You should now see the CyanogenMod boot animation of its robot mascot named Cid. The first boot may take up to 15 minutes but you should soon be seeing the ""Android is upgrading..."" dialog. Then eventually the setup wizard where you can continue like you normally would. If it doesn't boot, tell me.

As you know, CyanogenMod is being replaced by LineageOS. If the time comes that your device gets LineageOS builds. You should simply need to update to it and it should work fine. Anyway, you could always ask me if you need help with it.

If you want to have root access, you can enable it in CyanogenMod's developer settings. If you have any questions or problems about the procedure, updating, or about CyanogenMod itself. Feel free to ask me. I'm happy to help.",1483229025

Edit: I would just like to say: even though I can handle fighting a huge horde, chopping at one from the side isn't an efficient way to deal with them. Most often you either want to use fire or use obstacles to split them up. Often I will take on hordes that are up to about 20 strong if I'm rested up. Lead them on a little to pull the fast ones up front and take them out first. Chop away at the rest.

Nothing held my interest, and that started to make me depressed. Can you imagine a depressed 5yr old? My parents initially took me to the doctor because of it. They hooked me up to monitors, and watched my brain functioning as I tried to read something silently. That's how I was diagnosed. 

ADHD isn't a child being too active, or daydreaming, or talking too much. It's a chemical imbalance just like every other mental issue, and it's the inability to hold focus on things. It's not a lack of discipline. Spanking a child will not fix the fact that no matter how hard they try, it is impossible for them to focus. It's not a bad kid, or a brat. It's a legitimate disorder. 

Now, I do agree that it is diagnosed to frivolously, and so does the medical board. There are now tighter restrictions on the diagnosis. They watch how many patients a doctor makes this diagnosis with. If they think it's too much, they start pulling files. You're also drug tested now once you hit a certain age.

If that's correct, that would be a huge turn-off for me. 

If, on the other hand, you just need to be able to install the app (even an archived copy of it, if the app/company suddenly went away), and if you only need a WiFi network for your phone and the Joule, that would be OK.

I doubt this will affect the ultra-high end (or Rolex, tbh) but wouldn't be surprised if the groups like Swatch and Richemont start to thin their herds, and if a few of the smaller/independent brands disappear altogether (or posture for acquisition, a la Breitling).

"depression","t5_2qqqf","For me Cymbalta worked really well for anxiety. &gt;also had you noticed in the post, i'm not addicted to opoids. Like I said, I tried them one time. the second time, I was going to but got rid of them instead.

&gt;As far as the alcoholism goes, I've had to quit cold turkey for a couple months at a time at points, when suppliers moved away and such. I never had withdrawels and within the five days since my last drink, none have occurred. And this drinking was literally so bad (for some one my age I guess, but bad for anybody I assume) That I would drink and then make myself throw up just so I could drink more. This didn't happen often. I have not had any withdrawals of alcohol ever.

&gt;And I'm not on prozac, but what did you mean by withdrawals from that? Or Cymbalta or whatever.

&gt;What is Cymblata, is this something I should talk about with my doctor?  Xanax, of course on the lowest dosage so far, has had no noticeable affects in my mood. Maybe it helps anxiety and I just don't realize it or something.   And what is suboxone? 

 NALTREXONE and SUBOXONE are medications to keep you from doing drugs and drinking. --SUBOXONE is an opioid that blocks the effects of any other opioids. It's also sometimes prescribed for pain. I'm thinking if you have pain issues it may not be a good idea. 

Naltrexone is for addiction ss well but I take it to help with the night eating I get from my antidepressants.  

Xanax for anxiety is going to flatten your personality out and they also need to be increased constantly because its short acting. Maybe consider Klonopin which is better suited for someone who doesnt want to pop pills all day. I've had them all and stopped because they are the worst to come off of. 
For anxiety I had great luck with Cymbalta but everyone is different. For anxiety I found the Beta blockers work best. A low dose of Inderall helps a lot. 
You have a dangerous alcohol problem. The binging and purging thing is interesting. While I don't believe in addiction I do think your drinking is a symptom of some sort of personality disorder. 
As a safety net try naltrexone for a month so you can get ahead of the drinking and focus on what the problem is. You could have ADHD for all I know. Symptoms range from a total disregard for your health to getting hyperfocused on substances. Sucks about the shots.

But my argument is that if you took away the twilight mechanic there's still a ton of high quality content hiding underneath. That mechanic is used to place another layer of gameplay atop what's already there, rather than being used to artificially pad out the game like sailing or rewinding time. So for the sake of this argument, let's not consider whether or not that mechanic adds ""depth"" or enjoyable gameplay, but rather whether or not the game can stand on its own without it.

My biggest counter argument to this, as it comes up every year or so, is: the army doesn't have a fucking clue what to do with its own aviation branch, much less one the size of the USAF.  Aviation is treated like long range artillery, and the Army has zero clue how to effectively C2 tactical aviation. Besides, the ultimate argument is to ask the Army if they want us back  the answer is usually a resounding ""fuck no!""

"civbattleroyale","t5_36z7e","Although I agree that Victoria is a very boring choice, I actually ranked the Netherlands quite highly. First off, they aren't actually overused in AI games, despite being a vanilla civ, and they weren't in Mk. I or Mk. 2. I rarely see them on r/civAIgames. Second, polders are extremely pretty to look at, and since they can now be built on coastal tiles, I expect to see quite a few. Third, I love their colours. Fourth, vanilla civs are likely to be far less popular in general, so I decided I ought to vote for a couple just because they're very stable and typically don't need any tweaking. I picked the Netherlands because they're one of my favourite vanilla civs.

as for your friends... they may be coming from a place of love, but they are also coming from a place of overbearingness. unless there are other signs of abuse that they are seeing that you don't, they are totally out of line to continue to approach you so aggressively about the relationship.

It's consumers versus businesses. They will do whatever they can to separate you from your money, and they will put as little effort into it as they possibly can. They want the most buck for their bang, so they give you the bare minimum for what you're willing to pay, and then charge a little more somehow.

As consumers, we want the most bang for our buck. That puts us at odds with businesses looking to sell us things. They aren't our friends. They aren't looking to help us out. They only want our money.

Never, ever, ever take the side of businesses. Don't do it. They aren't going to take your side. They don't want to help you out. So don't help them out.

Seriously. Bethesda does not care about you. They don't make decisions based on your happiness or well-being. Everything they do is cold and calculated, and serves only to help them turn a profit.

It's amazing that people are actually saying Bethesda supports modders. That they give us the ability to mod because they're such great developers.

Often what drives different viewpoints is a variation in experience and understanding how another's experience forms their opinions is key to becoming more empathetic.

One of the issues we are facing is that we are now becoming so connected to so many we can comfortably reject all opposition and still maintain a social group. Even if our opinion is one in a million, we can find hundreds of others with that opinion and shield off ourselves. We no longer must choose between confronting the opposition and loneliness.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","Don't give up on drawing! Actually, think of it as some motivation to keep your life going - to get better at something. I promise you, I was very very bad when i started drawing. I look back at some of the stuff and cringe. But now I  love to draw and while i know it's not perfect, i keep striving to do better! It makes me happy and i think it could make you happy too! Start by drawing some of your favorite video game or manga characters, and instead of berating it, find the little flaws and figure out how you could fix them, and you'll be improving in no time!

There are many other ways to create things as well. Some people are good with air dry clay, others love to make music, some like to sew, etc.,

I'm not having suicidal thoughts at the moment, but have been the past month or so. My boyfriend has lymphoma and it's been making me feel quite depressed. It's easier said than done, but you just gotta remind yourself of the things in life that you DO love! Relaxing, drawing, anime, and video games make you happy, maybe if only for a while, but you have to latch on to things like that.

Please, please please don't decide to end your life. I know you may not think so, but from the short conversation we've had so far, i can tell that you're quite smart and lovely with deep interests. All you have to do is find some tiny bit of motivation inside you to keep going. Being social is hard, I know first hand. But it becomes a lot easier when you find people who share the same interests as you, whether it be online or in real life.

It's just something you have to take day-by-day. You mentioned you have one friend - ask them if they want to go window shopping one day. Ask them if they'd like to go out to eat. During depressive episodes, sometimes i'll just lay in my pajamas all day and stay in bed because it's what i think is best for me. But it's not what's best for me.

I started going to concerts alone, and I can think of 4 people in the past 6 months that I've made acquaintances with, and one really great friend. Meeting others in real life is spontaneous and unexpected, so don't think that life will be like this forever. You will get to know someone and i bet you there are plenty of people who would love to be your friend! I really mean it.",1483229054

&gt; Beach House is a dream pop group that formed in 2005 in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. The group consists of Victoria Legrand (vocals, organ) and Alex Scally (guitar, keyboards). Legrand is the niece of French composer Michel Legrand. The group has released six albums: ""Beach House"" (2006), ""Devotion"" (2008), ""Teen Dream"" (2010), ""Bloom"" (2012), ""Depression Cherry"" (2015) and ""Thank Your Lucky Stars"" (2015).

&gt; Within a year of formation, the group charmed indie music enthusiasts across the blogosphere with their languid songcraft, while the eerie warmth of ""Apple Orchard"" landed on Pitchfork's Infinite Mixtape MP3 series in August 2006. Two months later, Beach House issued their eponymous debut album for Carpark. Fall shows with labelmates Over the Atlantic were also scheduled.

&gt; Victoria can also be heard on Frenemies' Birds in High School album.  She and Chris Freeland created harmonies on the song Waiting for the Ambulance. Victoria can also be heard on Grizzly Bear's 2009 release ""Veckatimest"" and she sings on ""Slow Life"", a Grizzly Bear track featured on the official soundtrack for Twilight: New Moon.

&gt; In September of 2009 Sub Pop Records announced that Beach House had signed and that a follow up album to 2008's ""Devotion"", ""Teen Dream""  would be released in early 2010.

&gt; Beach House was featured as a cover story in a January 2010 issue of the Washington Post magazine.

I don't think muslims are bad people when they are in a different country, but there is no way I or lots of other people on this globe can co-exist when sharia law is even considered to be the law of the land.  

Until they start exposing their ""brothers"" who are terrorizing in the name of a god against us infidels we can't win the fight, so we have to just wall up and defend.  There are too many, they are like zombies who can't stand that their is only one life to live.  It is a hard truth to realize, but the sooner you do, the sooner you can be free.

"gadgets","t5_2qgzt","One could also argue that it's more confusing when you open a DMG and/or zip file and the application is sitting there. If you're not familiar with OS X, your first instinct is just to launch the application. But a lot of applications don't work like that, you have to actually put them somewhere. Do I have to put it in Applications? Will it work anywhere? Can I just put it on my external drive and all of my data will be saved across machines (everybody says you just drag applications to the trash to uninstall them, so they must be self-contained)? Can I just drag it out into the Downloads folder and call it good? Is it just creating a shortcut? Oh, I see &lt;thing name&gt; is in the sidebar of the Finder! I didn't even need to drag it anywhere, I'll open it from there. Woops, that's the DMG again. So do I need to mount the DMG every time I run it? Should I keep it somewhere safe?

Also interesting is that Sierra introduced 'app translocation', so if the hapless newbie does decide to just drag the application out of the DMG and into the Downloads folder, it probably won't work properly since its relative path will be wonky.

Uninstalling things is another whole can of worms. If some settings get corrupted or you want to start fresh, you drag it to the trash, empty the trash, and assume you're good. But when you download a fresh copy and open it up, all your old corrupt data is still there. So then you have to wade into the filesystem. You finally figure out that you should be in your library folder and try to figure out where the data is. Is it in preferences? Application support? Saved application state? All of the above? None of the above? Better go through each one and look for every scrap the application left behind.

Anyway, I think as others have mentioned it comes down to familiarity. If you're already familiar with OS X, you know you can drag it and go. If you're familiar with Windows, you know you run an installer and go.

The most unfortunate thing to me is how many different ways now exist to install applications on each platform. In OS X we have the Mac App Store, disk images, and application zip files. And within disk images and zips you can have a package installer or an application file. And on Windows we have the Windows Store, installers... huh, actually I guess they do only have the two. Some things have 'portable installs' but you usually have to go looking for those... I don't know, I don't really use Windows.

At any rate, I think my excessively wordy point is that there are difficulties and strange nuances in every OS. I still prefer OS X (sorry, macOS) personally, but I don't mind using Windows either. Neither is more stable or intuitive to me than the other, just different.",1483229064

He's not helping the team unless he's out there taking out any incoming defense. He's meant to be a flanker who's always moving. He's more oriented towards offense than defense (I never play Genji on defense ever, I don't trust my jumpy abilities with defending the point.)

Now, if he was on the objective attacking, he should be MOSTLY with the team, even with his 1v1 capabilities. Genji CAN flank with a well coordinated ult to catch the defense by surprise on point A and possibly B, but he has to make sure his team is contesting and helping out. 

Tl;Dr he's not meant to stay on a point all on his own, he helps pave the way for the payload. While there most certainly are a lot of bad Genji's who do things on their own (trust me, I've done this before when I started playing him and I'm sorry.), it's not a good thing to say that ALL of them are awful pieces of shit.

"gtaonline","t5_2xrd1","The two MC businesses I have are the coke lockup and the meth lab, which are the two most profitable.  I have the least expensive locations and all three upgrades for each business, though only the equipment and staff upgrades are relevant to profit.  The numbers that follow are only relevant to coke and meth with equipment and staff upgrades.  The supply to product ratio and sale price per product unit are worse without the upgrades.  Similarly, while I don't have the other three business types, I understand that the ratios and unit prices are different (and less favorable) even when they're upgraded, so those businesses are not profitable when purchasing supplies rather than stealing them.

I also must admit that it's been a while since I paid attention to the sale prices, so these numbers aren't exact.  They should be fairly close however.  I'll try to get more exact numbers this evening for you if I can make the time.

Buying a full five bars of supply costs $75k and produces two bars of product.  A long distance sale of two bars of product from the coke lockup pays about $170k, for a profit of about $90k.  The sale price of the meth is a little lower.  I think it's about $140k, for a profit of about $60k.  So the cycle nets me about $150k for however long it takes me to do the two sales, which may be anywhere from twenty minutes to an hour depending upon which delivery methods come up.

The routine is simple.  I go to one business, order a new batch of supplies, then sell the existing product.  Once the sale is complete I just go to the other business and do the same.  After the second sale I disband my MC and go do something else.  Depending upon my mood and whether any friends are around that may mean doing CEO crate and/or vehicle work interleaved with VIP work, helping friends with their CEO or MC work, driving or flying around exploring San Andreas (I've only been playing a couple of months, so that's still fun to me), hunting Sentinels or Sandkings, or even sitting AFK in my apartment or office watching TV while I go cook dinner or do something else in the real world.  I believe it only takes a couple of hours to process a full five bar load of supplies, so by the time I feel like going back to the MC businesses after whatever else I was doing, it's pretty much guaranteed they'll be ready for another cycle.

So it's not a huge amount of money, and if I were doing it over again I might choose to skip the MC stuff entirely.  But since I have them, doing a sale from both makes for a nice bit of variety now and again in between CEO jobs, and it pays a decent amount for what averages between thirty and forty minutes.",1483229067

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Well this isn't like $20 dude. This is $1k! Friendships end over much less and I think it's justified that you used this strategy after your friend essentially stole a thousand dollars from you and refused to pay back what you are owed. He's just trying to come up with reasons not to pay. 

I actually wouldn't have come up w a plan for him. For some men that just means he'll go against the plan just to feel like he's the one in control. I would've stuck with ""I need x amount by this date or the utilities are getting cut, as I am not here to be your mommy paying your bills."" 

Is there any actual reason he has not paid you back, or does he just think that you should pay because he doesn't feel like it and I suppose that means you owe it to him? ",1483229067

"FUTMobile","t5_379r4","Hmm i think that you are wrong. That what you are talking about is shooting accuracy. Since we dont have all skills in fifa mobile, that would be Positioning because that skill is in attack skills so makes sense.
Finishing is skill as far as I know and as far I understand chance of succesfull score after u choose position. So for example you swipe in the corner and then there are some skils for gk which gives him higher chance to save and for field player thata finishing. So then match engine basically add all these skills into calculation (for field player position+finishing) and for gk some other skills and which one have better score that guy wins. But when i say position its not skill position but place, skill only determines where ball goes after that basically as better position of ball is, better chance to score.",1483229068

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Here's the way I look at it. If enough people want to discriminate against a group because of something they're born with, they're going to do it, by hook or by crook. If you try to force them not to, by law or by violence, they'll only become more set in their ways. But, if you allow them to choose and if you show them that people with the specific birth factor you're talking about can still be useful to them economically and socially, then you will convince most of them. But, you won't convince all, and you will have to constantly do work to make your case. 

And you don't think you should have to. You think that you have a right to have people ignore the demographics. Which amounts to a right to limit and control people's thoughts. That's an impossibility. You literally can't force someone to think something. ",1483229068

Okay. It's getting some good reviews, some not as good. Similar to every previous model.

I don't. As I said, I have lots of friends who have them and they are very happy. Shorter battery life? Yes. But I guess that isn't enough of an issue. It hasn't failed to meet their expectations.

"VOIP","t5_2qrz4","It's really dependent on the platform and your skill set. An experienced Asterisk developer could do it pretty easily (the back end at least). The web interface might be a bit tougher, but depending on the feature set, not the difficult either. There's also the idea of using a softphone (instead of something like WebRTC) which would make initial start up costs less (if you are using pre-made softphone) or a LOT more if you want custom software developed. To give you an example, we had some RFPs out for a custom Android SIP client based off a open source package and most of them came back at around the 100k ballpark.

If you are looking for a turn key solution, your probably looking more along the lines of $100k + (just for the hardware, licensing and software). This is also a low ball investment, depending on the features you need it could easily be upwards of 250k-500k

Then there's also Asterisk based turn key solutions (like PBXware) that has a smaller initial investment, but not nearly as customizable.

That all said, your issue won't be the platform, it will be marketing. Everyone and their mother run ITSPs these days, what will set you apart from them?

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","The problem with goldfish is they are very dirty, and get very large, so this guy by himself could live in a 55 gallon for a little while. Using the 10 gallon your going to be doing frequent water changes, probably daily, and tank 'instructions' which come with a tank are a joke in some cases. Do not put 4 goldfish in a 10 gallon, like EVER. You need about 30 gallons for one goldfish and 10 or 20 for every one after, and that's not even enough for the common gold fish that you have. These guys get big, like multiple feet big if you keep them alive and healthy long enough. 

So yes, for your one fish you need a bigger tank, at least another 30ish gallons for him to have plenty of room and to keep from doing water changes every day. That will only last you for months-1year though as this goldfish will get very big. I would recommend a much bigger tank, and keeping him as long as you can until you find someone with a pond for him :/ Also no friends for him unless you get larger than a 55 gallon aquarium as this goldfish is already a decent size. 

It sucks, but common goldfish get really big and after long enough a tank just won't do it unless your looking at multiple hundred gallons. ",1483229072

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","&gt; In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data is significantly unlikely if the null hypothesis were true. In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is not rejected (i.e., accepted). In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data is.

Since biomes and nests exist, I wouldn't say it's significantly unlikely to have spawn points operate this way. It'd be nice to have ""I watched x Pokestops for y hours and these are my results"" or even ""it can/can't be possible because z"" which helps either prove or disprove OP's findings rather than an outright ""nope, it's RNG"".

Nicola Cuffe, 54, from Woking, Surrey, is a mum of three who runs a childminders’ agency.
Height: 5ft 4in | Weight: 10.9st

I liked that one...when she said:

&gt;Nicola’s reaction. “It was a real shock to hear I needed so few calories. It would be impossible to live on that amount.

Um yeah. About that. I'm her height, and a few years older. I may be more active than her. And I eat in the vicinity of 1300 calories a day. Sometimes fewer, sometimes a bit more. 

Is it hard? On days when I spend a lot of time on the treadmill, or outside with the dogs, it's a little low. So I eat a carrot. Problem solved.  

I will say that when I first started losing weight, and cut my calories down, it was a shock to see how much I had been eating, vs what I should be eating. But you get over that, and if you do it the way I did (gradual reduction in caloric intake), it's very doable.

* CPU: The i7-6800k has 6 cores, but that is more aimed at work related stuff. Its hyperthreading is more superior, but the single-core threading is worse than a i7-6700k. And most games do not use more than 4 cores, if they use 4 cores at all. You most likely wouldn't even need a i7-6700k. You can get a i5-6600k, if you're purely gaming. The i5-6600k is only 5% worse in gaming. Not worth the $100 difference in my opinion. I still included the i7-6700k because you wished so though.

* CPU Cooler: Very quiet, efficient cooler

* MOBO: Get this combo at Microcenter. You could theoretically get any Z170 motherboard you want. I just found this one from their website. I recommend just getting the cheapest motherboard with all the features you need. Paying more money for a more expensive motherboard is just a waste of money if you're not using the extra features.

* SSD: Do not get the SSD from Microcenter. It's overpriced, and the performance isn't too good either. Instead, get the SK hynix. It's the 2nd fastest SATA SSD available, right behind the Samsung **850**, but it's a lot cheaper than the Samsung 850. You can get the SK hynix for $64.99 [from Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820329009) or [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SK-Hynix-Memory-Internal-HFS250G32TND-N1A2A/dp/B01H5KW8VG)

* GPU: This GPU is most likely overkill for 1080p 60fps. The R9 Fury's performance is somewhere in the middle between the RX480/GTX1060 6GB and the GTX1070. I found it on a sale, its price is at the price point of a RX480/GTX1060 6GB, so it's a good deal. You should be able to get ~100fps consistently with this one. It's an older generation card though, hope you don't mind.

* Case: Great case with good airflow and cable management.

* PSU: The PSU is one of the most important parts IMO. If you skimp on the PSU, you risk frying your components. If you get a high quality PSU on the other hand, you'll get to keep the PSU for a decade and longer, without seeing any issues. This is a very high quality PSU, should last you a long time.",1483229082

"BPD","t5_2qqdp","&gt; feeling like a burden, etc. 

I wish I could remember which celebrity gave this anecdote. They were either on Oprah or in O Magazine or something years ago. She said she used to be really self-conscious when she'd go see friends and they were comforting someone, her first thought was, ""Oh man what did I do to make them feel so bad?""

Then one day she realized that that level of self-consciousness was actually kind of self-absorbed. Why should she assume that another person's pain or bad mood was because of her? In this particular instance, the friend's mother had died and people were consoling her, but the narrator just assumed it had to have been because of something she did, and that prevented her from being a comfort to the friend or having true empathy.

That really struck me. When our primary focus is always on worrying about how we affect others, we're making it too much about ourselves, and ironically, that's not true empathy. Therefore being overly self-conscious is actually being narcissistic. It's much kinder and empathetic to approach someone with no preconceived notions at all and assume nothing :)

The good news is -- it's also kinder and more empathetic toward ourselves!

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","1. There should be something in the hotbar section of the settings called the WXHB. That's another hotbar accessed by tapping L2 or R2 twice. You should turn that on, it'll be visible right above the regular cross hotbar so you can see your cooldowns. Alternatively, you can just plop a regular hotbar somewhere and put your cooldowns on that.

2. You can change classes, but you won't be able to accept the duty until you change back.

3. Just do it! The best way to learn how to tank is by trying it. and, you know, doing hall of the novice.

4. Targeting system on PS4 is shit. And you should really move that back to the dpad instead of L2 and R2.

5. What I do is start AoEing if there's at least 4 mobs around. Keeping your dots active on all the enemies is pretty decent for groups of three or less, but some people would just prefer if you focused down one target first.",1483229088

Then, all of them are shuffled, including the correct answer, and each are read aloud. The players all vote on which line is the real line, and players earn points both for guessing correctly, and having other players vote for their answer.

Of course, reading has a component to the game, and more well-read people have a slight advantage when it comes to familiar books, but the game includes a wide array of genres and books.",1483229091

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I would start with something from the [Ego line](http://www.myvaporstore.com/SearchResults.asp?Search=ego) for your set up.  This is very popular right now for first set ups.  

For the juice a pack lasts you two to three days, you should be good with nicotine levels at no more than 12mg.  In fact you might be good with 6 mg.  

My favorite ""mint"" flavor is from Adirondack Vapor (site is having problems right now, can't link)  Flavor - Frigid.  For me this is a little to minty to use on its own.  I usually mix it with something.  Couple of Adirondacks flavors that have mint mixed in already are ""Miracle on Ice"" and ""Eureka"".  (I am not affiliated with them at all, I just use their liquids the most).

There are so many places to buy liquids from.  One of the popular less pricey ones is Mt. Baker Vapor.  I don't use them so I can not say much, I just know lots of people use them.  They make getting a variety of sample flavors simple.  I am sure there are countless others that do the same.

One important thing I suggest is to buy several different liquids in different flavors and different nic levels.  You will need to play around with it to find what suits you best.  

Search this sub for help and YouTube videos can help you with your set up cleaning, assembly and such.

Hope this helps!

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","You only ""needed"" a single ring to be an effective spell caster in Dark Souls II. The Clear Bluestone Ring. Of course, you also had the exceptional Southern Ritual Band but it was hardly required - especially in duels. Clutch and covenant rings could be added but provided paltry benefits (capped at 8%).  

---

Let's see what sort of rings are needed in DSII;

--

&gt; Sorcereries: Sage Ring, Young Dragon Ring, Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring, Magic Clutch Ring  
Pyromancies: Sage Ring, Great Swamp Ring, Witch's Ring, Fire Clutch Ring  
Miracles: Sage Ring, Morne's Ring, Ring of the Sun's First Born, Lightning Clutch Ring  
Hexes: Sage Ring, Bellowing Dragoncrest Ring, Witch's Ring, Ring of the Sun's First Born, Young Dragon Ring, Great Swamp Ring, Morne's Ring, Dark Clutch Ring  

--

Clutch rings can be safely disregarded in PVP since the game likes to lie to you. The sage ring can be disregarded but only if you're running around with 40 dexterity for some fucking reason. Not using these rings will cost you at least 43% damage up to 65% - at which point you might as well throw your character in the trash. At absolute most, sorcerers stand to lose up to 112% of their damage.",1483229095

No, that's clearly not what's going on.  This *is* deployment, no ships have moved yet. The deployment areas are defined by the diagonal lines corner-to-corner in each mat.

"AdvancedRunning","t5_2t1rd","It's really three things that I am looking for with that comment:

1) More aerobic benefit from those runs.

2) Holding closer to ""Race"" form rather than flopping all over the place.

3) The psychological benefit of having designated ""easy training runs"" and ""recovery runs"" rather than just a bunch of ""easy"" runs.

3 is the big one for me really. My ""typical"" week prior to this would be: Workouts Tuesday &amp; Thursday, long run Sunday, easy runs all the other days. Easy &amp; long runs typically are between 5:30 - 6:00/km, while the [vdot](https://runsmartproject.com/calculator/) and [McMillan](https://www.mcmillanrunning.com/results?hours=3&amp;minutes=03&amp;seconds=&amp;distance=Marathon&amp;goalDistance=10km&amp;ghours=&amp;gminutes=&amp;gseconds=) calculators put an intended ""easy"" or ""long run pace"" at more like 5:00/km or faster (3:03 marathon, 37:30 10K). This has me feeling uneasy about what I am accomplishing on each run, and then worrying about whether I should be speeding up on every run or keeping them slow.

The plan was to focus on getting my long runs up to the intended pace of a bit under 5:00/km average, swap one of the other ""easy"" runs for a run around this same pace, and leave the other three alone as recoveries.

I would then have two workouts, a long run, a ""general aerobic / medium long"", and 3 recovery runs, and could stop worrying about whether I should be pushing the pace up a bit on my recovery runs. ",1483229097

OPM would decide to pass on the secret training regimen which gave him his strength to the young man who seems most worthy to use it, Mumen Rider. Mumen Rider then spends the next three years in Hero High School getting into SoL/combat-action hijinx while secretly training with the guy who is probably killing most-every villain who shows up. Meanwhile, Saitama gets increasingly bored with the fact that no villain can come even remotely close to matching him and becomes obsessed with finding a fighter who can give him a worthy fight. When Mumen graduates from the training program and from the school, OPM attacks him hoping that maybe, finally he will have a worthy opponent. The two then fight. Not for the fate of the world, but because Saitama is insanely (literally) bored.

Edit: Conclusion, the series ends as they are both running in for a full force single punch. No result is conveyed.",1483229099

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","&gt; You do this on a daily basis. For example, are you breathing right now? You're engaging in the consumption of oxygen. Yet, before I pointed out this fact, were you concerning yourself over the ""economics"" of air? Do you worry over the proper production and distribution of air part for your daily life?

This is because air is not currently scarce.  But if air became scarce in the future, know that a market would develop around air.  

&gt;Where scarcity does not exist, economics is irrelevant.

We agree.  

&gt;What happens when labor happens to be the resource that is no longer relevant?

Wait.  Won't humans just want more stuff?  It can't be robots all the way down.  Who is paying for the robots?  And as human desire increases and we need more stuff and more robots, won't we have to continue to increase the UBI?  Who is paying for all of this?

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I started playing the entire Uncharted series when a bought a PS4 bundled with Uncharted 4 last October. I had a lot of fun playing the first three as each one gets progressively better. The plot seems kind of repetitive in each of the games [They look for treasure then they found out that said treasure could destroy the world](/spoiler) but gameplay-wise, it was one hell of a thrill ride. 

After beating the first three Uncharted games, I've started Uncharted 4. I was blown away by this game. The visuals are amazing, the gameplay is intense, and the story perfectly concludes the entire series. I have never enjoyed a more satisfying ending to a game since Ocarina of Time. I was pretty emotional once the credits roll, I know this a bigger impact to players who played this series since Uncharted 1. I also played this on HDR mode and this game keeps getting prettier and prettier!

My time playing the Uncharted games was definitely worth it and I'm so happy that I had a chance to play it. As for Uncharted 4, it's a solid game from start to finish and it's why it is my game of the year.",1483229100

* Try to build the National College (in the Philosophy tech) as soon as you can. You need a Library in all of your cities in order to build it. Consider purchasing Libraries for your low-production cities to get the NC faster.  
* If you're playing BNW, make sure you establish a trade route with your capital to get a food bonus. If your capital is on the coast, use a cargo ship since that will yield a higher food bonus (side note: always use cargo ships if it's an option because they always have higher yields). If you build the cargo ship/caravan in your capital, you'll have to move it to another city to do this.  
* Once they're available (I forget the era), use spies to steal techs from your rivals.
* It's almost always a good idea to accept a research agreement when offered, unless you have to pay a hefty premium (which usually means you're ahead of the other civ in tech).
* If you build a city directly next to a mountain tile, then later on you'll be able to build an Observatory in that city, which grants +50% science in that city. Some mountain-like natural wonders also enable you to build an Observatory.
* Don't improve banana tiles. If you do, you get a little more food and production, but you'll lose the eventual science bonus from jungle tiles (and maybe culture as well if you choose the +1 culture in jungle tiles pantheon).",1483229102

Warwick Fire and other fire departments don't hire paramedics because we are overqualified to work on their rescues. This leaves EMT-Cardiacs who have about one tenth the training that paramedics have to provide the majority of ALS care in the state. The hospital staff and medical control are uninvolved with EMS, have no idea what best practices are in EMS and how the services operate that they oversee. For example they think that some paramedics or other ALS providers will treat 2 cardiac arrests a year while working in the area. I don't want to work where the prevailing attitude about EMS by fire departments and receiving hospitals is that EMS is a joke.

But I'm a big fan of the protocol changes and I hope that the services and providers in the state improve the care that they provide.",1483229104

"Vermintide","t5_36d6l","There are 2 types of attacks. Normal attacks (quick left click) and charged attacks (holding left mouse a bid before releasing).
Then there is block (360 degree, right click). When blocking you can also push enemies 360 degree around you to get space (rightclick and then left click).

Each weapon has its own attack pattern which determines how to use the weapon.
For the rapier the normal attack combo is good against normal rats (slave rats (naked) and clan rats (a bid of clothing)). The attacks are fast but dont deal much dmg individually.
The charged attack (stab) has the attribute armorpenetration. Armored enemies are stormvermin (armored rats) and ratling gunners. Armor will negate every attack that doesnt hit the head or misses the attribute armorpenetration. It deals more damage but is single target.


Block is rather straightforward. Block any attack that hits you. Blocking different attacks costs different amounts of stamina. A hit from a standard rat takes 1 stamina (0.5 shields). A upperhead attack of a SV takes 7 stamina (3.5 shields). A swing from the ogre takes all stamina.

Push is also classified based on the weapon you are using. There are 4 levels of push. Level one is barely worth the push and only stutters rats in place.
Level 2 is the point where it starts to matter a bid. It pushes rats a few steps back.  Level 3 pushs rats further away and sometimes makes them fall. Level 4 lets rats fly backwards and fall. Another important thing about pushes is if they can interrupt overhead attacks from Stormvermin. Shield weapons can do this naturally but every other weapon needs devastating blow to interrupt it with a push.
Pushes cant stop a packmaster grabbing you.

A Rapier without devastating blow has level 1 push aka near useless.

Another attack that is unique to the rapier is the offhand pistol. To use it you need to bind ""weapon special"" in the options.

The last important mechanic is dodge. Based on the weapon you have equipped when dodging the distance covered is different.
Most/All attacks ingame can be dodged if timed correctly.",1483229110

"computers","t5_2qhm5","people use virtual machines because they let you *isolate* different things.  for example, two people using two (different) virtual machines on the same hardware, will not be aware of each other (with some caveats).

so people (big corporations, say) want to use virtual machines for that reason.

but virtual machines have a *cost*.  they *add* work.  just running the virtual machine itself uses some of the cpu power.  so unless you need the isolation they provide, you're better off without them.

and when people say that xeons are better for running virtual machines they typically mean that xeons are optimized in certain ways so that the cost of running the virtual machine is quite small.  but it's still there.

so a program will always (unless there's some really weird special case) run better directly on the host than on a virtual machine.  even on a xeon.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","MTGO is the *most complete* digital Magic experience, since it has an impressively complete rules implementation. However, it's expensive, it has a fairly steep learning curve, and it can be... buggy, to say the least.

Magic Duels is a stripped-down free-to-play alternative to MTGO. It's simpler and more streamlined, but the cardpool is much smaller and the rules implementation isn't as complete.

There are various unsupported, inofficial free alternatives floating around, such as xMage, Cockatrice and Untap.in.

Finally, there's [Shandalar](http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Magic:_the_Gathering_(MicroProse), a 1997 videogame adaptation that has a surprisingly fun campaign mode and some mild RPG elements. Because it's so old, the rules barely resemble modern Magic, but the game is a *ton* of fun. You'll probably have to do some digging to find a working version since it's abandonware.",1483229114

"apple","t5_2qh1f","&gt; They already have that casual line: the new MacBook

It's not priced like a casual line.  

It should be around half the price to really be competitive in the general market.  It's competitors are ultrabooks that consistently cost less than a grand.  

Yes it's got some nice perks, the main one being Mac OS, but it's also burdened with a lot of ""design"" features that casual users don't really care about, at least not enough to justify the premium.  Apple is charging consumers extra for little other than ""thinner.""

Same with the new MBP, unfortunately.  There's absolutely no need for a ""pro"" laptop to be that light and thin.  The target user spends much more time using it than carrying it.  But Apple has compromised usability (especially keyboard and battery life) in favor of a *marginal* gain in portability.  Weird, and not a sound strategy in the broad market.  

I would be interested to know what percentage of Mac business at this point is simply driven by platform lock, and reluctant upgraders who just need a new Mac because they're due for an upgrade and can't deal with switching platforms.  I doubt that many people are switching from Windows to Mac for the new machines.  But I don't know where to get that information.",1483229115

I think some of it comes down to personal perspective on the issue. Everything in those articles pretty much describes cronyism and pay-for-play politics, which is rampant throughout all branches of government on both sides of the aisle. The question in Perry's case is how much did he personally benefit. His opponents would say, look at all the money Perry is dishing out to corporations, some of which contributed to his campaigns. His proponents would say, look at all the business and jobs he brought to Texas at a relatively small price. 


Personally, I straddle the fence on some of this because I'm very pro business and pro Texas business, but I want to less money in all aspects of politics and campaigning, especially in the form of lobbying.

"wow","t5_2qio8","**US/A Uldum/Antonidas &lt;Rapid Succession&gt; recruiting for weekend raiding.**

If you're looking for weekend raiding, we raid every Saturday and Sundays from about 5:30PM to 9:00PM PST.

We have a solid raiding core of players that work well together and we make great progress for the time we raid, but real life has claimed some of our core. While pugging is easy enough, we prefer a tight-knit and reliable group and we're looking for a few good players to round-off our roster and raid composition. We usually raid with 12-15, as we prefer a smaller group where everyone's play matters to getting the kill.

Rapid Succession has been an active guild since the beginning of BC (though many of us have played together since Vanilla), and we're focused on covering as much content as possible while maintaining a positive-but-focused environment. With experienced raid leadership (our raid lead has been doing this since Vanilla), we're serious when we need to be and goofy and drunk most of the rest of the time.

A relatively hardcore raiding guild from Vanilla through Cata (consistently in the server top ten and occasionally at the top for entire minutes at a time), many of us took a bit of a break after Firelands while a dedicated few held down the fort. Now, a little older and wiser(?), we've navigated careers, kids, and international narcotics rings to return back to the fold and are currently a tight-knit group of friends enjoying a less time-consuming approach to small-group raiding.

We're looking for mature (or those that can fake it well), dedicated, self-sufficient, skilled members to join the ranks, and we're currently especially open to adding a shaman/monk heals and some ranged DPS to our regular raiding group (skilled, committed, experienced players with good attitudes and a minimum of salt). Unless you're Canadian. We have enough of those. Too many. It's like a maple forest up in here. Okay, I guess maybe one more wouldn't hurt.

Balance druids, warlocks of any inclination, and mages of all flavors are particularly appealing for our current raid composition.

So you've literally decided that no matter what, even if bitcoin is accepted by 99% percent of the worlds countries  as legal tender, and the price was 1 million per coin, and you couldn't get a job without accepting it as payment, you still wouldn't consider it a success because... You say so?

Yes I'm sure they don't care for me at all even though JK just hit me up on Kakao to wish me a happy new year. Yes, they dont care at all.

See people like you are the reason why their every move is carefully calculated. Because people like you judge and think they know everything about all their situations just because you see what you see on a screen or read on a paper.


But of course you wouldnt know about the hours of footage I didnt put on the video that shows us all hanging out, laughing, having fun. I couldnt have a lot of footage of LKS because I simply didnt want to step on any toes of his management team when it comes to my videos. JK, I can film freely and talk to freely on camera because he is his own management and what he says goes. I just had to be more careful with LKS. 

Tiny actually helped JK a lot with the recent issues but thats more stuff that has not been made public. But I'm sure you'll make up things in your own mind again no matter what I say.

Seriously, this isn't an issue. I've repeatedly explained why Blake is acting completely consistently. They've been incredibly hamfisted and anvilicious over her character, with almost no room for nuance or subtlety, and you're acting as if she has split personality.

Again, ""I want to rest, but I will fight because I have to fight"" is not a contradiction. You're insisting that's her character when it's not. Even in Volume 2, she was the most proactive against White Fang, because she's trying to overcome her cowardice. That's the key thing. She thinks she's a coward, she's bitter about her Semblance, and she's trying to take on all of her issues at once because she doesn't want to be a coward.

Sun had no right to eavesdrop. He wasn't like ""Lemme knock on the door loudly and show her the White Fang mask."" He wasn't like ""Lemme wait for her to answer why she left her parents, which would give me the time outside to see the spy and go after the spy."" No, he was like ""I found her, lemme lean on the door to hear her, then break the door because it can't handle my body mass, and lie about what I was doing while trying to excuse my repeated invasion of her privacy."" He's completely in the wrong in how he was trying to convey himself, and she's completely in the right for how she acted, beyond throwing the phone (but her anger even then was understandable).",1483229127

If you disagree on moral things and religion that's hard especially down the road if you commit. If there's a child involved that raises questions, when family abd things are involved and also preparing for your end of life arrangements all that is serious and could cause issues down the line. I'm not saying it can't be worked thru but it takes A LOT of work. 

If you both want two different things out of life that's almost impossible. If one of you gives in, that person might regret and feel resentment later which will come between y'all and possibly break you up. 

Better to let go now before you get too attached.

Nadella is praised because he is also a visionary. Cool is reviled because he isn't. It's something of a curse: every visionary has a faithful executive behind them to make things happen, and when the visionary departs (the company or this world) the natural successor is the executive who shadowed them.

Example: Stick figures sitting in chairs, conversation bubble pops up above the one guy and it says ""Derray,"" then the other guy opens his mouth and the text bubble says ""Productions."" Then the text bubbles combine to form your logo (no clue what it is tbh, but seemed appropriate to be 2 text bubbles overlapping) and that gets bigger until you white flash to the main content.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","Back the our point? That point was nowhere in your response originally. I replied to what you said, not what you edited. I never claimed to have access to proof that they were ghosting, I literally said how the proof could be obtained (assuming it was true).

Even if it was only one game that someone ghosted him, it would still influence his w/l... 1 game is the minimum significance required to change statistics when it comes to hearthstone, is it significant throughout the entire day if it was only one game? No, not really, going 46-32 is pretty much the same as going 47-31 (made up numbers obviously), but the ghosting still influenced his win loss record. So the answer is actually yes, it's not always significant, but you can literally for yourself if you want, watch the difference between a stream where he has delay and a stream where he doesn't have delay, and see if you can find a difference in these types of plays. I don't think you will (I know I won't), but you could. The ability to prove your point with data exists, or if you don't like Reynad use Trump, he's doing a delayed stream right now.

My point isn't that ghosting is a huge problem, I know for a fact streamers are going to exaggerate ghosting problems, but the fact is that it *does* exist, and happens more often than you're trying to make it seem.",1483229136

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I just want to talk about a badass brand I found!! 

I have a huge problem with hormonal acne (due to PCOS). My face goes from dry, to mega oily, to some weird, hard to describe, state inbetween. I break out with ugly cystic-like acne because of this. 

When I get this kind of acne its really hard to get rid of. I have gone like a month with one persistent huge, red, break out spot on my chin multiple times. Its always in the same spot that this happens. Ive always wanted to get it fixed at a dermatologist but I cant afford that.

Well, for christmas my boyfriends step-mother got me a set of masks from Bonvivant. 

At the time she got me these I had just broken out with my usual, ugly, huge, cystic acne from my chin.

So, I put on one of the masks (I used the niacinamide + lime one the first time) and let it sit for 20 mins.

OVERNIGHT my acne was gone, healing spots that were inflammed lightened and calmed, my skin tone was even, and my face was not oily to the touch.

Yall dont even understand (or maybe you do!) Ive been battling this problem for 7 YEARS and I found something that literally fixed a flareup over a period of 12 hours.

Now, my flairup did try and come back with a vengeance after like 4 days. But all I did to fix that was put another niacinamide + lime mask on for 20 mins before bed and my cystic acne shrunk substantially, again, overnight. Skin victory for me! I expect it to be totally gone in a few days with continued treatment.

So I just wanted to share those amazing results with yall in case anyone is having the same problem as me. Bonvivant is amazing. Its not even expensive.",1483229140

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt;Because the Liberator is not a dedicated anti-anything vehicle, it's a jack-of-all-trades gunship.

I'm a bit confused. I thought our argument was over the tank buster specifically?

Regardless, I'd hardly say that liberators have a ""free win"" against MBTs. An attentive magrider crew will still put a couple of halberd and/or AP shots into your lib before you get close enough to tankbuster them. 

&gt;By that logic, the Skyguard should just click ESFs to collect certs.

Oh, hell no. Weapon balance isn't rock-paper-scissors. But again, we have to consider that this is a combined-arms game. While, say, a zephyr liberator is ridiculously overpowered against a handful of infantry, how often do you see just an isolated squad of infantry foot-zerging between bases? More often than not, they're fighting at a base which has manned anti-air turrets nearby, or burster maxes, or whatever that makes using a liberator against them only practical for a very short while, if at all.

Weapons should be balanced against the situations they're being used in, not against just the units they're fighting. But if you balance a weapon for the one situation where they're most powerful, if it's rare or has little effect on base caps (like tankbusting a lone wandering MBT), then that weapon would become pretty much useless in situations that actually matter (like tankbusting deployed sunderers around a base, which may be equipped with deploy shield and walkers or parked near AA turrets or guarded by MBTs or whatever).

I don't have a good answer as to whether the tank buster is ""balanced"" overall, but I do know that balance is a far more complex subject than redditors seem to realize.",1483229141

Treat yourself like you'd treat a loved one with the same problem -- it's just avoidance to stay inside with the foods that are keeping you there.  

Weight loss is about the food.  Even when you were the triple-athlete, it was that you were eating less than you were burning that allowed you to lose the weight.  

If underfed, people in a coma will lose weight.  You, with your limitations, can lose weight with tracking and guidance using MyFitnessPal (see the Quick Start Guide).  

Your loved one would have your support and make sure that you're not letting your self-doubts keep you from living your life.  Do the same for yourself.

&gt; I just cannot stop eating

No, but we can slow it down.  We can't turn it off, but we can lower the volume gradually.  We can't get to perfect but we can get to ""pretty good.""

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The general idea behind midlane is that the champion scales well with levels and items.  Midlane gives solo experience, is generally safe if your champ has some self peel, gives solo gold, and receives jungle pressure.  Midlane also has access to the entire map to abuse their generally powerful midgame and waveclear.  

Putting an adc in midlane would be detremental unless said ad carry also had waveclear, midgame power, and scales well with levels.  The best marksman example that is viable is corki as he has playmaking with his package, gains damage with levels since he's ability based, and he can push a wave.  

Furthermore, put an ad carry midlane and put them vs, say, leblanc.  That matchup will either end with an 8/0/0 leblanc, or a 2/0/0 leblanc up 100 cs.  This isn't even factoring that said ad would be put under jungle pressure.

2. While valid, I have a counterpoint: Rare realm synergy is useful for people who want to do all CMs. 


3. Just because it's harder to make a mage team doesn't mean 'mage teams suck'. Mage teams can be better than physical teams due to the higher soft-cap. This also means stacking mage buffs is way more worthwhile than stacking physical buffs. Furthermore, Deployment tactics is the best boostfaithga for mage teams besides OK BSB. 


4. First of all, you're gonna have a hard time convincing me that an en-element BSB is bad, especially when we're talking about the Holy enElement BSB. Furthermore, the breakdown commands are not at all useless. It means you don't have to bring Attack/Magic Breakdown on your Support, thus they can run stuff like Affliction Break, Mind break or Wrath.


5. You're missing the forest for the threes.

The added bonus is that aTrump hates looking like the idiot he is, so if he talks up Russia and Vlad fucks him over- well Vlad wins because Trump will either ignore it to prevent looking like a fool. Or look like a fool and be unable to deal with it because he is one. 


The US is like the big protective older brother of a girl Russia wants to fuck. First they are getting him a little tipsy...and then a little drunk. Before you know it, he is lying passed out on the couch and Russia can fuck whoever it wants. 

Trump thinks he is smarter than everyone else. He is not smarter than Putin. Vlad hasn't made his mark on the world yet and he wants to.

The rule that states that you should give a reason/argument for why you dislike things.

&gt; Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something

.

&gt; You do nothing but flame people but when you're called out on it, you lash out at others.

His post was just like yours, the sole purpose of it was to personally attack the person he responded to and distract from the topic in order to defend his beloved Valve from criticism. People like that need to get banned, they are cancer for any community. In any community forum such as playdota, these trolls get in fact banned. I can't comprehend how stupid you must be for thinking it's a good thing to silence every discussion and to always be completely destructive. And to have the balls to call me a hypocrite because I call out trollshits on their trollshittings in order to make the game and the community better and get a constructive discussion.

I guess I could have spent more time at work studying, as I spend way too much time on Reddit telling myself that I'm going to get started on real work. I am not good at time management. Another reason was the workload of the next required class, which required meaningful participation in the online discussion forums almost every day. 

I was also turned off to the program by the widely varying quality of instruction. One of my classes' lectures consisted of reading online notes.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Troubleshooting is one thing. Having a PC build community is another. It's bothersome that people can use a website to skip all the process of learning what you are building.


The interest into the technology is less than the interest to buy a part and use it, instead of relying on the PC technology as a source of entertainment. Right now, the subreddit has always been about only helping people to build parts, but to go beyond the newbie level of building your first PC, this subreddit is not there. And PCPartpicker makes this happen even more, because of the lower interaction. PCPartpicker isn't the problem...but I've found there is more fun to be had in a group of people, when each other talks about what they are doing. The reason this subreddit is so maintainable for advice builders is because people see upvotes on a post asking for advice and want to participate. The title doesn't mean much, but it means just enough to teach people about different components. So people read the title and actually click to see the content. The comments never go beyond much about the PC being built. Also, reddit was made about news, but there's never news about hardware....people  have to be presented with something to look at in order to be interested about something new and cool.

People that look at the free stuff on this subreddit, like PCPartpicker, use it, ask a troubleshooting question, and that's it. Troubleshooting doesn't produce the same type of forum as talking about PC building.

I'm not the only one who thinks this way, that doing things differently could be just as fine, as not depending on PCPartpicker, all the time. That doesn't mean we should stop using it. Researching for ourselves could be good too because it's not a perfect system.

Thanks, as that was my goal.



&gt; Many of those costs are fixed costs plus the amount stolen is report at retail price not the raw product cost. 

That is correct, many costs are fixed, but regardless you must factor them in when doing these types of calculations.



&gt; So a $26 26oz Captain Morgan (I think that's what they cost, I never buy it) is reported as a $26 lost when in it costs them much less.

There is the unit cost, but there are also operating costs that must be applied to it. So what the store pays for it is only % of the true costs.

When you lose a $26 dollar item, you not only lose what that item cost you, but you also lose profit you would have made on it and to calculate that, you go with the retail cost of item and work back based on ~% that the store makes per $1.00.

Honestly just threw that together. Keep in mind this is only the tower, and no accessories/peripherals/software. Meaning whatever you pay for Windows, be it from Ebay, some key reseller site, etc will be extra. However, the only thing this build doesn't give you is a boot SSD, which I would definitely recommend (a 120GB would do, its overkill even).

This build will play any game you throw at it on 1080p60.",1483229160

Meaning, TARP is being sold as a ""good"" thing to uncritical viewers of infowars. Meaning, whatever factional conflict there may or may not be it is not based on fundamental disagreements about the central banker command &amp; control of politics and the economy.

I'm less certain many people could attain that, regardless of work ethic.

You keep using these specific examples as if it proves something. I admitted in another post that a small minority of turks are still white, because originally turks were white hundreds of years ago. However today turks are generally not white at all, and as a rule that stands. Generalizations are important. Also that guy you keep talking about is half albanian, like you, so still at least half white for sure. The vast majority of turks are not fucking white, period.

"aww","t5_2qh1o","My god, you just brought back memories, OP! That is such a beautiful little kitten!

My first kitten was a jet black, green eyed little goofball just like that! This was around 17 years ago, when I was 11. He was litter of a feral cat, who was going from place to place carrying her kittens. She chose to rest in the lower compartment of my small closet. We gave the mother some food, and let her have her night there. My mother and sister got a little out of hand, constantly disturbing the cat. And they were telling me to not disturb the cat family.

For some reason, the mother forgot this one guy, and we waited all day, but she never came back. So we adopted him. He used to fit within my two hands and would sleep happily if we put a blanket around him. I would encourage him to climb stairs, because at that age, I thought that if he was not with his siblings and mother, he wouldn't know how to cat (I was not a bright kid). But in a few years, that dude had  penchant for heights, relaxing on the railings of curtains and cupboard tops. Used to wake me up in the morning by licking my nose. I couldn't wait to get home and pet him, after a long day at school. Had him for a few years, till my mother got, well, bored of him, and just gave him away, no matter how much I protested. It was a bit tough, and I still think unfair and irresponsible, how things went.

But the few years I spent with that cat were my happiest. I have been a cat person ever since. I hope I can adopt a cat one day, once I am settled. Have a great time with that precious little furball. You are all the family it has. A perfect start to the new year!",1483229165

The safe spaces that exclude others based on identity are probably gonna fall on the far end.

My personal opinion on board games is this: if you want a game to be a mass market success, you need rules that fit on a box top, sets up in a couple of minutes, cost no more than $25, and plays in about 30-60 minutes.  Our modern games are great, but they aren't for the mass market.",1483229167

I believe that the sarcophagus is the body of the ""master"" and his sentience was moved to the core in the Ice Tower. I believe that his burial room does in some way connect with the Tower as you can see around his sarcophagus area are 5 protruding channels in the ground. The same sorta channel structure is seen when near the end of the game where you climb into the spherical ball towards the core. This could also be how hes giving commands to the Tricos around the Nest through the antenna rooms that The Boy and Trico find themselves in.

I believe his body may be, in a way, chronologically frozen or comatosed while his mind is alive in this entity seen at the core. Im glad to see someone else have this same idea as its sorta a stretch to be true, but still an interesting theory.

http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/8/11/9129063/ronda-rousey-i-can-beat-anyone-in-a-ruleless-fight-including-floyd
- September 2015: I think I can beat every girl in my division with one hand.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGFFPE7K8Dw 
- Miesha Tate (on Ronda Rousey): Before we ever even fought each other, she just kind of came out of the blue and was just started talking trash about me and saying how she was going to slap the title out of my hand. So it was just very disrespectful from the get go and I'd never met her at this point.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RTbNiwPY5E&amp;t=3m25s
- Karo Parisyan: Our guys felt a little hurt from her that she's been a little disrespectful; she thinks she's big. This is what they say and they think, not me – I could care less. It's all good between me and her, but the guys, most of the guys, even (trainer) Gokor (Chivichyan), they're like, all of a sudden she doesn't train with us. She'll come by once a year and she has to get dragged there from her mom, like, ""Oh, just come back and say hi to the guys.""
http://mmajunkie.com/2014/04/karo-parisyan-talks-comeback-hints-at-friction-between-ronda-rousey-and-old-gym
- Dennis Hallman: She came and said, ""Hey Jamie, I'm really pissed off I brought some of the best coaches in the world here to this show (The Ultimate Fighter), and they're supposed to get paid. Here's three weeks later, and they haven't been paid."" That's a legit argument, and Jamie from the UFC, very respectful, and she said, ""Oh my gosh, Ronda. I'm so sorry; it will be taken care of very soon."" Before she could finish her sentence, Ronda interrupted her and said, ""You shut your mouth when I'm talking to you. You don't open your mouth. When I speak to you, you sit there and listen and shut your mouth."" She said that to the producer. For what reason? Nobody really knows because she truly has mental health issues.

- Jimmy Pedro: They did a big to-do for her. They rolled out the red carpet, had a big press thing for her. It was very important to the Japanese that they had an American coming to live and train with them for a year. After four days, she decided this isn't for me. Rather than talk to the Japanese, politely ask for her way out of it, she just packed her bags and left. The Japanese were very upset. That's not their culture. They don't understand an American just taking off. That's just not protocol. They shunned the rest of our team and ignored our team. They (the other U.S. judokas) were there for another six weeks. They didn't give them any rides, didn't pay attention to them. They were really pissed off.
http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2015/04/02/kayla-harrison-mma-ronda-rousey-judo-olympics/
- Rhadi Ferguson: We had a training session where we were rolling around on the mat with just newaza. I was a black belt at the time in jiu-jitsu. Ronda began to cry. I said, ""What are you crying about?"" She said, ""I can't do anything."" I said, ""Ronda, I'm 100 kg (220 lbs) male."" She said, ""Yeah, but I don't feel like you're supposed to beat me.""
http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/8/9/9120037/technique-talk-rhadi-ferguson-and-understanding-ronda-rouseys-reign
- Brendan Schaub: She needs a guy who's gonna take a backseat. That's not me. She also needs a guy that's gonna say ""yes ma'am, yes ma'am"". She's so successful, she's surrounded by people that worship her and go ""yes, yes, that's a great idea"". But when I said ""I don't think that's a good idea,"" now I'm a hater.
http://www.mmamania.com/2015/8/10/9126189/ufc-brendan-schaub-im-too-much-man-for-ronda-rousey-mma
- Ronda's ex-manager: She believed she was as special as the press made her out to be. They give me absolutely no credit for the success of her career. She's not a good person. You don't forget where you came from. In a sense it was poetic justice because she's wronged so many people that were there for her at the beginning of her career.

I think killing the coil is your go to weak spot.

You could do a battery kill switch and install a small battery for keeping the radio alive. Mercedes uses a second battery to power the comfort electronics in their cars. EDIT: You would need to isolate this battery from the main B+ -&gt; Gnd circuit.

Yes I have lived in America lol and in the south, you should've been at the SC state house when the KKK and black panthers showed up to protest the confederate flag! I was there, definitely didn't feel safe after watching a few fights break out and steel getting pulled. 

&gt;as long as you do not just go up to a random person and start bothering them about it


Yeah that's what I'm talking about, how else are you supposed to protest? Just bitch on the internet about it where you know people can't hurt you? Shocks me that people are afraid to protest this election but the WBC goes un fucked with most the time. I only ever hear about the crazies doing the ""in your face"" type of protesting

Hmm.... examples of lacks of freedom...

I'm not from America and my home is much much less ""free"" than America, and this might play into why I'm more anxious about speaking out in front of average people because even in Cape Town which many of you think is nice, you can still get shot or stabbed in broad daylight on the street for something so insignificant like that. Really makes you appreciate the police work and forensics teams in America despite how underpaid they are. I love America and I love the freedoms it offers which are far greater than many other countries, but I'm not gonna get on reddit and say that America is some last bastion of freedom on the planet having witnessed the past five years here firsthand. Let me start with some examples that aren't EXACTLY restrictions on your freedom, but it would still be a bad idea to do these things in America - being Middle Eastern in airports, being Middle Eastern in shopping centers.... etc... being black in jewelry stores (Vic Mensa), being black and driving, being black in the south, being black and dating a white person, actually just being and race and dating another race, being the only white in the hood (sophomore year of college I moved to a really shit neighborhood, next to Gonzales Gardens (the projects of the town I went to school in) and was constantly harassed, people would try and steal from us until we started sitting out front with guns (reminds me of back home!)... crazy man..), being white in an inner city school... There's a short list of places and things you probably shouldn't do in America if you value your time and freedom. 

Anyway, for the TRUE lacks of freedom - entrepreneurship with no investors and little starting capital (""oh but if your ideas good you'll get investors"" actually conflicted on this having worked for a startup that received a ton of investment money but ultimately failed when the investors sacked the founder/CEO and his spiteful ass got buried/destroyed the company in lawsuits since everything was in his name), careers if you don't go to college, drinking age (minor (get it) but still kinda BS), things that are legal 10 miles away but illegal where you currently are (I can't buy beer on Sundays but I can drive 10 mins across the state border and get it, so what's the point of the law?), being homeless in some cities, not personally experienced with this but I hear a lot of veterans on reddit and at work and school complaining about the VA (to me this is unforgivable because of how much the US loves and values their military, I guess that only applies when they're active).

Here's my personal anecdote in starting businesses. Not sure how familiar you are with this sort of thing, but in my four years of college I thought myself to be a real entrepreneur, until I saw some of the BS regulations that are now the norm in sustaining monopolies and making it nearly impossible for new entrepreneurs to get their small businesses going. For example, I wanted to start selling quesadillas for a dollar downtown by the bars right where I go to college. Seemed easy enough and I had a couple grand saved up in case I needed to buy a more serious push cart. So I get my buddies who are interested in this endeavor together and we look up our states regulations and such for operating a mobile push cart. 

First of all, you have to have a licensed commissary (restaurant) to sign you off and I think (?) let you use their kitchen, but I'm not sure if you actually do have to use their kitchen or how you'd even get checked for that. So you gotta know someone who's rich enough to own a restaurant close to downtown give you permission to use their kitchen. Thankfully, we figured out a loophole in that bars in our state have to be registered as restaurants and serve food in order to stay open past midnight so we got a local bar that had a nonexistent kitchen to sign us off, and it worked. Next step was that we needed a mobile push cart to serve the food in, only we weren't allowed to do any cooking on the push cart (every street food vendor cooks on their carts idk how exactly they got around this one), had to have a hand wash station with at least 10 gallons of water connected (none of the other push carts had these save for a couple fellow college students carts), had to meet certain sanitation requirements (thank god, not complaining bout this one lol), and we had to conform to certain regulations as to when and where we could deploy (it's all public property but w/e). We gave up after making it halfway through the process because we

I'd say focus on stats CS and math but my knowledge is limited about those classes so hopefully someone can fill in the blanks. 

CS 125- the work load can depend on how much prior experience you have programming. The workload is not bad at all but just know that you're taking it with CS majors so it will be very competitive. Learn a bit of Java beforehand and you will be Gucci. 

Math 241- I really enjoyed math and this class led me to take calc 3 part 2 the semester after. Khan academy will be your best friend since the profs are most likely foreign and/or pretty bad. I thought the class was very straight forward...I never showed up to a day and still pulled an A by just using khan academy and online resources to do the HW but most kids I knew struggled because they didn't keep up.

&gt;I am not spreading it...just making an opinionated comment.

Which happens to be FUD. 

&gt; Before airbags they attempted car seats that would swivel in a crash. 


What's your point?

Stay on topic please. 


&gt; There will be driverless trucks...millions of them... and they will get public backlash for being unsafe.  That will happen.  

Based on what evidence exactly? You say it _will_ happen, and such grand claim requires grand evidence. 

Research shows in general a favorable view of the technology as primitive as it is. 

https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/108384

&gt;What happens next determines how, when, and where they are used.


You don't get it, they are already being used. Use is just going going to increase. 

There are already real world trials in trucking and taxies, were not far from big city roll outs for an automated Uber or before Walmart starts using automated trucks for distribution centers. 

&gt;  The difference is automatic breaking will save lives in a truck driven by a driver and driver-less trucks...so the breaking system will not be the determining factor.  What will be the determining factor is when and how often driver less trucks kill people.  It does not matter if they are safer overall...what matters is how expensive is the litigation and who can push laws through against them.

http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/googles-self-driving-car-is-ridiculously-safe

The real difference is that mile for mile there will be less accidents with computer controlled vehicles than human drivers. This is a statistical fact. One that drives the cost of insurance as well as laws in the not too distant future. 

There won't be a wave of lawsuits or huge public backlash. That's your baseless paranoia talking. ",1483229179

Very timely, another user [posted a thread ranking the SAT math books](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sat/comments/5lcef1/ranking_the_math_workbooks/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=Sat). You should check that out if it relates.

But I will still review what you got:

Never heard of Applerouth's guide so don't know what to say about it. Unfortunately, there are no reviews on Amazon for it either.

Princeton Review is overall a good bang for the buck. Will say though it's not enough alone. Some problems might seem *slightly* easier than the real SAT. But still, it's a good guide to work with as it contains many tips/advice and detailed explanations.

Don't have PWN. Heard it's great though.

Barron's is okay but a lot of problems on there are so much harder than the real SAT. I don't have that book specifically but I do recall a lot of Barron's books has many errors and incomplete explanations. 

Of course, College Panda is the #1 book I've seen everywhere. Just outstanding how much content is effective and pumped into that book.

Continue to use Khan Academy daily.

It was quite hard for me to use at first and I felt like it just didn't have the utility other troops had. I rejected the notion of immobile troops like infantry from the very start.

But when you just don't have that daka daka - its quite apparent. As joinrbs said, its nothing to trifle with. It takes some work to support an infantry, like all the things you said, but man infantry can go off damn well with some help

Shoutout to Ucross rebalance - I needed to have like 10 infantry because I don't have enough firepower. pretty cool stuff

"ynab","t5_2vqaa","It's not the end of the world, but you should do everything you can to avoid it.

The YNAB way is to give all the dollars in your possession a job, no more, no less. If you're not giving dollars a job, you become more prone to spend them on ""whatever"". If you're trying to assign dollars you don't have...well, where is that money coming from?

You will need to budget less in some other category to bring your TBB back to $0. This might mean budgeting less to ""Savings"", but that's the reality of it - you don't currently physically have the money available to save, so you shouldn't be trying to save it. When TBB is negative you're essentially trying to Save money from a paycheck you haven't earned yet.

Once you start using YNAB more and following your category balances, you'll find that it's easier to spend less. If you've got $10 left in your ""Fast Food"" budget and a week left in the month, you'll have to decide if today is the day you really want/need to go out, or if you can skip it today to give yourself the freedom to go out later. I think this is so much more powerful than looking at a few lump sum account balances and trying to go from there (like you have mentioned). You've planned some amount of your lump sum for Fast Food, and now you're deciding if that's enough/where else you can cut back to make it enough.

If you ultimately decide to go out twice, you'll be overspent by $10, and that's something you'll have to fix by moving money out of another category. Sometimes there are easy ones (like Entertainment or Bars) that you can pull from. Other times you'll have to make tougher decisions like taking away from your Savings or Car - but that's the reality of it - you didn't have the money to go out, but you did anyway, so now you're further away from what you want.

That's the point of YNAB - it puts you into the habit of tracking every purchase you make and owning all your spending decisions.

A very important point to make is that this doesn't mean that you *can't* go out anymore, you just have to own that decision and look at where that money will come from. I've made lots of ""go out anyway"" calls since starting YNAB (I probably do it every other week), but I consciously knew what I was doing and made that call because it was worth it given what's going on in life (maybe friends are in town, maybe it's been a really bad week)

So to answer your question, it's ""okay"", but you shouldn't do it. Own your finances, own your decisions, and act on what you see. If you're overspent this month, solve that problem now (budget less towards savings), don't push that problem onto future you. If you cut back your spending just a little next month, you can push that extra money right back into Savings. ",1483229182

From F12 - F6, when it was silver veto rules, only once did a nominee actually win the veto, Amy at F6. It's why they eventually changed it to only 6 players competing in BB5, so the veto would be more likely to be used.

Probably half the reason they do it, because to them it's silly that people would get so bashful around a topless woman. 

I think you might be viewing this through a similar western lens. That because they're women and topless that the only logical answer must be that they're being exploited. ",1483229186

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt; BPD normally cannot be effectively treated with medication, but maybe you're a rare exception. Maybe you've been misdiagnosed, or maybe you're a unicorn

No, I'm not an exception.  Medication can and does effectively treat the symptoms associated with BPD.

&gt; Not a single fucking word coming out of your mouth should be believed

It doesn't matter whether you think I can be believed or not. There is plenty of published scientific research confirming this.

Refer to the following: 
(source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18601305)

""**In conclusion, a large number of different drugs have been evaluated in the treatment of patients with borderline personality disorder. Initial findings are encouraging for many of these drugs.**""

Also (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18304647) 
""A growing body of data suggests that **there are psychotropic agents which appear to be well tolerated, and which to varying degrees may be expected to ameliorate the domains of psychopathology associated with borderline personality disorder.** ""

Also (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15142476)

""To date, there is at least some **evidence-based support for the use of antipsychotics (conventional and atypical), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of borderline personality disorder.**""

Also (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21728970)
""This article reviews double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing active drugs versus placebo and drugs versus drugs, published between 1990 and 2010 and focused on the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Different classes of psychoactive agents, such as antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and dietary supplementation were tested in BPD patients. **More recent evidences suggest that mood stabilizers (topiramate, valproate and lamotrigine), second generation antipsychotics (olanzapine and aripiprazole) and omega-3 fatty acids can be useful to treat affective symptoms and impulsive-behavioural dyscontrol in BPD patients. Moreover, antipsychotics significantly improve cognitive symptoms in patients with BPD. SSRIs were found effective in decreasing severity of depressed mood, anxiety and anger, mainly in subjects with a concomitant affective disorder.**""

Also (source https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18286399) ""Borderline personality disorder is a disorder with important social and clinical repercussions, which has been treated mainly by psychotherapy. **In recent years, the syndromic analysis of this disorder has allowed us to identify different symptoms capable of being improved with psychopharmacology treatment.**""

Also (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10729938)
""Pharmacotherapy for patients with borderline personality disorder is directed against the psychobiology of cognitive-perceptual, affective, and impulsive-behavioral symptoms. A symptom-specific method using current empiric evidence for drug efficacy in each symptom domain is proposed. **Drugs in each medication class have some potential utility against specific symptoms in patients with borderline personality disorder.**""

You can earn new white weapons (or green after level 32) by levelling up, but the main way to get weapons is to get them to drop in missions. Your drop is unrelated to the hero you play. Playing a character doesn't make you more likely to get loot for them.

However, you can boost the likelihood of getting weapons for a particular hero. To make weapons more likely to drop for a given character, you can equip a loot trinket (you will have 5 of those in your inventory, most likely, one for each character).

EDIT: A list of which weapons go to which character.

If not in meta at the very least relevant. I think to many ADC's right now are just in general in need of tweaking. 

There have been several posts about itemization. But I don't know if that will fix every problem. Kogmaw is pretty weak and what they did to Corki was pretty meh. 

What do you lean more towards? Fixing this with items or balance of numbers? Lucian has gotten shafted both ways as have other adc's.",1483229190

Hence why the prologue was structured like Sly 4's with each character getting a short gameplay sequence. Obviously for an actual game Bentley would be calling out the buttons, but that didn't make sense for a story. 

As for the new storyline for the game, I tried to keep Murray's food talk to a minimum, give Sly and actually valid reason to leave, and I know I had story arcs for every character planned out to stretch the whole game. I'll have to remember Panda King and the Guru's, but this little bit I've written pretty much foreshadows the others.

He'd treat her like garbage in general, and assign her jobs that did not line up with her job description. One day they had an inspection so as a cashier he had her scrub the entire lobby floor on her hands and knees.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","He was really shitty towards me both leading up to, and during the actual breakup. He wouldn't really talk to me. I drove him to the bank so he could cash his check from work. I offered to go and pick up a birthday present for his sister with him. I got out of going into work that day because I could sense something was wrong, and tried desperately to save our relationship and fix whatever was wrong. He wound up telling me that he didn't love me anymore, and made it seem like he regretted ever meeting me. He told me he didn't ever want to come and visit me because I slept on a couch (my family/living situation wasn't all that great at the time, but still that's not my fault). As if all of that weren't bad enough, I barely had enough gas to get home. I had to stop at a gas station about a mile from his house and fill up with the last bit of money I had, after spending ~$23 in tolls to get to him. My eyes were so swollen from crying that I had to just keep on looking down to avoid anyone seeing me, and asking if I was okay. Then, to make matters worse, I got stuck in traffic and it took me 4 hours to get home (practically running on empty again at that point). I didn't recognize him. In those few short hours, he had become a totally different person. If I had known he could be so cold and distant, I would have never dated him to begin with. 

From what I know of, he seems pretty dam happy with himself and it sucks. He's getting laid, going out and partying, etc. It seems like life's been pretty good to him. Meanwhile I'm miserable, feel worthless, replaceable and cry every other day. It's amazing how much of an affect one person can have on another. I wish he knew how bad he made me feel. I wish he would realize how much of an ass he is, and how wrong he was to end what we had together. I wish he wanted to take it all back if he could. I wish and I wish, but I don't think he'll ever feel regret and sadness the way I do. ",1483229194

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","Outline, outline, outline. For the love of all things holy and good, outline. Many new/young writers lose steam half or even a quarter way through their projects as not only do they not know the ending of their story, they don't even know the ending of their first *act*. 

Whether you use Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet, Dan Harmon's Story Circle or some other structuring methodology, outline your scenes- even with just a bullet point. Yes, it will change; yes, you will fuck it up. But for those moments where you feel lost, blocked or tapped out, a quick glance at your outline will put you back on track. You'll remember what that scene you really wanted to write was, and from there you'll have a new passion for the next scene, and the next, and the...

Also- and Max touches on this with his mention of an idea you are ""excited"" about- I tend to roughly outline my set piece scenes first before delving into a story's connective tissue. Keep in mind that set pieces aren't solely reserved for popcorn flicks and tentpole movies; rather, those set piece scenes should fully exploit the promise of your premise. Set piece scenes should be the ones that excite you and thus your audience the most, and knowing what they are and when they'll happen will keep you motivated.

However, do I jump right into writing those scenes first? Hell no. They're my reward for doing all of the other not-so-fun stuff. Think about building a house; you might want to install that balling theater room right away, but first you need to actually lay a foundation and put the walls up. I've found it extremely helpful to treat set piece scenes as a reward; the idea that in ten pages/three scenes/etc. you will get to write that big, sexy car chase or whatever will keep you going.

Lastly, it goes without saying that writing more makes writing more easier. Like a weight lifter, you need to grow your tolerance for sitting down and cranking out X number pages in an hour, day and week. Don't be discouraged that you only one wrote one page today; if you keep with it, you'll eventually be able to write more and more. The trick- again, like weight lifting- is to add resistance as it becomes easier. Once one page is easy, do two, etc.. Keep doing that, and you'll be capable of regularly producing pages- a vital skill for anyone who wants to succeed.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Just for perspective, and perhaps insight into the farmer's mindset:

These guys work like dogs.  Try it sometime.  And after a year of varied hard work, work that doesn't always produce results, the farmer can easily not have earned enough money to pay the bank for the various loans they need to keep their small family buisness afloat.  The bank loan on the land, the combine, the two trucks.  God forbid any of the myriad of other vehicles (tractors large and small, spreader, produce lift truck, etc.) needs major work or replacement.  

If you compare the work they do everyday, in a economic sector the country certainly cannot do without, then yes, you can see where the American farmer might get a bit titchy about bail-outs and welfare.  Bail outs to the same banks that have these farmers livelihoods in their hands like feudal lords just missing the right of prima nocta.

They can understand a guy that owes money to every bank on the planet, has (very expensive) property in his name, yet still on the verge of bankruptcy after a few bad years.  Has *had* those few bad years, and has persevered and kept on going... because that's what a farmer (and their neighbors) have had to do too.

I'm not excusing the lack of foresight in supporting a bigoted, megalomaniac, toddler.  A man that gets in bed with racists and fascists just so he can get his name on a library too.  But, the perspective of the farmer should not be discounted as ignorant or hypocritical.",1483229199

As in, is there a treatment? Would that mean you stopped looking for other causes of miscarriage? Etc. 

There is pretty weak data supporting MTHFR causing real health problems in isolation, and the common opinion in the genetics community is that it's something with little to no evidence that people have latched on too. Having said that, my specific specialization in not in this area of genetics, so I'm not super up to date on it. That's why I say ask your doctor what they think and what the latest data says. There could be stuff out there I'm not familiar with. I just did a quick search in the literature and saw some studies that showed very little association with miscarriage, but again, it was quick and it's not exactly my area. 

My concern is just always that if you do the test, and you find something, but there is not clear evidence, then what do you do? Do you stop looking for the cause and potentially miss something that is clear and actionable? Or does it hang over your head like a big question mark? You're kind of stuck.

You are his wife, he loves you, the ladies at the strip club are not trying to take your man.  It's jsut entertainment and silly.   Look at all the ta-tas!    Like others have said, they are professionals and this is a safe setting to just enjoy a night out.

&gt; Russia, China and Pakistan have agreed to work together to get Afghan Taliban individuals delisted from the UN sanctions list.

&gt; &amp;quot;No source except the Afghan government is authorized to ask for the removal or inclusion of names of Afghan nationals to the UN sanctions list and this is also applied to the Taliban,&amp;quot; said Ahmad Shekib Mustaghni, MoFA spokesman.

&gt; &amp;quot;The big part of this that concerns us is the public engagements that the Russians had with the Taliban because it does provide legitimacy to the Taliban and our very strong view is that the entire region and all efforts need to be focused on supporting the government of Afghanistan, again this is the government chosen by the people of Afghanistan leading the country of Afghanistan and they will be the ones that have got to come up with appropriate solutions,&amp;quot; NATO spokesman in Afghanistan Charles T. Cleveland said.

For instance, the term ""wygnz"" (yes, spelled *that way*) has a specific legal definition in the US and you can be fined for failing to use it properly. If your meat product is less than ~90% meat, it has to be labelled differently, which is why Taco Bell's meat filling is labelled differently from, say, ground beef (the rest is spices and other ingredients - nothing nefarious, but they can't claim it is ground beef).

[The FDA has a full page-long definition of what constitutes Mayonnaise;](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=169.140) if your product does not fit that pretty exacting definition, even if it is very close, it can't be called mayonnaise.

I'd strongly recommend against going the LCD route. MVS games look especially good on a tube, and dropping an LCD into a dedicated MVS will severely hurt the value of the machine.

With that, it sets an extremely high quality bar for a live-action remake.  This link is specifically featuring Watson's voice, which a lot of people just think isn't very good for a movie of this caliber.  

It's nothing against Watson, in my opinion, as singing seems to require some natural talent and there's also a lot of her peers that have been singing professional their whole career.  It's not something most actors can just pick up after a few months practice.  Paige from the original Beauty and the Beast was a Broadway singer before she did Belle so her singing career was already well established.

**[ON] lightly bumped pedestrian in parking lot did not exchange info.**
&gt;i lighly bumped a pedestrian while reversing into a spot. she did remained standing. i got out and asked if she was ok. she said i lightly tapped her and i was going very slow and that she was okay with no injuries. they had a family member witness. i should have gotten a written statement saying that she would not pursue claims against me and exchanged info. but i didn't. i left to go return something. they didn't stop me from leaving. i was not able to stop them from leaving when i remembered and ran back to the spot.  i do not want my insurance premiums to go up and therefore would not like to report it to my insurance.

"nvidia","t5_2rlgy","&gt; &gt; I'm also curious to know what happened to Compute Capability 4 8-D.

&gt; What would you like to know about it, specifically?

What happened to it. They went from Kepler (CC 3.x) to Maxwell (CC 5.x). I wonder why the skipped CC 4.x. Is there a technical reason for it (for example, they started working on an architecture before realizing it was a dead end), or is for non-technical reasons (for example, 4 is considered unlucky in a lot of Asian cultures, so they skipped it for the same reason that the 13 is skipped in the US?)

&gt; Err... is the support for the API you're looking for not at https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl ? 

Not really. They used to have support for OpenCL in the visual profiler, but it got removed. Then it was still possible to get profiling information from the command line setting some environment variable, and this possibility was removed with the more recent drivers (the ones that enable CUDA 8 support). So now it's completely impossible to get detailed profiling information for OpenCL kernels on NVIDIA 8-/

&gt; It's something I feel from a security perspective would be particularly useful, but I understand it may impact revenues for them. Not to make an excuse, but I can see where hesitation might exist on the NVIDIA side.

Unless they're still doing some nasty stuff such as disabling specific features in software rather than in hardware for the lower-end cards, I don't see why a stronger contribution to open source would impact their revenue. I think that the solution found by AMD, with the FLOSS and proprietary driver sharing much of the code, is a win-win solution, as it allows both proper FLOSS hardware support and an edge on the proprietary side as needed.

&gt; Can I ask exactly what it is you're doing? Sounds similar to some aspects of DL/ML optimization? (ELI5, please).

We are doing a lot of stuff, actually. The biggest code, as I mentioned, is for CFD (computational fluid dynamics), using particle methods. We also have another CFD code using finite volumes instead. On top of that, we do some image processing to identify the evolution of some natural phenomena. So far we have developed algorithms in a more traditional sense, but for some of the upcoming applications we'll be looking at machine learning as well.

In all of this, the code most affected by the rapidly changing NVIDIA architectures is the particle method one. It's the largest, most complex, and most computationally intensive code we have, so even a few percent performance difference counts.",1483229225
"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","A lot of stores that have ""dollar"" in their name, i.e. Dollar General, Family Dollar, etc., have switched to various price points (or, never did $1 only in the first case).

Around  here, at least, Dollar Tree does offer most items for $1, but a few items are less.  I think cards are 2 for a $1, and I've seen candy bars for I think 89 cents.  Other things, too, I've seen like baking soda for 50 cents, canned veggies for 79 cents, and so on.  But I'd say 99% of DT's items are exactly $1.

My question was on stores like Dollar Tree, etc, that do advertise as $1 only.  I can't imagine that type of business model can last indefinitely.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's likely more ""tax fraud"" than ""wage theft"". Tax fraud is an actual law with teeth. ""Wage theft"", not so much. 
Exactly how is the revenue collected and reported? Paycheck garnish? Oh boy do we have fun with that, since the evidence is in hardcopy on an easily established document. Post tax or pre tax? Very important implications there. 
Or do they just take it from the tips? This can be sticky, because who reports it as revenue? Does the business take it for the tip pool, cheating everyone, or are tips sorted, recorded and paid out and then garnished? Does the employee still have the tax liability for the tips he or she wasn't paid? Or does the employer demand payment after all this is settled? That document (probably) doesn't give them an enforceable right to demand payment. So they get payment anyway, do they account as revenue? 
Yeah, I have a whole lot of questions about this if I'm an investor in the business. And there really aren't any answers to these questions that would encourage my continued investment. The employee is on his own though. If this is the only job in town, you need a new town, or you need to recognize the opportunity for starting a competing shop without batshit crazy management policies. But do NOT work for this place.

Nearly every city state in the region is better supplied, positioned and armed. These guys have a small population, poor farming land, no real natural resources to draw on and no diplomatic ties to anyone. There is one mine that occasionally produces low-demand semi precious stones.

The only reason it still has it's independence is because neither empire is willing to take the diplomatic punch it would come with if they took it by force. Both sides would say the same thing: ""Your expanding your borders illegally!"" and would use it as a propaganda tool.

Their 'Kings' are a line of incestuous megalomaniacs that insist they descend from the ancient 'true kings' of the lands.

They eek out a living on the harsh lands, but barely produce enough to feed themselves, let alone a real government.

Even the city's castle is a dilapidated mess. It was left there, long ago, by mountain gnolls. Set there as a hunting lodge, and later abandoned for a better one.

"blackdesertonline","t5_2w6ir","Zerkers have amazing 1v1 crowd control (they have a lot of grabs, think John Cena) and also a very powerful black spirit ability that allows them to stun everyone around them for about 3 seconds. They have 3 abilities that can almost full heal them, one of the abilities is the black spirit one I was just talking about. Basically every minute if you ration out your 3 abilities you can full heal yourself. They also have really good mobility and AoE debuffs. 

You're not gonna top kill charts but you have the ability to singlehandedly carry a fight if you use your abilities right. 

Warriors are very good. Basically can't be CC'd unless you screw up with the amount of super armor they have. Also extremely mobile. They do tons of damage as well, you can top charts ezpz as a warrior. That said, it's ez to play. A lot of people get bored as warrior. 

Valk (my first love, but ex) struggles quite a bit. They have a spammable heal (every 8 seconds) they can use on allies and a 40 second AoE heal for everyone. They have an ability that's kind of like a vacuum, you can group up enemies to make it easier to kill them. Valks have a huge problem though, their speed. It's the slowest class movement-wise and also their animations are comparably slow to other classes. They have longer combos to do the same amount of damage as other classes. In this game speed is almost everything, when living/ dying is about who can pull the trigger faster being a slow class can be very discouraging. That said, it's a fun class and may get buffed in the future, but I doubt it. Valk is considered the one ""balanced"" class in this unbalanced game with real strengths and weaknesses.

Get an attorney representing you to hopefully prevent this from occurring. Often they can work out some sort of diversion plea for you. This is not something you could DIY. A lawyer needs to do this for you. You should **NOT** speak to anyone about this, especially the prosecuting attorney. Are you or are you not going to tell your parents that you need a lawyer?

# AWS Glaciar
This doesn't seem to count getting the data out from AWS itself, which via ""Data Transfer OUT From Amazon Glacier To Internet"" seems to cost a blistering nine cents a GB.

So if you have 2 TB of data on Glaciar then you are paying:

* $0.0025/GB * 2,048 = $4.096 a month for storing the data

And when you want to recover:

* $0.0025/GB * 2048 = $5.12 for getting the data out of Glaciar and into the Amazon ecosystem
* $0.09/GB * 2048 = $184 for getting data out of AWS and to you

So for 2TB via Glaciar, it costs $4.10 a month to hold the data, and $189.12 to get the data out of Amazon and to me. Assuming I will need to get the data out of Glaciar once every 3 years, that means it costs me monthly $5.25 + $4.10 or $9.35 a month.

But, nothing else seems to come close for 2 TB a month for sub $10 when taking into account bandwidth other than services like backblaze or crashplan.

Sadly though, Backblaze and Crashplan seem to still lack proper one way sync tools. 

# Backblaze B2
Backblaze does have [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html) though which seems like it should be price competitive.

- 2048 * $0.005 = $10.24 a month
- 2048 * $0.05 = $102.40 for recovery of that data
- Assuming a recovery every 3 years, that's $10.24 + $2.84 or $13.08 a month

# Google Nearline

I ask nicely to stop doing it. If it does not stop (both times it did not) I simply wait a few minutes,  leave like I'm going to the bathroom. Go to the concessions counter. Nicely ask them to deal with the issue. Few minutes later they come in and tell them to cut it out if it is still happening. Get to enjoy the rest of my experience.

It's all about the tasks you're given and the man who handles the paychecks. Some tasks have an innate time schedule attached to them; meaning task A WILL take about 8 hours. Many bosses will pay you the full 8 hours regardless of how long you actually spent (be it 6 or 10), so you have the incentive to work quickly.

Ignition Casino also has the casino bonus match. I'd study up on basic blackjack strategy to try to clear it.

I would recommend parking your entire roll in a few mid stakes cash games and play tight, so you'll *only* use your bonus cash and not your actual cash. From what I've heard, you can't just sit-out at a table with your roll and not play as Ignition security will forfeit your casino bonus.

You can bet big in attempts clear it faster, so you won't risk too much playing mid-stakes cash presumably beyond your level. Good luck!",1483229234

The O2 is depleted and the flame is reduced until it goes out, at which point there is no more hot air being created (or converted from cold air I guess), and the remaining air cools and occupies less space than the hot air.",1483229240

&gt; What, you were worried about that?

&gt; ...

&gt; As per the first words of this afterword, I'm sure there will be plenty of readers who will feel it's a bit of an anticlimax and say, ""What? That's it,"" when they find out the cause of Shimako's worries. With all I've written of Shimako's suffering to now, there were some people who imagined she must have been carrying an unthinkable secret.

&gt; However. I don't think the impression of Shimako is an over-exaggeration. The person who's worrying about something can dig themselves into a hole that's far deeper than those around them can imagine. Young people in particular seem to do this. When you're in the middle of it, you get caught up in what's going to happen tomorrow and can't take the long view.

in the Light Novels they play around with it a tiny bit more via at least having a couple characters acknowledge that it seems a little overblown. 

Though if you look at it as the standalone 'pilot' chapter it was, it probably feels rather fitting. It's just that with a season/8 light novels of build up it feels rather insignificant. ",1483229245

UW couldn't put their money where their fans' mouths were. I'm just pointing that out. 

My team finished exactly where our pre-season predictions said we would. UW finished much, much better than theirs. They are the better team, but against Bama, they weren't, and those shitty fans are going to ignore that.

"PlanetDolan","t5_3e5p2","When I was about 7 years old I had a nightmare where me and a couple of people were surviving the zombie apocalypse. We had come across a man in a town I believe to be called little red.(in the dream red was changed to dead). He asked if any of us were infected being casual people we were, we told him the exact truth. He ended up going nuts a few moments  later and locked us in a room full of the undead. Me and my friends were terrified and we fought for our lives, There were so many zombies on the floor to count but me and my friends didn't care because we still heard about 4 zombies still in the cages. When the cages were opened I noticed something strange about the zombies... They looked like my family members. My friends have never met my family so they attacked the four. I watched in horror to see my friends turn into zombies. I was so traumatized that I wouldn't move. There was only one of my friends still alive and he was taken by the strange man into another room and the man said if the fight got to intense I could scream for help and the man would take me out of the room. My sister ended up pinning me to a wall and when I went to shout for help I realized... My voice was gone and I couldn't scream for the man to help me. Just before I was bitten I woke up in my bed to all my family members surrounding me like they saw a ghost. My dad had a baseball bat. I saw tears going down my sisters face and I remembered I had a mirror next to my bed, When I looked at the mirror I couldn't believe what I saw.... I was a zombie. I ended up springing out of my bed and noticed that I had not moved. I ended up realizing it was all a dream so I just stayed up for the rest of the night. To this day every night I go to sleep I think of the horror I had gone through and I always just lay my head down and read a book until I doze off.",1483229249

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; if a few minutes of commercials are enough to keep you away altogether then you can't have enjoyed it that much in the first place. 

I'm old enough to remember when going to a movie was a real event. The theaters themselves were architectural works of art, and there was a 'respect' for the art of the film. Alas, now they are junk food selling operations with arcade games and commercials on the side. The movie itself is little more than an excuse to sell Coke and popcorn, and sell commercials. 

The irony is that the technology of big theatres is better than ever with digital projectors and Dolby sound systems. Nonetheless, to actually get to the movie requires running a gauntlet of the worst of junk product marketing. Movies, in my view, deserve better than the Cineplex experience.

Thankfully, in some smaller towns, mine included, there are indepedent rep theatres that are worth going to for a quality movie experience.

My mom used to bartend while in college in my hometown back in the 70's. She had a regular that was a mean, sleezy, old dude who would come in every other weekend with his disability check and deposit it right into the bar. The kind of dude who would yell, spit on the floor, and catcall and play grabass with the waitresses. 

Anyway, it was the weekend of Christmas and the bar was closing early for the holiday (and the weather, it was December in Minnesota). My mom cut this dude off, and he wasn't happy about it. He began to yell and scream at her from in front of the bar. He got so mad, he took one of his beer bottles and threw it at my mom, narrowly missing her head. Her coworker was about to grab the baseball bat they kept for such occasions but before he had the chance my mom had already leapt over the bar. 

She grabbed the man from behind by his shirt collar and belt and lifted him (she played rugby for years she's built like a linebacker), walked him to the door with him flailing about, and threw him head first onto the sidewalk. Back then they had outdoor speakers that played Christmas music on main street for holiday shoppers, so all those families got front row seats to a 20 something woman throw a 65 year old on his face to the tune of 'Wonderful Christmas Time.'

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","I'm highly doubtful the Switch would be able to run **emulated** Wii VC games up to Nintendo's rigerous standards. As the Wii is a Power architecture based system and the Switch is an Arm based one, either the games would need to be emulated or recompiled. While most Wii games can be emulated on decently powerful PCs nowadays, the Switch is not this. The Switch will simply not be powerful enough. The Wii games on the Wii U were not emulated, they ran directly on the Wii U's hardware, as the Wii U's architecture was a Power based one that was very similar to the Wii's

I was hoping this professor would at least share the opposing view,  which he acknowledged existed.    Disappointingly Not.

The middle period is bracketed by the 6 Patriarchs on the front side and Foyan,  Yuanwu,  Wumen and other Song period characters on the back side.     

The only way McRae and his sycophants can get to their interpretation of the middle period is by accepting Zongmi,  Zanning,  Qisong,  and other Buddhist syncretists version of events.    They base this claim the Song period Chan Orthodoxy,  a Buddhist religious expression that usurped the Tang ""lineages"" to gain official support.    But the tension between Buddhists and zen characters was already present during the period of the 6 patriarchs,  and it was not erased (how inconvenient!) from the zen cases.    And it continued into and through the Song period.

Institutional assimilations are tempting to many,  but they are also resisted by honest critics who are not biased by religious leanings.    Resistance is not futile.    Institutional claims should be questioned.  

How can they claim zen when they virtually ban the zen characters in favor of Buddhist priests?

A lot of people have the idea that it's archaic and barbaric, akin to blood letting and labotomies.    
  
In reality, it is extraordinarily effective for treating a variety of serious mental disorders. The results are often miraculous and life changing, particularly for people who have not responded well to more conventional treatment.   
  
Keep in mind, it's 2016. They're not plugging your head into a wall socket and hoping for the best.   
  
Having said that, the side effects can be quite severe, which is why it is generally the last resort.   
  
But there are a lot of people walking around living their lives, rather than being totally crippled by mental illness, because of it.   
  
Having said that, Pence is advocating that treatment to ""cure"" homosexuality.    
  
There are two major problems with that -  
  
First of all, it fucking horrific. ECT can do a lot of damage.  
  
Second, it doesn't work. It is almost certainly possible to change a person's sexual orientation, but we're not their yet scientifically. So they're braining people's damage for absolutely no reason.    
  
Though I think it will be a great thing for humanity when we figure out how to alter a person's sexual orientation.   
  
Everyone will just pick bisexuality, for obvious reasons.

Not according to this.

&gt;It's generally a myth that retailers must honor a posted price if it's simply a mistake, although some stores might do so as a matter of policy or on a case-by-case basis. The issue gets murky if the retailer begins processing the order, something that is more likely to happen online, says Jane Winn, a professor at the University of Washington Law School. But even then, she says, a merchant might be able to cancel the purchase if the price was so low that a buyer should have known it was mistake. An online retailer's fine print may relieve it of the duty to fulfill orders based on pricing errors.


My experience with Best Buy coincides with this website.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","&gt; There are two data points in this particular model. Do you even know what overfitting is? 

I was responding to your more general claim that ""They are not bad models until they no longer fit data."" I don't agree with that, but admittedly, it's a matter of perspective. From a statistical point of view, you would need a test set (ideally), but there's a reason statisticians don't just take a set of n points and fit an n+1 degree polynomial. There can still be reasons to believe a model is bad a priori. 

&gt; If you did, you would know that you that it uses more data points than necessary to make a model.

This is not necessarily right. If you have a data set, and you believe that all the data is usable, then you should use all your data (or am I misunderstanding you?). But a developed model might be overfit none-the-less, for example, you have n-points and you just fit an n+1 degree polynomial even though the actual model is linear + gaussian noise. That's overfit, and it's due to the model having too many parameters, not the data. 

&gt; And the funny thing is, you generally can't be certain that any given model is overfitted UNTIL YOU COLLECT MORE DATA and demonstrate that.

Yes, you can't be certain. 

In any event, to get more back on topic, I'm not much of a fan of Carlsen. I think he's a bad sport and not entertaining (as a person) and that makes me not like him much as a player. With that being said, I'm uneasy about simply giving the Champion the win in the event of a draw, and I think rapid chess retains enough semblance of classical chess that it is a reasonable criteria to determine tie breaks.

Reading is an educative but also fulfilling hobby to have. I believe its rudimentary to a person to read if they want to better themselves. I'm not saying there' a right way to read or only one reason to but there are numerous benefits for it.

Unfortunately, I myself have recently fallen into a little bit of a slump where I had forgotten the reason I started reading in the first place and have gotten to the point that it feels as though I am digesting tons of stories and experiences, through movies and books and video and comics and any possible storytelling medium that it feels like I'm on a checklist.

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","The comments will ignore the fact that Tyro is, by and large, leagues above his Core brethren... and even more so when you fully dive him.

* Gladiator is your tankiest Core, by far. He'll sport over 4k HP when he hits 80. Caster Cores can't even break 3k at this point... and many physicals only go above this. He's also decently versatile on account that he sports Celerity and Combat. Celerity means he can Wind Slash and Tempo Flurry, useful for Ranged Wind fights, as well as Advantaliate strategies.

* While the Knight is still comically weak due to his lack of MC1 access... he still has some use with Draw Fire and Lure Magic. Pair him with solid Synergy gear, and either the +800 HP accessories or a Major Element Resist and watch him eat a surprising amount of punishment. That said, usually he's sitting in the back row and defending when not casting Lures or Memento of Protection. (Yes, spamming that spell is a thing when you don't have Sentinel Grimoire... either by luck or by choice of omitting Tyro from runs.)

* Devout is fantastic for her access to Curada. This spell, even at R1, can be super useful... Grant 4 Cores what's almost assuredly a full heal AND then a 2k Shield. In some cases, the Curada shield is almost DOUBLING Core health... like for the Black Mage or Knight. There's also an upcoming heal that provides Curaga+Esuna... and with White Mage lacking this... Devout can get mileage for Debuff heavy fights.

* Magus and Black Mage can go toe-to-toe in many bouts. Magus having access to 5\* and 6\* Black gives him a good advantage far more often for general use... but BM's Magic Signet SB grants him a sizeable +50% to Magic, a self-buff that is yet unmatched by other Faith/Faithga combos. If you RW a BSB, chances are the Black Mage can overtake Magus.

* Dark Knight is a Physical DPS powerhouse thanks to Dark Bargain, and the recent Death Throes. If you are intending on using a Physical BSB, you can have Tyro Draw Fire, Steal Power call the BSB... and likewise have DK use his two Bargain/Doom spells and bam... he's keeping up with Tyro in the damage department. The main con is of course being front row and super squishy. Better have Draw Fire on someone, or ensure he can't be hit by melee.

* Mystic Knight's occasionally useful for his default +Res SB... he's a hard fit though given he *only* knows how to use Spellblades. Bah.

* Thief works as an alternative Power/Armor Breakdown thanks to Steal Power and Armor. Useful for when Tyro and Bard need to carry other stuff.

From my experience... if you are a Day One player... it's entirely feasible to get all bouts up to ++ done without Tyro, No Gacha, and Core Only up to ++ reliably, at this point. +++ is usually also feasible. The only time the two might have exceptions would be for bouts where the bosses have persistent NAT Long Range Physicals, or the AoE spam is too frequent for a Medica off both Devout/White Mage.",1483229269

"anime","t5_2qh22","I have two recommendations for world building anime that I both rated as 10/10. Hopefully you'll like them as well:

[Mushishi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi)

What I like about this show is that it's episodic in its story telling. Each episode is a short story. You don't necessarily have to watch it in order to understand. 

The story follows a traveller named Ginko. He goes from village to village helping the people out with problems due to mushi. Mushi are invisible creatures to most people, kind of like weird ghosts that live in nature along plants and animals. Some of the different species of mushi can inadvertently affect humans as they live.

The setting is pretty beautiful. Mountains, oceans, rivers, islands, etc. Each story adds a little more background about the world they live in and how mushi interacts with other beings. Overall great storytelling. 

---
[Seirei No Moribito](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1827/Seirei_no_Moribito)

Great story and world building for this show. Decent fight scenes and good character development. It follows a woman, Balsa, as she is tasked to protect a prince from assassins. Then the story evolves into an adventure. Don't want to give anything away, but it's very good. ",1483229272

You may think that the wooden desk prevents this, but shocks are quite high voltage, and wood is not that great of an insulator at high voltage, it can easily get to the 5V level to disrupt the mouse.

I think Unlike the other books, GoF pushes hard on the idea of ""Harry Potter, the Boy Who Survived being more Heroic and more Heroic than ever."" I think the plot never gave exactly a consistent reason why Harry had to compete with the other champions in the first place. ""The Goblet of Fire has spat your Name, Harry, and you have to compete!"" It's a bit forced, if we stop to think. After all, Harry's case was a special exception, and no exceptions could be made?

Cancer requires that a cell be suitably damaged in such a way that it divides endlessly, and it turns out many substances can inflict the sort of cellular harm that can lead to cancer behavior. Remember, it just takes one fluke, and you have a whole lot of cells that are constantly fighting to stay alive. Even the sun causes damage. Even oxygen does.

If you look at how many people die from cancer, especially in old age, it becomes obvious that cancer is often a numbers game. The longer you live, the more chemical reactions have gone on in your body, including basic ones like sunburn. This means more chances for a few cells to go rogue. In the end, everyone fails that die roll someday if something else doesn't kill you first.

Plenty of things cause good results to encounter! The trick is moderation. Sunlight causes our cells to make vitamin D. Omega 3 fatty acids promote healthy skin and hair. Many compounds found in plants are helpful, like resveratrol in grapes or natural aspirin in willow bark. Caffeine helps us focus and wake up. Red meat is a good source of easily used iron.

Even if you have several plants with the same genotype, they can develop very differently due to the environment. Changes in plants due to the environment are called the plant's PHENOTYPE. 

It could be as simple as the back plants getting different amounts of temperature, light or airflow. Environment plays a huge role in the plant's development and can make two plants from the same genotype look really different.

I'm not saying this is you, but I'm white and on the askgaybros subreddit many Asian guys seem to see it as a ""goal scored"" if they land a white guy their age as a BF. Please don't hang on to him just because he's a ""handsome built blue eyed white guy"" - it's really not worth all the heartbreak and grief that will soon follow if you stay in the relationship, you're clearly unhappy and as someone else pointed out , you cannot change his desire for an open relationship. In fact, I'm even a bit critical that you let it go ahead despite being uncomfortable because it suggests keeping him is all that matters.

However, the fact that he said ""prejudice doesn't exist in the gay world"" shows signs of a  toxic entitled  conservative white male, Where the term ""race"" is practically non-existent when considering themselves. Really not good. Him accusing you of being self loathing also came off as selfish to me and inconsiderate of your own views. There is nothing wrong with wanting to stay monogamous - in fact in my own opinion I think he idea of an open relationship defeats the purpose of an actual relationship with all the commitment. 

An open relationship can stir up divisiveness and insecurity in the other partner if he's more of the monogamous type, which you seem to be (and I respect). 

Would you mind if I ask why did he want to open up the relationship? Why does he ""want to explore sexually with others?"" - that implied a lot of things, none of which are good. Even if he says he wants to marry you, I don't get why he'd then want an open relationship.",1483229280

So, the town where I delivered was a total crap hole, gangbangers, druggies, thefts all the time but I was on high alert. Earlier in the day my GPS already got stolen from my car. And at 11 o clock I roll in from my last delivery, and there are 4 more sitting there! all to the projects. So im not getting tipped on these deliveries, and im probabally getting robbed at one of them. I looked at the 18 year old ""manager"" girl and said, "" Im not delivering those"" she responded with ""you have to!""...I responded back with a grin ear to ear and said ""wanna bet"".

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","There issues here go well beyond their ostensible desire to ""daven at the Kotel with Sifrei Torah"". 

Firstly, as the article points out, the Kotel Rabbinate is willing to allow them to do so at the Robinson arch area (which is absolutely part of the kosel), but this particular group insists that they specifically want to engage in nontraditional practices in the specific area that is used by thousands of Orthodox Jews on a daily basis.

In my opinion, the establishment of this group (which, officially, is a break off from Women of the Wall) is an obvious political manuever by the WOW leadership to continue pushing their broader long-term campaign against Orthodox Judaism in general.

Thus, they don't just want to pray at the kosel, but they want to pray in the exact same time and place that Orthodox services are taking place, and now they want to remove the mechitza entirely and restrict one of the largest and most active synagogues in the world to a few hours a day.

Kurds are treated fine? Typical comment from a racist and ignorant Turk. Confirmed by your last sentence.

Also funny how all Turks on Reddit who comment on the Kurdish issue have been to the Kurdish regions and can confirm that Kurds have it good, while at the same time making sure to refer to their cities as dumps. Why are the cities dumps, if the Kurds have it good? You are contradicting yourself in one comment, you filthy liar.

The very first automatic transmission, GM's Hydra-Matic (1939), used a shift quadrant that went N-Hi-Lo-R. The selector range was changed to N-D-L-R sometime in the early to mid-1940s. (It didn't have 'Park' until later.) The problem with this arrangement was that if you were in Drive and wanted to switch to Low but went just a little too far you'd end up in Reverse, which could destroy the transmission. In 1950 Ford released their Ford-O-Matic transmission, which was (as far as I know) the first automatic transmission to use P-R-N-D-L (or rather P-R-N-Dr-Lo). The idea is that it's safer if you've got Reverse and Drive separated by Neutral.

Rundared and Samira
---
Rundared and Samira watched as the waves of Chaos were unleashed onto the Nexus. They watched as their new home was *perverted* by an unprecedented expenditure of Divine Power. They saw the very *souls* of weak-willed mortals being twisted out of shape... stifling the spark of Free Will from which the Power of Creation was born. Vexiel had done more than just unleash Chaos... he'd threatened the very power which sustained the Gods.

This would not stand.

Rundared retrieved the Incarnate, which he had placed in Stasis long ago. He found that something had begun to grow on his Mortal Soul... and it saddened him. It wasn't like the *cancer* of Winter that was too tightly interwoven for him to remove... but nor was it as hated. It had been a useful tool, and one that Rundared had been skilled in using.

The Sphere of Secrets was trying to grow back. 

He cut it off of his Mortal Soul... and held it in his hand. He had fond memories of that Sphere. He remembered creating it with the help of the Craftsman God of Legak, the first decent Divinity he could remember meeting. He had created it to hide himself away... to protect himself from the One God's Enemies, and to conceal the fact that the One God's Soul still existed so that madmen wouldn't try to free him.

Rundared set the regenerating sphere aside... and reactivated the Incarnate. He sent it out into the world, trusting in the blessings upon it to guide him where he needed to be.

Then he looked at the Sphere... and threw it away. He didn't need that power anymore.

[-5 Acts of Buffing the Incarnate.]

[Timeline Note: Rundared met Old!Fremgang shortly after Ascending.]

The Shadow of Rundared takes Shape
---
[/u/GalacticProfessor]
The Incomplete Sphere of Secrets felt... strange. It had been ripped out of that... thing it had grown from. It didn't feel too concerned by that separation though... if anything... it felt as if it had been liberated from countless chains it hadn't even been able to perceive. Before it could only be a Sphere... now... now it could be more.

The Sphere completed its development until it became a full Demigod's Sphere... and continued on beyond that point. 

A Soul grew around the Sphere of Secrets. It remembered *some* of the being from which it had been removed, and it used what it remembered as a starting point. Threads of Soul slowly wove together... but the Soul was not stable. It appeared that bearing *One* Demigod's Sphere was difficult for a Mortal Soul. A second was needed to provide a counterbalance... and so the young Soul began the development of the sphere it needed to complete its growth.

The Soul did not know what its second Sphere would be until it was completed, and the Sphere of Retribution rested within it.

It then realized that it needed a Body to interact with the world properly... and so it created one for itself in the Nexus, in the City of Eld.

[-20 Acts for the Shadow of Rundared, Demigod of Secrets and Retribution.]

Sol'natha
---
[I'll write up how she got to Rajhutistan in a bit.]

[/u/TheJediJew, Sol'natha is *very* noticeable to Dexie right now.]

Sol'natha was in Rajhutistan when Vexial gave the announcement. It had taken all of three seconds for her to notice a resemblance between him and Razhok. It was not physical... but there was *something* in his bearing and attitude that set off alarm-bells within her mind. She brought old knowledge to her mind, and thought of the basic forms for Purifying Magic. The Metaphysics to cast those spells weren't in place in the current plane... but being a Demigoddess opened up several exciting options for cheating.

Sol'natha drew upon the power of Vorkeron, and unleashed a burst of Purifying Magic around her mere *moments* before Vexial's Chaos Wave washed over the world. A sphere of White-Gold Light erupted from here, and clashed against the purple waves. Sol'natha felt the overwhelming power of a God clashing against her own. The two forces fell into balance a few hundred feet from the edge of Rajhutistan itself... and Sol'natha slowly felt the wave of Chaos subside.

She took a deep breath... and took a knee. She'd done it... she'd protected them... she hoped.

Sol'natha fell down from the exertion, and passed out in the street.

[-2 Acts to Buff Sol'natha with Purification Magic. She's now trying to brute-force a safe-zone around herself. Depending on how Mak is feeling, she may or may not be able to restore things with it.]",1483229286

At the begining the eight characters don't know what's going on (so the connections are random) but by now it seems they are starting to figure it out. I mean, I've been thinking during the whole series that the stuff they experience they do at an inner level, subtle sensations, being sharing and visiting the strongest connections (at least by now). In my opinion, the show it's aiming to convey emotions and experiences as if you're meant to sense/feel what the characters are feeling. So the only way this can be delivered is with strong imagery (montages) and sound (because the media limitations). But what they actually feel is some sort of sudden pleasure or excitement... and (if they let it happen) they can let go with all their senses. In the grocery store situation I think that probably you will look absent, or need to focus to not give in. A new, unexperienced sensate may end up doing things shouldn't be made in public...

In the case of you simply looking to dominate, run Hardline and either Grip or VMC + secondary or lethal of your choice (launchers are good if you're playing solo). As killstreaks, run UAV / Warden / Thor.

If you are looking to get nukes, run Hardline and greed it with Scavenger. Run UAV / CUAV / AUAV for streaks; the goal here is to get AUAV support as fast as possible to ensure reactive advantage against the opponent, counter Ghost users, and multitask to cycle to the next AUAV quickly.",1483229291

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","In the Sanguine Perspective: Planet cataloging.

It's a fairly simple albeit occasionally dangerous occupation of, well, just going star to star and recording what planets are in the system--if any. Extra pay is often given for discoveries of life and habitable planets that don't require much if any terraforming to colonize. The danger, though, is if you find life, and it's *hostile*. There's also the problem that since most races don't exactly like sharing potentially important information like possible locations for future bases/colonized planets, or if someone is really greedy and selfish and wants credit for discovering the planet(s) first, you could potentially come across another cataloger who might be...less than friendly. Lethally unfriendly, that is.

You'd also have to be pretty careful about not running out of supplies or going insane from claustrophobia, because sometimes you might have to be traveling in hyperspace for quite a while (the longest straight distance you could go is about 190 hyper-days, or 274,000 light-years), only to be left in a place without any other galactic civilizations for hundreds or thousands of light-years. This has lead some people to travel in groups while cataloging.

The job is moderately well paying, although its a very niche occupation, especially since you could be gone from your friends/family for very long times depending on where you're searching, and you could very well never come back.",1483229292

Possibly. But while it didn't get a lot of coverage on Reddit, and coverage in some of the more mainstream anime forums may not have been high, it was certainly huge in other areas. In the Crunchyroll awards, Re:Zero has two nominations, but YoI has five. It topped the annual poll on Anime News Network, and was picked in the five top anime by 9 out of the 13 reviewers and topped their rankings, with Re:Zero fourth. And it was certainly much bigger on Twitter and Tumblr that Re:Zero.

It may be that Re:Zero was the most popular - which certainly wouldn't upset me. But it might be the case that YoI's popularity was with a different audience than those on Reddit, and it isn't clear if that different audience is bigger or smaller. :) I wish we had access to viewing figures for all the episodes.

Perhaps the issue is that internationally the numbers of dedicated anime fans are still small enough that a popular ""niche"" show that grabs an audience outside of that group can gain greater popularity overall?",1483229295

You could say his foreign policy comments concerning our disposition to countries, especially but not exclusively in regards to NATO, and interventionism/nation building are what ""sealed the deal"" for me.

Many doctors who would be more than willing to assist are prevented because their hospital will not allow them.

It's corporate paternalism large corporations or owners of companies controlling the lives and religion of their employees.  Basically just a poorly run system of feudalism.  Conservatives and libertarians should oppose this ruling because it overall reduces religious freedom the religious rights of one owner or even a small board supersede the religious rights of dozens or even hundreds of employees.

That said, the ruling is probably correct, at least legally, RFRA The Religious Freedom Restoration Act prevents federal agencies from passing laws that violate religious freedom.  It's why Hobby Lobby which is also wrong morally is correct legally.

Oddly enough Scalia was opposed to these kind of lawsuits.  He argued in Employment Division V Smith that religious rulings and exceptions should be handled by legislation rather than in the courts.    ",1483229298

Authors: E. Samsonov

NASA's Preliminary Paper

http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/1.B36120

Measurement of Impulsive Thrust from a Closed Radio-Frequency Cavity in Vacuum

A vacuum test campaign evaluating the impulsive thrust performance of a tapered radio-frequency test article excited in the transverse magnitude 212 mode at 1937 MHz has been completed. The test campaign consisted of a forward thrust phase and reverse thrust phase at less than 8×10−6torr8×10−6 torr vacuum with power scans at 40, 60, and 80 W. The test campaign included a null thrust test effort to identify any mundane sources of impulsive thrust; however, none were identified. **Thrust data from forward, reverse, and null suggested that the system was consistently performing with a thrust-to-power ratio of 1.2±0.1mN/kW1.2±0.1 mN/kW.**

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; And remember how I wrote that he got on board before she was even named the nominee?


It was clear that Hillary would be the nominee after she swept Super Tuesday. The vitriol and divisive stance after the results of the elections which lead to him being booed by his own supporters for suggesting at the convention that Hillary should be the nominee after overwhelming winning the popular vote is what I mean that Sanders was slow to recognize Hillary as the nominee. Hillary didn't simply become the nominee at the convention just like Trump didn't simply become the nominee at the electoral college vote. For Bernie to get on board with Trump after so little time after the convention contrasts with his fighting spirit against Hillary when it was inevitable that she would win the nomination. 

Literally, just compare how much money Bernie gave to campaigns attempting to oust Democratic representatives vs. republican representatives (including Trump) and my point is made. He is divisive to the Democratic party even more than he is against the Trump presidency. 

&gt;That's basically every Democrat, including himself. 

Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat (anymore). He was only a Democrat for the brief period of his presidential campaign. 


&gt;His post campaign narrative has been that Trump is picking terrible nominees for executive positions.


Bernie Sanders lost his campaign long before Trump was elected president. 

&gt; Considering how often he gets asked about it, he could be hammering it way more that he would have won, he usually just punts with ""who knows, doesn't matter"".


Yeah, he had to say something to counter the bullshit coming from his own campaign. 


&gt;You're projecting a ton of hate on him that no one else sees.


Do you literally not know anybody outside of the Bernie camp? Bernie Sanders is anything but universally loved. For you to call me deranged because you can't think of anyone else who doesn't like him just means that you don't read very much. He is Barney Frank saying more or less what I'm saying:

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Good stuff, these stats are good for getting a general idea of how good all the teams in the NBA are at the moment.

BUT... they seriously lack any predictive ability between the top 5-6 teams.  The Warriors and Cavs frequently blow teams out, rest their starters in the 4th, and lose ORTG/DRTG.

Toronto's offense is not better than Cleveland's.  I feel like the Cavs net rating is always low, and predictive models using those metrics instead of wins always underestimate them.

The Cavs are also an above-average defensive team in crunch time, and LeCoast is a notorious regular season slacker on D.

Otherwise, I think this is pretty accurate.  The Knicks keep being overrated and defended on this sub, and Utah has been underrated until recently, it's good to see them up there.

I'm surprised to see the Spurs that high in DTRG given how Gasol and Parker have been roasted on r/nba.

Also nice to see small market teams like The Bucks and The Hornets doing well!

So are we all in agreement that the Top 10 teams in the NBA are: Golden State, Cleveland, Toronto, San Antonio, Houston, Utah, LAC, Milwaukee, Boston, and Charlotte?

Charlotte seems like the only debatable one -- you could make a case for Memphis or OKC?",1483229302

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","Well it's not as if the Tyrells outright hated the Baratheons. They were targaryen loyalists but eventually fell in line and became part of the new realm. House relations can also change dramatically over a period of time. Remember that House Baratheon was once the most loyal house to Aegon the Conquerer. And it's not as if this is the first time the Tyrells forgot about the house they once hailed as kings because they happily bowed to aegon when House Gardener was destroyed.

If they did have a grudge against Stannis (for.... defending Storm's End against them like he was supposed to? I still don't see how it's his fault) then a much better way to stick it to him would be to side with Renly, the man not only attempting to deny him the throne, but also his bannermen and castle of Storm's End.

Additionally, the Tyrells really wanted Marge to be Queen and this was their perfect opportunity. They were even plotting to marry her to Robert early on. It didn't hurt that Loras was really close to Renly and the Tyrells were cool with that. Olenna even went so far as to admit it to Tywin and try to reason with him, saying something like ""hey come on didn't you ever do gay sex with your buddies when you were young?"".",1483229303

Basically we just keep the temp at 50 or so and shut off the well pump (effectively like closing the water main) and open all the taps before we leave.  Worst case we lose power (and therefore heat) long enough that the water remaining in the pipes freezes, but with the taps open there's some room for things to expand, and worst worst case a pipe breaks and a bit of water leaks out but we don't flood (since the well pump is off).

My flippant-esque response to OP was just to point out that these arguments are very elementary to the subreddit topic; it was my understanding that this subreddit is not interested in those who come in with day one's notes of Religious Debate 101 (nothing against the poster, back in the day, under a different account, I had many an elementary post deleted by mods - more elementary than this undeleted post).

That being said, I suppose you would expect someone in the fermentation stage of religious skepticism to find their way to this subreddit, even before watching any religious debates. 

*That* being said, I can write a response to each individual one of these points when I get back to my desktop, which is an acceptable charge given the subreddit topic, but if posts like this aren't discouraged, it will just be a weekly copy/paste (which I don't have any objections to, I suppose). 

Tl;dr: I guess I mistakenly expected posts in this subreddit to have at least contained basic knowledge of internet religious debates (nothing against the posts or the posters or the subreddit, just my misunderstanding); I can write an actual response to each of these posts soon.",1483229304

As Cominick says, losing is a part of life. It's refreshing to see how great people like him handle it with integrity and maturity. I wish that I can be like that sometime in the future.",1483229304
"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","You have 1 day of food indicated at '8 ounces'.  Just so you're aware, a pound-and-a-half (or 24oz) per day is basically minimum to budget.

Other than that the tent and sleeping bag are the things that are obviously very heavy for ultralight and where most weight can be shed.  Depending on conditions you need to hike in, one of the inexpensive Chinese sleeping bags (e.g., Aegis max) can save you well over a pound for outlay of $70-80 or so.

You mark your Sawyer mini as 1.3 ounces.  Can it really weight that little?  Stated weight in Sawyer specs is 2 ounces.  In itself that's not a big deal, but if you consistent underestimated weights for much other stuff it could be, so it always can help to actually weigh your items.",1483229304

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Got rid of that printer. If I ever come into possession of another printer I will reenact Office Space. They're excessively difficult to get rid of and I've come to inherently dislike them. 

We went to Target (to return said printer.) and I got some Star Wars ornaments for 70% off. I posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/6XyLZv6.jpg?1) to Facebook with the caption, ""Typical C3PO."" Rooted around and found his head (with tag) so I could buy him. :D /u/Adeno - think I should paint his head red? :P 

ALSO we (myself, my mother, and her boyfriend's 13-year-old daughter) went through McDonald's, and my mother ordered for us (two 20-piece nugget meals with cokes and a mcdouble for me because burgerrssss) and the lady on the speaker was like ""so two meals with two sodas and two fries each?"" and my mother rolled her eyes and was like, ""well yeah,"" and the daughter and I looked at each other in abject horror but before we could say anything the lady asked, ""so you want four sodas and four fries? all of the sodas cokes?"" and my mother said, ""*Yes.*"" As if this should have been obvious. 

And then we pulled up to the window and the daughter and I, in utter disbelief, were like ""you just ordered four fucking sodas and four fries dude,"" and my mother was like, ""psh why the hell would I do that?"" ... And then we had four sodas and four things of fries, and they forgot my burger. I laughed my ass off about it, and then on the way home I'd remember every few minutes and just start laughing again. Journey came on the radio -- ""Don't Stop Believin'"" -- and I sang super loud and tried to get my mother and the daughter to sing with me, haha.  All in all not a bad day other than my mother generally being a shit. I'm so annoying, hahaha. 

**New Year stuff~!**

3. I do want to get out of my head a bit more in the new year with reading, but also learn to be more comfortable *in* it. I want to read more, and also do some more writing, some meditation, mindfulness -- all that stuff that's started to make me gag when people suggest it ad nauseam. :P Maybe look into more depression treatments too, but I've kinda run the gamut there. I need to work on anger -- now that I'm comfortable acknowledging my anger, I'm just angry all the time. @.@ 

4. Family. Gotta sort out this family shit. I think it's going to be a matter of minimizing contact and also not internalizing it so much.  I may have to bust out the affirmations. *-gags-* 

5. I must. Organize. My apartment. Storage is gonna be a big deal, as well as getting rid of things I don't need (soooo many clothes that don't fit, and why do I even own a kitchen table) and just trying to keep it a lot cleaner in here. Decorating may help. I just want to have a clean, comfortable, happy place to come home to, and not to feel afraid all the time that someone might show up and see how messy it is in here. My apartment is as cluttered as my mind. x.x

6. I need to be more social and get out of the house more. This is going to take a lot of work on the anxiety, the fear of driving, and my general awkwardness. 

7. Similar to #1, I need to do more stuff I enjoy. Movies and music are great, but I also need to find things I can do that don't involve a screen. 

8. I need to work on my nutrition, and on drinking more water. It's been really hard getting myself to cook at all, and the water here is disgusting, so it's going to take some work. I might just figure out what the bare minimum I need in a day is and build a menu around that, just to make sure I can get all the nutrients I need even when I'm not up to cooking much. ",1483229306

I'm going to write up a summary of the features, and also work on a description of the first public test. Watch this sub :-)

&gt; Specifically, is this is to be a big blocks spin-off altcoin? (i.e, pre-fork coins are spendable on the btcfork side? But are replay attacks on Bitcoin original chain prevented?)

Yes, the fork code itself is geared to be deployed as a big-blocks spin-off off the Bitcoin main chain &amp; network, but this (BFG) is a testnet (starting from a new genesis block) that is meant to be a scratchpad for testing that the forking works correctly.

Coins on this testnet should not have a real-world value.

Once the fork happens, transactions signatures are modified so that transactions signed on the spin-off chain are not valid on the existing Bitcoin chain, and vice versa. This replay protection is just an impediment though - if the existing Bitcoin clients (i.e. Core, BU) wanted to, they could defeat this by supporting the fork's signatures.

Obamas the one who took the upper ground and said there would be a smooth transition. Meanwhile he goes nuts with executive orders and sends Russian Diplomates home. Have you read the DHS/FBI report on the Russian hacks of the DNC? There was a disclaimer at the top of it basically saying don't use this report for any serious conclusions. There's no evidence produced to the public still, and Obama takes one of the biggest opposition steps regarding Russia since the Cold War.

And trump is causing a divide? You couldn't make this stuff up. All of Russia is laughing at us. Not to mention, pretty much the entirety of military intervention since the Cold War has addressed proxy war with Russia. All of that death.

Republicans have fake news, but the Democrats were much worse. There was clear collusion between the Clinton machine and almost every single news network. Its obvious when comparing the lack of representation other candidates received during the primaries. Or the out right refusal to discuss any of Clinton's controversy. Like her emails; or like her receiving debate questions ahead of time. 

Nepotism. Okay so the former first lady is now our most qualified Democratic candidate. Chelsea Clinton is being groomed for Congress last I heard. How many millions of people do we have in this country? Why do we keep seeing the same names again and again? And while this next example is not a text book definition of ""nepotism"" it is relevant and highly suspect. In 2008 when Hillary lost the primary, guess who was her campaign manager? Debbie Wasserman Schulz. At that time the current DNC chairman was, guess who? Tim Kaine. Tim Kaine bizarrely decides to step down and he nominates, guess who as his replacement? Debbie Wasserman Shulz. Flash forward 8 year DWS is the current chair, do you think the DNC was fair to other more qualified candidates? Do you think their might have been a conflict of interest there? ANd look who suddenly pops back in to the fucking picture next as Hillary's running mate... Tim goddamn Kaine!

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I've got you covered! I've actually read the majority of these books so let me know if you have any questions.

&gt; **A Novel With Fewer Than 3000 Goodreads Ratings

* **Senlin Ascends** by Josiah Bancroft. (583 ratings) Science-fantasy/steampunk. Thomas Senlin has dreamed about travelling to the famed Tower of Babel and now will be vacationing there for his honeymoon. Only one problem, his wife goes missing shortly after they get off the train. This is one of the best books I've read this year and highly recommend it.

* **The House of Shattered Wings** by Aliette de Bodard. (1569 ratings) Urban fantasy set in a historic Paris. It's basically a fantasy murder mystery with fallen angels.

* **Agatha H and the Airship City** by Phil and Kaja Foglio. (2604 ratings) Steampunk. This is the novelization of I believe the first four Girl Genius graphic novels. Technically a YA but a funny and eclectic adventure.

* **The Gaslight Dogs** by Karin Lowachee. (374 ratings) Flintlock fantasy-ish. It's heavily influenced by the history of the colonization of North America and tells a great story about war, expansion, faith, spirits and magic. It was meant to be a trilogy but the publisher only bought the rights for the first book and never picked up the rest. Still worth picking up though.

* **A Stranger in Olondria** by Sofia Samatar. (1173 ratings) Low fantasy ghost story. Beautiful, lush, evocative writing. It took me a really long time to finish this book because I had to pause to digest the writing.

* **The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps** by Kai Ashante Wilson. (1265 ratings) Novella. Not really sure how to categorize it. Follows a demigod who's joined a caravan guard. Beautiful writing as well.

* **A Blight of Mages** by Karen Miller. (2161 ratings). Epic fantasy. Technically a prequel to her Kingmaker, Kingbreaker series but works decently as a standalone.

* **Cold Hillside** by Nancy Baker. (45 ratings) This is the book that got me back into reading fantasy. It's got a beautiful world and plays with notions about the fey in a way I hadn't seen done before.

* **The Devourers** by Indra Das. (610 ratings). Werewolves in Inda. Beautiful writing but brutally bloody.

* **The Last Days of New Paris** by China Miéville (1296 ratings). Blends surrealist art as monsters with WWII.

&gt; **Female Authored Epic Fantasy

* **Inda** by Sherwood Smith. All the politics! Really good, solid epic fantasy with some turns and twists.

* **A Wizard of Earthsea** by Ursula K. Le Guin. Beautiful writing, very introspective and philosophical book. Also quite short.

* **Kushiel's Dart** by Jacqueline Carey. Basically about a courtesan who saves the world. 

&gt; **Five Fantasy Short Stories

* **Clockwork Canada: Steampunk Fiction**, edited by Dominik Parisien if you're looking for steampunk.

* **The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories** by Angela Carter if you're looking for dark, literary fairy tale retellings.

* **So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction and Fantasy**, edited by Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan if you're looking for strange and interesting new things with a twist.

* **Are We Having Fun Yet? - American Indian Fantasy Stories** by William Sanders if you're looking for funny stories that play with stereotypes.

I'd also recommend these. They're on my list but haven't read them yet.

* **The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories** by Ken Liu

* **The Starlit Wood: New Fairy Tales**, edited by Dominik Parisien and Navah Wolfe. Included stories by Naomi Novik, Sofia Samatar, Garth Nix, Aliette de Bodard, Charlie Jane Anders, Catherynne M. Valente and much more.

* **Conservation of Shadows** by Yoon Ha Lee

&gt; **Graphic Novel (At Least One Volume)

* **SuperMutant Magic Academy** by Jillian Tamaki. Short vignette about kids with magic powers at an academy. Super funny (to me at least).

* **Girl Genius** by Phil and Kaja Foglio. Steampunk graphic novel series set in an alternate Europe after the industrial revolution changed history with the emergence of people called sparks. It's available to read [here](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php) online as well.

* **Saga** by Brian K. Vaughan. Technically a space opera but has a real fantasy feel to it. It's more about the world building then the technology.

* **Through the Woods** by Emily Carroll. Creepy, unsettling horror stories about ghosts and monsters in the woods.",1483229310

With mortar, you have to learn when to let go especially, as it is only 4 elixir and 2 hits makes it already worthwhile. If you opponent uses hog rider, a mortar in the center at the river hits the tower and counters the hog for an even trade.

 I actually only started using Mortar about a month ago because I thought it looked super different and underused, but because I've used it in every one of my decks during that time, I have grown to be quite good at using it, and even beat over leveled RGs on ladder.

The man uses shitty, subversive, underhanded, negative, berrypicker, evil, morally questionable tactics. He is also insanely concerned with his 'social appearance' or presence. Why else would he bring on people onto his show, and then go on about how many twitter and snapchat followers they have? It's something he cares about.

"architecture","t5_2qhae","&gt;ridiculous philosophical discussions which are unlikely to affect the end user.

I don't agree with this at all. Architecture is all about space and how it affects people. This is necessarily going to be subjective and involve some amount of philosophy, since people and spaces bring with them all kinds of cultural, historical, religious, political, etc. context. This is a tangled web of influence and influencers, and positions or beliefs architects hold will directly manifest themselves in the built environment - which will, of course, have a very tangible effect on the users of a space or building.

A lot of these conversations are discussions about what the role of architecture is, which is important. Or the connection a certain building should or should not have to its environment, which is important. Or whether it should directly reflect the history of the area it's placed in, or stand in contrast. Or the merits of juxtaposition as an idea at all.

&gt;but instead the conversation will often revolve around topics like postmodernism, ""milieu"", ""morphology"", and ""tectonics"".

This is exactly what I'm talking about - you aren't familiar with these terms, so to you, they come across as pretentious or arcane and it's easy for you to scoff at them. But they all have meanings, and are very useful terms when communicating in certain contexts. 

- ""Milieu"" is another word for ""context"" - which is obviously very important for architecture - but it has connotations that carry its meaning beyond that, to also imply social or cultural context. It's more specific, which makes it helpful in some cases.

- ""Morphology"" could be simplified to ""form"" - but you lose some of the meaning of the word that has to do with structure and shaping and intent. You could also say ""structure"" - but that loses the connotations of ""form.""

- ""Tectonics"" is how building materials interact with each other and express themselves.

&gt;I guess what I'm trying to say is that you can't level the same arguments about pretension at engineers and doctors discussing technical things because they are discussing concrete, functionally important things. 

That was an analogy, and I think it got my point across: people in any specialized field will communicate with each other using terminology that may be unfamiliar to those outside of that field. But I think it's an error to say that this kind of discussion doesn't touch on things that are concrete or ""functionally important."" Buildings are the manifestation of a complicated web of constraints and drivers. Some of those constraints and drivers are more ""surface level"" than the others. For the ones that aren't, discussion is how we formulate our understandings of ideas that are more difficult to grasp, but are still important.

&gt;A lot of the theory I was taught in school revolves around vague concepts borrowed from philosophy which have little if any relevance to the actual built environment.

I don't agree with this perspective at all. If we wanted the built environment to be nothing more than a uniform series of concrete boxes that were only functional, there'd be no need for these conversations. But that sounds like a hellish world to live in.

And again - it's totally fine for you to not want to participate in or not enjoy these discussions. But just because you don't understand or care about something, or have a phobia of big words, doesn't make that thing ""mental masturbation.""

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Not forgetting it at all. It's just unlikely. The majority of cases are not behavioral, and are usually solved with something as simple as a probiotic. If it is behavioral, then anything that makes the feces smell less appealing is ideal. Most additives on the market that deter a dog from eating its own stool or other animal's stools also contain a digestive supplement. Companies like Naturvet make their market on people's lack of knowledge in dietary issues - read the majority of ingredient panels for Coprohapgia in dogs and cats and you'll see. The reason why pineapple works is due to bromelain, a dietary enzyme that helps digest protein, which would make poop still smell like ""food"". Think about it. A dog having digestive issues would have excess nutrition left in the stool, resulting in something that smells like leftovers. Prebiotics, probiotics, and enzymes to break down proteins are the primary ingredients in products made for this issue.",1483229317

Like, I know that people have different ways of dealing with stress or loss or whatever problems, but if your feelings related to that problem begin to leak into other aspects of life that may bear some resemblance to that problem, then that's where trouble can start. Andy is not his dad. Andy didn't do what his dad did. I don't think Andy WOULD do what his dad did. I understand the wound is still fresh, but he even acknowledges that he knows exactly why he feels the way he does. The next step after recognition in my opinion should have been to mentally separate that problem from this completely unrelated episode. It's fine to relate to characters and to be reminded of real world people and events by characters, but don't let a bad, unrelated experience ruin an entire episode.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","from http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#template-inheritance:

&gt; You can’t define multiple {% block %} tags with the same name in the same template. This limitation exists because a block tag works in “both” directions. That is, a block tag doesn’t just provide a placeholder to fill - it also defines the content that fills the placeholder in the parent. If there were two similarly-named {% block %} tags in a template, that template’s parent wouldn’t know which one of the blocks’ content to use.

So the order of execution is create_mon passes the string 'ceph_mon_config' via the 'pillar_id' block to create, which then is (supposed to) render that block into the string that was passed from the child.  Those returned pillar values are then used to determine the value for the cpu, mem, etc. blocks that get passed on to prepare, which then 'does the work' of setting up the virsh config files, etc. based on the values it was given.  If completely drop the nested 'pillar_id' block inside of the cpu block and replace it with the ceph_mon_config string explicitly, everything works like expected.  It's just something about the nesting that makes it go all wonky.",1483229317

When you're talking about actual [dongles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle) in a conversation about dongles, then yes.

When you're using ""big dongle"" as a euphemism for ""big penis"" in a joke about anthropomorphized ""male"" software with a woman you don't know at a professional conference about Python programming, you're using the word ""dongle"" but you're not talking about actual [dongles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle).

"FFXV","t5_2uk8i","Just beat the game, so I'll chime in too.

I really liked the game, and went in expecting the worst. I played FFXIII all the way through while drinking and having me and my roomates riff the entire time. I should've expected this would've been better, since FFXIV is transcendental. Better to be pleasantly surprised though!

&gt;The biggest issue I have with this game is its lack of musical identity

Different strokes I suppose. I liked the soundtrack, though it was far more sparse and subtle than any other FF to date. There are very few tracks that switch between styles depending on the situation, which requires a different approach to scoring. I think with the game's open world nature, if they went to the usual ""one basic track on repeat ad nauseum"" the repetition would become quickly apparent. Normally SE scores per-scene, but in an open world RPG, aside from the scenes that make up the final third of the game, you will experience repeated music more often. I agree the Chocobo track got really annoying really quickly. It could've done with more improvisation and alternate takes. I think there's only the one violin solo mid-way through, they could've had four or five solo's and randomly threaded them into the song after a certain point.

&gt;Fishing feels unfinished, and It's just not fun

Fishing blows. I never really got the hang of it, and I didn't pre-order the game until a few weeks before release so I never got all the game breaking extras that makes fishing pointless. I could see where they were going with it, but it's so pointless, unfun and missing pieces. It would've been better if Noctis' hobby was a card game like in previous FF titles. That would've been easier to produce and stayed closer to FF games of the past imo.

&gt;Photography could have been amazing... how about letting Noctis point and shoot with a reticle?

Actually, I really liked photography. I didn't need to, nor did I want to, move the camera myself. And after around level 5-6 Prompto's photography gets a lot better. I was seeing more and more shots that actually looked good and were funny. On top of that, I never headed out of a town at dusk, I was usually pulling in. So I was always asked in the early morning to pull over for a shot, never ever at night. Maybe you just had a bad run of it? I think the focus on photography added to the game for me, and I was expecting it to be pointless. It's not as if Prompto or Gladiolus' secondary abilities mattered too much more either.

&gt;Most of the tech abilities will never be used. Ignis has the most useable, and Gladio deals the most power - but Prompto even as a support character is awful, and underused.

I didn't put too many points into the Tech abilities, but Prompto's Starshell helps out considerably in the end game when there are daemons every-god-damn-were. Starshell then attack daemons from behind for extra damage. Or Starshell plus the ring ability that voips enemies away.

&gt;I found one of the most frustrating things about this game was the inability to swap between magic/tech abilities while in-battle.

Honestly, magic should've been taken out entirely or re-imagined. In essence they're elemental grenades that you need to use as openers or closers. I really wish when you used a grenade the AI didn't make Prompto run headlong into a raging fire. Manually aiming would be better, but the game didn't help when enemies will just run you down at the speed of light anyway. As for quick-changing, why wasn't magic selection handled through the tactical menu? Maybe making down on the d-pad the magic only option, and being able to swap out spells in L2? Easy fix.

&gt;Travel in this game is pretty sloggy, and the cars handling mechanics are like being on slippery magnets

The car felt really slow getting out of Lestallum for some reason, but other than that I found it to be ok. I wished there was more banter, dialogue or options when driving than there was. Honestly, I fast-traveled each and every time I could, only letting the auto-drive ride if there was something worth stopping to do between my location and the final destination. My bet is that originally you could never manually drive, but the option was added in later to make the game feel more like an open world.

&gt;Lets not even go into the loading screens. NG+ is absolutely pointless, as it doesn't scale the difficulty whatsoever.

Yeah, you're better off with your end game save dreaming and completing the content. Though it feels sorta pointless, aside from getting all the things I guess? Anyway, face Adamantoise. It's a bitch.

&gt;This game is too easy. It encourages you to sidequest, but unless you do every story mission at estimated level, you won't get a challenge.

I guess that's what the Noxperience band is for? I didn't mind the lack of challenge, since it was never about how hard I was hitting the enemies and how generous questing was to giving me health restoratives. Which I appreciated because healing is sorta fiddly.

&gt;The weapons have no enhanceable abilities, traits, or sockets.

Vendors had shit for weapons, but I appreciated that over the usual FF way of each and every town for some reason has marginally stronger weapons that you are forced to buy. The wearpons I found questing were better, and I never had to get the end game weapons anyway. Didn't even know where to find them. Weapons are pointless compared to gear.

&gt;THE BLATANT ANNOYING MMO FETCH QUESTS.

I went ahead and did just about every quest I could and I think the questing sort of ends at the right spot. It was starting to get annoying right around the time when I was seeing less and less to do. Now all I have is adamantoise and powering up the weapons with Cid.

&gt;This next point is a large one. They seriously need to reprogram how the AI spits their lines out. They are downright terrible in repetition and don't even make sense half the time.

I could go with some code that puts a line on hold for a good hour or so before you hear it again. I also really wished there was a conversation continuation system in place. Too many times would one character start to say some plot-important line, when someone else interrupts them because we walked too quickly and Prompto saw a pointless thing to talk about.

&gt;Most of the ""advanced"" dungeons are all the same, minus the top tier ones which are a grindfest unlike any other. It seems like this game really doesn't present a challenge until the very last 1%, and when it does - it's ridiculous. No spoilers, but if you make it there you will see.

I don't know what hard end-game dungeons there are other than the sewer dungeon by Insomnia and the one that only opens up at night. Guess there are more that are hidden? I dunno, due to how the game is laid out they were annoying more than challenging. Either having monsters constantly curb stomp me, or being a drain on my restoratives.

&gt;Why can't I use Aranea or Iris in my party? They are coded and work during parts in the game, even in NG+ you can't permanently get them. I have a feeling like this is Square waiting to release even more characters as DLC, which bothers me.

Probably because that would require even more banter, time and money to produce. Imagine the low amount of repeated lines that are already in the game, and double it...

&gt;If you've made it this far, tell me what some of the things that bothered you while playing this title. Bitching aside, I think the combat is the most well done part - it just needs tweaks.

I'd say it needs a lot of tweaks. Eventually I ""got it"", but everything felt too fiddly. First off, the camera is shit and needs to be scrapped and re-programmed from the ground up. Enemies need a better system to telegraph attacks, and the block needs to be re-worked too, since half the time the little Square warning sign came up with no follow up enemy attack. Warp points need to appear in each and every combat, no exception, and a cancel animation option would be greatly appreciated. I would also re-work magic, either making it something only Ignis can do, or increase the number of spell styles there are. Maybe making straight up healing spells, debuffs, buffs, single target, multi-target, etc.

Also, I dunno about you but the MP3 player worked fine for me? I could use more variety in towns too. Oh yeah, and why does Chocobo racing suck? Also, explain the goddamn story better. I know there's a lot of shit going on, and it'd be great to see it. Also more outfits. And outfits for people who didn't buy the game five years before it released? Also, more scenes like that one time when Prompto opens up to Noctis on the roof of that one town and you really get to know him and his character. Why didn't I have that for Ignis or Gladio?",1483229322

And if conservatives disagree, and still think that rural voters deserve more influence in politics than they deserve, they should remember this quote by Republican Justice William Rehnquist:

After I confronted them outside, I wanted to make sure I got a pic of their car before I called the police in case I didn't have a chance to do that while I was on the phone with them.

My main curiosity is if it really was gang-related as my friend thinks it was.  That's what worries me the most about retaliation if the police are onto them and end up finding out about them.

""reasonable amount of time"" seems to be a very subjective term.
back in the day i got that sence of accomplishment when i got a empy weapon to lvl 85 which took me maybe 2 months (partly cause of the time spawned bottle neck NMs). on the other hand i keep seeing ppl (those that apparently equaly struggle to get a RME) who simply quit 1-2 weeks after they got their first relic because they are fed up with the high grind/reward ratio - not even enjoying their just attained new ultimate weapon. but wether the grind is to much or not is a different discussion. 

the thing that bothers me is the blatant abuse of bots, glitches and exploits that apparently don't get punished as well as the hidden pay to win system that you'd expect from a free to play game but not one with a monthly subscription fee.

Cthulhu eventually looked down at the ocean proper, spotting Booker's island whizzing out of the fog towards him. Now that Booker was out of the fog, he'd be able to get a better look at Cthulhu's island -- which, unsurprisingly, was made of a series of strange green, uneven stone blocks that were covered in otherworldly moss and slime, and arranged into strange, impossible shapes that sort of hurt your eyes to look at too long. It was also several times larger than Booker's, but it kind of had to be considering its occupant.

"soma","t5_2ra4z","Hello! I'll unpack your reply a little if you don't mind, as there's a lot of questions in there :)  

&gt; But I will still argue that our mix of neurons and chemicals is more complex than a computer, that is nothing but electrons flying around to manipulate zeroes and ones.  

Well, at it's core, the brain's components and working completely differently than a computer of course, but that doesn't really matter if the *functions* are the same. If the simulation is able to learn and adapt, to reflect, if it's behavior is determined by past experiences, a core programming and probabilities, we're not far from how human behaves. In fact, when we start talking about a.i in terms of *behaviors*, we've pretty much made the leap. Would an a.i with biological hardware seem more ""real"" to you? If I told you I'd created a computer that ran on a biological matrix with neurons and receptors, would you be more inclined to say that its alive?  
  
We have to face the fact that computers are evolving at a scarily rapid pace, making giant leaps in the span of decades. Quantum computing is at our doors, and we are now trying to synthetize D.N.A as a storage medium. For now, the difference between our brains and our computers is quite clear, but the distinction will blur as technology advances.  

&gt; A simulation however, no matter how perfect, is still just a fake. 
  
Well, if a simulation is *perfect*, and has no flaw, how is it distinguishable from the ""real"" one? How is the original more *real* than the simulation? If I where to brain scan you, and through wizard's magic, implement *your* consciousness in the simulation...Would you still be real? Would you still be you?  

&gt;How do you know than an AI has conscience?  
  
That's a big question. I mean, we haven't even answered that question about us properly yet, so imagine applying that to something else. But, if we simplify a little, and define the consciousness as the self-awareness that emerges from our mental states, I imagine that once our software is complex enough, it could very well emerge on it's own. To test this though, will be hard. We could be, and should be, trying to test for self-awareness though. That would give us a clue.  
Since the problem of consciousness is a big big one, I invite you to check out the [consciousness entry in the SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/#ConCon) if you feel like learning more about that :)

&gt; A assume you know of the chinese room paradox and I argue that AI is just the same. With an AI, you can pick it apart and look at the lines of code controlling everything, picking everything apart until you get to the glorified calculator the CPU is, just manipulating numbers. Us humans are not manipulating numbers, or anything similar, in our brain, to my knowledge.  

Isn't that exactly what we do though? The more we know about the brain, the more we know about the processes that goes on behind it. How the different parts interacts with one another, how memory is written, and so on. It's still just processes, albeit much more complex that what we can program right now. You are, as a being, a collection of processes that interacts and reacts to external and internal stimuli. A computer is much the same, in a simple form.  

&gt; Therefore the AIs of SOMA doesn't feel anything. It is nothing but (excuse my ugly attempt at programming) something like
    if(hazardouz_electrical_current){ func.(pain) }  
and so on. Stuff like that, all the way. That's not feelings.   
  
Isn't it exactly like that though? If you are hit by an electrical current, your nerves endings gets damaged, sends an impulsion to the brain which transmits the data to you through pain. It's an evolutionary function designed to keep you from harm.  

&gt; The AI in games we have today can do just the same thing, do you also think the AIs in GTA actually feels anything when I run them over?  
  
I do not think that A.Is today are advanced enough to actually feel anything. When the A.I in G.T.A will be coded to respond to the pain of the accident, and then that the pain and tragedy will inform the A.I on future encounters, I wouldn't discount it. But for now, A.Is are in their infancy. Much like a cell cannot feel anything.  It's too small, too simple. Yet. But then, you keep adding building blocks, and one day you get us.  

&gt; I am sure that if we had a time machine, we could go back to the 50's or 60's and show them our current AIs, like Google Assistant or Siri or whatever, and make them believe that they are actual, conscient, sentient AIs. They seem like the perfect simulation of it, right (to people back then)? SOMA takes place a hundred years from now, so of course they are able to make even more advanced AIs than us, but it doesn't magically make them ""alive"".  
  
Well...no. The turing test was proposed in 1950 after all. And of course, Google assistant is pretty advanced...but you can't have a complete conversation with it. You will know through your exchange that it is a bot. But there's a point where that argument fails. Because eventually, we succeed and surpass the original vision. Take for example flight. For much of mankind's history, flight was impossible, a dream. The closer we got to actually making that possible, with several key new technologies, the less impossible it seemed, but even when it was invented, it was a revolution. It was the impossible made possible...and today, we walked on the moon. We're readying ourselves to go on mars, soon.  It isn't because it seems fat-fetched today that it won't be possible in 50 years. or a hundred.

The lack of discipline and professionalism in soldiers coming out of AIT is either from a lack of real punishment aside from stupid details, ART 15 and chapters (which no NCO there wants to see happen) or it's platoon sergeants that are so overloaded with taking care of a class that they don't have time to train and discipline their soldiers. Then there's the issue of the lack of professionalism in the NCO's themselves. 

The restrictions on corrective training doesn't help either. 150-200 students talking and moving around at parade rest waiting to get checked off for bed and the only punishment that can be done is ten push-ups or making them wait out there until they get quiet. None of them are motivated to do the right thing for the sake of doing the right thing. There's no pride in being a soldier. In basic they have a fear of punishment, but that's gone in AIT.

Then there's the sick call games and shamming. There were people who spent 90% of their time on profile for the sake of getting out of either class or pt. The tmc would basically give you whatever you asked for whether it be quarters or a profile. Never investigations for malingering or faking to get profiles.

It's going to take a lot more than drill sergeants to change the quality of soldiers coming out of AIT",1483229329

I count myself among those people who used to discuss Snape on other message board and get yelled at by other fans for wanting to discuss Snape without fliping out.

I think even more so at the end of Half Blood Prince, especially because he killed Dumbledore, it just seemed to suspicious to me. I just had a feeling more was going on between Snape and Dumbledore.

It may be because I was a lot older than the average HP fan and back in the day when you would try to have a rational conversation about Snape after HBP people would flip out on you. LOL! Well, it's not totally different but people have calmed down a little over the whole Snape is total evil incarnate. Other than the OMG he is so mean to kids and teenagers.

A friend of mine jokingly, when we would talk about HP (years ago) would say that Dumbledore is evil. But in our more serious conversations she would insist there was more going on with Dumbledore than this kindly old headmaster.

There's a whole sub-segment of this area called Terror Management Theory, based on the work of Ernest Becker and his book The Denial of Death. That's a really interesting existential rabbit hole to go down, very grim but reaffirming in a way.

In Canada, the year you exercise your option you must include the difference between the fair value of the stocks acquired and the cost of shares. Then the increase in Net income for tax purposes will be offset by 50% under ITA110(1) deduction. 

For example: you have option to purchase 1000 stocks of xyz .inc at a price of 25$. At the time you exercise your option the fair value of the stock was 50$. Your net income for tax purposes would increase by 25,000$ ((50-25)*1000) then you would apply the deduction from ITA110(1) for 1/2 of 25,000$, this will result in an increase in taxable income of 12500$. 

When you dispose of the stocks in the future you will realized the capital gains from the fair value of the stocks at the time of acquisition.

The story doesn't end well, but my point is that age and age gap in a relationship doesn't necessarily give you insight into motives.  Two people of very different ages can be happy with each other, or one of them could be manipulating the other.  Same with two people of the same age.

People who get into relationships will influence the development of their partner, regardless of whether they are intentionally trying to or not.

We wouldn't need Rods over the US or South America for years if at all so we wouldn't need 72 right off the at unless I'm missing something. The stuff about gravity was that even with the friction of the atmosphere gravity as a rule is easier to work with than against.

* **Post processing in Audacity:** normalize, -6 db soft limit, normalize, noise reduction

Since it took me two months to get around to trying my new pedal and playing guitar in general, I thought it was best that I make a new post for people interested in hearing what this thing sounds like.

You are hearing me hearing this pedal for the first time so it takes a moment for me to set it up and realized I had bypass switched on. The first 30 seconds or so is dry and then around the 2:00 mark I make it clip pretty hard, so beware of a few loud parts. I tried to tame the [twin] peaks with a soft limiter. This demo covers delay, reverb, delay+reverb, and modulation. No other effects were used as you can see in the signal chain above. Definitely not your run-of-the-mill delay and reverb. It's dark and weird, and I love it.

You should probably skip around unless you want to listen to over 15 minutes of the same loop.

Since 2000 here are the number of Pac-10/12 championships (Rose Bowl or National Title representative) that have been won by teams:

* USC - 6
* Oregon - 5
* Stanford - 3
* Washington - 2
* Wazzu - 1

Since 2000 here are the number of SEC championships that have been won by teams:

* Alabama - 5
* LSU - 4
* Florida - 3
* Auburn - 3
* Georgia - 2

I'm actually surprised by the total numbers here, but they obviously don't account for margin of victory. What's kind of crazy is USC had a share or an outright Pac-10 title for seven straight years.

"ShingekiNoKyojin","t5_2we2n","The OVAs are based on side material (the one about Levi is based on a spin off manga series about him, another episode is based on a gag page by the author...only the last one is one that I'm not sure about its original source, and I don't really consider it as canon). The (I could be getting the order of episodes wrong though) first two OVAs are pretty much canon (as in, characters that appear in it only are actually mentioned in the manga I believe), and the third ova is maybe canon if you count an offhand reference to it later in the manga. The OVAs in general stick pretty true to the original storyline. One of them (I can't remember which number it is, but it is called Ilse's Journal, I think) even directly is of a bonus chapter from the manga. It is the only one of the extra/ova material that is explicitly referenced to in the manga series I believe.

The live action movies are based *very* loosely on season 1 of the anime. A lot of details, including plot points, world building, and characters that are important in the original story, are very different from the original. The CG at first seems decent, but it gets worse towards the end. Honestly, I don't suggest watching it unless you're watching to see something you can't take too seriously.

There is also the Attack on Titan Junior High anime series, which is not at all in line with the original story except for having the same characters in an alternate universe of middle school setting. If you're into AOT purely for the action, plot, and drama, the JH anime probably isn't for you, but it is a pretty fun watch if you're into that sort of thing. ",1483229339

I'd absolutely love [Subnautica](http://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/), since it isn't a request of yours I won't write about why but you can see it in my post history if needed :) 

It's very hard for me to choose a favorite game so I'll go with top 2 picks.

* **Overwatch** - Very cool game, I really enjoy playing it. It has a diverse set of heroes to choose from, all of them have more or less interesting abilities. If I had to choose my top picks are Sombra, Symmetra, Zarya and Torbjorn. Though I play almost every hero regularly depending on what my team needs the most. There are different game modes which is awesome, there're even winter themed maps/game modes and Blizzard really made a good job with this game. Even though there are microtransactions, there isn't any need to buy anything with real money because you can get anything through loot boxes and/or with coins. I love the diversity of maps, player community is pretty good and I rarely (1/100) encounter a troll/cheater. Another thing I enjoy is the length of the games. They're fairly short and you can play in short bursts or in longer sessions, kinda like Rocket League. The game is probably a bit expensive but very much worth it in my opinion (&gt;200h)

* My second favorite game is **Stardew Valley** . That game caught me completely by surprise, since I never played Harvest Moon or something like that I didn't even know that kind of game existed. It's such a joy to play it, it's very relaxing, I can go at my own pace and it feels rewarding at the same time which isn't the easiest thing to get with a game. Also it was made by just one guy in 4 years. He made literally everything in the game, and it's still regularly updated with a lot of new content. It feels awesome starting your own farm, creating a community, participating in town events, taking care of your animals, fishing and just chilling,... There's a lot to do yet you can do nothing and still be able to enjoy the game. There are a lot of surprises too if you're more involved with the town community, they can send you gifts, recipes, money, etc. It's a unique game, not on the expensive side and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet to at least try it. 

Well there it is, thanks for doing such a big giveaway, happy New Year! :)

I've went from 0 lp to 2900 lp on a new character on the backs of 0 -800 lp, a few 1200s here and there. I've been on 25 plus win streaks a few times, its horrible. I am learning nothing just winning because its an endless stream of people who throw out sweeps.

Before the update the lower ranks were a good mix of people from 1000 lp uip to gold, now its a slaughter house.

Thing is because my boxer is actually pathetic and new i lose 120 + points regularly to a newb ryu with a few tricks so getting to 300, 3500 where i hope the new threshold for stronger opponents is feels like a losing race.

Three days and 100s of matches sub 700lp, maybe this is how they have structured the lower ranks now?

If you get catapulted out like this guy, you need to suicide/self destruct first. I believe the key is something like RightAlt+Backspace.  
Then the prompt to Press X appears.  

In the 'Persistent Universe' death and respawn controls are the same, but you get your ship by interacting with a monitor on the space station you spawn at.  
When ships explode in this game mode there is a timer before you can respawn your ship. It's the first Super basic implementation of the insurance system bringing a new ship to your location.",1483229342

Anyways if you're going to quote someone at least quote them properly Obama: “one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset."" proper quoting is important when trying to prove ones point. which leads me to the next issue with your ""quotes""

Obama never actually said ""I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction."" this false quote is extrapolated from this: 

&gt; Of course, not all my conversations in immigrant communities follow this easy pattern. In the wake of 9/11, my meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans, for example, have a more urgent quality, for the stories of detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging. They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.

I have no idea how ""I will stand with the Muslims"" was gotten from that, if anything it's saying he will stand by *legal* immigrants, including those whom are Muslim.

So we have an odd campaign, we rotate dm's, and we have ancestral weapons that make us a bit OP. Basically weapons that get bonuses as we level up. So my cousin is a warlock, and his arcane focus is a part of his sword, through time his sword has become +3. He keeps trying to argue that because his sword is +3, his spells sting rolls get +3 to them. The sword is +3, does that mean the arcane focus is +3 also? He could've picked a materials pouch instead, he wouldn't be able to argue the +3 for that.

He says that dnd is about changing the game to your groups liking, but I feel like he's changing the game to benefit himself. So now I'm questioning our weapons, wondering if his is the most OP of all, which I think it is.

But anyways, what are your thoughts on a sword that is +3 giving you +3 to weapon attacks and magic attacks? The sword does more, I forget what, but just that part seems way more op than my rapier that's +3 that I can switch with another weapon for a BA instead of just an action.",1483229345

From my experience, it's because the people coming into the conversation don't immediately take certain things as fact and because of that they are banned.


For example, someone linked to SRSsucks said they'd only continue the conversation in X-feminist sub. I looked at the rules and the sidebar said ""Those who deny patriarchy/other feminist ideas will be banned"". The conversation was on the patriarchy, or lack thereof.",1483229347

Yes they're useless when alone and in 1v1 situations. Remember this is a TEAM GAME. You shouldn't walk up to a poppy and try to 1v1 as a Draven unless you are super fed, thats just the nature of the game and the roles that each of the champions fulfill.
If ADC really feels that weak just play Vayne or Twitch, stop picking MF or Lucian and wondering why you get shit on.  Every new champ has more gap closers and ways to get on top of you, playing an immobile back line ADC is just not viable with the mobility creep this game is plagued by.
Draven is somewhat mobile but he's always been about snowballing, him being unable to kill a poppy when he's behind says nothing about the state of the game. 
If you play ADC stop trying to make highlight reels and just take towers when you have vision and backup and grind through to a siege  victory. Why does he need to kill poppy? He showed up and got her off the tower. The game isn't only about 1v1 killing people and if that's the only way you can have fun then play top lane.",1483229350

&gt; Police say on Nov. 12 at approximately 2:30 p.m., a passenger reported seeing the man and another passenger allegedly damaging a streetcar in the Spadina Avenue and Richmond Street area.

&gt; The altercation continued outside the streetcar where the driver was choked, punched and slapped repeatedly, police said in a release.

He was better than Bush, who was a disastrous president, but that's just reversion to the mean; McCain or Kerry or Hillary Clinton would all likely be better presidents than GW Bush just because Bush was so awful. In sports analytics we might say that Obama has a very low VORP (value over replacement President) while Bush's VORP is a big negative number. 

The ACA is the main domestic accomplishment that Obama has over Clinton (though, ironically, the ACA was based on the Republican counter-proposal to Clinton's health care reform initiative), but the question is ""what if the ACA is repealed"", and in at case Obama wouldn't have a solid domestic achievement anymore. That leaves us looking at his foreign policy achievements, which are few and far between and basically add up to ""not being as terrible as Bush"", which is a very low bar for an American President.

After 2 hours of his guildmates spamming me(wtf my gear i sell at MY price)he made one of his mates(who must be a real sap to do this)leave their guild just to come buy them off me. Once he had them he spammed me bragging he bought them.

"wowtcg","t5_2s572","I read up on my ruling, and this is what I found.  From the compendium about token copies:


Some modifiers tell you to “put a copy of a token” into play, or to “put a token copy” of

another card into play. That copy is also a token (404.2). That token's printed information is

the same as the printed information of the card it's copying (402.2a), except for that card’s

cost. A token’s cost is always zero (201.4). It does not copy any modifiers affecting that card,

unless those modifiers are altering the card's printed information. A token’s printed

information can be accessed as it’s entering play (710).",1483229356

Until recently, the freaking NFL was non profit (they only switched to profit so they could hide what they were paying their top administrators). 

So take non profit out of the equation completely and decide if you want to charge or not. If they're a charitable organization, decide if you would be happy donating the fee you would have received from it, since that's essentially what you'd be doing. ",1483229356
"slimerancher","t5_3bg75","Oh right. I forgot.

Okay, well all slimes get hungry at more or less the same rate. But I first need to define ""hunger stages""

1. ""stuffed and happy"" -- open mouth smile
2. ""fed and happy"" -- closed mouth smile
3. ""oh so hungry"" -- drooling face
4. ""dying"" -- squinty frowny face

a slime will downgrade its hunger stage every 6 hours and a food item will upgrade the slime one hunger level. At stuffed, it will *not* eat anymore. At ""fed"" it *will* eat if food is right in front of its face, but it won't seek out food. At either of the hungry stages, it will find food, more aggressively at the lower stage. So a slime will be ""hungry"" every 12 hours. But it will possibly eat every 6.

The difference in how often they naturally eat is all in how slimes behave. Crystal and rock slimes seem to spend more time rolling around than getting distracted by food in the pen and eating when still ""fed and happy"" stage-- they don't really eat every 6 hours unless you're shooting food straight at them. Even when they are hungry, they will make a beeline for food, pause to shoot crystals or roll around, and *then* eat the food. 

Tabby slimes are programmed to play with their food if its around and they aren't eating. Therefore literally every 6 hours its chomp'n time since they likely already have the food in their mouths. 

They all get hungry at the same rate, but it appears to be the programmed *behavior* of individual slimes that leads to whether or not they'll feed immediately.",1483229356

Secondly, they've funded those games, which is why they exist in the context of ""When will VR get games that aren't tech demos?"".

VR software development is not profitable, which is the case for many developing media platforms.  The traditional subsidy in those types of scenarios is exclusives to establish market presence for the subsidizer.

Without Oculus software funding, HTC would still profit on their system, and Valve would still act as a riskless software distribution monopoly, but nearly all development would be at a loss, and all customers would only have access to a dwindling supply of indie games from funding-less devs.  That is what steamVR is and it *is* a problem.

&gt; 2. Did not require silver to enjoy the full event. (Looking at you Festival of the Lost this year) 

&gt; 3. Surprised us with how fun Strike Scoring ended up being. 

.

.

1- I'm glad for people who like SRL, but I personally couldn't care less. Played the minimum required to grab the tags and rewards then bailed out: 4 maps are not enough, physics are unpredictable and sparrows are all the same (except two).

As for the exotics, they are horrible imo. More examples of rehashing of the existing weapon catalog: Nova Mortis and Abaddon are lazy copies that are worse than their arc sibling and will have a really hard time owning their exotic slot. The Icebreaker case is a sad one too; a once revered exotic that has been so good it was taken out of the game then brought back a year later as a shadow of its former self after countless nerfs and put behind a lazy rng wall.

.

2- I agree completely

.

3- Strike scoring is a good addition no doubt, but I just don't think it changes much in the grand scheme. People are paying attention to the scoring in the nightfall only because they are looking for the IB, and as soon as they do (or lose interest), nightfalls will be speed-run again or thrown aside. Scoring is probably even less impactful in regular/heroic strikes as people usually run those for keys, chests and exotic engrams.

All in all, I think the Dawning was... ok: not great but certainly not bad either. It's miles ahead of FotL and CD, but the bar set by those is too low to consider the Dawning an achievement.

I don't think I've ever seen a player as electrifying as he was in his time at Barca, and it's a testament to his ability that even after an injury that would have ended the career of many lesser players, Ronaldo went on to have a career that can only be classified as world class. 

All that said, history will judge Cristiano as the better player due to the longevity and quality of his career. ",1483229360

I was drunk and made a move which she responded to. Then she pulled back and told me she loved me but that it wasn't enough. It's the only time anyone has told me they loved me and it basically destroyed me. 

NYE is my personal emotional nightmare because not only was it the day I finally realized I'd never be enough for the person I loved, but I lost my best friend in the process.

&gt; [Mr. Trudeau essentially told premiers to adopt a carbon tax or cap-and-trade plan or Ottawa will impose its own levy – a minimum of $50 a tonne by 2022 – and return the revenue the provinces.](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberals-to-set-carbon-price-at-10-a-tonne-in-2018-rising-to-50-by-2022/article32206937/)

And, carbon pricing is not the actual cost. It's a cost made up by bureaucrats; a cost that is impossible to accurately measure and a drag on the efficiency of the economy; and it doesn't reduce emissions. 

&gt; [But BC Ministry of Finance budget documents show, clearly, that total demand for the B.C. carbon-taxed products grew faster after the carbon-tax was introduced than over almost every other similar timeframe between 1992 and 2008 (before the carbon tax was introduced). Further, B.C.’s official 2013 Fiscal Plan expressly forecasts that, in spite of the carbon tax, B.C. demand for the carbon-taxed goods will grow another 8.6% by April 2016, while the population is expected to grow only 1.2%.](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/carbon-pricing-doesnt-work)

The most we have ever reduced greenhouse gases is through the [Montreal Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) in 1989. It reduced GHG by more than all the initiatives since combined. We need to keep working at behind the scenes solutions like this (like the October 2016 amendment for HFCs) to reduce GHG not feel-good sunny-ways carbon taxes that have little actual effect.

"communism101","t5_2uc81","&gt;It is still an open question as to why socialism has occurred so rarely historically,

I would like to solve the puzzle.

It is because people are greedy. A society where everyone is treated equally will never be able to work because of human nature. There is no way that anyone would ever want to be a doctor if they got paid the same as someone cleaning toilets. Any doctor in that society would either leave or revolt. In either case the community cannot survive as is. 

&gt; but I do not think this fundamentally challenges our beliefs

In even the examples you gave, you admit that true socialism doesn't last. For example, China is beginning to resemble a more capitalist society. Other countries that I always hear people mention when it comes to socialism being successful like some European nations are now going broke because of their socialist programs. Even the socialist programs in America like Social Security are having huge budget problems and are on the verge of collapse. 

Socialism, and thus communism, have never worked out long term in history because they are not conducive for a healthy economy and they do nothing but anger the professionals in society who work hard.",1483229363

I always like to do 24hr shift prep. We have a guide that we print out and used based on expected guest count. Make where you're gonna put people, write their secondaries, try to plan out breaks, lobby checks, smoke outs, dish bodies, prep, who's gonna manage change over.

Do your preshifts. Make lists. Pick at least one thing you want to make better in the store during your floor control. Delegate and then take some for yourself if able. I work 6/7am starts mainly, so often I will single booth in the drive thru and start on table prep until it gets busy (small store). Sometimes you will need to take a crew person off a station to just get something done, like dishes piling up? Lobby garbages overflowing? Etc.

If you find yourself stopped, even for a second, that's the time for a travel path!

The party manages to track this guy down, and the conversation goes something like this: 

Bard: Hello good sir, what's your name?

Half-Orc: I FRAW

Bard: That's very nice. What's in that box you're holding?

Half-Orc: FRAW NO NO

Bard: I'm sorry?

Half-Orc: FRAW NO NO (Fraw no know)

Bard: Okaaay, might I see the box, dear friend?

Half-Orc: NO

Bard: Why not, dear friend?

Half-Orc: FRAW NO NO YOU

Bard: Of course you do. Don't you remember making friends? *charm persons him*

"gaming","t5_2qh03","This post seems to get a lot of hate and I am genuinely curious as to why. I am here wondering if there is any reason to pre-order in the first place. 


You can get the exact same game on the of its release. Heck, you can buy the game the moment you want to play it instead of paying for it months before the release. I've heard people say ""I pre-order it now so I don't forget."" If you are likely to forget about the game's release, what's are the chances of you playing the game you've paid for when it comes out?


""I pre-order games that I know I will buy anyway no matter what."" Sure you are fine to do whatever you want. I know that feeling when the trailer for your favorite game series drops. The HYPE is REAL. And honestly you are most likely going to buy the game anyway. We all know that.  The people who are against pre-ordering are just arguing that this is a bad consumer practice. Having a rapport with your butcher after building a close relationship with him for years is nice. Buying the newest game from the developer with a rock solid reputation is also nice. Some people work extra hard to keep their reputation. Some people grow complacent and try to milk it. Either way, it is in consumers' best interest to not pay for goods that are not delivered yet because the former people are in it for their reputation whereas the latter works for the money and pre-paying only feeds the money hungry.


Lastly, this is the most illogical argument I've heard. ""I pay for the game now because I don't know if I will have the money when the game comes out."" If you honestly believe this, you may need to check your priorities. You can save this money, put it in a bank or anywhere else it will accrue interest. This is the very same reason why companies like pre-orders so much. They get your money upfront and they get to work that money and keep whatever interest or pay off it generates. Walmart is notorious for deferring payment until the very last moment because they can generate millions by working the money before the payment date. So you are better off keeping the money and defer payment as long as possible. In the case of pre-ordering, you are willingly giving up any income the money generates during that time period. This is just bad money managing and probably the reason why you don't know if you will have enough money at the end of the month.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Yes, I'm tired of this overwrought concern by Luddites claiming to be futurists. It's based on a thought experiment with unreal premises, the first of which is assuming nothing ELSE will change while this massive leap to truly autonomous automation happens. Not our economy, culture, lifestyles, education, demographics - for the first time in history, nothing will adapt in response.

Why is that a reasonable (or even rational) assumption? Jobs being destroyed by exponentially increasing efficiency has been a constant factor for hundreds of years. From blacksmiths to wagon makers, millions upon millions of jobs have become redundant. Every step of the way there were doomsayers decrying the inevitable march of progress destroying jobs. Just read the overwrought editorials of every era from steam power to electrification to microprocessors.

Yes, these changes have always caused massive disruption but everything else in our culture changed too and somehow, more people are better off today by most measures than ever before. Where is the evidence that the exponentially increasing disruption we've always managed to adapt to (though we've always predicted we wouldn't), where is the evidence that ""this time it will be different"" and the apocalypse really is nigh?

True futurists understand that everything always changes and changes causes adaptations. Nothing remains constant, except for two things; 

1) Doomsayers will always be forecasting imminent doom (because *this* time it really, really IS diiiiiiiiiifffffrrreeeeent!!!!)


2) Overall quality of life for most people will still stubbornly continue to improve, most of the time by most measures (as measured globally on decadal timescales)

(These changes will disrupt individual careers for specific individuals as they always have, especially those unwilling or unable to adapt. But those individual hardships will not rise to a level sufficient to upset our increasing global well-being averages over the long-term)",1483229370

If you REALLY want that effect, I'd try [[Mirri's Guile]] instead. However, I also don't think that's really where you want to be, unless your meta is very very slow (i.e. will give you time to get actual value from Guile before you die).

As for when it makes sense to dilute your deck, the reality is that you almost never want to unless you absolutely have to. This is why I think post-sb against counterspell decks (I'm assuming these are the decks you want to grind against?) I think you want to max out on Collective Brutality. Have at least 3 post-board, and if you have the space for it a 4th might be worth it. It's the nuts against counterspells (unless they have 2 in hand), kills pesky hatebears and sets up your combo all in one card, even if it gets countered. 

See my above comment for the strategy I'll be testing vs Eldrazi going forward.

As far as Lavamancer is concerned, I haven't tested it myself but I know it has been tested and found not to be good enough by people over at MTG The Source, which I think (based purely on theory) makes sense. It's pretty slow, requires red mana (mana is already tight in this deck, non-black mana even more so), and while it can kill bears, it'll never win you the game on its own. Again, Collective Brutality is something you can play in the main that's a clean answer to DRS and company and doesn't dilute your plan A at all. ",1483229370

"XWingTMG","t5_2vsga","If you don't mind building a list specifically to beat that, I'd say those Rebels that looks like great candidates for Plasma Torpedoes to their face regions.

More generally, Autothrusters will do you well against TLTs and against slow ships on her list that can't control range well (like... all of them), as others have said.

Bearing those two items in mind, consider this list:   [Soontir Fel, Inquisitor, Tomax Bren](http://geordanr.github.io/xwing/?f=Galactic%20Empire&amp;d=v4!s!163:18,73:27:15:;190:140,126,136,-1,-1,-1:-1:25:;28:18:5:15:M.1&amp;sn=Unnamed%20Squadron).

* Tomax gets you through shields in the first turn
* Crack Shot virtually guarantees the plasma torp hit, and counters Jan Ors if Tomax lasts
* Autothrusters is a direct counter to TLTs
* For the end game, both Inqy and Soontir are favored in any 1v1
* You have a 99 point list, allowing you to force Miranda to take initiative and move before Inqy and Tomax.  In addition to the obvious benefit to Inquisitor's positioning, this allows Tomax to take a target lock on Miranda during the first shooting round, should he want to.


I'd approach this match by having Tomax and Soontir together with Inqy opposite, or having the three ships evenly spread.  In both cases, the goal is to get the enemy to separate her ships, then use your mobility to get Soontir and Inqy over to help out Tomax with whoever landed on him.  If the enemy refuses to break formation, attempt to flank with your dog fighters and accept a joust with Tomax - he'll get at least one torpedo off.

The vital objective is to get Soontir and Inqy into good position on the same turn Tomax engages.  Partly, this is so they plink some unmodified damage into whoever Tomax is targeting, but mainly so that they're setup for range 1-2 attacks to confirm the kill on the next round.

Regarding target priority, I'd say go for Thane, since he's got the best regen and is best at piercing your Autothrusters.  Unfortunately, Soontir firing before Tomax means that Plasma Torpedoes might be wasted against Thane's mere 3 shields, so it might be worth giving up your initiative bid in order to upgrade to Proton Torps instead.  If you can get all your ships on Thane, it's possible he'll go down in the first shooting round, and likely he'll go down in the second.",1483229371

"sanfrancisco","t5_2qh3u","why not all their competitors get it. It is to the point that you can only survive in the market through corporate welfare. True free market capitalism has not existed in the US for over 100 years. Tesla has needed multiple funded rounds as well as taking loans from the US government just to get off the ground. They needed 187 million in private funding just to make the first 147 roadsters. Plus 465million in government loans prior to their IPO, the same program gave Ford 5.9 billion in loans and nissan 1.4 billion.

There is a reason tech has the most amount of start ups because it currently has the lowest barrier to entry. Even starting a restaurant has a higher barrier to entry than selling thing online. You need multiple licenses and inspections just to get off the ground, in the end this is probably for the better but it does mean that we are putting burden on companies that makes it hard to survive. Is it any surprise that they then beg for the same government that taxes and licenses them for money?",1483229373

No one looks at album sales and says, 'yeah they produce the best music.' It's more like the most popular. Drake went 4 times platinum on a frankly mediocre Drake album thanks to the radio and white girls being told it was good and riding his dick claiming it to be the best fucking album ever when it wasn't close to his best work (yeah I guess this is just my opinion but I don't think I'm alone). J Cole is no different, just at a slightly smaller scale. Record sales are literally irrelevant. I wish this meme would die because it perpetuates that only marketing and commercial formulaic success means good music. 

That being said, how's that double platinum with NO GRAMMIES treating J Cole?

All these flavors (both artificial and natural), sugars, alcohol and traces of peanuts in some cases, are not meant to be constantly inhaled. The solution would be to vape pure flavorless, but very few people have caught on to that or are willing to do it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy it's helping people transition and that many have quit the nasty habit of smoking, but I advise everyone who is able to do just that - transition, use vaping as a way to ween off of smoking, not as a complete replacement for many years/the rest of your life.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

you will have to get creative in trying to record complete pieces of music (as you would with any one synth) but it's pretty versatile, can definitely get bass, leads, pads, percussion out of it.

it's definitely limited, there are other virtual analog synths in the same price range that have more features, but none with the interface of the CS so it's a tradeoff.",1483229378

I highly doubt he truly understands himself (most people can't). Basically he feels shattered and resentful of you because you are doing so much better than him so he insults you to bring you down to elevate himself. His behavior is very disturbing and show you his deep seated beliefs. While you can do counseling, it is doubtful you will actually change those core beliefs. Its really hard to tell some people can change. Its a case by case basis. I would say get out because when that respect line is crossed calling you a c**t and all that stuff, that is just crazy. You been with him a long time and I know and its hard to let someone go but would want him back and knowing he resents you because of your success?",1483229381

The summary is that I will definitely consider approval of FPTP to be a broken promise.  The only way that I could grudgingly give the LPC a pass is if they start putting some serious effort into convincing Canadians that FPTP has to go, that they actively and fully engage FPTP proponents in public forums and still fail to convince Canadians that we deserve genuine majority rule.",1483229381

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","The best thing about Amagi on high-tier matches is that everyone seems to underestimate it for some reason. It's actually really tanky when angled well and the guns are fantastic. Ships like Montana, Iowa and Yamato tend to ignore you because ""you're only tier 8"" and broadside you or angle against something they perceive as more dangerous, but Amagi's guns will easily citadel even a Yamato if they broadside. She fires enough of a broadside that even an AP salvo will give a lot of Destroyers second thoughts too, and her secondaries have fantastic firing arcs forward. 

I think really the only other BBs that give me pause in mine are Izumo and North Carolina, because both tend to favor a bow-in strategy that can make it difficult to deal with them. I've also had a few issues sometimes with taking out Bismarcks and Tirpitzes that decide to angle away from you and retreat, but it's probably just that I tend to continue to fire AP when I should be loading HE sometimes.",1483229382

However, I think that comes from the fact that theaters are more casual then they were say 30 years ago.  My mother remembers going to the theater as not necessarily a big deal, but it was something that was special.  She's talked about how theaters used to be a bit more formal.  Not that you had to dress up, but that the audience was respectful and considerate of this special time at the theaters.

My guess is that the advent of home media for movies has slowly degraded the theater experience because people want the luxuries of watching a movie at home while still going to a big screen to see it.  People will talk and be on their phones more, because that is what they are used to at home which is where they watch the majority of their movies these days.",1483229386

In other MMOs, the ""character"" was often equally matched which meant more skill intensive fights as the battle progressed. Not so much in eve with no skill cap and things like high end ship mods and boosters.",1483229386

"Chiropractic","t5_2r82y","I think the profession has split into the functional and structural camps. 

The functional camp manipulates to improve motion and modulate neurology (in theory) by stimulating mechanoreceptors. They seem to believe in joint fixation or dysfunction, and tend to avoid subluxation because of the strong structural component inherent to the term. Since manipulation has been clearly shown to NOT change the structure of the spine over time, this camp is less reliant on radiographic analysis. 

The structural camp (which I consider myself to be part of) is part of the line of thought originally postulated by the Palmer's as a ""bone-out-of-place"". The early chiropractors clearly thought that they were indeed moving bones by adjusting. With modern technologies and research we know that this is not the case. Thus, the ""corrective"" techniques were born in the 60's which sought to find a way to change the alignment of the spine. This of course necessitated adding an additional therapy besides manipulation, which ended up being traction. Subluxation can still be stretched to describe the global alignment of the spine. You could argue that a kyphotic neck is an example of a subluxated spine since the joints are intact, but out of proper alignment, and this mis-alignment can lead to degeneration and be involved in pain generation. 

However, I do believe that most chiropractors do not care one way or the other. I think that the term subluxation is toxic at this point and should be removed from use since it is both ambiguous and vague, and could be replaced with multiple, more specific terms. ",1483229387

"ethereum","t5_2zf9m","&gt; It's likely to be very price- supportive. That helps most Ethereum development teams, who have much of their capital base in Ether, including of course the Ethereum Foundation.

While the Foundation holds a significant amount of Ether, I don't think that's true for many other projects building on top of Ethereum. And this is basically an argument for inflating the value of holders' assets, regardless of who they are.

&gt; A robust price for ETH also attracts new capital to invest in new Ethereum-related projects, increasing network effect and defending the ecosystem against competing, often rivalrous platforms.

Why would a high price be more attractive than a low one? Relative to what? A _rising_ price may be, but that's a completely different matter.

Maybe if you took a few language courses you'd be able to form a coherent argument. Because ""being good at writing isn't particularly useful to anybody"" is ABSOLUTELY not the same as:

&gt; English, history and women studies majors are by and large less useful to society and the majority of students should pick up STEM related fields. 

But then again, when do I trust a kid who is in his second year of university on his analysis on real life? It's funny how when I studied in my second year of university, so many people had that same opinion. Interestingly, they're much less radical and see the value to people being in lots of different fields, such as history or languages. They seem to realize that the world can't operate on 100% STEM subjects (yet). Why argue when I can just wait for you to realize it on your own?

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","I have a somewhat long story that I posted last night in a different forum. It is anxiety related, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to share it here as well. I am new to Reddit and this thread so I look forward to looking through it and finding some stories and talking to some people who I can relate to about anxiety. Happy New Year!

I just had a pretty crazy 4 hours and I wanted to share it.

Basically I had a breakdown…and then a breakthrough.

The backstory is my life, but I will try to keep it as short as I can so hopefully people read this. I have never posted something so personal, but if even one person gets something from it, I will consider it worth it.

Right now, it is 9 pm on 12/30/16 and if this is not the best thing that has happened to me in 2016, tomorrow is going to be amazing! Technically the last part of it happened about an hour ago and I just decide to write about it. It began at 4 when I was dragging my ass out of a funk and trying to take it to yoga.

Rewinding a little bit, I just arrived home on Wednesday night (today is Friday) from going home to MD for Xmas. Long story short, my parents had a bitter divorce over 20 years ago and still can’t be in the same room so Xmas usually sucks. I wasn’t going to go home but based on some realizations in prior months, I decided I wanted to go home not for Xmas, but to talk to my parents about how their resentment towards one another affected me. I could go on and on with examples of ways they have hurt one another and I probably will write a longer edition because it seems therapeutic, but that’s not for now.

I convinced my parents to meet and so I went home for the holidays for that. I was contemplating not going up until the last minute and cancelled my uber to the airport twice. My anxiety has been reduced for much of the year but started to get very bad when I began making plans to ask my parents to do this. Let’s just say it wasn’t easy. It took a lot of emotion out of me having to come up with 17 different ways to tell each of them how this affected me, what bothers me and ultimately to agree to it. By the time it came around, I was having such a tough time. I told myself I needed to power through it and at least try, so I went. We talked about how their relationship is unhealthy for my family. I told them that they are the parents and need to set a better example. They ended their relationship with each other and that’s fine, but to still hold so much animosity so many years later has affected their relationship with me and my siblings. Even during this conversation they couldn’t help but bring up the past and blame one another for how things are today. Again, this is only the abbreviated version, but basically they just point the finger at one another.

Another key part of this story is, how (I feel) they handled having a gay child. Growing up, I was bullied a lot for being gay (I wasn’t out). This has had a huge factor on my life struggle with anxiety. I never talked about it growing up for fear it would destroy my family, but I found out more recently they knew of it. Growing up in their silence and lack of any type of positive discussion or comments on the topic of anything gay made me feel like I just could not be. I came out at 26 and am now 33. When I came out they said it was ok, but I still sometimes wonder. They still just ignore it, but I have realized that’s just how they handle things.
This was also the first time I have ever had the opportunity to ask them both at the same time why if they both say they knew I was gay, they didn’t talk to me as a child. I have asked them individually, but they usually blame the other. I still don’t feel like I got a good answer, but I think I got an honest answer, which I greatly appreciated. Overall, there were some obstacles in the conversation, but at the time it seemed it was a step in the right direction.

However, more drama happened after and since I have come back and had time to register it all (plus taking into account other things that I am leaving out) I have felt this sense of doom that nothing will change and I might have to just cut off ties with my family. This might sound extreme, but there is more to it. My anxiety until about an hour ago has been at a lifetime high since I left to come home. It is impacting me in ways that effect my livelihood.
I have been doing hot yoga for almost 2 years. It has done wonders for me and my whole mind, body, spirit mindset. I am kind of obsessed.

Well, I rushed to class and made it just in time. I got in and immediately started sweating like a pig. When I first started this happened a lot and to the point of it making me self-conscious, but I came to appreciate that because I think I am literally sweating anxiety out. This was some next level shit though and the fact that it was happening this way so quickly made me realize it was going to be a long class.

Well, it wasn’t because it got so bad, I couldn’t do it. They tell you when you start that you should never leave class, just lay down and make it through. I always did this, even in the beginning, but by the 30th minute, I was out... the door. Another interesting side note on this is that I was late to class and the only spot was right near the door. I think if I were in my normal spot on the floor (opposite end of the door), I never would have done this.

I bolted out without my stuff, went to the locker room and just hung my head in my towel and tried to make sense of what the fuck was happening to me. Since I left my stuff and was not going to go back in to get it during class, I just took a shower and then went out to wait for the class to finish.

As I was waiting, feeling pretty guilty for leaving, people began coming in for the next class. As I mentioned before when you are new, they give you the overview and the most important thing is just don’t leave. Well…, there were a few 1st timers tonight. Also, the teacher for the next class was one of my favorite instructors so as she is telling people this, in my head I am just saying god damnit, this is the one thing that I want to do and I can’t even get through an hour because I am so jammed up with this family shit.
I started to chat with the instructor and some of the other people working and they asked me how my holiday was. I said it was a little stressful but tried to keep it at that. Once I got caught that I left class though, I think they were like, oh shit, he isn’t joking.
Class finished and I did my walk of shame in to grab my stuff. I apologized to the instructor who was along with everyone else was so supportive. One of them even gave me a hug.

As I began walking to my car, I started to get emotional. Mind you, I am kind of an ice queen, so this is odd.

By the time I got to the car, I was in full on bawling (for me) mode.

My friend and I had talked about meeting up earlier in the day, but I was feeling so anxious all day that I said I wanted to try to go to class and see how I felt after. I told her what happened and just vented about my Xmas trip. She and I used to be roommates so she gets my family stuff and we definitely relate to each other with family issues so it’s good we were talking earlier in the day. Otherwise I might have just kept it in. I told her I probably didn’t want to go out but was going to eat and see how I felt. She was going to the gym so she said she would text me after.
Taking it out helped me to really lay out in my head how crazy it all is and how its slowly eating me alive. After more tears and some long talks with myself I realized that… Fuck them…. I have told myself in the past, but this time I feel like I believe it. I realized that my whole life I have gone out of my way to try to accommodate them. Whether it was trying to convince myself I wasn’t gay for fear of what they would think, acting as if everything is hunky dory when I go home or even just going home since I have probably done that over 40 times for the last 13 years. During that same time, my 5 members of my family combined have visited me a total of 6 times (and I have lived in some pretty amazing places).
Anyways, all these thoughts went through my mind. I also came to the realization that I have, at times, allowed them to make me feel ashamed for being gay. I’m not saying it’s their fault and I wouldn’t even think this was intentional, but they have. This is due to other factors (such as politics) but the pain has always been there and I just uncovered that.

Once I realized this, I feel like everything I felt before just kinda washed away. I realized that allowing these things to stress me out has only gotten in my own way. Not just with accepting myself, but in every other way that this anxiety has tormented me (relationships, socially, physically).

Going from such a bad place to how I feel now in such a short time is crazy. I feel like I just let a huge weight off my shoulders! I'm looking very forward to putting this new attitude to work in 2017!",1483229397

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","I didn't say anything about government subsidies. A $15/hr wage would force small businesses to raise prices and cut jobs. People around here already grumble at the prices of the small town stores, any drastic increase will push the ability of these small businesses to survive. 

Yes it will create demand, but that demand will flood to big supermarkets like Wal-Mart. Who cares if it is nearly a 40 mile drive? Drive up once a month and buy in bulk. Then you're saving money, and that business dies. Jobs leave and the town goes with them. Then you have those rural job seekers move into the cities, and flood the job market. Big businesses aren't hiring because there are many job seekers most positions are filled. Smaller ones can't afford to hire more. Some jobs are eliminated because it costs too much to keep them. A large amount people can't find jobs and become homeless, others fall back on government assistance, putting more burden on the tax payer. Not to mention all of these jobless people might end up defaulting on debts in huge numbers, and suddenly you have 2008 all over again.

Now of course that is a worst case scenario, and a bit of a hyperbole I will admit. But what I'm saying is a $15 national minimum wage will help urban populations and hurt rural ones. And people will remember when they lost their job because their position was too expensive to keep. No progressive platform or revolution will ever get off the ground without the support of at least part of the rural population, and you don't get that support by trying to force policies down their throats that they've openly said are too extreme or that they don't want. You do it by compromising and meeting them halfway there.",1483229399

"instantpot","t5_31q4c","I made this messy lasagna recipe. I used a full pound of ground turkey (trying to cut down the red meat consumption), and added half a pound of Italian sausage, as recommended by one of the reviewers. I didn't have bow tie pasta on hand, and used rotini instead. Also, be sure to season it generously - I probably doubled the amount it calls for. I didn't have plain tomato sauce, so I just threw in a jar of spaghetti sauce I had sitting in the pantry. Think it was ""Classico"" brand 4 cheese marinara or something. It turned out wonderfully! Next time I make it, I will add more garlic (who on this earth only uses ONE clove of garlic in anything?!! I used at least 3 and that still was wasn't enough) and salt, and maybe some mushrooms. Because I love me some mushrooms.  And slightly  less noodles - I tossed in an entire box of rotini, plus maybe 1/3 cup from another box, which is ended up making waaaaaay too much food. Be sure to add enough water/liquid to cover noodles. If some edges are poking out, that's ok. Cooked on high pressure for 5 minutes (look on the box of noodles for cooking instructions. Cut that time in half, and that's your pressure cooking time). It takes a bit of time to come to pressure, because there was so much in the pot. It made a metric shit ton of food. 3 of us ate it all week.

Original Post:

Author: /u/Benjalzz

**My [24 M] Girlfriend's[F/21] Grandfather [M/82]may be in danger from his new spouse. We need advice**
&gt;This is a long and convoluted story but i will do my best to explain.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I will refer to the grandfather as Jim. Jim lost his wife to a stroke 5 years ago and remarried about 9 months ago. His new wife ""Linda"" is much younger, mid 60s. She seems very nice and is very charismatic. Jim on the other hand is very hard of hearing, pretty mentally sharp but otherwise what you would expect of someone in his 80s.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim is also very wealthy, his late wife had a large life insurance policy and left Jim everything, with nothing going to his children or grandchildren. Jim has in turn wrote his entire will, including many family artifacts to Linda.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Since their marriage, strange things have happened. Jim's grandson was living with him since he is still in college, Linda demanded he move out, a few months later, her 32 year old deadbeat son was able to move in rent free. Now that doesnt sound suspicious, shitty but whatever. Jim is on a a steady dose of medication vital to his health. Linda claims to be a natural health nut and tries to stop him from taking his medicine.
&gt; A month after, they were in an accident, Linda was driving. She ran a redlight and rear-ended a vehicle going 45. According to Jim, he was wearing his seatbelt but it mysteriously became unfastened right before the accident. Jim hit his head hard on the windshield and wanted to go to the hospital. Linda refused. Jims daughter, Jamie, had his power of attorney and when she got to the scene of the accident was enraged that Linda was trying to keep him from the hospital. Jaimie told Jim to go to the hospital and that was that. A week later, Linda tells Jamie and the whole family that Linda now has power of attorney.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim has not said anything about abuse or anything like that but myself and my GF's famil feel this woman and her son are evil and trying to kill Jim. We feel powerless to stop her and powerless to prove anything.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; They are not concerned with the money or the artifacts, they just want him to be safe. He is oblivious of any wrong doing and thinks she has his best interest at heart.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Is there anything we can/should do?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; tl;dr: GF's grandfathers(Jim) new spouse(Linda) made sure the will be put in her name, since then, bad things have been happening to Jim. Power of attorney got changed to Linda after a suspicious accident. We do not know how to help him, as he does not feel anything bad is going on. We are afraid for his life.",1483229404

It's just crazy to me that people believe that if my cats are outside, they are automatically murdering several birds a day for fun and that I sit around with popcorn like I'm watching a movie or something. If you see a cat hunting a bird, ruin the hunt. If my cat brings a dead bird, I hope the bird finds peace later on and that I'm sorry it happened.

Working at mcdonalds, and it's 11pm. We're doing the end of day reboot and by we I mean that my manager was downstairs doing the paper work and all that jazz while I manned the upstairs. 
The headset beeps and a I tell the woman at the speaker were restarting the systems and to please pull through and return in about 10 minutes. She chose to stay there so by the end of the restart there is like ten cars idling behind her honking their horns and wondering what the fuck is up. 

I take her order, it's 40 chicken nuggets, four large fries and a handful of burgers and for someone who had just spent like 15 minutes sitting in front of menu it took an astonishing 7 minutes to get out her order in entirety. Since she essentially wasted everyone's time behind her I continue to take the orders of other people before asking her for her money. I take a few orders but I'm not hearing the woman's food come up. I peak around the corner out of first window to find that the manager has gone back downstairs and the night grill staff member hadn't showed. 

I go back to grill and put down three bags of nuggets, and than ran out to ask for the woman's payment, give her her drinks and tell her I'd be back with her food in a few, she went on about how much of her time had been wasted now and how she was sure all of the people behind her would be extremely angry at me as well.
So I'm out back making up her order with all of its particularities, and forty nuggets.
I'm taking orders for front end and the drive thru. 
I was pretty frustrated at this point and I was sure this want was here for the sole purpose of fucking with me. 
I bring her order to the window and give to her, it's been 23 minutes since I began to take her order. 

She looks up at me and asks if she can get like 10 extra packs of mcchicken sauce. I looked her dead in the eye and said, ""we charge ten cents per extra packing, that's a dollar fifteen."" It was a mcdonalds, I usually just gave customers the packets and called it a day but not this woman. 
She began to throw a fit, ""what do you mean ten cents a pack just give me my sauce."" Blahblah. I don't know if she drinks mayo or what but she refused to pay and actually got out of her car with it still parked at the window, came inside and threw her drink at me as she went in behind the counter and grabbed a handful of mcchicken sauce. 

My manager basically watched all of this unfold on the security cameras from the basement but chose to stay down there and let me run the show. 
The best part in my opinion was that I was suppose to be off at 11 but no staff showed up and the manager just didn't want to deal with any of it.

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","Hmm.  I mostly use Linux.  On that platform, I've experimented with Artofillusion ( http://artofillusion.org ), OpenSCAD, Blender, and BRL-CAD.  All of these can produce STL files.  

Artofillusion has a really quick learning curve, but it's easy to get in trouble by making models which be printed (like an MC Escher painting, they cannot exist in the real world).  

OpenSCAD is very useful for some kinds of models.  It is very code- and math-intensive. Having some experience with writing software helps a lot.  You may also need to make some of trial prints to get the thing that you're building to match with real-world objects.  

Blender I tried but found really difficult to master.  I understand that they've re-worked the UI, so perhaps I should give it another shot.

I'm now experimenting with BRL-CAD ( http://brl-cad.org ). It's pretty clunky, but very stable. The documentation can be difficult to master as well. So far I'm still a  BRL-CAD N00B, but it seems promising.

As far as working with physical items, I've found that the digital caliper is Your Friend.  Scanning an object into a file is usually a pretty involved process.  You often have to do multiple transformations to get from the scanned data to something which you can actually work with. 3D scanning involves multiple pictures taken from precise positions. Your best bet may be to hook up with your local makerspace or university in order to use their equipment to get your initial data.",1483229406

There are people in this world who are grizzly bears. They do not play well with others. They are single-minded, stalwart, and stubborn. They don't live in harmony with the world, because they don't have to...  

...To them, life is not a journey, it's a game. And people aren't passengers, they're obstacles...

...Despite being so furry, Grizzly bears are NAKED. They're unaware of this, however, but the fact remains...

...But when you put underpants (metaphorical underpants) on a grizzly, it reminds him that his ""balls"" are showing and makes him aware of his own faults and weaknesses.

I too was a naive TBM who assumed everyone around me believed the same I did.  I had no idea how much variance there is even among active Mormons; and neither do they.  The church has a vested interest in not clarifying tough doctrinal or historical questions because people will be shocked to discover nobody has agreed on those questions for decades.

In addition, a common thread I've noticed in almost everyone I've met who has left the church is that the fact that it is false overrides any community or fellowship that membership could provide.  For me (and many exmos like me) it is more important to be honest and not pretend (lie) just to stay in the club.  For many people who stay, however, staying in the club is so important they won't even let themselves acknowledge any possibility that it might all be made up.  I don't think they're dishonest, it's just that their affinity for remaining _in_ the group is so strong, they cannot even comprehend something that might challenge that.",1483229411

"australia","t5_2qh8e","My tips for language learning:

There is no better way to master a language than to use it in an interactive way. Find a Spanish speaker and just talk to them (don't pay for a Spanish teacher, any native speaker is fine). If they can correct you, that's great, if not, that's fine too. Input (reading, watching TV, listening to podcasts) is great for vocabulary, but the immediate combination of input and output that you get from a conversation is better than any learning tool that you can buy (and anyone who tells you otherwise is probably trying to sell you a learning tool).

Hela and her army (plus surtir too?) invade, Thor prepares to fight but suddenly Odin betrays them.. and it turns out it's loki.. (10 min)

Hela betrays Loki, and somehow loki and thor get to earth (break out of prison? hela exiles them? Bonus points for mjolnir destroyed)
(10 min)

So there's ~2 hours left, assuming whatever ragnarok final battle scene is will simply be a battle on asgard against hela, which would be half an hour at most for an extravagent battle, There can be 1.5 hours left to go to earth, find odin/strange somehow, end up on some gladiator arena and meet valkyrie and executioner and the grandmaster... 

Plenty of time.

Most likely the only true main villain will be Hela/grandmaster, and true hero pairing being thor, hulk, perhaps valkyrie.. It's doable.

Oh and my timeline is probably totally off as I have no clue how the transition between earth and gladiator scenes will work out.. but if the gladiator fights and valkyire/executioner/grandmaster introductions all happen on asgard (but I hope they dont), that streamlines the story even further. Say.. Hela wants to torment her prisoners and pits them in battles to the death with monsters and warriors from across the 9 realms.",1483229414

Organizing large groups of people for tasks isn't that difficult. They can still enjoy themselves and work. It just takes people to plan, train, and supervise who have done this on a large scale. It is done every year by other organizations. Pull your head out of your ass and look to them for advice or breakdown and pay for a staffing agency where volunteers just aren't working out. 

Charging volunteers means they are no longer volunteers. They are now paid attendees at a discounted rate who are working in exchange for that discounted rate. People may have been born at night but it wasn't last night.

Growing up watching Disney movies (or most movies for that matter) it's always emphasized how it's just something you know. A special feeling that cannot be described. That it is magical and mysterious. That it is always happily ever after.

The problem with all of this is that it's not so magical or difficult to grasp. While being in love can certainly make life feel magical, it in itself is not so difficult to understand or achieve. It just takes two things. Hard work and attraction.

Love is something that is built over time. It must be worked for. It is accepting without trying to change. It should be unconditional. 

That being said there must be some attraction to get started hence the term falling in love. What that really is, is attraction/lust. 

So if the attraction is there and this person has some or most of the qualities you think another person should have then go for it. But be prepared for hard work if you really want love. There is no such thing as happily ever after. There are ups and downs and often disagreements but it certainly is an adventure worth taking.

people keep saying 'it's good tracer tracking!' but others like you and myself think it is suspicious, for exactly the same reasons

if it's as good of aim as some people say, why on the slow moving rein is he not shooting the rein in the head area?

and why is his crosshairs swerving like that when he shoots? to me it makes it look like a soft locking aimbot, that goes for the body and tries to compensate for spread by jiggling around on body

'good aim' is straight and efficient, this guy would seem to have good aim with his snaps and perfect tracking, yet why does his reticle move like that? there's no purpose for it, then when you try to look at how sluggish his movements look to be, the fact he isn't going side to side in case someone turns to aim at him, none of that really matches him having amazing game/mechanics, he just has really good aim.. yet for some odd reason, he does inexplicable things with his mouse while he's locked on

to me, it looks like aimbot is all i was saying, he keeps saying he learned to aim from top 500 players but i've never seen mouse movement like that on anyone but a few people i've thought have fishy aim, it just looks like a more sublte aimbot to me",1483229417

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","Ask for their portfolio and reverse image search it to see if anyone else has it (some people will copy a portfolio and pass it off as their own). If you like their style then you can get down to business...

Basically everything that makes someone a ""pro"" has nothing to do with the actual images. It's all about preparing for shit to hit the fan:

Do they have a backup camera for when the first breaks?
Do they have multiple lenses for when the primary breaks? (They don't necessarily need multiple copies of the same lens because a good pro will have a range of lenses with some overlap and can work around it)
Do they have multiple batteries? (I didn't... once. Now I have a bajillion)
Do they have a second shooter? Is that person on staff or sub-contracted (if subbed out, when/how do they pick that person and will you have any say in the matter? Basically, are they going to hire the first random joe off of craigslist?)
Have they been to your venue?
Do they have a shot list (some of the more seasoned pros will have a shot list template for you to fill out so they can plan their day)?
Ask them to walk you through the day. If they can't describe how they're going to work like they've done it before then they probably haven't done it before. You're looking for them to say things like ""while you're getting dressed I'll be doing the x, y, and z shots of the dress/shoes/etc while Sally the second shooter is getting shots of the dining room before people come in and mess it up."" 

I would point out that there is a very well respected photographer, Mel DiGiacomo, that is really a photojournalist that does the occasional wedding and he would fail pretty much any interview question, but you can't afford him anyway.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","So how do you feel about the total cost of 'bookshelf' speakers once you've factored in the cost of the stands?

After having both bookshelves and floor standers I see bookshelf speakers as a special case only solution.  As in, the only room I have is on top of a cabinet or an actual shelf for the speakers. I've got a set of Mirage OM3s chilling on the TV stand next to the TV as there's no room for stands and the mandatory sub to fill in the bass these speakers don't have.  Would they sound better farther out in empty space?  Sure but we do what we have to...

The better value in speakers, to me, is much greater in the tower version of the bookshelf speaker that caught my eye.  The added benefit is the tower can use the space of the no longer needed stand to add volume to assist with the bass reproduction aspect of the speaker vs. just hold the bookshelf in space.  Plus some towers take up less floorspace than a stand.

I get it if the wallet says no to the extra 10-20% cost of a tower setup vs. bookshelf and stand but wanted to ask the question in case you hadn't thought of this possibility.

Wharefdale 10.1 and 10.4 former owner, the 10.4s worked well in a non-standard audio setup, i.e. in an L-shaped room.  They sounded rather even and full across the space.  The biggest drawback was the beamy nature of the tweeters but sitting farther from the speakers would help eliminate that.

Red Mountain located in the Sunset Isles, Mount Munmirk (Mun-Mirk Maywa) located in Maywangidia, Jade Mountain (Jet Malai) located in Elhan, and Mount Micitepetl in Micoatlan.

All four mountains had the same local legend about them, despite each of them being separated by oceans and unconnected cultures. The legends have some differences, particularly in the gods involved and how the world was created, but they all share the same story that when the world was made the gods found four dragons. The dragons displeased the gods so they sealed them away in four mountains spread across the world. No one really took much notice of these legends until the year 1148 AuP (1 AA) when the sleeping dragon beneath Red Mountain was awakened by the High Queen of the Sunset Isles as part of a deal to help gain independence for her people.

Now each mountain remains the home of the awakened dragons, and are the religious and political centres of their respective countries. Red Mountain is a loan standing volcanic mountain surrounded by highly fertile plains and the capital city of Tredragon. Mount Munmirk is a tall snow-covered rocky peak in an otherwise arid land. It's also the source of a major river and again has a large city at it's base. Jade Mountain is almost completely covered in thick tropical forests and is the tallest peak in a long central mountain range, again it's also home to the capital city of the Naga empire. Finally Mount Micitepetl is a large dark rock in the centre of a lake. The city of Micitepetltlan is built on this lake and surrounded the mountain. Canals criss-cross the floating stone city up to the base of the mountain itself.",1483229422

"ClickerHeroesBot","t5_3fl9m","**GENERAL SCRIPT INFORMATION - PLEASE READ**

*WHY A NEW SCRIPT?*

I have stopped using Sw1ftBot since it's not useful for much more than clicking rubies at this point. The game still needs to be ""babysat"" with leveling ancients, reconfiguring the bot between runs, and starting off new transcensions. With all the bugs that have been cropping up, this seemed like a good time to start using something else.

*WHAT DOES IT DO?*

This script clicks fish. That is all. It's a tool to assist with repetitive parts of the game, not a bot to play the game for you completely. Use an auto-clicker to level your hero and you're all set!

*HOW DO I USE IT?*

You will need an image of the fish (fish.png) in the same directory as the script; make sure to run the script from the same folder the image is located in. Create an image using the instructions below.
To use the script, run the game in low quality mode, any client should work fine. Start by pressing F1 with Clicker Heroes as the active window, and stop/reload with F2.

*HOW TO CREATE AN IMAGE OF THE FISH*

1.) press Print Screen

2.) open up MS Paint

3.) paste with Ctrl-V

4.) Crop out the fish

5.) Zoom in all the way

6.) Crop out a few pixels - 4x4 or 5x5 works fine. Get the eyes and some of the center.

7.) Overwrite the fish.png file with this image.

8.) Reload the script with F2 and start it up again with F1.

Make sure you are in LOW QUALITY mode when getting the image and when running the script. This way the images will match.",1483229423

I think that sticking to the facts and what will be done by who and when is a good idea. My son had a hard time when he was unsure about part of the process.

Gneisenau is a ship with a relatively low skill threshold. While better players of course do better with it, bad players can get decent results with it as well, which is why it has the best T7 average stats (bar Scharnhorst, but premiums usually tend to do a little better because of their player base). If you are looking for a T7 ship with a higher skill payoff however, you might want to look at the Nagato instead.

Seriously though, 8w7 ENTP is someone like, say, Jordan Belfort, of Wolf of Wall Street (not a very moral guy, but he really embodies the capabilities of the type). In his book, he talks about how when he was a kid, he used to get all freaked out by his wild imagination when he was trying to go to sleep, and he used to multiply the numbers on his bedside clock to calm himself down.

Let's say you write something that one of the ""Facebook Heroes"" finds offensive.

It's crazy how it's a number that we're supposed to give out to lots of people (like employers, banks, and so forth), but it also needs to be kept super duper secret. Otherwise it can be used to ruin you life for several years. It's like having the password be the same as the username.

Yep. According to Republicans, doctors should be allowed to discriminate against their patients.

"dvdcollection","t5_2sm9e","I said new and classic. Though since you mention New World which is only 11 years old I think that counts as a classic. Is there an agreed upon length of time outside of the immediate release? 20 years?15? I think it refers to a film which still is being discussed and enjoyed after its initial release window. Have you seen it. The blu ray releases this year is simply stunning. 

And ok maybe I was a bit negative. I did start saying love what you love and that this is a subjective thing. However there were a ton of amazing releases this year in regards to quality of the film, quality of the blu ray image and quality of the supplements. I mean look at Criterion or Arrow's amazing releases to name just a couple of companies. Saying Sully was one of the top ten releases of the year and not even mentioning releases like Brighter Summer Day, The New World or the Dekalog is kinda like saying Hanson was  one of the top ten albums of the year and not even mentioning Nirvana's Nevermind or Radiohead's The Bends (yes I know they came out at different times but you get my point). It may be true that that person genuinely loved the Hanson record (I like them myself and don't want to pick on them too much) but If someone did that they could also get comments that they may need to expand their horizons. And I only mentioned Criterion. 

I mean two of his top 10 of the year are actually lacking significant features. Star Trek beyond did that bullshit splitting of extras between different stores like they did with Into Darkness and Hateful 8 is missing the roadshows version. He mentions this but surely these are points against films in his top 10 blurays of 2016?!? I would think a top ten blu ray list would indicate films that are great films, look amazing, and have amazing bonus features. Otherwise this is just a favourite movies list. Fair enough but worthy of some criticism.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Calling it ""not mathematics at all"" is overstating your position.

Sometimes, properties stated in terms of representations of numbers are related to whatever you consider ""real mathematics"". A number is rational if and only if has a periodic decimal representation. Q[alpha] has degree at most 2 over Q if and only if alpha has a periodic continued fraction representation. The number of times that a prime p occurs as a factor of n! is (n-s)/(p-1), where s is the sum of the digits of n written in base p. (And the number of times that p occurs as a factor of (a+b choose a) is the number of times you have to carry a digit when you add the numbers a and b in base p.) The Cantor set is the set of numbers in [0,1] which have a ternary representation that uses only the digits 0 and 2.

Whether or not pi is normal is a mathematical question. Maybe not a very fundamental or important one, but a mathematical one nevertheless. The fact that we have a spigot algorithm for digits of pi in base 16 but not in base 10 is also part of mathematics.

I'm glad you brought up perfect numbers as an example, by the way. I personally have never had much reason to care whether the proper factors of a number add up to that number, and it strikes me as one of those unmotivated ""numerological"" things. Not as much as palindromic numbers or whatever, because like you say that even depends on what base you write things in, but in that ballpark.",1483229440

"metalgearsolid","t5_2s4hr","&gt;I beg to differ. His entire arc was based around fighting with the intention of philathropy.

That's just a fan misconception. He, during the period of between MGS1 and MGS2, dismantled several bootlegged Metal Gears in order to stop the obvious. He devoted his existence during those years to preventing the world from abusing Metal Gears. Aside from that, he's mainly been a soldier sent on missions (not to undermine the awesomeness that is Solid Snake of course). Big Boss has had more personality development, and more emotional development imo. But besides that, I think we could both agree that Big Boss' saga is more emotionally charged in the fact that the decisions are based on emotions, whereas Solid's saga is based on what needs to be done, only acting on his own in MGS2. 

&gt;Examples of what...?

How Big Boss' character is remotely similar to the one in TPP. 

&gt;You keep saying this, but you're not giving me any context to see it backed up. 

I would say you're arguably guilty of the exact same thing. You can't just say a character would do something because they've done something largely unrelated to what you're describing. 

I already explained why Big Boss isn't the kind of guy TPP tries to portray him as in my other comment(s). He cares for the soldiers Gene kills in PO, he helps people who lack soldiers to fight for them in PW, throws parties for soldiers, recruits probably as much if not more often than he kills, etc. You've told me pretty much nothing to make me believe TPP accurately portrayed Big Boss' character.

&gt;Naked fights for peace, right? 

In Peace Walker, he fights for those without armies or troops to call their own. He was only unwilling to go against his home country at first, but even then decided to do it anyway.  

&gt;Yet he arms himself with nukes and built up a paramilitary group.

Did you even read my comment? Because I'm starting to doubt it. Big Boss only equipped Zeke with a nuke in case some country tried to blow them off the map for whatever reason. That nuke was their only threat against countries that may have just wanted to eliminate them. And even ***then***, Boss feels uneasy about it. You try to warp reality and turn him into a war monger, but that's not where he's at yet. That's the point that MGSV's was supposed to bring us up to. 

&gt;Mother Base is destroyed, all he built was taken. Skullface is gunning for him. What are the options: wake up and build up a group while trying to fight for peace AND battle Skullface...or ensure that the fight for peace can go on by throwing out a decoy to distract Skullface.

Again, this part is all on Kojima. Being able to build a new base and a new group while Cipher or XOF is gunning for him could have easily built up the legend more, but he decided to have Big Boss do nothing for some reason and have a medical employee do the deed. What I'm saying is Big Boss could've done it if the plot allowed it. Venom Snake going through the game actually undermines Big Boss, as it means Big Boss could've done the same if Kojima hasn't written him ou- I mean if he hadn't ""abandoned"" Mr. Faceless Nurse. 

&gt;The best thing for Naked was to start fresh; presumed dead he has no baggage.

He doesn't change his face and Foxhound still hires him to be their commander. The only thing TPP managed to add is the requirement to do mental gymnastics to figure out how Big Boss got where he was. Especially considering he was ""*active*"" around the same time he was presumably doing paperwork business.. do these people just not know about this?

&gt;No one needed MGS3.

No one needed Metal Gear Solid 2 either. What MGS3 was made to do is expand on the plot, and you know what? ***It did that***. Along with that, PO, MGS4, PW, GZ, and TPP are all based around MGS3. MGS3 could be argued to be the most important in the series.

 On the other hand, how important was what MGSV  added? If you took MGSV away, are there any significant things the series would lose? We know Big Boss becomes a dick *somehow*, and that he recreates Foxhound, trains Solid, rescues Sniper Wolf, etc. What did MGSV do to answer any questions? The only relevant thing I could think of was Miller being angry at Big Boss. On the flipside, the game ruins Liquid's origin story by contradicting what was told. MGSV doesn't add enough to negate what it messed with, unlike MGS3. I think it's simple. MGS3 inspired plot points from other games, MGSV has the opportunity to *expand* on them, but doesn't. It's simple. 

&gt;MGS2 could have ended the series

And I could've ate that Ice Cream scoop that landed on the floor, but it would still taste crappy. MGS2 is one of the best in the series imo, but it doesn't serve as an ending as well as people like it to. MGS4 is a testament to that. We wouldn't have MGS4 if people didn't mind Liquid running off with the Ray unit and never heard from again (not do mention the whole Patriots thing in the post-credits). Again, I love MGS2, but it's not a proper ending. 

&gt;V allowed the series the come full circle

If you think MGSV makes the series into a circle then I don't know what to tell you. I don't know about you, but my circles close, and MGSV didn't really do that at all. It was succeeding at showing Big Boss become more merciless, even if not the way most would hope, then sucker punches us with a bland, generic ""body double"" plot twist at the end, making us still crave the explanation for why Big Boss is suddenly a bad dude (which the game was meant to explain). Along with that, the game makes us wonder what happens to the third virus and Sahelanthropus, then never explains either.

 MGSV didn't even close itself. 

&gt;everyone should agree with you...

You could say, as a bland and tired out example, that Hitler was right, but most people would disagree. You could say MGS3 was bad/unneeded/caused confusion, but similarly, many people would disagree. It speaks for itself. I'm simply explaining my own thoughts on why MGSV doesn't do what it was meant to. 

&gt;What do you think? Facts?

It's a fact that the majority of the fanbase loves MGS3, contrary to whatever you'd like to believe when you close your eyes at night, and it's not a fact that a lot of people, contrary to what the now apologist r/metalgearsolid would have you believe, were (and still are) upset with what MGSV did with the lore it was given. I've already said multiple times that every comment I've made is my opinion, but your comment on MGS3 is just an unpopular one. Don't cry to me about it. 

&gt;How would his voice have fit the edgy tone?

No matter the tone of the game, that man is the voice of Snake. They could recast RDJ as Iron Man for Avengers 3, and while he's the same character, he's still different in other ways. If they wanted us to connect with Snake, then they should've kept his voice is all I'm saying. I'll take cheesy over mumbling. 

&gt;Don't give me that. We've already seen the affects of Ocelot's hypnosis previously. 

Yes, the magical hypnosis that somehow allows you to share the same physical capabilities as someone higher than you. Also, your argument makes even more sense considering Ocelot didn't have Liquid's voice in MGS4 when he cut Liquid's influence (arm) off and resorted to *full* hypnotherapy. So a less advanced version of what couldn't replicate voice or physical attributes can do it if the plot demands it basically?

&gt;VENOM WAS A TRAINED SOLDIER WORKING DIRECTLY UNDER NAKED; ONE WITH A CONNECTION TO HIM.

The whole point of Les Enfants Terribles was to capitalize on Big Boss' soldier genes. Big Boss' soldier genes are, in fact, a major plot point in this series. I'm sorry that I'm not as okay with some random faceless medic we haven't known about until the very game that we play as him being Big Boss' physical equal as you are. Forgive me. 

&gt;So what you're saying is: ""I didn't like it, therefore anyone that did relate shouldn't have ever had the opportunity to."" 

What I'm saying is, if non-white non-males can't enjoy it, then it doesn't serve it's purpose. I know you missed my point on purpose since you lack the ability to counter it, but try not to bring it up next time if you actually missed it. 

&gt;Evident by the ""should've been replaced with Naked comment

This is apart of Big Boss' saga, and the game was promised to be the ""missing link"" that also explains how  ""men become demons"". Sorry that multiple people wanted the game to deliver on what it promised, instead of point us in a direction that goes nowhere (Venom).

&gt;there's really no point wasting the time arguing.

I had no intention of spending New Years battling it out on r/metalgearsolid yet again, so this may be the only point we agree on. ",1483229442

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Why control others? Why intentionally create war? Why indoctrinate? Why push agendas? They can't just rule themselves, they have to be plagues on mankind too?

Well two things.  First of all I am arguing they don't have the control you think they do.  Second of all I already answered.  The reasons people do something is usually they see a perceived gain that exceeds the perceived cost and so they act to improve their situation whether in some tangible way like wealth of intangible way like happiness.

Let us however consider say someone who has an arms manufacturing company.  They employ people to make weapons.  They may push, through lobby groups, actions that encourage conflicts or sell arms to places to escalate those conflicts.  They may just make the decision that someone is going to sell weapons to them so it might as well be them that takes advantage of it.  The reason why they wouldn't move to try to minimise violence in foreign locals is that doing so directly makes their life and the lives of those they employ worse.  Maybe their cost benefit analysis is wrong sure people make mistakes but there are really easily considered reasons why someone might do these things.

It sounds though like you have some preconceived notion of what the natural human mindset and that it demands some kind of outside intervention to change it.  Perhaps if you considered that the desires and drives of the human race are a little more neutral or varied than you think it could help you to realise why some of this happens.",1483229442

USB keyboard, I'm guessing? Probably some of the bugs still left in the XHCI (USB3) bus manager are biting. Creating a bug report with a syslog and the output of the ""listdev"" and ""listusb"" commands would help us debug it. (And if you can set EHCI [USB2] mode in the BIOS, that's a quick way to get around the problem - but Lenovo machines are all that support that, afaik.)

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;That's not what neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is a reactionary form of economics that pushes deregulation and privatization of the economy. Analytical Marxists don't believe that.

Jesus Christ.. The attempt to assume rationality of consumers in the market is literally an emergent concept from the neoclassical tradition. Look up Martin Hollis critique of rational choice theory and the neoclassical assumption of the role of instrumental reason in the market place. These are all manifestations of neoliberal economics. And moreover, your definition of neoliberalism is naive and myopic to begin with. 

&gt;This is all rhetoric and with a few word swaps you could easily say the same thing about orthodox Marxism being ""dogmatic worship of continental philosophy.""

Marxism is dogmatic in a lot of cases. I'm skeptical of any mode of acquiring knowledge that refuses to localize itself to that which its equipped to investigate, which is why analytical philosophy is such shit. 

&gt;Yes, they deny these economic areas of Marxism because they believe them to be empirically false, but they hold onto Marxism itself and are proponents of different areas of Marxism. What you see as a ""liberalization"" of Marxism (which sounds like tankie dogma rhetoric) is called doing science and attempting to falsify and prove various claims. Marxism isn't a religious dogma but an empirical method.

Yeah and they're wrong. I'm all about critiquing Marx's ideas. I think Marx was wrong about plenty of stuff, the Asiatic mode of production is wrong, lumpenprole theory is wrong, Marx's idea about the relation to the base and superstructure is incomplete and outdated, but the facts here are that analytic Marxists are not wrong to critique Marx, they're just wrong about the issues with surplus theory and exploitation. They've literally reduced Marxism down to some moralist nonsense where it only serves to provide a value claim towards the lack of ""individualism"".

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Hey guys, thanks to /u/demonmit1 I have finally found the PC I am going to build. I have already bought the monitor and new Bluetooth Xbox controller because those were the only parts I was sure I could buy separately and not have any issues with. I was antsy to start my build and just had to buy parts of it. Sadly, due to the Steam winter sale and buying the monitor and controller, I am down to around $650 and need around $900 before I buy the build I want. This is no problem as I will just wait a month to buy the rest of the build. Anyways, until then, I want to get my space ready for the PC. That's where my question comes in. 

Per /u/demonmit1 's advice, I purchased the Sceptre E248W-1920 24.0"" 1920x1080 60Hz Monitor. I currently have it sitting on my desk now. It fits perfectly with my two speakers (Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System) sitting on the left and right side of the monitor and the sub underneath my desk (plenty of space, no worries. The desk is a hand-me-down from my father and although it is old and worn, it is a huge desk that takes up a good fourth of my apartment bedroom while I'm attending college.). Anyways, with the monitor set into the base that it came with it droops forward and isn't very appealing to me. 

I was wondering what would be the best mount to mount the monitor to the back of the desk. I can't mount it to the wall because the way the desk is made it doesn't come in contact with the wall. Here is a [picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/kjU6N) of the desk to show you what I mean (excuse the mess, rearranging everything after Christmas and I'm addicted to post-it-notes). 

So in order to mount the monitor I will have to mount it to the desk itself. I was looking at [this](https://www.amazon.com/Mount-Computer-Monitors-Compatible-MI-2041/dp/B00898482G/ref=sr_1_14?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483227921&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=computer+monitor+mount) on Amazon and it seemed pretty good considering I am trying to keep the price down but I need to make sure it'll fit the computer and wont tear up the desk backing. The desk backing is made of this cardboard like material that is similar to, like, a pegboard or something. It is hard for me to explain and I couldn't find the material online. It is very thin and wiggly if I push on the back of the desk where I will hang it, but honestly I feel that if I mount it right the first time it would hold it fine and not be an issue at all. 

Thank you for any help you offer me, if you know of a mount that is pretty cheap like the one I linked that seems more stable or attaches to the desk surface instead that would be very helpful. ",1483229445

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","My sympathy for the condition of coal miners is qualified. In a recent article--I forget which publication--the people in an impoverished West Virginia town were asked why they don't move someplace else that has jobs. Their answer was they have deep roots in the town and so moving would be uncomfortable. 

Complaining and starving (well, not starving--so many of these people are very fat) while refusing to move on to other opportunities is not credible. Yes, moving is an expense, especially if you're poor, and perhaps you'll miss your old home. But most people face moving because of a job, poor and rich alike. 

Furthermore, their playing the ancestry card doesn't make a ton of sense since everyone on this continent, except for native Americans and black people, willfully uprooted themselves from elsewhere for better opportunities. Especially for economic opportunities.

Finally, cumulative coal combustion may be the most toxic and detrimental thing on the planet. I'm sure the transition from leaded gasoline and paint cost money and jobs. But it had to happen and it was for the best. ",1483229447

Well first of all, let's not gloss over these. Final Cut and Logic Pro are the best video and audio editor applications, and they're exclusively for macOS. Garageband is a great lite version of Logic Pro and it comes with every Mac for free.

&gt; Office for mac still shitty

Doesn't matter. I've been using iWork for years and it's better than Office for Windows or Mac. Aside from Numbers missing a few advanced features of Excel, iWork has everything Office has. Pages is much easier to use than Word, and Keynote blows PowerPoint out of the water. Plus, unlike Office, iWork is free and comes with free cloud syncing and collaboration. Microsoft charges high prices for both Office and Office 365.

&gt; adobe software is glitchy on mac

I use InDesign on my MacBook Pro almost every day and it runs just fine for the most part. My few experiences using it on Windows felt the same.

&gt; Blizzard for the 1st time dropped Mac support for their overwatch claiming Apple doesn't care about gamers at all

This isn't surprising at all. The Mac has never been a great platform for gaming. Buy a copy of Windows and install it on your Mac for free using Boot Camp. Problem solved.

&gt; There are lots of machines with same build quality

Bullshit. ""Better"" does not mean ""as good as Apple's."" You will not find laptops with build quality as fantastic as MacBooks, period. I see MacBooks that are 5+ years old all the time still running fine. With most PCs, they break down, fall apart, or have their battery life go to shit within 2-3 years.

&gt; in areas of performance for pros and interfaces Mac is loosing on all fronts

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Something I think is missing from the other answers (which are correct about the ""social hierarchy"" stuff): we encounter low-level employees *all the time*. So if Bob is an asshole in general, he's probably going to be an asshole to a *lot* of retail and fast-food employees, just because he encounters them a lot. But he's not likely going to be an asshole to a lot of rocket scientists, because he doesn't encounter them in his daily life. Meanwhile, the cashiers, waiters, and so forth, are in jobs that put them into constant contact with the general public, so they're going to get a higher number of assholes than other jobs that are either not public-facing at all (rocket scientist) or have a more limited interaction with the public (lawyer, doctor).

Added into that is that the ""limited interaction"" jobs are typically ones that provide a service that isn't necessarily easy to obtain otherwise. Bob can't really afford to piss off his doctor and get dropped as a patient; it can be difficult to find a new doctor. But Bob can piss off a cashier as much as Bob likes; in the worst-case scenario, if Bob is enough of an asshole to get kicked out of the store, there are still other grocery stores. And that's just the stores in town; Bob has almost no consequences whatsoever for being an asshole to a cashier at the Kwik-E-Mart he passes through while he's taking a cross-country vacation.",1483229449

I feel that ""must be fate"" chemistry with a girl the strongest when she shows the kind of intense interest in me that I try to give to others.

For you, does she appeal to your sense of humor? To your rational side? To your sensitive side? Or do you just enjoy talking and the company she brings? Which of those would you say is important to you? What about her makes you grin? The little things, or the big things? Her mannerisms, or her dreams?

It's okay to say you don't really know; that's one of the things you discover only by trying in young relationships. It sounds like you two have what's referred to as an ""easy manner."" That's certainly a start. Just keep in mind that you're both about to start new chapters in your life.

The truth is that this is going to be a life experience for you whether you pursue a relationship with her or not.

It is the people that are giving the money to them, which means if we weren't giving them money that does not mean we would suddenly start throwing it at teachers. Besides pros take big risks and if the reward/payout wasnt high then a career or economic field like this would never exist.

Entertainment is insanely important, and arts arent exactly the only form of it. And who is saying people are switching their brains off when they watch a movie, read a book, watch a competitive sport. You act like someone who spends 40-50 hours a week working for society (and not counting other things like donations, helping the needy) shouldn't be given an option to relax and do something less productive on their free time.

In the west, denmark and canada are both in the west and are even claimed some of the happiest places in the world. 

I am from U.S, so its not like I am talking up my nation, but places like china and japan also have issues with suicides, and people not even caring when they see it happen for example.

Entertainment has always been a huge thing that kept us happy and you would be ignorant to make a claim like that. Humanity has had countless types of entertainment since forever. From theaters to gladiatiors in Colosseums, people enjoy and want entertainment. And statistically people who have more access to entertainment and so forth do actually end up being happier, and working harder when they do have to work.

Yes you sort of did review society as a machine. Dont get me wrong they are plenty of injustices in the world, but making a claim like ""contributing nothing to society"" is referring that everyone is robots and what universe does is useless. While yes he may not be helping as many people as much as lets say a doctor, but universe could be helping society indirectly by lets say, giving a doctor something to enjoy on his free time, so that when he goes back to work he is refreshed and ready to work hard. 

You seem to have an opinion that people are able to work countless hard hours, and be okay with it. When in reality that simply is not true, and is what a lot of america has been starting to stray farther and farther away from (but the vacation days and so forth still suck)

"Gaming4Gamers","t5_2x2wj","Hi /u/reklamomir, thanks for contributing to /r/Gaming4Gamers. Unfortunately your submission was removed as it violates Rule #5:

&gt;we take spam seriously and killing it is practically a sport for me and my team. (/u/DiggDejected is in the lead BTW (I'm coming for you diggy)) our mod tools let us know in a short period of time along with the help of user reports if someone is spamming. We will not hesitate to remove your post and ban if you violate reddit's rules on self promotion and spamming. 


___
##What are the rules Throwaway_4_opinions? Where can I find them?
___

* [Reddit Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules/)

* [Spam Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F)

* [Self Promotion Rules](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion)

* [The reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

___

##Golly that looks like a lot of reading for someone with a short attention span like me, can you sum it up for me?

___

If more than 10% of your links are from the same source such as a blog, a youtube channel, twitter, etc. **YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE BANNED HERE AND POSSIBLY PERMABANNED FROM REDDIT**

___
##What if it's not mine but like a friend's or I don't make monnies off of it?
___

Doesn't matter.

___

##But site x let's me and I worked hard on it!

___

Doesn't. Matter. This is not site x. 


___

##Why isn't this made very clear on reddit?

___

Because reddit has a lot of problems like every other website. I didn't even know about these rules until later in my moderating. My account was nearly permabanned too because of this. 


____

##Why are these rules so strict?

____

Ever notice the lack of MTN Dewritos here? That's because this policy prevents a lot of shilling (not to imply this is fool proof, but it gets a lot of it out of the way) and teaches users to not ""use"" reddit as a dumping ground for promoting stuff. The system in essence is supposed to teach you to give before you take. 

___


##What if I'm spamming and I never realized it until now?

___

Delete your old posts that are spammy and try to contribute. With links. not just comments. We count by links mostly. 


___

##What if a spammer deletes his old posts and keeps it looking like 10% of his links are not spam?

__

We can still see it. Not the links but the percentages thanks to third party mod tools. Spotting an evader is rather easy. Other mods can also find these folks easily. 

___

##Anything else I should know?

___

Shilling in the comments is still spamming. We will ban that too. 

Thanks for reading.

I spent my freshman and sophomore year just putting on weight cause I hated being smaller than my girlfriend. When I got to 145, I finally felt human.  I weighed around that until ~four years ago. 

When I turned 30, I started lifting. I found a passion for it. And a connection achieving goals.  My first goals were simply to add more weight again, I wanted to weight 165.  Then I could focus on strength and get to my first goal of one day bench pressing 225lbs once. You see those guys in the combine repping it out like its nothing. I wanted to do it just once. 

This year, Ill be turning 34, my bench goal is 300 (really 315 cause I want that third plate).  

What Im getting at here is that I too was in your shoes.  I too was weak, skinny and down on my appearance.  Finding that drive and passion and setting achievable goals has kept me pushing and growing.   Stick with it and your inner strength grows, so too will your muscular strength. ",1483229455

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It's true;  Christians were persecuted in Japan between the 16th and 17th century, [some of whom were crucified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrs_of_Japan).

The wrathful, jealous, and angry Biblical God claimed that he would ""visit the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me.""

It is also made clear in these texts, that vengeance belongs to God, not to man.  So your grandfather is wrong in terms of his reading of the Bible.

More importantly, Christians believe that ""God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.""  

Further, according to Christians, Jesus preached forgiveness for those who sinned against us.

And yet, this goes back and forth, with many contradictions.  As atheists, we can't make sense of it.",1483229461

"MechanicalKeyboards","t5_2ugo7","cassettes are by far the cheapest (and most fun!) form of music collecting. yes they sound like shit but they're just fucking tight

new vinyl from an artist - $20

new cassette from an artist (when applicable) - usually around $7

thrift stores have massive boxes of tapes hidden away because literally nobody cares about them. you can find hifi decks for less than 20 at the same stores. it's the only way to get some flashy futuristic ass gear with crazy design and random sensors that you don't even understand without dropping hundreds of dollars. yesterday i picked up the miami vice soundtrack, a tape of sailing sounds, and a collection of ""island party music"" for less than a dollar.

also your friends' parents will just give you their old collections once they find out you're into tapes. it's cheap as dirt.

oh and i forgot about tape labels. they're fucking rad. last time i bought a new tape i got a handful of candy, four stickers, a business card with some cool art on it, and a handwritten thank you. you can't get that shit anywhere else.",1483229461

"suggestapc","t5_31y8k","Every PC im looking at is ridiculously overpriced. What I would recommend is heading over to [these guys](https://www.phaetonpcs.com/contact/) and ask them to build you a custom PC. Give them this [link](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/j7DFCy). From a recent quote I received from them, they'll charge you roughly an additional 50 dollars for assembly and shipping added onto the price of all the components. You'll be able to get this PC for $1,375. 

In comparison,  a PC on Newegg or Amazon with similar specs would cost upward to  $1,800 which is ludicrous. I don't know what case you like, but I picked one out for you so take a look at that. If you don't like that one, then just tell me and send me one that you like. You can look on Amazon for cases. The specs on that computer is an i7 6700k, GTX 1070, 8GB of DDR4 and 1TB HDD.

You've just described every game ever.  Including SC, because there is very little to do currently.

SC may have publicly scoped that large, but it's many years away until it'll be on the same scale as those games.

ED has player to player interaction too (when the instancing bugs don't mess up, thankfully fixed in the current beta), and will gain four-role multicrew in 2.3 expected at the end of Winter.

A lot of the boosts like that are for people who want to raid with their friends in-game but don't have the time to actually progress the character outside of the scheduled raid times.

Modern games are, as you say, ephemeral - they are pure entertainment, popcorn meant to last only a moment so they don't get in the way of selling more popcorn next month.

And it's kind of good that pure entertainment adventures are no longer talked about for months after, as the player really didn't do anything. Nothing happened - so it's better to not talk about them.

That's because they are pure escapist entertainment. If the game actually ties into something that happened in reality, then it's worth talking about for months latter.

Also philosophically I think you should change in regard to Metal gear solid 5 - you're treating it as if the only way you can be in a story is if someone else hands you a story. Rather than *what you do IS THE STORY*. If you didn't steal a jeep then yeah, you have to run between areas. That's the story - a consequence of your choices.

I use Ben Nye cake makeup for the stage, but for every day looks, I personally start with moisturizer, apply a silicone face primer for all day hold, a liquid foundation and a fluffy round brush to apply a setting powder, in nude. I use a brow kit and angled brush to do my brows. Then, I use the cake Navajo Sand by Ben Nye to put right where the natural shadow starts below my cheek bones and overlay a rose blush just above it. 
I take dark brown Ben Nye shadow to line the outside of my eyes only and finish with a  shimmer highlighting powder to go over my cheek bones, jawline forehead and nose, I make sure I follow the natural shadows and highlights of my face and then finish with mascara on the outside of my eyes.

Attack on Titan, which is fun despite being so simple, relatively monotonous (though the different playable characters keep it from getting stale too fast) and it's pretty easy before you unlock True Attack Mode.  True Attack Mode makes the game much more difficult and while it still doesn't capture the overall grim tone of the manga and anime, it's much closer than anything in Attack Mode.  

DoAX3 for actually being an improvement in terms of the volleyball gameplay and the addition of Owner Mode and Excitement Level makes gifting suits from one girl's collection to another girl less of a timesink compared to XBV and especially X2 (X2 would take at least a year to do everything if you devoted your entire spare time to just that game)  though it is still held back by being a glorified tech demo like the other games in this series and is sorely lacking in terms of activities compared to XBV and especially X2, and while the soundtrack is surprisingly good for being in-house stuff, it's just not the same without How Crazy Are You?  

Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 2 for being a solid and fun RPG.  It's basically more of the same gameplay-wise as the first game but better in every way, especially since there are more than 2 Divine Knight battles, so if you liked the first game, you should like this one too.  

Senran Kagura: Estival Versus is an improvement in every way over the first game, and as a wise man once said, ""Tits are life, ass is hometown.""  

Valkyrie Drive Bikkhuni is very similar to the Senran Kagura Versus series, and I like that series, so this was a no-brainer for me.  

I'm also having some fun with Dead Rising 4, but they've changed a lot with the game and it's just not as fun as the previous games and the exo suits have too short a duration.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","At first, I was really confused with the kuva siphon mechanics. I was a burden to my teammates, because I literally couldn't do shit. I couldn't stay in Operator mode for 5 seconds and my dash seemed to be 5 cm (it seems that I would aim for some sort of lip in the ground without noticing). I'm certain that people that came here and in the forums, complaining about leeches, I was possibly among said ""leech"".

Now that I know how to do it, it's very simple. I learned how to get in and out of Operator mode long enough to disarm the kuva guardians and not get rekt, while also keeping an eye out on the kuva clouds.

Unfortunately, you took the words out of my mouth: the spawning of the siphon can be *very* painful. Sometimes, it spawns in such place where the guardians stay in another floor, usually occupied with the mission's factions (infested or corpus), while you can safely keep an eye out on kuva clouds. Most of the times, it's in such a tight spot, it's hard to look at anything else other than those fat fucks.

Eris' maps are the greatest culprits of this. I forgot how many times I failed a kuva flood because the siphon spawned right on top of a hive and the clouds would appear *exactly* next to it. There was zero time to react and the guardians would murder our operators before we could do anything.

I don't think it's a terrible farm, especially after you get used to it. I thought kuva farming for me was 100% done, but after a little practice and watching how people do it, I can do even the floods on solo perfectly, without losing a single cloud. However, these spawns really need to be checked out. Some are ridiculous.",1483229466

Please read this entire reply because we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). Next, read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn how the sub operates. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment but not submit music to listentothis.

**If you are planning to submit your own music or the music of someone with whom you have a personal association** (e.g. friend, neighbor, colleague, etc.), you may do so [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week) after your account is at least one day old.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","I would agree you *ideally* shouldn't use SteamSpy for anything serious. But there can be serious reasons to use it.

Say you have a publisher and he's reporting that they distributed 1,000 keys to press and 5,000 copies were sold on Steam (to keep it simple, the game is only available on Steam). Checking SteamSpy you see that the game has 10,000 people that own the game, with a margin of error of ~1000.

That doesn't mean the publisher is lying, but it does indicate you might want to request an inspection/audit of their books and records. Which, by the way, should always be in a publishing contract- never sign a contract that doesn't grant you that right. And you should request an audit regularly anyways, no need for SteamSpy at all. Though it can give you a heads up (which it did in the case of a friend of mine, long story short: they bundled his game without his knowledge and didn't report the earnings from the bundle).",1483229475

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Unless you have particularly complex and technical needs (e.g., trusts or $$$ estate planning), do not trust or work with anyone you meet in the financial industry who is looking to advise you or manage your money.   Almost all investment products you hear about are a sham designed to confuse/overwhelm retail investors with too many choices to create the false perception that you need a professional to help you navigate this purportedly complex web of products.  In reality most of these products just go towards generating commissions, fees (and hidden fees!) to compensate overpaid workers in the financial industry.

In general all you need is one ultra-low-cost equity index fund (e.g., SPY or Vanguard Total Market Return) and maybe a small allocation to a similarly low-cost bond fund if you are more conservative, and the desire to save a little every month.      Let your assets grow and compound and never sell a single share except to fund a purchase of real estate for you to live in, pay for kids college, or until after you retire and need the money to live on.

If you are selling one investment to fund some other investment that someone recommended to you, that makes you the sucker.  Every time.",1483229475

(That's even taking as given that Sanders would have done better, which is far from certain.

In fact, the arm fabric is designed to put the baby's arms on the chest in an ergonomic position instead of down flat.  My LO is almost 5 weeks old, weighs about 10lbs and is 23.25 in long. I have been using this swaddler since he was 2 weeks old.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","In addition to damage scaling, also think about your loadout. If you are getting overrun with enemies in certain missions, trying using a fusion rifle and machine gun instead of say a sniper rifle and rocket launcher. Obviously you're limited by your weapon choices at this stage in the game, but try messing around with things, because there is no one loadout that works for ever scenario.

Also, since you're a newer player, make sure you're capitalizing on your abilities. I've seen some new players treat the game like a pure shooter and never use their supers, but you don't need to save it the end of the mission/strike/etc. All of your abilities recharge pretty quickly (and will charge much faster when you get better gear), so get in the habit of using them a lot.

And FWIW, some of the missions are just hard to play solo. By all means, play the way you want, but know that you will be essentially locked out of a fair amount of activities just from playing solo. For example, the Nightfall is the weekly strike challenge is definitely something you'll want to do to earn loot, but it's designed to be played with a fireteam of 3. Plenty of people do solo it, but it's not going to be easy, and some weeks nearly impossible.",1483229479

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","825 karma (per the ability to gain up to 25 kamra via negative qualities) is vastly superior to Priority Build due to the ridiculous amount of customization it offers.  I have been attempting to follow your math, and cant seem to get it.

It is incredibly simple to build something (using 800 karma) better than via priority gen, in the sense that we walk away with much higher dicepools. Adding in that much karma just gets into obscene levels.   

I would be remiss to deny the fact that specific builds are best accomplished via different systems, but will gladly dispute your point of needing that obscenely high amount of karma to be as effective as a Starting Priority Build Character.  

Sum-To-10 I will gladly admit is capable of making something more powerful than either Karma or Priority systems, but is not all that relevant to *this* discussion after said admission.  Worthy of an additional discussion though.

A Fully Functional Troll Mystic Adept SURGE 3 with max magic, cyberware, and tons of skills are not really a thing at 800 karma, I agree, and Drakes/other nonsense are not able to be built to anything remotely functional.  That is not a result of the build system, but the thing being built that is unbalanced.  

Take a troll, define intent of build, and you can build it better via 800 karma than in priority, just about every time.  Exceptions are present, I agree, but not enough to consider them a majority.  But adding in an extra 200 karma is just silly.",1483229479

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Disclaimer: Techinacally off topic since I didn't get fired. Behavior was indirectly encouraged by boss. 

I worked as a server at a chain restaurant about 10 years ago. When I came in one day to start a dinner shift, I was greeted by a female server who was in tears. She asked if I could take over a table for her. I asked what was wrong/if she was OK. She told me that a table had come in, gotten drunk, and become very abusive to her- to the point of throwing their lemons/limes at her. I asked someone else who had been working if it was really that bad. I was shocked that a human being could do that to someone (pretty sheltered at the time, I guess). Everyone said they were pretty shocked but confirmed that the table was the worst they had seen. Side note: I can literally count on two hands the number of times I have been truly angry in my life. This was one of those times, and when that switch flips, things have a tendency to take an ugly turn. First, I went to my boss and explained the situation to her. She was always one to stick up for us. I asked if I could encourage them to leave. This was really rare- the only time I ever saw anyone asked to leave. She told me to do whatever I needed. I went to my car and took out my bat. It was church-league softball season, and I thought I was a badass at the time- turns out I was just a young idiot. I walked back in with the bat over my shoulder and strolled up to their table with a big smile. I set the bat down at the table next to theirs (the restaurant was empty except for the four of them and one guy at the bar). I explained that they were cut off and that they needed to settle their check and leave. Their response of ""why the fuck would we do that?"" was not what I wanted to hear. Nor was their question as to whether that ""fucking, crying bitch"" had complained about them. I looked at each one of them and and yelled at them for about 5 minutes to the effect that no one should ever act like that, that's no way to treat a lady, they were the worst kind of garbage, etc. They said they would complain to the manager, no one talks to them like that, blah blah blah. I cut them off and said that the healthiest option was to pay their check- with apologies and a healthy tip to the waitres. Their other option was that they could have a meeting with me and my ""friend from Louisville"" (still so proud of myself for thinking of that one)  in the parking lot. After that, i just stared at them until they left. I think they were more ashamed than anything but they paid their tab plus about $50 for ""the trouble"". Few things have ever been as satisfying as the look on her face when I handed her the check and tip. She tried to get me to take it but I insisted and told her I would sneak it into her purse if I had to. I went to tell my manager that the issue was settled and that the guys were gone. She didn't ask any questions and said their names were now on the ""do not serve"" list. I don't know if she saw anything but she reminded me not to forget any of my property in the serving area. I grabbed my bat, put it back in my car, and worked my shift.

TL;DR Some asshholes came into a restaurant I was working at and were abusive to one of the other wait staff. I yelled at them, threatened less than legal consequences, and told them to leave. My manager did not get involved. ",1483229480

Here's a couple more thoughts. With a AVR programmer and a SOIC clip you can reprogram the fuse on that driver to the correct value. That might not be worth the expense and effort. However there's a bigger payoff if you happen to have other flashlights with Qlite type linear drivers. 

I claim (or strongly suspect, at least) that most of those drivers are compatible with Biscotti. With the AVR programmer and SOIC click they could be upgraded. I'll also claim that those drivers could be altered to support the ""backwards mode by mode"" press of Bistro. Add an [Off Time Capacitor](http://www.mtnelectronics.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=25_104&amp;product_id=310) between the [star next to ""C1"" and the ground ring](http://www.mtnelectronics.com/image/cache/data/Products/store57-750x750.jpg). A quick (20 second) look biscotti.c suggests that the mode backup code is still present could be easily enabled to work with an added OTC; provided the resulting code still fits in the AVR. If I did this I'd also reduce the number of fast presses from 15 to about 8 to get into the program mode. 

If you happen to have some older M.E. Qlite drivers with guppydrv firmware they might already have an OTC.

I imagine she would've done well in ep 3 and the lipsync would've been Alyssa vs Adore with Alyssa still winning the lipsync sending home ginger. Ep 4 would probably still be Alaska vs PhiPhi with Alyssa being eliminated. Ep 5, Adore ends up pairing up with Tatianna and so the top is. Alyssa/Alaska vs Tati/Adore. This time because Adore never left, Alyssa probably gets to stay and Tati doesnt (the producers would definitely get Alyssa in over Tati, and seeing as they both slayed the lipsync, it would be easier for them to have the lipsync be in Alyssa's favour.) Next episode Detox and Roxxxy are on the bottom. Alaska/Katya saves Detox over Roxxxy and Roxxxy is eliminated. For the makeover challenge Detox/Katya saves Adore and Alaska over Alyssa and Alyssa is eliminated due to being in the bottom the most times out of the 3 :(. (BUT Adore may have gone home over Alyssa) Adore slays the shit out of the Read U wrote U challenge and is top 3 instead of Detox. The top 3 is Adore, Alaska and Katya and Alaska still wins.

1. ""if"" you are 16 and the kid is 18 months old and he is 20 that means that you were fucking at 13 with a guy who was 18 or so. Saying that he is involved with the judicial system is interesting being that he is guilty of statutory rape in every state of the USA. So a Judge and or prosecutor would have picked up on this fact. The judicial system works a bit different than an episode of Jerry Springer

2. If you go before a judge/clerk and are repentant and responsible they will work out a plan. You present a plan like this; here is a copy of my last 3 months of paychecks, copy of all bills and a plan to say I can and will make a payment each month of $x  If there is a kid involved you have to be a complete asshole not to get the most lenient payment plan and if you're being honest and not even making enough to make any payments they will suspend or forgive. You could pay $1 a week and as long as you don't miss your ok. 

3. You say food stamps. Anyone under the age of 30 would say WIK or EBT so me thinks you have a problem with your story. If you're going to bullshit a story please use the corresponding nomenclature.

4. If sperm donor has any skills and is a certified Auto Body/Collision Repair Technician how the fuck does he not make money banging tin?  Bad work ethic and a taste for weed, booze, young girls maybe? Or you're full of shit.

And Suicidal thoughts and NICU nurse do not work together stay away from kids and that includes your own.

From helping to build your team or explaining certain mechanics in the game. Also, the game offers a lot of ways to strengthen your characters, by doing certain missions/events (currently doing Ares - Sales over and over to get the herbs) that will make you overcome that wall with time and dedication. It will make the victory only sweeter!

- I know the feeling of being unlucky with pulls. You see people on this forum getting three 5* banner units in 2 mega pulls while you're stuck with a six 4* from 5 mega pulls. Do know however, that people are far less likely to write that they did get them, then write that they didn't get anything (and upvoted too!). Trust me, it's not just you who feel unlucky, it's a lot of us xD. Yet, every once in a while, we do get a good pull, believe in that =3.

- Even if you do feel like you're very far behind seeing people with 6*'s all over the place, know that gacha games make stronger characters almost each time, to encourage players to pull. It may seem like Barbatos is the strongest unit ever and it sucks that you can't get him, but he might change from overpowerd to a niche pick in a year time, in which you might become even stronger than the Barbatos players you looked up to!


Now, I did pretty much say a lot of the same stuff that you did, I just felt like emphasising it a bit xD. Happy new years and all the best! =)",1483229487

Our current raid schedule is as follows: 

* Tuesday 8:30 - 11:30 PM EST
* Wednesday 8:30 - 11:30 PM EST
 
We are looking to extend our raid roster for Nighthold with the hope of eventually pushing into Mythics for the first tier of Legion. We have several mythic + groups that run weekly in order to help gear those who have had a late start to the expansion. 

We are ideally looking for plate dps, a rogue, a warlock, and a holy paladin for our current needs, but will consider any and all applicants that wish to join us. 

Evade has been raiding since Burning Crusade and has been a staple guild on the server over the last several years. 

Here are some contacts if you wish to raid with us. Please feel free to ask any questions you wish.

I mean we already are swarming in the middle east, what more can we do there - this would be the argument. Time to begin military ops on the homeland. It's crazy, but, after all, Bin Laden was primarily concerned with the long-range destabilization of the US with his attacks - not the attacks themselves.

"DnDBehindTheScreen","t5_36c1q","Alright, I'm back with more time...
You understand the plan, the Drow has to kill one more person while the ritual is ""active"" (don't know, draw a circle on the ground with chicken blood and have candles burning or something) now the PCs have only one goal... don't kill any  creature with an Intelligence score of above 5 inside the house.
The Drow's idea is to sacrifice that guy and with the last sacrifice the demon thing can take over the body of the guy they're supposed to free. The demon would probably reward the Drow (either with a quick death or a nice juicy new spell/level) and everyone 's happy... well they're happy.
The party has to disrupt the ritual (wash the blood away, blow out the candles...) and all that without killing anyone. Now the Drow can use lethal force, while the kidnapped person would be a better vessel for the demon lord (blood type? Awakened mind?) he wouldn't mind the body of a hero. (Death would have a special meaning here)
Have him surrounded either by helmed horrors or if you want to be more evil by other Drows.

The house could have 3 floors (attic/basement, 4th floor is just for the ritual) to unlock the door to the ritual chamber they need ingredients (depending on their level, eye stalk of a beholder for a high level party and a mummy heart for a lower level party) now these monsters can be encountered by either hunting them outside (which would take a looong time) or the party could jump through the paintings in the house (they learn from the seer what they need and see paintings in the house with these creatures on them) 
If you don't want to do creatures then you could have them find items in the house but this sounds a bit boring.

Now each floor has one good, neutral and evil ghost. Let the evil ghost be the second they encounter to mess with them a bit more.. again, depending on your players you can choose the wraith as stats or something, my advice is not to use the ghost's aging ability... though it depends on your players. With the evil ghost you can go all poltergeist and have them throw stuff at the party. The neutral ghosts can be bribed into helping and the good ghosts will try to help. Have them all be unable to talk to make it more interesting (they still can write) I think the best way for the ghosts to help would be to let them rest there or to help with a puzzle.
Add different skill challenges for each character, Stück door for the fighter/barb, balancing over a beam that's over a bottomless pit to reach the plank for the rogue (a bottomless pit in the house? Magic!) 

Now to make it more interesting give them a social encounter or two, maybe some teenagers/kids dared each other to go into the weird house and if they fail to bring them to safety those kids might die (and the demon would be pissed to be inside a child's body)
(Use the social encounter only after the PCs know that the Drow needs one more sacrifice) 

To tell the players what's happening, have them stumble upon diary pages or a journal from the Drow that tells them how he found a weak link in the fabric of the material world (the house) and that he finally can show other Drow that arcane magic is superior to divine magic, or something like this.
Maybe the house was built to protect this weakened fabric by an order of Paladins long ago... they all died mysteriously and people forgot why there were Paladins there in the first place.

I don't know your players so it's tough to choose some puzzles... but there are a lot of other people here with great ideas.

The final battle could be against the Drow and his helmed horrors (or animated armors) the Drow casts a different version of force wall (I think that's the name of the spell) where nothing can penetrate it (power source nearby and/or would be a good reason to weaken the Drow should the party be low level) and I mean nothing can penetrate the force wall... also no air.
Now they see the Drow and his guards, the kidnapped guy is sitting on a chair with his hands and feet bound (and the chair nailed to the floor) and he frantically yells that he can't breath. Luckily the heroes are here... now they have to knock the guy unconscious or remove the power source before the guy runs out of air, maybe give him 5 rounds of air in the bubble and another few rounds as he can hold his breath (depending on his CON score I believe)

Now either they save the day (and the guy) without killing people or the guy gets killed and the demon is happy, the Drow gets killed and the demon is slightly unhappy, a kid gets killed and the demon is pissed, a PC gets killed and the demon is slightly happy... be evil and send an assassin or two into the house to kill the PCs and if the demon takes over the assassin's body he'll also be slightly pissed.

Sorry for the long post but it really got my creative juices flowing.

That extra heat 'bakes' the nearby host rock and changing the structure of those minerals.

*""Overall, from the first reactor in Korea in 1971, costs fell by 50%, or an annual rate of decline of 2% for the entire Korean nuclear construction history. This is in sharp contrast to every other country for which we present cost data.*

Now either South Korea is smarter then Everyone else in the world,
including Japan, India, France,,, or South Korea is cutting corners.  The French discovered that the more they knew, the more it cost.The Russians discovered the more they knew the more it cost, the Americans discovered the more they knew, the more it cost....  

The Nukers wave around South Korea, because it's all they got, but they can't answer why....Why did South Korean costs decline?
Did they thin down the containments? Did they use cheaper pumps and electronics?  Did they skip on emergency systems?
Did they just cheat on the accounting?

I would argue that, while the north was racist in their own way during the war (remember the time New Yorkers had a riot over being expected to fight for black people?), the south definitely codified racism after the war in ways much more relevant to our modern understanding of racism, eg: Detroit had a 9 mile line of segregation the south racist archetype is a Klansman in Arkansas and electing senators willing to protest for over 24 hours to prevent integration in schools.

Note, I live in Florida, I'm not some northerner starting a pissing contest.

The acting often seems absurd to me, and half the time I'm cringing going ""annnd that would not be pleasurable."" Not to mention the terrible sounds and camera angles! It's obvious that a lot of porn is made with male viewers in mind (eta: though a lot of guys probably hate those shrieks etc too). And it becomes even more difficult finding something hot to me when I start looking for kinks. 

Written porn is just so much easier. There's a lot written with women in mind, so it's easier to find something which suits your kink and your style. Whether you like hard-and-fast anonymous sex, or something softer and more romantic, there are options. And no awful acting, surprise weird camera angles, or shrill screaming to make me cringe!

My GPA is still garbage. Not much to say there. it's slowly crawling upward.

I have stepped out of my comfort zone more regularly. I am more social. I am taking on more leadership responsibilities. 

And. The best news. I'm dating a girl I met two months ago. Could not be happier! I know it's still early. But I really feel like I could spend the rest of my life with her. :)

- According to recent data by the Department of Education, African American students are arrested far more often than their white classmates.

- According to the Human Rights Watch, people of color are no more likely to use or sell illegal drugs than whites, but they have higher rate of arrests. 

- The U.S. Sentencing Commission stated that in the federal system black offenders receive sentences that are 10 percent longer than white offenders for the same crimes.

- While white women are more likely to have breast cancer, African American women have higher overall mortality rates from breast cancer.

- African American women represent 65 percent of new AIDS diagnoses among women.

- Only 21.4 percent of African American women had a college degree or higher in 2010, compared to 30 percent of white women.

- According to Census data about work-life earnings, white women make more than African American women among full-time, year-round workers, regardless of what degrees they have obtained.

[Using it once so far](http://www.rocketshipgames.com/blogs/tjkopena/2016/12/first-playthrough-the-molokh-gambit-x-wing-narrative/) confirmed my belief that FFG made the right decision to scale down the huge ships.

As-is, there's barely enough room on a standard mat setup for the huge ships to really open up and fly. And they have tons of issues around bumping: They create large voids around them that small+large ships need to carefully avoid, and grinding huge ships can be a real drag on a game (from many angles they're just not fast enough to fly apart quickly, so you end up with many turns of bumping).

I realised that I'd been neglecting my reviews, so for the moment I've told Anki to stop introducing new kanji while I revise the stuff I've already seen. I don't have a set number of new kanji and vocab to look at, but I spend 20 minutes on each of those per day - so 40 minutes of Anki. This means I don't technically don't get through all of my daily due cards, but the SRS still works (it just takes longer).

Ideally you would be making sure to get through all of your reviews, which might take a couple of hours. I think 2 hours is a pretty optimal amount of time for a flashcard system.

My experience is different.  I have cooked in them up to 165 degrees for hours with no issues, and, I have nuked for a few minutes in them...  That comment was three years ago.  One persons reddit comment and experience does not make it official.  Likely they didn't get the zipper sealed good enough, or, had some other issue.  I just got these a week ago, so I can't comment on long term, but I have multiple bags that are around 7 days with a tight vacuum seal, and no sign of any leakage.  I have some frozen as well, and the vacuum is as solid as the day they went in the freezer.  

Also, the freshsaver bags are made from the exact same material that foodsaver rolls are, the only difference is the zipper.  I had the foodsaver roll in one hand, and the fresh saver bags in another at Walmart, and the material is identical in type, thickness, etc...  I would also dare say, that the seal on these freshsaver bags are better as a factory seal, than making a seal with a foodsaver... Of course, the weakpoint in the freshsaver bags being that they have a zipper, and a port to vacuum the air out.  

I guess everyone's mileage is going to vary.  If you don't take the time to make sure the zipper is fully sealed all the way across, and you have one little spot that didn't quite get pressed down enough, I can see a sous vide disaster happening, but, I am very thorough before I throw an expensive piece of meat underwater to cook.

Blockchains are no exception and in fact the pseudonymity you mention may make corruption easier than in most institutions. But blockchains are also no exception to offering value. I agree there is a space for cryptocurrencies and other applications such as M-Pesa. 

I just worry adopters are jumping on the bandwagon without assessing the true risk to reward ratio of their particular application of the technology. I think there is tremendous potential reward in many applications, but for the reasons I gave I also think there is tremendous potential risk. For example, your Eris platform offers application to insurance. Medical insurance is desperate for reform and transparency, and the blockchain could be an ideal solution. But medical insurance is also a very high stakes industry, and blockchain corruption could wreak damage, especially when human life is at stake.",1483229509

Surely it's not that hard to simply explain the choices they made and why, plenty of games more complex than HS do so. For instance the other day I watched a Mass Effect Andromeda video about the creation of the new species in the game. They walked through pretty much he whole process just showing a few prototypes at each stage and a quic explanation of their thinking and how it ties into the game.

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","I don't even want to click on it. About a month ago, I was in a post about Carrie Fisher (something about how she told a younger SW actress to choose her own costumes), and it came up that she was bipolar. This one poster kept posting all this shit about how bipolar people cannot be trusted, and that he knew this to be a fact since he worked in a mental hospital. It sounded like the poster had been traumatized by some experiences with the mentally ill. I mean, I know it's a hard profession to be in, but if you look down upon the people you're supposed to be helping *that* much, then you need a new profession. The guy would not stop going on about how terrible bipolar people are, and the fact that a couple of people were backing him up was pretty upsetting.

I think it's mental health workers like this that make mental hospitals an even worse place to be in. Luckily I didn't encounter anyone too terrible during my stays, but it was obvious that most of the employees hated their jobs. The hospitals I've been in have felt like prison with drugs.

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","""Insight is the change that occurred."" There are new permanent cognitive functions. A neural substrate potentiated to continuously create the experience of having insight. As this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeNmydIk8Yo discusses, we are only aware of having this insight 6-8 seconds after it actually happens. But this ""we"" refers to a pure witnessing that is its own new permanent cognitive function. So it is the neural substrates of pure witnessing that ""experience"" the neural substrates of the new permanent cognitive functions, albeit with that interesting delay thing going on. 

“Understanding is that aspect of the insight that appears to conscious awareness.” The neurobiological substrates of insight are different than those of understanding. Neurobiological substrates of insight provide new permanent cognitive functions that are delimited, however, when they reach the understanding of the 7 +/- 2 working memory processor. By this stage of the neurobiological cycle, insight can only be grasped in conscious awareness by the understanding of the 7 +/- 2 processor. ",1483229513

**Coup** 2x 5p, 2x 6p

Played with some university friends. I have a thing for games that come in little boxes, have a few components and yet are quite deep for the amount of components they work with. The bluffing element did not have time to shine when we played, but people were starting to get a hang of it.

I got this as a christmas present! Sadly some beer was spilled on it, and while we transported the game to another location the box lid received a huge tear in it because the hinge in the trunk of the car ripped into it.

1. Many of us are vegetarians, so we can't actually open a successful restaurant, because you love tandoori chicken. 

2. One of the reasons Indian food isn't as popular as some others is that it gives many non-Indians digestive problems, even when we basically massacre good food to cater to particular tastes (particularly in making things less spicy). 

3. Many of us prefer or are specialized in other things. Often times, the guys who open restaurants here are people who ran restaurants in India, and it's their background. ",1483229514

I mean, our ancestors created these species so that they could die for us, and I agree that's awful. But at this point, we're locked into it just as much as they are. Unless a human is perfectly healthy or genetically lucky, they need meat in their diet. Nutritionally comprehensive meat substitutes are still decades away. What we do know right now is how to give farm animals a blissful existance and a painless death, so why not just use *that* knowledge, instead of pretending we aren't omnivores and waiting for science to catch up to a massive social change?",1483229516

I'm gonna try to explain you again, if you don't want to make an effort to get what everybody is complaining about (Btw, if you check our guys like Forg1ven, qtpie or Zven, they are stating the exact same problem) I'm done talking with a guy with this little understanding ability.


Big surprise, all the adc mains want adc buffs. I wonder why that is.

&gt;Waht I said about Yasuo is a true statement by Dopa, 

No. You said Yasuo is by far the most broken champ in the game. You do realize there are champs that do what he does 10x better? He's strong but not BY FAR the most broken.

&gt;Btw, using the rank you suppose the other guy has as an argument in a discussion is pretty much ""I've ran out of logic and reasoned arguments, lets pull the humilliation card to state I'm better"", which kinds of fits the 12 years old kid capacity of discussing about something.

Not really. Rank means a lot. Even riot has said they balance around plat+. In one of the recent Beyond the Rift podcasts the talked about what rank riot should balance around and they even agreed that low elo players don't even know what's going on in the game, so they shouldn't be balanced around. Anyone below plat doesn't even understand the basics enough to talk about balance really. That's why in those elos you never see anyone complain about champs like Viktor which is actually cancer in higher elos.

&gt;NO FUCKING BODY IS ASKING ADCS TO BECOME 1V1 GODS OR TO BE BOTH EARLY AND LATEHYPERCARRIES That would be stupid as fuck, and we have the recent example of Vayne being too stacked with buffs in a too short period of time, being the result a fairly unbalanced champion and Riot having to revert some of the buffs.

If it was this reasonable I wouldn't have a problem with it.

The problem I have is that people come onto reddit and say ""adcs are too weak"" and to justify this statement they bring up some bullshit like ""yeah I got 1v1ed by a tank"" or talk about how they're so squishy. Yeah no shit you're getting 1v1'd and are squishy. That's the purpose of the role. That's why you have a damn support there to take care of you. If Riot were to ever make adcs able to self peel or 1v1 other classes they would be beyond broken. Adcs are not useless right now. If they were no one would pick them in high elo. They might need a small buff, but people exaggerate how weak adcs are and that's my problem

If the market for sociologists, historians, teachers, etc is saturated, and there are no positions that need to be filled immediately or in the next 10 years, then perhaps that degree isn't a logical choice for expecting a job afterwards. 

It's not that people think those jobs aren't important, it's that there's no jobs to be had in that field, as there are no vacancies. This is the situation for a lot of STEM fields too, depending on where you live, and those aren't smart degrees either. It's not ""anti-arts"", at least not for me, it's ""anti-no-jobs-in-that-field""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Just like any normal racer, there are many ways to start your career. Podracing has been outlawed for a while once Ep. 1 happened, but the Republic has more important things to worry about than illegal racing/betting, so it looks the other way.

One way to start is like Anakin Skywalker, in that he was sponsored. Strange to think about, but it's true. Watto ran a podracer parts shop and would have Anakin race every now and then. Anakin eventually built his own racer from spare parts Watto had lying around, and due to his technosaviness, it was a remarkably fast racer.

Then you've got someone like Fud Sang, who was a prisoner on on of the moons of Ovoo IV and raced under the permission of the warden, Fenn Booda. Eventually he was allowed to race on other planets such as Ando Prime.

An interesting beginning is Clegg Holdfast. He was a journalist for a podracer magazine, *Podracing Quarterly*. He mainly piloted for the sake of getting an inside scoop on the racers and was well respected as a journalist, but most of the other racers considered him to be a joke. 

Then you have someone like Ebe E. Endocott. He started out as a general deliveryman who was renowned for getting packages to their destination quickly, but haphazardly. Eventually he joined up with landspeeder races, and after that was recommended to pick up podracing.

And finally, there's Sebulba. He grew up on Malastare, the official planet of origin for podracing. Obviously he grew up around it throughout his childhood. He probably watched the annual Phoebos Memorial Run every year. It was in his blood.

If you're looking to start your own career, I'd start off by doing some general racing, and slowly working your way into amateur divisions. It's more economical to build your own racer, but you need an incredible amount of knowledge. Imagine building your own car, except it's common for professionals to build their own custom cars so parts are more readily available and more accessible to fit with different vehicles.

This is really only obvious in the case of studio photos, which is why Walmart and any legit photo shop won't copy photos that look  to be too professional, as they assume it's a studio photo and you don't own the copyright. It's a bitch when you have pictures of your grandparents as children where the copyright has expired, but Walmart won't take the risk and copy their school photos.",1483229520

"AgeofMythology","t5_2tf0k","The best unit composition will depend on your opponents' armies. If you're facing a lot of infantry, you'll want to replace most of your War Elephants with Axemen. Against mostly cavalry you'll want to build Camelry. If you're facing tons of myth units, build Priests. Siege Towers with Chariot Archers and War Elephants is just the typical all-around build that Egyptian players tend to use.

I'm a bit skeptical that you have the economy down if no one really fights until Heroic. You should be constantly building villagers from all of your Town Centers until you have around 60-80 of them (roughly half your population limit). Most beginners plateau around 30 villagers. Your resource income is the bottleneck; the more villagers you have gathering, the faster you can churn out military units and upgrades.",1483229520
