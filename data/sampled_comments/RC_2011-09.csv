I'm not trying to sound cloak and dagger, but I really have to be careful about what I say. I'm not a criminal, but I do work for a company that has a very strict policy on giving any information away.

No, I can't say which company, other than we are one of the largest Hydroponic suppliers and manufacturers in the world. I have a direct, personal, daily relationship with people who are the subject of this documentary, and who have been **directly** inconvenienced, or harmed by this documentary. I feel no obligation to prove to you that I'm not just ""bullshitting"" as you so eloquently put it. This is my career, I am a professional Horticulturalist in a specified field.

What I can tell you that I work out of the west coast of Canada, and the industry in Canada is different in a few ways than the American market. Slightly different laws, and different standards could explain some things, but ""The Union"" was produced in an area called the Okanagan Valley about 4 hours east of Vancouver, British Columbia.
This area houses some of the most mind-bogglingly huge gardens on the planet. For decades, B.C. was responsible for the biggest chunk of production for North America. California has since become a massive supplier, and it has lowered the demand slightly in said area. Many of the growers, or insiders came from this area, and it is quite a well connected community, and much larger than anyone would suspect.

It's widely known, that the producers of this film did not do their due diligence in fact checking, and a lot of numbers and references are not accurate. Some is, and like killuhkallyh said, it can be a good resource for people who are not in the know already. However, from the other side of the industry, it was not well received. Many of my clients feel it was way too much information to give out, and made a lot of people's lives more difficult.","1314835215"

If you are bound and determined to *finish* the damned thing, regardless of quality, then you're good to go. The lousy plot points and clichés can be fixed in editing later.

If you need a precedent, I'm one. I started a novel in twelfth grade and I didn't finish the first draft for 10 years. I had 80 pages that I kept trying to get right and a subject matter that was frankly too big for me at the time. Various things happened and I had to ask myself if I wanted to continue. I decided that my goal would be to finish no matter how awful it was, and I did. And it was awful. So I revised it, rewrote sections, added new bits, revised it again, repeat, for a couple years. Now it's being workshopped and I'm working on the second draft of another project.

Also, remember the part of my story where one of the protesters/anarchists lunged at me for no reason? I supposed that's acceptable, but if a cop does it OMG FASCISM AMIRITE? I didn't see anyone get hit or beat, except for one kid who at point blank swung a lead pipe at a cop a couple times. And he didn't get hit per say, just brought to the ground and zip tied pretty quick.

Also *I* didn't get arrested because I wasn't rioting. The cops were pretty nice to me because I wasn't throwing rocks, poop, or trash cans at them. Funny how that works. When a couple asked what I was doing I actually started chit chatting with them, and even got them to pose all badass for a pic. Much like OPs pic.","1314835227"

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; First, I am extremely surprised that so many people in this thread are bringing in dogs and cats. It is not even remotely a close comparison. Human life is infinitely more important.

This is a matter of opinion; many people strongly disagree.  Even the world disagrees.  To ask a silly, extremist question, why are you spending money on dog food when an infinitely more important human life is being threatened by starvation?

Even if we avoid the nitpicky question, what does ""more important"" mean?  Some ask why pets aren't kept alive in torment while the more important humans are.  Is the duration that much more important than the quality?  If so, where do we draw the line?  Should we keep people with no hope of recovery on life support until massive cellular death occurs?

&gt; I am extremely against making it mandatory (for doctors or pharmacists or any other profession).

I understand your point and, even though I'm pro-euthanasia, I don't think it's fair to force medical practitioners to do this, either.  However, I expect that there will be some practitioners, like Dr. Jack Kevorkian, that would be willing to undertake this difficult task.  Would you be okay with self-selected specialists performing this task?","1314835241"
"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I am intrigued by this question, and I don't know the answer.  I'm going to do some research on this tonight and get back to you.  If I can't find anything, I'm going to ask a colleague of mine about it tomorrow.

My current guess:

Regular air +

volatilized aromatics from the pepper itself

~~If the pepper is green, then I would expect there to be more oxygen inside the pepper than outside because of photosynthesis~~.  Turns out the opposite is true.

ethylene from the maturing fruit

Other than that, I don't know.  I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of secondary metabolite to prevent microbes and insects from living inside the locule (empty space) of the pepper/pumpkin.  As far as creating a gas to inflate it, there is gas exchange with the air outside the fruit, so that would not be a problem.

Edit:

Abstract of Blaskiak et al. 2006:

&gt;Seeds developing within a locular space inside hollow fruit experience chronic exposure to a unique gaseous environment. Using two pepper cultivars, `Triton' (sweet) and `PI 140367' (hot), we investigated how the development of seeds is affected by the gases surrounding them. The atmospheric composition of the seed environment was characterized during development by analysis of samples withdrawn from the fruit locule with a gas-tight syringe. As seed weight plateaued during development, the seed environment reached its lowest O-2 concentration (19%) and highest CO, concentration (3%). We experimentally manipulated the seed environment by passing different humidified gas mixtures through the fruit locule at a rate of 60 to 90 mL center dot min(-1). A synthetic atmosphere containing 3% CO, 21% O-2, and 76% N-2 was used to represent a standard seed environment. Seeds developing inside locules supplied with this mixture had enhanced average seed weight, characterized by lower variation than in the no-flow controls due to fewer low-weight seeds. The importance of O-2 in the seed microenvironment was demonstrated by reduction in seed weight when the synthetic atmosphere contained only 15% O-2 and by complete arrest of embryo development when O-2 was omitted from the seed atmosphere. Removal of CO2 from the synthetic atmosphere had no effect on seed weight, however, the CO2-free treatment accelerated fruit ripening by 4 days in the hot pepper. In the sweet peppers, fruit wall starch and sucrose were reduced by the CO2-free treatment. The results demonstrate that accretionary seed growth is being limited in pepper by O-2 availability and suggest that variation in seed quality is attributable to localized limitations in O-2 supply.

tl;dr:  The balance of CO2 and O2 in the locule of a pepper plant controls the rate of fruit maturation, seed weight, and the starches and sugar content of the ovary wall of the sweet pepper, but not the hot pepper.

From Almeida and Huber 2001:

&gt;Apertures ranging from 18-31 mum in width and 33-41 mum in length, with densities ranging from 6.7 to 47.9 apertures . mm(-2) were observed in the endocarp of mature-green fruit. These apertures were progressively occluded during early ripening and were absent in late ripening fruit. Aperture occlusion might result in reduced gas exchange between the locule and external fruit atmosphere, resulting in modification of the locular gas composition. 

tl;dr:  The structures that regulate gas exchange between the outside environment and the locule of a ripening fruit constrict in the intermediate stage of ripening.  So the answer to your question would vary depending on what stage of development the fruit was in.

Interesting, in the silique (fruit) of canola, the plant regulates for high levels of CO2 (Musgrave et al. 2007),

&gt;The Brassica rapa L. silique is a self-contained environment that maintains hypoxia around the developing seeds, and in which carbon dioxide accumulates to very high concentrations (&gt;30,000 ppm).

It seems that this is to regulate the production of lipids in the seed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was bullied for almost all of elementary school and some of middle school. I remembering holding a lot of it in, and not telling anyone. That led to a lot of problems. So first, I'd say go in and talk to the principal about reducing the consequences. Then I'd suggest that you have your son talk to his counselors about what's happening in his class. Having him interact with administration and dealing with problems by himself will help him in the long run. Have him talk to his teacher and see if he could be moved to another area of the class, away from the kids he identifies as bullying him.  

Lastly, I suggest that you get him involved in something. An activity where he will be accepted and have a strong friends base will help. I'd suggest clubs like key club, red cross, or maybe even debate team. Or, get him involved in band/orchestra, tennis, or what have you. A lot of these organisations impart a greater sense of purpose and belonging, which will help your son from playing the victim in the four year drama we know as high school.

They could easily do that with limited run vinyl - card holders have release numbers logged when they are purchased. IF you're caught selling on E-Bay within 6 months of release, your purchase power is taken away. This would keep the price down for fans as well as keep those snagging albums to flip at bay.

The justices held that deadly force ""may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.""

As said before, this is a restriction on law enforcement due to the ""seizure"" provision of the original judgement.  It also does not apply due to the fact that the guy that was shot had committed a violent felony. Lethal force was lawful in preventing his escape.

State v Weddle does not apply. No jurisdiction. Nevada law does not affect W.Va law.

I'm trying to find a decent online version of english common law but it is a PITA. Generally publishers do not put full law books online due to the loss of revenue.

So here is your reference, look it up yourself. It is also the reference that the SCOTUS used for the fleeing felon rule in Tennessee V. Garner which you have already accepted by using it in your argument.

Edit to add: I took a bit of pity. It's towards the middle.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I don't know why, but hearing about teachers like this always makes me want to cry.

My favorite teacher in high school was definitely one who ran the classroom by force of personality, and I loved his personality. Even as a Freshman, I could tell he'd seen and dealt with many difficult students. As a result, he called the entire Freshman student body ""Ugly Freshmen."" I met him during registration, and when my mother and I shook his hand as we left the building, I turned around and walked back to him and said, ""Mr. C, is there any way that I can get into your English class this year?"" And he told me, ""I'd be honored to have the most eager, and seemingly intelligent ""ugly Freshman"" I've had the pleasure of meeting so far this year, but I'm not allowed to request particular students."" I frowned and started to walk away, turned back, and he waved and winked.

I did end up in his Freshman class, and he had quite a way with kids, despite the fact that he referred to his students as ""Ugly Freshmen."" I sat in the front row all year. Met one of my best friends in his class. None of my other teachers got this treatment from me. I learned a lot of things from him that didn't even necessarily have to do with English, as well... mostly things about life, and learning to think before I speak. I still have a bit of a problem sticking my foot in my mouth (it used to be way worse), but I remember him telling me that I'd improved a lot. Mainly, he said he could see my face contorting and working to hold back what I wanted to say, and working it into something intelligent to say to someone in a way that was insulting, but subtly so. I guess this article kind of reminded me of Mr. C.","1314835276"

"duke","t5_2rh8n","Hey, thanks so much for sharing your concerns! I'll do my best to answer your questions, although I am by no means an expert (more of an enthusiast).

1) I agree support is a HUGE issue. Google Apps for Education is really good about setting up a support framework to ensure that their customers are happy...the best way to gain traction and legitimacy is to make sure current customers are satisfied. [Here](http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/static.py?page=contacting_support.html) is a link to their support page. Each school is set up with an account manager at Google. In the event of a mission-critical emergency, an engineer will be paged 24/7. As far as individual support goes, I have to disagree that Google has ""absolutely zero customer service."" I've always been able to file bugs/offer feedback knowing that a live engineer would follow up. Plus, OIT would be well-trained to monitor and offer solutions.

2) I just sent an email to State's Google rep to see how they handled/are handling the situation you mentioned. One solution I enjoy is using Chrome's incognito mode, which allows me to log into multiple accounts. As far as benefits outweighing it, a school gmail account would allow professors to create/share calendars/docs/groups/surveys/etc directly. That just begins to skim the surface of possibilities.

3) It's definitely possible. A quick search of ""pine gmail"" returns a lot of solutions that people have found, but I can't speak from experience. Here's [one](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.mail.pine/RIlBBiUQDLM) that seems promising, but it does look like there would be some setup involved.

Edit: As a follow-up, [here's the link](http://google.ncsu.edu/announcement/announcement-new-google-apps-infrastructure) that State's rep shared with me that you might find useful to read. The challenge that students are finding there relate to the multiple-sign-in feature, which is an opt-in system. It's apparently a few steps to set-up, but then works seamlessly. It's the closest thing to allowing linked accounts, which would be a huge privacy/data ownership issue. I believe there are things in the work to make the transition smoother.","1314835276"

&gt; Fine I don't care, could you not wait till your children were grown ups and out of the house?

Is it going to be less traumatic once they're in college, so they don't know anything, and suddenly they're home for Christmas and Daddy is now Mommy?

FWIW, I'm a straight caucasian male, so I've got no stake in the matter...

But [read this](http://www.misfile.com/?page=1). They didn't ask to be the ""wrong"" gender, either, and it's my understanding that this is what it feels like for many people. I know that if you asked me to be a woman for ""just a few years"", just so my kids didn't get teased at school, I'd ask if you were out of your fucking mind.

Would you say the same thing if they were a gay couple? Just... what... don't get married until the kids are out of the house? Or would you *encourage* transgender crap in that case to ""fix"" the problem?

The problem is the taunting and bullying, and a society in which children supposedly need therapy because their parents are true to themselves.","1314835280"

I guess to me it's pretty sad that any woman would feel less of herself for having small breasts - I understand why it would be hard (to some extent) I just wish the world was a place where we all could feel comfortable with our own bodies and not have to worry about feeling like shit because to someone else, we might not ""add up""

I think the beauty of a woman is more than just skin and bones, it's everything, personality, energy, humor, inspiration... we all get old and wrinkled and saggy sooner or later... there's so much more to enjoy about a woman than just her boobs.... just sayin :) I'm sure you're beautiful and your boyfriend wants you to feel that way, too. 

Having a small chest may make you feel inferior if you compare yourself to others, so I hope you can gain some confidence to realize that you are a woman, and that in itself is a pretty amazing and beautiful thing. Feel better :)","1314835278"

As far as fishing goes, make sure to check your surroundings before you cast. Getting a hook in you isn't very pleasant. I also recommend a pair of gloves and some needle nose pliers. Fish can be really slippery and it might be hard for you to get the hook out without pliers if you've never done it before. When you are removing the hook, just don't rip it out. Remember, you just pierced a live animal! It's more of a guiding motion than anything. Try and find the hooks path of least resistance out.

There are usually kits you can buy that come with a fishing pole, bobbers, weights, and some lures. I wouldn't use the lures, just go pick up some worms. Don't put the whole worm on the hook, break it up into three segments or so and just use one segment at a time. If [this](http://www.fishsniffer.com/maps/lexington.html) is correct, then I expect you will be catching a lot of bluegill. Good luck with your fishing adventure!","1314835289"

I know where you're coming from, sometimes I feel like I'm just on a hamster wheel. but, as they say, life is beautiful, but living is hard. it can be a drudge, if you're in the same environment for ages, doing the same things, feeling the same things. but it's easier to break out than you might think. if you can't get overseas, get out into nature for a while, find someone with a log cabin, take a load of books &amp; some fishing gear &amp; refind yourself. when you get back you'll have a much better perspective on how you can change your life to introduce new experiences, make real progress, and be selective about the stuff you want to include and exclude in your life.","1314835290"

He's not having sex with you because you now weigh 15lbs more than when you first met?! 

&gt;He says 190 would be a really good weight for me

He won't have sex with you until you are 190lbs? I want to throttle him. This idiot is toxic for your self esteem!

&gt;I don't get why my weight has so much to do with it

Because it's not only your weight. It's his psychological hang ups, possibly a loss of desire to be your boyfriend (even though he still loves you-- the passion is gone and he's too lazy and uninterested to get it back).

&gt;I am confident that if he would work with me, we could really regain this important aspect of our relationship back. 

Exactly. That piece of crap is 100% responsible for letting your sex life die, keeping it dead, and torturing you by making you feel like you have to earn sex by losing weight.

&gt;It even annoys him when I bring it up.

He doesn't deserve to date you.

&gt;I just don't feel like I'm good enough for him so much of the time simply because of this attraction issue.

This is exactly why he's kept you for so long. You love him and see so much potential that has not and will not ever be realized in him, and your self esteem is in the toilet so you think a man who makes you lose a bunch of weight to have sex with him is too good for you.

You are SO MUCH BETTER than this. I can barely wrap my mind around what a bad relationship this will ultimately be for your self esteem. When you finally break up with him someday, you're going to be angry you wasted so many years on someone so undeserving of you.

Luckily I ended up having to work late that night and never showed up that night.

Had things of not worked out that way I would have been incredibly pissed about the whole thing (it's really wouldn't be that hard to tell, especially afterwards, unless your friend is just completely oblivious to everything).  Personally I would never want to be with a hooker and not really even with a slutty chick.  I don't really even like being set up with some chick.  I had said this to my friends in the past when they had tried talking me into getting hookers, so if your friend has expressed the same, don't do it.

"poker","t5_2qhix","UTG likely has a big flush draw here, ATdd+ and, as many of my home games have gone - once the game looks like it is breaking up and they get a good hand that flops decent (overs + FD) they will gamble it up where they are not getting great odds (unless he figures there is a great chance that people have worse draws/are folding).

I estimate that the BB shows up here with a 2 a decent amount of the time, and A8 a decent amount also (discounting a FD since I am assuming UTG has a FD).

In the best case scenario where you are up against A8 and JTdd you are only ~55% to win. (I realize that there are possible holdings that will increase your expectation, like no overs, no FD, against an 8 and TT for example... but given the action do we really expect such weak hands to show up?) If you were for sure 55% to win, ship it quick! But I feel like there are enough times that you are in bad shape against a random 2 that folding here is okay.

In retrospect, I like flatting in position on the flop. If there is then more action in front of you, you have very little in and get away cheap. If you are ahead you don't chase off worse hands, and can drop the hammer on the turn.","1314835319"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Fine, but I really get irritated about this criticism of the McDonald's case, which I've seen many times before.

&gt;What most people don't know is how hot the coffee was 

Yes, everyone who was around when the case happens knows how hot the coffee was because - news flash - McDonalds' coffee is fucking popular. Like the very next sentence says, McDonalds **had a policy** to serve the coffee at that ridiculous temperature, so everyone getting their coffee there would have experienced the same thing.

Ms. Liebeck should have been able to tell that the coffee was hot, too, based on the fact that she would have had to accept it with her hands. Those cups really don't provide that much insulation.

&gt;which they knew no one could drink and would cause 3rd degree burns within 3-7 seconds of contact.

[citation needed]

&gt;Despite the unanimous verdict for Mrs. Liebeck and even after the judge drastically reduced the amount awarded, McDonald's appealed and the parties settled out of court.

So? The outrage is and always was about the original verdict.

&gt;Most people believe she was driving the car

I have never heard anyone say, in a discussion of the case, that she was driving the car, and it wouldn't matter anyway. What does matter is that she held the cup between her legs, which explains the pattern of burns. This is a stupid thing to do with a cup of hot liquid. It's fantastically easy to accidentally squeeze your legs together a tiny extra bit and spill everything, or even crush the container outright.

&gt;was not seriously injured 

Bullshit, this was well-understood.

&gt;and got millions.

Again, not relevant whether people were paying attention to the reduction of the settlement in the aftermath.","1314835332"

Ratios are not the end-all and be-all of AP DPS, though. His Q has a .8 ratio on an 8 second cooldown. His E has a .14 ratio on hit, and a .14 ratio per second DoT. So, if he attacks once per second, in 8 seconds he will have done 8(.14+.14)=2.24 times his AP -- and Teemo's *base* attack speed at 18 is 1.3, not including his passive. If he attacks just twice, he does .28 from two on hit procs, plus at least 4 tics of poison, for  a total of .84 of his AP.

So, protecting your own means taking whatever measures it takes to improve their life, and increase their stock in the world.

I understand that poorer people may not be able to prove that they are citizens.  But what if poorer people voted Republican? 

And if we don't verify citizenship before voting, you open the door for non-citizens to vote.  Like poorer people, non-citizens are also more likely to vote Democrat.

I suppose the problem is the games industry is now filled with so many bad games that we need a fast way to decide if we should play one or not. And because they're all massively over-hyped and over-marketed to look great when they're not, the best we have to go by is ""am I still interested after 10 minutes of playtime""?

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","There's lots of inbetween on that story. I have a somewhat adventurous life, thus my name.

Only one time in Arabia did I experience something weird. Two friends and I managed to find some bedouins who let us sleep at their camp and eat with them for free so long as we cleaned their horrifically disgusting kitchen. We did. The bedouins left in the middle of the night to go over the border to Saudi Arabia to chase a young camel that had escaped, so we were left all alone in the camp, sleeping outside. We woke up to pitch-blackness at around 3am, hearing faint footfalls in the sand about 50 feet away. I quietly grabbed the bedouin's shotgun that they left behind, it wasn't loaded, but I figured it would be a good enough deterrent. After my friends and I standing still for about 5 minutes, wide-eyed and listening into the dark, we realized that the foot-falls were just the sounds of the bedouin's tent flaps lazily folding against the light breeze. They happened to sound just like someone walking in the sand.

So that was the only other time I've experienced something weird, outside of Shikoku, that is.","1314835393"

"PovertyTips","t5_2r9e3","Where I am located, the only clinics available to me are hardly free.  Getting tonsillitis cost me well over $300 thanks to the costs of the visits and the antibiotic shots and various antibiotic pills they tried.  Actually, I lucked out when it came to oral antibiotics because the local grocery store provides most generic ones for free.  The only time I had to pay was when they had to prescribe some really strong and expensive one because the others weren't working.  And that was $60 but it was supposed to be $90ish.  At least that one finally worked.

The worst part is that I am insured.  I just have a super high deductible (can't afford any other plan offered to me) so everything is out of pocket unless I end up in catastrophic circumstances.

So yeah, cheap access to antibiotics would be something I am interested in.  I can get antibiotics for ""free"" but that is with a doctors prescription for them.  The cost of getting that prescription can be massive.","1314835394"

We have a disagreement then. I think that people take action based upon ideas. Religion is a body of ideas which are formalized and consecrated. Many of those ideas are evil, but are presented as good. 

I think that from the stories on here, the *ideas* that holy roller parents pass on to kids, cause the kids to take fucked up actions, or be fucked up. It is the fault of the bible.

It is like this. If I use a car repair manual to fix a car, and the manual is wrong, it is not my fault. I took action because I was following the directions of the book, and why wouldn't I, right? Except that a car repair manual is infinitely easier to figure out than a religion. Sometimes I think religions are purposely designed to be contradictory, to fuck up it's readers and not allow them to understand, so they can't make a decision.","1314835398"

Eventually if you have a sensor in your pocket at all times that is more than sufficient and has a computer attached to it, who's to say that you don't download the Canon or Nikon app?

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","That's not what mainsoda stated though.  What's stated is that only Libertarians even understand the problem in the first place -- that ""science and the scientific method are shamelessly manipulated by politicians"".

The claim made is that this is objective fact, and that nobody except Libertarians know that it's true.

What you're saying is that libertarians or any other group each believe they have the best solution to this particular (or any) problem.  I agree that generally this is the case, but that's not the issue; mainsoda reckons that non-libertarians don't even know ""this particular problem"" exists.

In the case of this particular problem, it's because it doesn't really exist -- we have a disagreement about the nature of reality.  If climate scientists say that they aren't being manipulated and that they are doing good science, and here is the data, then how is it that a Libertarian internet blog surfer suddenly understands their situation better than they themselves do?

The solution to the disagreement is to investigate the problem by interviewing hundreds or thousands of climate scientists, and review the data -- and to see if you can reproduce experimental results, for example.  Use the scientific method to determine the nature of reality.

Posting instead that only Libertarians can see the truth is childish and insulting to all concerned.

"HeroesofNewerth","t5_2r497","I would argue that it isn't even minute and it doesn't even tip the scales at all. The majority of players that purchase EA heroes won't even know how to use it, properly, without playing in a lot of matches with varying hero lineups. So, within the first week or maybe even two of using said hero they are more likely to be an encumbrance to their team.

Your F2P argument maybe works if the typical F2P accounts were matching up against 1900's or higher, in a ban pick mode. However, their typical opponent, in an AP game, is just going to pick heroes they can use, with ease. I consider AP to be one of the least rewarding modes of play. It doesn't incorporate banning, you technically might not even see your opposing team's picks because of right clicking, and the actual time for you to set-up a team with good synergy is quite low; unless you're playing with a larger group of friends (3~4). In a good chunk of AP games among the non-hardcore players (1650 or lower), even before F2P, people would:

1. Random for the extra gold.

2. Random because that don't care about team synergy, but don't want to be forced to pick. 

3. Pick w/e hero they want regardless of what their team might need.


If you're searching for strategy in the picking phase and you think AP is the holy grail... I just don't know. That would seem like if defies logic because of the limitations of the game mode.

I didn't say that.  Firstly, I limited it to Web Forms.  Not all of ASP.NET.  Secondly, I didn't say that abstraction is intrinsically wrong, of course that's not true.  But if you are building a web framework, you need to choose abstractions that are suitable for the work you are doing.  The abstractions that the designers of Web Forms chose scream from the rooftops that they intensely dislike the architecture of the web and view it as an inconvenience to paper over rather than a strength to build upon.  Either that or they really just don't understand it.  And if you like Web Forms, then I'm lumping you in with those people, and all the people I've ever worked with that like Web Forms.  It's a pretty consistent indicator of cluefulness at multiple levels in my experience.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I have a few things to say here:

(1) In my [first response to the original poster](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/jyzql/to_christians_have_you_considered_the_absurd_lack/c2g9hsq), and the dialogue that followed,  
my aim was just to ""express a Christian view"" about the substitutionary sacrifice, hopefully coherently and understandable (in contrast to the example conversation that the original poster described),  
and hopefully show that the substitutionary sacrifice is sensible.

My intent was not really to reason from the very ground up of low-level concepts, 
e.g. how do we know there's even any god, etc. and up from there.
I see that some responses in DebateReligion are of that type,  
but for today, I just wanted to express a high-level concept clearly.


(2) Why did I list Bible references?

(a) Some Christians have the habit of doing so: If Christian A makes a claim, and gives a reference, then Christian B who also holds the Bible authoritative can check whether the claim follows from the text referenced, and dispute or discount the claim if it doesn't really follow from the text.  
(b) If there were lurking Christian readers or agnostic readers who were curious or interested about a particular point, they could follow the link for more detail.  
(c) While composing the post, I had just searched for the corresponding passages to check that I was reasoning correctly from them, and I might as well mention them.

I do not presuppose that Bible references, or Bible quotes, are considered authoritative by you or other readers.

Also, by the way, if you see me or other Christians quote a sentence from the Bible, it's not necessarily that we think you'll consider it authoritative, but just that the words well express the concepts we want to express.

(3) About my Christian reasoning in general

I've been thinking recently that I have some lower-level premises:  
(a) People mentioned in the Bible actually existed  
(b) Events mentioned in the Bible actually happened  
(c) People said stuff (and what's recorded may be a paraphrase, that's ok)  

(so some claims against Christianity are against (a) or (b) or (c))

From (a)&amp;(b)&amp;(c), one can derive much theology, including, I think, the divine authority of Christ, and that he gave apostolic authority to the first-century true apostles (I do not hold the view of ""apostolic succession"").","1314835443"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Proliferation is a non-issue. Thorium reactions do not breed nuclear fissile materials. That's the main reason it was NOT supported in the first place.

Waste storage... I'm not sure what you mean by at both ends. There is only waste at one end. That said, thorium reactions can and do burn depleted uranium wastes, so in terms of waste storage, thorium usage would actually REDUCE the amount of nuclear waste in the world, rather than increase it.


I looked into this and finally got some info on waste management under a LFTR system.

&gt; If we take Australia’s total electricity generating capacity (48 gigawatts), double it (allowing for growth), and convert the lot to LFTR running flat out all the time, it would take 620 years for the combined ash from all those plants to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. As natural processes compost the ash, it becomes less radioactive than the ground you’re sitting above in 300 years.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Listen to what your lawyer says, and do it.

Often the cases are not pursued, BUT not always - take a look at Jammie Thomas' case.  You won't know if you're one of the unlucky ones until the court papers drop through your door, so hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.

If it is pursued by the plaintiff, then you should decide what to do based on whether you actually downloaded it or not.  Your lawyer will advise you of how likely you are to successfully defend the case, but even if you are innocent there is still a chance of life-ruining judgement being handed down, so settling may be the ""smart"" option.  Principles good to stick to when you can, but principals don't pay the rent.

Claiming things such as ""I had a friend borrow my internet"" may seem tempting, but (and I'm sure your lawyer will advise this) you have to be absolutely certain there is zero evidence to the contrary.  
If it goes to court, then any and all computer equipment could be seized and examined (along with records from any service you could have interacted with - did you log into your gmail account with the same browser that you grabbed the .torrent with?).  
If any of it is found to have been erased, then you may find yourself falling afoul of laws involving destruction of evidence.

Do not discount the reputational damage either - increasingly, employers are (regardless of legality) googling names of prospective employees.  In our society, pornography is seen by many as taboo and a character flaw.

More than anything though else, talk to your lawyer, be honest with them and listen to them.","1314835447"

I guarantee no one else has the same sheet, and it does disagree with some standard picks. Print it and bring it, it won't look bad, everyone else will have cheat sheets and magazines.

As for strategy, I dont know your league's specific scoring system, but assuming that's it's somewhat standard, If you have one of the top 4 picks, grab one of the top 4 runningbacks. If not, feel free to grab the top QBs or WRs. [Here's](http://www.fftoolbox.com/football/2011/mock-draft-results.cfm?mockID=18518) an example of a mock draft done this year

As a general strategy, in the first 8 rounds, grab **1 QB**, **1 tight end** (assuming you need one, some leagues don't require one), **3 running backs**, and **3 wide recievers**. 

After that, feel free to grab a backup QB somewhere, maybe a high-ranking defense (NEVER before the 8th round! In fact, I wait until the 12th round usually, but it's up to you.), and continue to grab WRs and RBs. Grab a kicker in the last round. NOT BEFORE.

Here's how my draft went for me the other day (8th pick):

1. QB
2. RB
3. WR
4. RB
5. TE
6. WR
7. RB
8. WR
9. QB
10. RB
11. RB
12. RB
13. Team Defense
14. K

Of course there is. If you start out with an advantage in life, obviously that advantage is going to carry through to the results. That's what makes it an advantage...duh.

Yes, not all inequality is due to unequal opportunity. But you agree that we do not have equal opportunity today. This necessarily means SOME inequality is due to unequal opportunity. Which means if we had more equal opportunity, there would be LESS income inequality (not none). I'm not arguing to legislate the outcome, but since even you agree we dont have equal opportunity, your position against legislating outcomes is idiotic because your position only serves to preserve the current advantages that certain people enjoy. 

There may be practical reasons why you are against legislating outcomes (such as government corruption) which are valid, but in any case, the opportunity part does need to be legislated. If it didnt then we wouldnt need the constitution.","1314835463"

if you have 10k, and i give you another 10k, you have just received a MAJOR financial windfall. i doubled your money.
if you have 100k, and i give you another 10k, you have benefited much less from said gain.
a flat tax punishes those with little money as their little money is of more value than somebody with excess wealth.
(taking 3k from somebody who only makes 10k is rather cruel, while taking 30k from somebody making 100k does not impact them nearly as much.)

""that a wealthy person's money sort of belongs to the public, since it was created from the opportunity that the nation provides."" yes, this is about right. but their money doesn't belong to the public, it is their money, but they do OWE more to the system for said opportunities.

That said... I own a couple pair in just some ""acceptable"" colors (navy/red, and red/black) and until I got some, I didn't realize how *fucking comfortable* they are. They have *built-in underwear*, guys. I don't even have to put underwear on. I roll out of bed in the comfy shorts I wore to bed, go to my 8 am classes, and I don't look wrinkled at all because the shorts don't wrinkle. They're also great in super humid weather, because your ass doesn't stick to chairs or the shorts themselves, and my legs feel nice and ventilated. Granted, I also wear them for...You know. Their intended purpose of exercise.

So, don't knock Tempo shorts. They're comfy and great for hot climates. I can't defend the poorly fitted t-shirts, though. It just makes you look like a dumbass.

I am currently studying computer science. It is maybe 15% women, and that is being generous. Engineering, from what I have seen, is very similar. However, when I take a psychology course, it is way more balanced, leaning more toward women. And that is a general class. When I met upper class and graduate psychology students (when I was taking part in an experiment), it was very little men. Even economics courses seem to be more men.

I mean, even look at engineers versus teachers. I never had a male teacher until high school, and only then it was a little under half of them being men. College professors have been mostly men, though.

The salaries even come off that argument. Engineers and computer scientists make a pretty decent chunk of change. How about teachers and psychologists? Not quite up there.

1. Evolution is a term describing changes in alleles (genes) over time. It is also part of a name for a theory that describes all the evidence we have seen in terms of different types of animals and fossilized remains. The theory is a description of how the process works, with some tests to show how it could be falsified. Evolution as a theory has been tested, both in the lab, and in real world changes to insects and animals.

2. A scientific theory is not a guess. A scientific theory consists of three parts: evidence, falsification tests &amp; results, and a description. Basically, when scientists see something happening and try to understand it, they gather all of the evidence they can, they analyze it, try to understand it, then they create a theory that explains it the best way they can, including some tests that could invalidate the theory. Then they test. Over time, they will either invalidate the theory, or support it. Often small changes in the theory are necessary as better understanding happens. The most well known theories are those which have either been around the longest, or are the best support, or both. Evolutionary theory is one of the best supported theories.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Literally [searching 800](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/search?q=800&amp;restrict_sr=on) will come up with some great builds for you.

If you're actually looking to play games $800 is a good price range to be looking at. If you just want to use photoshop you can lower that cost quite a bit.

Getting a pre-built one is probably a terrible option if you don't want to be ""ripped off on from Best Buy"" again. If building a computer is sort of scary I might recommend buying something partially built from newegg ([a barebones system](http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=3&amp;name=Barebone-Systems)) or a slightly used system from ebay/craigslist.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Here's my question. If this was the case, why are we seeing it in the NHL so much all of a sudden, but not in other sports? I mean, if it was just a pain management issue, don't you think football at the VERY least would be statistically on par with the NHL in deaths related to narcotic abuse? 

Not arguing against your point. This just puzzles me. What is it about NHL players that is making them more susceptible to addiction, if that turns out to be the case? 

If drugs are involved in this, there needs to be an explosive awareness campaign for the players, and in-depth studies to treat others in the same boat, and to prevent more players from falling into the same trap.

IF if if if if. Of course, it's all speculation anyway. ","1314835496"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","In normal CPUs like the one in your computer, errors come from two places, heat and space.

The problem is that the electronics within our modern CPUs are very very small. Modern CPUs use transistors (little electronic switches) that are 32nm big, that's half the size of a HIV virus(this was the first size comparison wolfram alpha gave me).

Because things are so very tiny, the amount of electrons going through a circuit, or held in a capacitor, can actually be relatively small.

When CPUs get very hot, some of that heat energy can impart a little bit of extra charge in a little pathway which is enough to ""tip"" over the scales from a 0 to a 1.

Similarly, there are these things called cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are little particles flying in from the sun and space, usually electrons or other sub-atomic particles flying very very fast. Sometimes, (rarely, but not so rare that you dont see it) one of these particles will hit a little circuit in a CPU causing a bit to flip. When these bit flips that's an error or fault, and can cause memory corruption or a crash.


The article you linked discusses quantum computing, so the mechanics behind it will likely be very different, but the general gist is that we're making things so small nowadays, that even tiny changes in the environment around them can change data.","1314835496"

1. If you dump a bucket of water onto this block, some of it flows to the left into your little receptacle, and some of it flows to the right into the tank. So you can fill your bucket again from the receptacle, dump it again, and just repeat the process to ""duplicate"" your liquid.

2. Something about the way Terraria handles liquid moving through single-block spaces makes it where if it travels a long enough distance, it doesn't deplete itself. So once your tanks are full, you break this block, which obviously creates a block of obsidian when the water and lava meet, and you can get infinite obsidian from the process.","1314835500"

6-12 frozen chicken wings (often called ""party wings"" these are really mixed small drumsticks and wing sections without the tip)  
Vegetable oil, for frying  
4 oz Frank's red hot sauce  
1 oz Tobasco  
1/2 habanero pepper, very finely minced  
2 cloves fresh minced garlic  
2 tbs margarine  
1 tbs garlic chili paste  
1 tbs tomato paste  
1/8 cup water  

Put enough oil in a pan to fry the wings until golden brown, 15-20 minutes.
Put everything but the margarine in a separate pan, bring to a simmer, simmer for 10 minutes to release flavors, add margarine, stir until incorporated.
Put drained wings in a container (tupperware-type with a lid) with the sauce, shake well.
Service with celery and blue cheese dressing topped with blue cheese crumbles.
Yum. :D

Edit: if you don't like it so hot, you can leave out the habanero, replace the garlic chili paste with crushed red pepper and this is still very good.","1314835502"

&gt;The unifying thread of the left is hypocrisy, a desire to do good with other people's money.

I disagree, and I don't really believe you think a group of people could have *hypocrisy* at the core of their beliefs. I say the unifying thread on the left is the desire to protect the weak from the strong, and to be tolerant of difference. Now this may be what's leading to

The free movement allowed for by FPS games is inherently different from anything on rails. Calling linearity or unidirectionality ""on rails"" is not just using a term that's already defined otherwise in the context of video games, but it also is an exceedingly bad simile. Most games do not have you on rails, no matter how you put it.

about getting accepted into a top university, not doing well in a top university. 

Though I'll have to admit, affirmative action isn't a particularly strong counter to your argument, for obvious reasons.

Also, having spent a fair bit of time in China, I will add that Chinese university students in general have it easier than western university student. They plagiarize most if not all of their essays, and often cheat on tests as well. Cheating seems to be part of the culture in universities [even in the top school in the country.](http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2007/dec/28/plagiarism-rampant-at-peking-university-yale/). In contrast, when I was in university in the States, there was a zero tolerance policy on cheating and Plagiarism in effect... suffice it to say, I wrote all my essays by hand. I think you can get your Chinese cousin to confirm this as well.... She'd tell you studying at university is a breeze compared to Middle school and High school.

The area I live in, there are 2 lawschools.  One is a T50 and the other a T2, and both do pretty damn good jobs of getting their grads jobs in the area.  This is because a good chunk of the people doing the hiring are alum from these two schools, and they know the reputations, and they don't really care about what USNews says.

I had coffee with an attorney who works for the EPA and does their hiring and was asking him about the importance of rankings when it comes to hiring.  He basically said he has never bothered to look up the USNews rankings, and aside from the schools in our area and the tippy top (HYS) schools, he really doesn't know where any school lies in the ranking.  The ranking within the class is what's likely to get him interested in offering an interview, and the interview is what causes him to hire or not.  He said this is true of most firms in the area.

tldr, only law students pay obsessive attention to the rankings.  employers don't care as long as you excelled in school.","1314835564"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Lots of feedback's been given to you already, but you haven't responded to anyone. I'd be interested to know what you think of our opinions. The fact that you created this post means that you're taking this into serious consideration, and I'd like to see you defend your position against the general negativity.

It seems to me that your priest is trying to convince you that you'd be able to do a lot of good as an ""atheist priest"". You'd have the moral authority of the title, but your actual morals would be coming from a much better, more reasoned place than that of a fundamentalist priest. This is a very emotionally compelling argument for someone who really does want to do good in the world. Taking this route would be a heck of a lot easier than sticking up for the whole truth and nothing but the trust, as it were. 

I know this because I've been made similar offers, though not quite the way you were approached. Most pastors and priests that I speak with are surprised at the amount of knowledge and interest I take in the Bible and their sermons. I'm good at picking out the logical fallacies from both a Bible-based viewpoint (most Christians don't act as the Bible tells them to) and a Reality-based viewpoint ('nuff said on that one, I hope). Anyway, what pastors have tried to do with me is convert me first before I become a pastor, which is not your situation.

Anyway, I would love to be a pastor in the sense that I do believe I have a knack for teaching, the things I'd like to teach aren't taught in schools (practical civics, counseling, etc.), and I think I could help a lot of people be doing this. However, I could not live with myself if I wasn't completely honest about my beliefs and the roots of my morality and world view. In my dreams, I'd like to set up a Civic Forum where anyone and everyone can go to learn about their communities, how the can become better, more productive members of that community, and how they can help other communities do the same. Just about every practical service that a Church provides could be provided by these Civic Forums, except it'd be a completely secular, no-pressure sort of thing.","1314835566"

In 2001, the Coliseum was the third best hitter's park.  That is *not* a hitter's park.  In 2007, it was the second to worst.

In 2004, the worst hitter's park in the entire MLB was Yankees Stadium.  In 2005, the *best* hitter's park in the entire MLB was the same Yankees Stadium.  The Yankees lead the league in OPS+ both seasons.

In 2002 and 2003, Kaufman Stadium was top 5, and then in 2004, it was #23, in 2005 it was #18, and 2006 it was #3.  What?

This is more than random chance.  This is straight up uncorrelated data.  It's not the biggest hitter's park (CBP), but it's definitely not a pitcher's park.  Calling it a meme just ignores that it was the easiest NL park to homer in in 2009, second in 2008, first in 2007, etc.  It's not now because of the ridiculous pitching staff and the somewhat diminished hitting lineup has quashed that, but I don't think everyone was just saying it in an uninformed random manner.

The intent o the child was tothrow rocks at cars, I severly doubt hi intention was to caue a tafic accident bad enough to cause harm.  The inent of the shooter, however, was to engage in lethal force against a minor.

I'm sorry, but actions like this cannot and should not be tolerated by anyone.  This was way beyond te bounds of a reasonable response.  Calling the cops, taking the kid to his parents, those would be acceptable.  But the reaity is if that quarrel had hit a few inches higher tha child would have died, which was much more likely that the possible rock-through-the-windsheild-causing-a-massve-pileup which you seems to be hinting at.

If your graphics card can support audio over HDMI, then you can use that to deliver digital audio to a receiver or processor, and bypass your sound card entirely.

As for your headset, well... you would have been a lot better off getting a good set of headphones and a clip-on mic. 

You will be able to improve your sound quality by hooking it up to the headphone output of a good receiver. Most include opamps that can power headphones nicely. Hooking up the mic input might be a little tricky, though, in that situation.","1314835579"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Ideally yes, you could pick your spot in a stream, but please realize animals also go to streams to drink, which in turn attracts predators. This happens in watering holes in Africa all the time, I have no doubt it happened in the Jurassic era as well.

You'd still need to get to water in order to sterilize it, and you'd still need a container.

You could always use rainwater as well.

&gt;Don't antibiotics have the opposite effect? They actually lower your immune system because you become reliant on them.

Using your immune system to fight something off on your own would result in a stronger immune system than using antibodiotics, but if you need the antibiotics to survive, your body still makes it's own antibodies. Just less of them, because it's working in concert with the antibiotics.

&gt;Eh. I doubt this would be very practical... you would be completely reliant on fire if you choose this method. In which case I hope you choose B for the fire starter, but B has the pills anyways so what's the point...

It really isn't that hard. I could go in my backyard right now, and using nothing more than a knife i could have a fire within 5 minutes.

&gt;Waving around a torch would scare off almost any animal

That's sorta a myth. Animals are only mildly afraid of fire. But like you see in movies, with wolves surrounding someone but not coming in because of a torch... That would never happen. You'd be swarmed and dead in a matter of minutes in that scenario. Maybe you could keep one or two at bay for a few minutes, but it wouldn't take long for them to get over the fear, and go for it.

&gt;I think very large predators are also going to be a concern

Large predators typically look for large prey. A t-rex is not going to be very interested in a human. A bear-sized animal is what you are going to be worried about. 

&gt;smaller ones could potentially be handled in combat and by outsmarting them.

The issue with the smaller creatures is not that they can take you down. It's the infection they will leave you with if you even get a scratch. Which, again, is why you need the med kit.

&gt;Humans are very adaptive, it would be an extreme case but I have enough confidence in my abilities to do this. I'm sure others could survive as well, even with different lists. I just think B would be the best option for me.

People aren't as able to survive in the wild as you might think. The human race has almost gone extinct multiple times, we only enjoy our current comfort because of our intelligence which has allowed us to create a huge variety of tools. But without a civilization, without a safe haven to work in, and without other people to help you survive, most people would probably die.

The axe is really the only good thing about option B, that you could not replace.","1314835580"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","I understand your frustration with JL #1. I'm frustrated too. I've probably read more Justice League comics than any other series. I've seen every episode of Justice League/Justice League Unlimited. This first issue was definitely a let down. 

However. I think it's a little silly to judge the rest of the 51 new books just based on this title alone. How can you possibly know the quality of the other books? 

The biggest advantage the single issue format is that you can just not buy the other issues. Even though I'm a huge Justice League fan, I might not pick up issue #2. I'm certainly going to buy other titles in the new 52 line up. I expect some to be good. I expect that some might not be good. I expect some that I don't pick up will get so much praise I'll end up buying the trade paperback. 

And I'm perfectly fine with all of those scenarios. Cause I know that at least I went through the effort to give the comic a chance. ","1314835602"

Roasting the ribs is a cakewalk, Grilled asparagus is hard to fuck up.  The bread is easy as hell to make, and is made in a skillet like most flatbreads.  
  
Hard part with the bread is learning to work with dough, which will only take one or two less than winning attempts before you have the hang of it.  Remember, not enough water is better than too much, also don't knead unleavened bread more than 2 -3 folds (gets tough).  
  
The gravy is easy enough as well, just be patient, since a good gravy is made by reduction, in other words boiling off the excess water.

* To make an instant face exfoliate, just add a course salt to your usual face wash. I use Himalayan Pink Salt because it's pH level is supposedly pretty close to your face's. It's kind of pricey for a jar of salt, but it will last a long time.
* To prevent nail polish from chipping, buff your nails with one of those $1 nail buffers you can get at any drug store. It smooths the surface to thwart peeling and rough surfaces. Don't do this more than once a week though because it can weaken your nails.
* If you like the look of shiny lip gloss but the the stickiness, use a lip balm before applying the gloss. The stickiness is gone!
* Use an eye-primer before eye-shadow to prevent creasing and keep your shadow on all day and/or all night. I have really oily skin and this really does work.
* Urban Decay's all-nighter makeup setting spray really is a great product. Again, I have oily skin and if I'm out at night it will keep everything in place without melting away.
* If you have blonde hair or blonde highlights, purple (literally purple) shampoo prevents brassiness or yellowing of the color. Paul Mitchell makes this as well as John Frieda (for a cheaper option).
* Moisturizing your legs everyday will help you have a close shave that will also last a little bit longer.
* Using a cream blush underneath your powder blush will help with the staying power.
* When you have conditioner in your hair, use a wide tooth comb to brush through and distribute the product. If you have wavy/ semi curly hair only comb it this one time (w/ the conditioner in) to not disrupt the wave/curl.
* Clamp-less curling irons will give you a more natural looking  S wave/curl than traditional curling irons.","1314835615"

Fall Weather Friends...man, it's kinda hard to justify Rainbow's actions in that episode, other than to chalk it up to a character flaw (she hates to lose). 

Applejack and Twilight both tend to play the straightman role in whatever quirkiness the others are getting up to; the difference is that Twilight gets more screentime, we're sympathetic to her problems, and she has a unique power in her ability to use magic. Applejack is the definition of a supporting role; you don't always notice she's there, but you'd miss her if she was gone.","1314835632"

I could take anybody off the street, give them a thesaurus, a voice modifier, and a copy of FLStudio with a nice microphone and they could do something equivalent or at least extremely similar to what Tyler does. But that's still talking about the music itself and I'd feel bad not addressing your comments about the video itself.


I think that ""art"" as a living entity, especially through video and photography, has moved past the whole ""shocking grayscale image"" phase. Of course that is 100% subjective, however if you look at any 14 year old girls' Facebook ""photography"" album it's going to be full of grayscale pictures of weird stuff. It's just one of those things that everyone does now and I don't think he deserves any particular merit for it.

As far as setting up a group/making music/videos/selling merchandise goes, that's a bit more involved, but I wouldn't say it takes a lot of talent. Like I argued with somebody else here, it's 2011.

No ultrasound had been performed yet, just a doctors pregnancy test to confirm the drug store test.

We tried a medicine, it was like antifreeze green, sorry I don't remember the name, to try to dissolve the fetal tissue and avoid opening her up. We ended up back in the ER 4 hours later with her in even more pain, I'll never forget the look of sheer terror on her face. That's when they decided to go in and take out the tube and make ensure the ectopic was terminated.

British people don't seem to see that there's room between authoritarian practices with kids and laissez-faire practices with kids.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was looking for just this response. Against the entire Roman army the marines would risk running out of resources (ammo, fuel, batteries) and would be in the shit fast. That is, assuming the army did not flee from shock which to be fair could happen to either army. Someone really should work out how much ammunition they would be bringing with them if we want to know how well they might do against the entire army in a fight to the last man.

Going to the top would be critical for long term success. The remaining troops should have enough knowledge between them to have the Romans then under their control making gunpowder and finding or refining oil. The technology they could have the Romans begin producing immediate would be primitive by today's standards but unstoppable by Roman standards. It should not be unreasonable to expect at least a few troops to be aware that gunpowder is made from sulphur, charcoal and potash. The first two would be easy to acquire for the head of the Roman empire. Potash is a little more difficult but can be made in a variety of ways using materials and techniques easily available to the Romans.

All those gun and explosives nuts you could expect a few to know of a few other ways to manufacture explosives. I would also like to assume the troops would share enough knowledge between them to get the Romans working on crude steam and combustion engines.","1314835650"

Scientists use animals for research because of the accuracy of the results they provide, not because they want to ""torture"" animals. The results aren't 100% accurate, but the other methods (simulations, cultured tissue) are even less accurate.

In any case, nearly everything we do is ""motivated by profits"" which is why we're such an extraordinarily prosperous society. Education is fundamentally no different from any other good or service you purchase.

Most of the evils you see in society are not caused by corporate greed, but by corporations who use the government to protect themselves and/or keep their competition from gaining market share. It's important to distinguish between justly-acquired profits (which can only be gained by engaging in mutually-beneficial voluntary transactions) and unjustly-acquired money gained through special interest legislation.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;So do you suggest all schools have uniforms or just not allow any graphic shirts? How would you classify this shirt, as a school, to ensure that no student wore it to class?

Yes, I do suggest schools have uniforms or not allow graphic shirts. Research shows that school uniforms are beneficial to students in most cases. So it's beneficial regardless. There shouldn't really need to be a classification for a shirt like this. Common sense should dictate it's offensive message, not bureaucratic policies. 

&gt;Public schools are run by members of society. Until society learns that something is wrong, you can't expect specific members of it to adhere to rules or norms that aren't yet in place just because it would make things easier. Somehow those school administrators must get the message that these shirts are unacceptable.

Again, it is simply not viable to expect society to change on its own through events like these. The school administrators learned how to be teachers before being administrators, they can influence children and educate them in their schools about such things as racism, misandry, misogyny and so on. If they can simply educate children, they do far more for society than society can do for itself. ","1314835660"

(this is a special school for displaced teens) There is no cultural framework for mental health in East African culture, for the most part. During my stay there, a student from Duke University did her pschology post-bac thesis project on the students of the school; she had trouble even finding words in the Swahili language for emotional states of being that we use in the Western world every day. (like ""trust,"" ""longing,"" ""anxiety,"" etc.) It's my opinion that these sort of hysteric ""possessions,"" serve as a form of cathartic release. For the few days following the exorcisms, the affected girls would immediately be more happy and extroverted.

So basically he destroyed my career at that company to discredit and get rid of me. Even after fighting it and warning them he was corrupt all I got a small pay-out but no apology. Not long after that the morons running the company did work out that something was up and they had him successfully prosecuted for fraud. Still no apology from them to me, no sorry you were right he was corrupt, nothing. So as far as I am concerned they are all stupid and complete cunts.

"Gamecocks","t5_2qi6j","You could say that, but you also need to recognize a few things:

**Arkansas:**
If you think losing Knile Davis killed their whole season you're wrong.  Wilson showed that he can play under pressure and the back up RBs have high yards per carry averages (6+).  This will be our hardest game and it will be in their house.  This game worries me to death.  I think when this team plays Bama that will decide who will win the west.

**Mississippi State:**
Underrated and if this was a home game I wouldn't be too worried but again this is in their house.  Mullen (whoops) has done some great things here and they will give us a run for our money.

**Georgia:**
You must also recognize that even though Georgia's running game is a gigantic question mark they do have the talent and a reason to play really hard (Richt is on the hot seat, blah blah).  Georgia has the easiest schedule in the SEC and that is why this game is so huge.  If we lose it will be hard to win the east.

I believe we have the talent to carry us a long way and yes, even have a chance at the NCG.  We will need some bounces to go our way though and this team has to play hard every single game and every single quarter.

**Position Concerns:** Depth at offensive line and secondary.  We have some very experienced O lineman but behind them we have mainly sophomores and freshman with limited experience.  Lattimore is amazing but we really need these guys to stay healthy.

The secondary also needs to return to their top tier shape from 2009 and 2008.  We also are pretty thin for the first 3-6 weeks except for a couple spots.

**What Should Make You Proud:**  Our defensive line. Could be argued that our 1st and 2nd strings could play almost anywhere. Everyone talks about Clowney and that is a great thing because I want our opposing teams to forget about Melvin Ingram.  This guy is a beast and had 9 sacks and 11 TFL last year and he wasn't even the starter at DE.  No matter what, the line is going to help the rest of the defense.

I could also talk about the Shaq Wilson/Rodney Paulk, our tall WRs and short speedster WRs, Latti and Jeffery, Gilmore, and Garcia/Shaw but just know that as long as we stay healthy and play hard every down we will have an amazing season.","1314835694"

Anyway, archaelogical evidence supports the thesis that thousands of years ago, the Persian Sea experienced a *regional* gigantic flood. It is also by the TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES rivers. The first evidence of agriculture (figs) were also found there.

Using this evidence and and your own logic, you can deduce how theistic evolution is the way to go.

AND TO CLARIFY: God and evolution are not mutually exclusive. Evolution is ""how"", God is ""why"". Problem is, people confuse the two. If you seperate them, it's logical.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I would like to hear your rigorous definition. But I hope we can agree that a function calling itself with different arguments is recursive.  So why can't we say that the virtual machine program is the function, and the image of the OS is the argument?

I actually forgot to say that I agree with you in that nested structures alone do not equate to recursion. And I obviously wasn't specific enough when I replied ""it's a VM calling a VM inside itself"", because you seem to have understood me as saying that nested structures are enough to quality for recursion - and I don't claim that websites are recursive.

Wikipedia says ""Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way."" So if the virtual machine is running the same OS as the original computer, that's recursion, because it's the same OS. I hope we can agree on that.

And what the guy in the comic and I are doing is taking machine as a class and saying that it's a machine appearing inside a machine inside a machine. We call it recursion when we generalize it like that, because as a class it's self-similar.

Regarding your examples:

Taking 'operating system' to be in the class of program, I'd say it's recursive in that it launches other programs that might launch other programs.

I wouldn't say an internet page that leads to other internet pages is recursive. Web sites don't run other websites inside themselves that run other websites inside themselves. And I don't think my definition leads to having to call them recursive.

I don't know Perl, so I can't say. But a Perl script that calls Perl scripts that calls Perl scripts - I'd call that recursive within the class of Perl scripts.

I might be wrong.","1314835698"

There are a few options, depending on where you fall.

I will simplify to a pair of binary options:
Are you a top student?  Is your family poor?

If No and No, then you will likely pay a 10K a year for a state school in state.

If No and Yes, then you will likely pay a few K for state school.

If Yes and No, then you will shell out 50K a year for a private Uni or go to state school for free (in an Honors College program, in many cases).

If Yes and Yes, you can go to a top private school for very little (the richest and most elite universities are doing away with loans, replaced by need-based grants).

And about my neighbor and I.  I would rather bear the burden of my education and then reap the benefits that I earn from it, than be society's ""investment"", and be obligated to others for my personal success and achievements.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","There is a very big difference between sectarianism and opportunism—one that many leftist groups, unfortunately, ignore.  As the article argues, petty-bourgeois (or middle-class) organizations play a critical role in providing illusions that bourgeois and otherwise nationalist parties and perspectives can play a progressive role.  The development of an independent revolutionary organization and perspective of the proletariat requires a systematic break from those of the upper-middle class that provide illusions in the reform of capitalism.

------
&gt;When I was about 14 we were having some family over (mostly my dads brothers and sisters), and all of a sudden we got a dog and bone ring up that my cousin was beat up by for chaps at the basketball courts a few blocks away. He had a broken arm, few cuts, bunch of bruises etc...
&gt;
&gt;Without a moment of hesitation my pop goes to the garage, grabs a crowbar, comes back in (with a shufty in his eyes I can never forget) and tells his too brothers to get in the jam-jar and they drive orf. They never found the older bairns who beat his fanny and I'm glad they didn't. 
&gt;
&gt;I had never seen my da be violent or cheeky to anyone. He's usually the bloke telling jokes, having a sterling time, and the type of person who can lighten any situation no matter how tense. 
&gt;
&gt;After a few years I found out that my pop is a former judo badass and he used to be extremely mint at fighting. He can certainly be intimidating at about 6'4"" and 230 pounds but to me he was just my hilarious chill pop. I know it's not much but it really made me see my pop differently and respect him a lot more.

As for a job, maybe for starts she can offer tutoring for students, or do conversation classes just held in spanish. Depending on where you live, you can check with your local community center, college or university if they'd be interested in these conversation classes, they're great especially for people who already know spanish and want to keep it up. Also, what's her degree in?

"geek","t5_2qh17","&gt;Are you required to have a permit for the gun and carry it in public?

It varies by state. In Georgia, a state with very allowing gun laws, there is no permit required to buy long guns (AR15's, bolt actions, semiautomatic rifles). However, a background check will be performed at the time of purchase. As far as carrying long guns go, there is no permit required to carry *any* long gun as it's not concealable. I can walk around the street with my AK47 strapped across my back perfectly legally. 

However, for handguns, it is legal to purchase a handgun without the permit, and to store it in your: home, car, place of work, or carry it in a locked case (while going to the range). But to concealed carry or open carry (in GA, there is no open carry without concealed carry) the process is as follows:

1. Go to a provost court and get the CCW paperwork. Pay them $30, and they give the relevant materials, namely, the paperwork and a fingerprint card for the sheriffs office.

2. You go to the sheriffs office, and get your fingerprints done, as well as your completed application. You give them a fee of $45 in the form of a money order and wait.

3. The sheriff does a background check with your state, and federal law enforcement (GBI and FBI).

4. If you don't have a violent criminal history, or committed any felony with a firearm, then you get your license after about 30-45 days. This license is valid for 5 years.

Other states will let you open carry without a permit, but not concealed carry. Georgia makes you get a permit before you can do either. There are some places where a carry permit is NEVER valid, off the top of my head, they are:

1. Government buildings

2. Courthouses

3. Public schools (Elementary, Middle, High, University)

4. Within 150 yards of a polling location.

There are probably several more, I just can't remember them off the top of my head.","1314835742"

This was solid hard evidence which could not be argued against without assuming she was lying.  However, there was a simple question ""does she wear glasses?""  This was lack of evidence on the DEFENDANT'S side which would have lead to an acquittal.  Without knowing that she wore glasses her statement was very damning and enough to get the guilty sentence, with that info her testimony was very questionable.

Evidence can be used on either side, a much more common example is ""Do you have an alibi?""  Obviously it is silly for the defendant's lawyer to not bring this up, but this would be a VERY pertinent question for the jury to ask if it were not brought up.  This is something which if the jury were to ask and they got an answer it by itself could lead to an acquittal.","1314835754"

They were saying hey rick parry you're a dick but he was fuckin Roger Ailes and drinking the Santorum from Chris Wallace's reamed out asshole so the MSM was all like ""hey Rick Parry is the new frontrunner, fuck Mittens, where did Bachmann go?""

Now, why you are especially a dipshit is because you fail to understand that a president is to be held to a higher standard and should place the good of the country before his selfish motivations and petty desires.  In this case he is using the pretense of a ""jobs plan"" to make a bitch move in an attempt to stymie the republican challengers.  That in itself exposes the fraud that was his ""plan""  Also, he doesnt want to postpone it because football is on the next night.  

So, are you attempting to defend this behavior?  Is it because you are that much of a weak minded ignoramus hell bent on party politics and drinking the generic cool-aid?  Or is it because you are 19, sitting in a dorm room, wearing a hOPE and Change t-shirt and listening to janeane garofalo records while you drink green tea and get hard while making snarky comments on reddit?  Or is it because your parents are defunct hippies who work at whole foods and drive a pair of Priusi and taught you the republicans are the devil and only liberals can save the world all while worshiping global warming like a deity and buying so many carbon offsets al gore invites them to take a ride on his jet?

It was going to save the state a lot of money, but it was also going to cost a lot of lives in fully legal negligence.

I hear people being pedantic about silencer vs. suppressor too. 

Anyways, I would argue that the word clip has evolved to mean simply a small convenient holder for ammunition.  You keep saying that ""clip"" and ""mag"" are entirely different things, but they are both holder of ammunition, right?   

Magazines, en blocs, and half moons are all loaded directly into the weapon.  Strippers are used to load internal magazines.  

Can we not group all of these, collectively, as clips?  They're not entirely different.  

I mean, a bullet is the projectile.  A cartridge is the whole package.  But when people say bullets, what do they usually mean?  

There's a whole list of ""misuses"" of words.  Most of them are allowed.  But for some reason, people can't get over the use of clip vs. mag.   Can't we just let language evolve? ","1314835767"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","Correct, this clip is good info. I'm an anal bastard about this subject. Because it's an illegal industry, so much of the information is very subjective and very difficult to get a straight answer. There is plenty of good information in this documentary, but a lot of it is not founded on tangible proof, but on the producers ""research"" and old wives tales. In my experience, every grower is the greatest in the world, according to them, part of my job is to take what I hear from these people, and try to interpret what I can prove in a practical environment. For instance, many people reference ""The Medical Marijuana Horticulture Bible"" for information. This is an awful resource. Some valuable information, but I generally have to do damage control if someone has read this book and believed what's stated inside. Good intentions, but it becomes this mishmash of old wives' tales that's been gathered subjectively from dozens of sources, some growing radically different strains.

As this incredible plant is native to so many different climates, each strain has certain preferences for conditions, fertilizers, additives, growth time, etc. This plant and the industry around it is so mind-bogglingly complex, the simplifications that these publications make are just to vast. I have spent enough time in this industry (it becomes your life, after a while) to not trust anything I'm told. You have to be able to replicate and prove these points via the scientific method. A lot of people seem to think you can just throw it out the window because ""Weed is Weed, man"" it certainly isn't, and it's this exact laxidasical attitude that is holding this industry back from being a legitimized medical option. However, the recent studies at the University of London, and Harvard university are making good progress into viable, scientific evidence.

"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","Thanks.  Getting good at skills capping with a good hero team could probably significantly reduce your average cap time to a few minutes per skill.  However there are some skill caps (specifically prophesies) that are a pain due to randomness, patrolling, etc.  I don't know how long it took me, but I remember getting hung up for a couple caps for well over 15 minutes.  In those cases it's probably well worth the price of an elite tome.

I would just say in general that all the times I listed are estimated maximum time limits for each part as if you were starting from scratch.  You can probably significantly reduce *every* time I listed if you work at it.  Also as prices are constantly varying the times could end up changing drastically so don't take these numbers too seriously!

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Depending on what version have, you will have different results.  I currently have the titanium edition. So make sure you have a copy of Mechwarrior 2, but have it as an image file and have it mounted.  There are many different ways to get it working but the easiest I found was something called MechVM, it will basically install the game for you and patch it to a working state automatically.

1) Download latest MechVM and Extract to anywhere - http://www.mechvm.org/

2) With Mech2 mounted, launch mechVM.exe, then click on the install+import tab!

3) It should now say ""Install (Your Mech2 Version)"", click it!

4) after installation complete click on Play Game and launch the campaign!

5) Play!

If you have a different version whether its dos, special 3d editions, then you might wanna check out mech2.ort (great resource for mw2), here is a thread that outlines all the current solutions to getting your MW2 fix.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I think that this thread did get pretty heated, but here goes for an attempt at a reasonable rebuttal that might get buried.
I don't think that a completely free market could ever provide a good healthcare system, because market efficiency is something of a myth. The laws of supply and demand will function better than any other system for fairly distributing most goods, people don't always behave rationally in their own self-interest. Bringing up groceries as an analogy is comparing apples and oranges. Food is a constant and immediate need, whereas healthcare is distant and uncertain one. People are generally not psychologically built to handle that kind of decision. While the free market may increase efficiency, bringing wealth and increasing the quality of living for many people, I think conservatives treat it as a panacea that will solve problems it isn't capable of solving. For similar reasons, free markets go through painful cycles of boom and bust that hurt those at the bottom the most.","1314835789"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","It's not the restart that's annoying... it's how long it takes... installing software updates in Windows 7 isn't fun at all. I experienced this the other week when my PC at work got re-imaged with a fresh install of Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.
After restoring My Documents etc. I ran Windows Update and opted for the important/recommended updates including Service Pack 1. After restart, it got stuck on that service pack configuring screen for ages, I got bored and went for a break. When I got back, it had rebooted but hadn't managed to install all the updates. So I run it again... this time it's actually installing the Service Pack.. and then it's stuck on that screen again for ages... 10% and not budging.. five minutes later 17%... no indication as how long I should wait. I go off for another break....
So that day I lost over an hour of productivity just to let my PC install basic updates. It's a Core 2 Quad with 3 GB of RAM, not like I was trying to update a P4.
Mac OS X.. I can't remember having to wait more than 5 minutes or so for an OS software update to install.. in fact I think it took less time to do a full install of Lion on my Mac Mini than it did to update my work PC to Service Pack 1!","1314835791"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, that would be today, I guess.

I have been unemployed for near a year bar some temp work here and there, and yesterday I get a call from someone asking if I can come to an interview for an IT sales job I applied for.

Strangely the interview is not at the offices of the company but at the local labor exchange. So I get all dressed up, go down there, meet the interviewer and it turns out she is just a person from a recruitment agency who it seemed just wanted to run through my CV with me and let me know she may contact me in the future with information on jobs.

I was just confused and depressed.

Oh, there was another time where I was in an interview for a **SALES** position and when asked about my previous jobs I started waffling about how in my last customer service role I hated that I occasionally had to do some selling.

Another time I got an invite to interview for a customer service job but my email spam-filter sent the invite to my junk folder. I didn't notice until long after the interview date.

I'm honestly so disillusioned with the whole application process. If I see the words *""we are looking for a candidate who is both proactive and reactive""* again I swear I may just lay down on the floor and consciously try and stop my heart from beating.

Recently I have considered replacing my cover letter with an individualized poem based on my application to that specific company. When I'm in the mood I can be pretty clever with rhymes and words.

What do you think? Can any recruiters tell me how they would react if I sent them a cover letter in the form of a poem? I have a feeling that it would be thrown straight in the bin.","1314835799"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok.  I wasn't more then 7 or 8 years old.  My mom was a community theater actor when she wasn't a stay at home mom.  She was in a production of ""Dracula"", in which she played the drunken aunt or something.  Key point to the story though is that the part involved her playing an alcoholic.  Now one of the interesting things about this particular community theater group is that one of the main guys that was involved was a biker.  Not necessarily a Hells Angel or anything like that, but tough looking, with really tough looking biker friends (...and really a talented actor).  Another interesting thing about this theater group was it happened to be run out of his leather shop.  Yes his primary occupation was like...I guess a leathersmith? (obviously made up, I don't know what you call a guy that makes leather clothing for ridin' the hog, a leatherator?).  Anyhow, we (me, my brother and sister) used to have to go along to my mom's evening rehearsals sometimes. And the biker dudes were always hanging around the leather shop and for a little kid they were big, burly, ZZ Top beard-havin, always with sunglasses on looking bad-asses.  Scary for a little kid.  So to the play.  The biker dudes knew my mom and were friendly with her, and one of them gets the idea one night after having seen the play to, as a joke, substitute her prop alcohol (which was ice tea that in the play is supposed to be sherry) with the real McCoy and not tell her.  My mom's first scene she has to establish the drunkery for the audience with several quick shots in succession.  And normally she would just fire them down.  First one goes down, and she described it as fire, in the middle of her opening scene.  She basically was coughing and not able to get words out and it was very awkward until she could get her composure back.  She gets the composure back and the play continues on with no issues.  The play is now over, me, my brother and sister and my Dad are waiting for her to come out.  The one biker dude who thought it would be funny is there with a couple of friends.  My memory may be a little effected by the trauma of what happened next, and that it was 30 years ago.  But, the minute she got within site, as her child...WHO KNEW when she had that ""I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!"" look from prior experience, knew something bad was about to go down.  As she's marching toward us with the ""whipass"" scowl, not even looking at us, she scoops some kind of leather working tool off the counter.  The biker dude now sees her and is laughing, almost giggly, like you would be after you pulled a prank (And objectively, this dude couldn't have been that bright and thought through the effect, no one ever thought there was any real ill will behind it, just a prank).  Mom marches right past us, tool in hand and gets right up on the dude, who is still laughing, and thinking she's just gonna yell at him.  Thought wrong brother....thought wrong.  Mom, in front of the whole family and audience filing out of the little tiny theater....grabs a ""rough"" handful of cock and balls, puts the tool right by them and starts telling him loudly how if he ever does something like that....she'll take 'em off.  That's a paraphrase, my Mom was prone to using unpretty words.  We children?  Horrified.  Why? Because ...if you've ever had your....*ahem"" ""business"" mishandled like that or done it to someone and seen a true ""you got me"" reaction, then there's no mistaking when someone's gotten got.  And dude got....got.  You could tell he was hurt.  At that was when I realized my Mom was a little too badass to be fucked with.  I wouldn't even consider it, even through high school.  And I wound up 6'6"" and over 250 lbs. The End.","1314835813"

There's an absolutely fantastic tool for this sort of probability work called [AnyDice](http://anydice.com/).  If you punch in:
 
&gt;output [count 1 in 3d6]

It'll output what percent of times you get one 1, two 1s, three 1s, and no 1s.  From there you can figure out ""at least one 1"" by totaling up how often you get one, two, and three ones.  Or you could just take the reverse of how often you get 0 ones.

The answers already provided by the folks here are right, of course.  But this tool should come in handy for a lot of other questions you might have.","1314835837"

The steel we use to build high rise structures is tempered past the raw materials ever used by a blacksmith so the analogy is kind of apples and oranges. High rise buildings are designed to withstand 5x's the load that it is bearing. This means that steel could heat to 750C and still only lose 20% of the strength and be 4x's more than capable to hold the structure up still.

alright.  not the advice you're looking for but the advice you need -- spend your goddammed money.  just do it.  if you engage or die with money in the bank, larva available, and open supply... that's **bad**.  if you're taking the time and effort to mine the resources, inject the larva, and keep the supply open... capitalize on it.

balance your gas income.  in the first game you effectively went 2base ling bling.  you won't need 4 gas for that.  in the second game you went 2 base ling bling infestor on 2 gas for wayyyy too long.  anytime you go infestor (or muta (or infestor muta!)) you need a lottt of gas.  understand which unit compositions dictate what mineral/gas income.

in the first game you poked a ling up the ramp and saw a big bioball, and then effectively retreated to your base.  you didn't need to do that.

1) You don't stick soap up your asshole.  Well, I should say MOST people don't stick soap up their assholes.  At the most you'd be rubbing the bar of soap on your butt.   
2) You're forgetting in the shower there's running water.  Things don't stick well on things under running water ESPECIALLY wet bars of soap.    
3) I don't put soap in my mouth.  Most people don't.   
4) Rinsing an item with soap is different than having the item **be** soap because when you rinse a soap bar (i'm talking like rubbing it in your hands under running water), the outer LAYERS come off as well as whatever's stuck on the outside.  

So to be analogous you'd have to be only rubbing a spoon on your soapy butt (soapy to emulate the no-stick aspect of soap and the fact that as you're rubbing the soap on your butt your butt is getting clean) under running hot water (the shower), then rinsing it with soap (when you then rinse the soap off), then peeling the outer layers off of it (when you rub the soap while under the running water) and then asking me to rub the spoon on parts of my body.

The only way to tell if these instances are ""goofy conspiracies"" would be to look into them.  You seem to just let others think for you.  You have faith in the conclusions of others.  You don't think.

For example, the idea of aliens visiting Earth in the 20th century sounds really illogical and nutty to me, but I haven't looked into the matter so I don't have a strong opinion about it.  I don't come to conclusions unless I've done my research.

You may discover that if you use this chemical on this organ or on this part of the brain, the animal goes to sleep instantly, what use is that beyond animal control? 

You can't convert that over to humans because the animal has no way to tell you what it's experiencing. Aside from that, it's again useless because the human will be asleep.

We all start out female. Normally, it's the SRY gene on the Y chromosome that triggers male development. If you have a defective SRY gene, you turn out female regardless of chromosomes. If you have androgen insensitivity syndrome, you'll end up female. If an XX baby has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the baby is male. There are people who are XO and XYY and XXY. And this is just biology - this doesn't touch ""gender"" at all. (I recommend you do research on intersex conditions if this interests you).

There is, btw, research to suggest that transsexuality is biologically based in brain structures. 

Also please be aware that many trans people do change their bodies (""external features"") to match their identity, so an alien biologist wouldn't be able to tell without doing invasive testing.","1314835887"

Same requirements go with interfaces... you can't ""instantiate"" interfaces just as you can't instantiate abstract classes.  You can define properties in abstract classes but not in interfaces, at least with PHP.

&gt;Abstract classes are good when you have a base object that has children which will need to implement their own versions of some functions. The parent (abstract) can define all of the shared functions, and the children inherit all of those automatically.
An interface requires you to code every one of those functions (or inherit them from another class).

Implementing an interface requires you to code to every function defined in the interface, just as extending an abstract function requires you to implement any functions declared as abstract.","1314835892"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","With any surplus rifle you should inspect it well before you buy it. Most of them have been sitting in crates packed in cosomoline, a thick nasty sludge that prevents corrosion. It gets in many places including the bolt and on the SKS the firing pin is supposed to float inside a channel so as to not make contact with the primer unless its struck by the hammer. If the cosmoline or carbon residue, or worse, dirt or some other substance is jamming it up a good cleaning may free it and danger of slam firing is averted. In my sks The firing pin was just bent or mangled and jammed too far forward in the channel so it was stuck out and i had a slam fire once. Cleaning it didn't solve it so I had to order a replacement pin with a retaining spring to keep it recessed until the hammer strikes it no matter what. Brownells has them here http://www.brownells.com/.aspx/cid=0/k=sks+firing+pin/t=P/ksubmit=y/Products/All/search=sks_firing_pin
but for $40 cleaning it is the best solution. If you are nervous about it, replace it. Its a cheap price for keeping your confidence of using the gun safely.

TL;DR- cleaning the bolt face and firing pin channel will almost always fix it if not, get an enhanced fring pin and problem solve, problem stayin solved.

3. I suppose the engine they used for F:NV was a bit dated, so using a different engine can only be a good thing.

(Q^T D Q)^T Q^T D Q = Q^T D^T Q Q^T D Q

In the middle you see two diagonal matrices with only orthonormal matrices separating them, so multiplication by them doesn't change your eigenvalues.  So you can see that the eigenvalues of A^T A will be the squares of the eigenvalues of the diagonalized matrix, which are the eigenvalues of A.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","In the olden days, it was assumed that humans had some natural facility for language, and an exercise called the _forbidden experiment_ was supposedly carried out by this or that bold-thinking king to try and figure out which was the ""native language"" of humans. A child would be reared alone without any linguistic contact and the first word it uttered would be analyzed. Psammetichus of Egypt reputedly concluded that Phoenician was the native language of mankind after such an experiment. Another story has James I/VI doing likewise and getting an infant who spoke Hebrew (considered the ""Adamic"" language).

Another tangential circumstance is that of deaf children in Nicaragua. Before the advent of state schools for the deaf, these children were mute and typically had a small repertoire of mostly mimetic hand signs and gestures to communicate with their families. After a few generations in state schools, the deaf children managed to invent a complete sign language (not just a set of gestures or home signs), on their own, spontaneously and independently. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language) has more on it.

The interesting thing about Nicaraguan Sign Language is that it took a few generations of kids. The first group (IIRC) managed to homogenize on a set of gestures and signs but there was really no coherent grammar. A younger cohort took that initial inventory and grammaticalized it. That probably has bearing on your thought experiment.","1314835914"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Well, no, mushrooms are not plants. They're fungi. 

Either way, how does that make any difference? LSD is semi-synthetic. If you were to consume straight ergot, which is the totally natural fungus from which the precursors for LSD are derived, you'd die. There are also plenty of other genuinely dangerous mushrooms, as I'm sure you're aware, so it doesn't really make a lot of sense to claim that something is safe, just because it's a mushroom.

There are many totally safe synthetic chemicals, and many deadly natural poisons. The idea that something being natural makes it safer is completely ludicrous. 

LSD is a single chemical. Mushrooms contain dozens, and if improperly stored are prone to rotting, which can lead to dangerous molds or bacteria (both of which are totally natural, by the way). Psylocybin and psilocin (the active chemicals in mushrooms), as well as LSD (and DMT, and a variety of others) are all tryptamines, and work in similar ways in the brain. 

You may want to visit www.erowid.org and read up on both substances. In fact, everyone who plans on taking any psychoactive drug should read as much as possible beforehand. It often amazes me how ignorant people often are about the drugs they take (and the fact that many people believe LSD is more dangerous than mushrooms, especially for nonsensical reasons like one is natural, and one isn't, is beyond).","1314835923"

Prices depend on what cloth you choose but I got a high-end cashmere suit with four cotton shirts for just over £200, the trick is to haggle like a local. I'd leave about five or six days to be safe when it comes to fittings, they tend to see you around three times, one for your initial measurements and to choose what you want and two more for adjustments.

What I will say though is that it's probably only worth going to that particular tailor if you plan on staying in Bentota for a holiday. If you plan on doing it then that's great, and I can advise you on the hotels and what to do there and so on, but there are tons of places to get a suit made all over the island, including the capital which is about a one to two hour drive away.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","First things first, I served in Catastrophe Relief for 7 years, roughly a weekend a month, because I'm neither the type that a) is capable of following orders without talking back big-time b) finds fulfilment in driving pensioners from A to B and back c) would boycott his own dignity by weaselling past the draft. I also d) already had been a member of St. Johns for years before, and St. Johns, in Germany, while being officially an Christian organisation, is pretty much Sodom+Gomorrah. (No, there was no making out on duty. *That* much of a work ethos we have)

Abolishing the draft, from a catastrophe relief POV, is *insanity*. Yes, you could fill all those vacancies in health care with paid positions, but having a standing, professional, paid, catastrophe relief is just an economic impossibility. Too much manpower needed if shit hits the fan, virtually no manpower needed when it doesn't. What catastrophe relief -- and the fire departments -- got from the draft were lots of young people, a significant amount of which would continue to volunteer their time as a reserve force. Without the mandatory time, there's now a drastic shortfall of new blood, and the reserve will be significantly understaffed in 5 to 10 years.

I always hear the word ""forced labour"" thrown around mindlessly, here. I'd much rather see service as -- last -- part of schooling. So far it has hurt noone to learn how to built a tent village, the paramedic ABC and how to keep a dike from breaking. Or proper radio protocol. Much fun to be had, there. When shit hits the fan we're all in it together, and the more people know what to do, the better. Last, but not least, available positions include stuff like leading people through the wadden sea, or counting birds on Helgioland. Seriously. You just have to look, and you will find something you'll like.


So, here's my proposal: First off, change the draft to include females, second off, change it to default to something else than the military (local fire department or THW, whoever needs people most, I guess) in case people can't be bothered to look for a position for themselves. *My* country, at least (Holstein, that is), is defended at the dike line, not at the Hindukush. If that doesn't happen, we're going to have Catherine-like failures in catastrophe response here, and I fucking don't want to see that. We don't have to duplicate *every* insanity the US are capable of.

In Germany, if fire departments are understaffed, the municipalities can draft people at random. That, afaik, happened exactly once in one municipality for as long as the FRG exists, because usually there's enough volunteers, not the least because of people not wanting to serve at the army and then realising they fucking love the fire department. It's no different in catastrophe relief, and a universal, time-limited draft followed by voluntary service is *vastly* better than having to right-out force people to do stuff because you failed to show enough people that it's sensible to stick together, and help each other, in bad times.

...not to mention that it's easy to find people to make out with at training camps, but I'm digressing.","1314835926"

To state something as fact is to express an opinion.

""Fact V Opinion"" is a dichotomy often abused to spread a grotesque conceptual confusion.

Although ""Fact"" has it's own ambiguity, in the context of ""Fact V Opinion"" most take it to mean the truth.

Literally ""Fact (as truth) V Opinion"" is a valid distinction between what is true and what a speaker's belief about the truth is. Of course a speaker's belief may not line up with the truth. Even when they do line up there is still a conceptual difference.

However, frequently the phrase ""Fact (as truth) V Opinion"" is abused to mean something else.

Sometimes ""Fact (as truth) V Opinion"" is used to designate (so the debater will argue) something of which we can be certain V something of which we must be less than certain.

At other times the distinction is used to designate the difference between a claim about the world (E.g. ""Global warming is caused by humans') V some moral (E.g ""A short skirt does not justify rape""), prudential (E.g. ""You ought not smoke crack""), or political claim (E.G. ""We ought have a carbon price"").

These are distinctions that it may be pertinent to point out, in the context of all sorts of debates, or otherwise use, as when organising a newspaper. 

The problem, however, is that when these distinctions apply, the literal meaning of ""Fact V Opinion"" does not (to the two components at issue).

We can take almost all (if not all) proposition to illustrate this. Take say the proposition that ""Men have walked on the moon"".

On the literal distinction there are the two components:

1. The truth about whether men have walked on the moon.
2. The belief about whether men have walked on the moon.

We could proclaim, against a moon landing denialist and using the first of the abused distinctions (that goes to certainty) that we can be practically certain about the proposition. This is to be proclaiming that the denialist ought change their belief. The proclaimer is proclaiming their *belief* that ""Men have walked on the moon"" and that there is good grounds for being practically certain about it.

Beliefs (opinions) are about truths (facts). If we want someone to adopt the truth about something we are wanting their belief (their opinion) to change. This applies even for truths that we take to be well established or easily verifiable (at least be the claimer). This applies even for the truths of morality, prudence and politics (unless there are no normative truths).

* ""Paris is the capital of France"" is a belief (an opinion) you can adopt and express.
* ""The moon is smaller than the sun""  is a belief (an opinion) you can adopt and express.
* ""We ought have a carbon price""  is a belief (an opinion) you can adopt and express.

""I have an erection"" is a belief (an opinion) you can adopt and express.
 
""BDR-529 was the license plate of Elwood's car in the Blues Brothers"" is either a claim about the fiction (in the story this was the license plate) and/or a claim about an historical event (during the filming this was the license plate on a real world car). Either way these are opinions about facts, beliefs about truths, which you can express. (That the fact V fiction is another valid distinction does not count the possibility of forming false beliefs about the fiction). 

&gt; it could have been unrelated ... it wouldn't be a comment on the thread here at all, it would be just a statement.

Whether the statement was related or not (you are right it may not have been) does not touch on the issue of whether the statement constitutes an opinion or not.

Also the issue of whether poster was sincere or not does not bear on whether ""I have an erection"" counts as a belief (an opinion) which could be stated.","1314835927"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Phoenix, I have to agree with stereoagnostic.  

Irrational: The claim that some individuals have the right to decide how other individuals should live who do not have that right: the inherent inequality between those who have the power to take and redistribute and those who do not.  This is completely arbitrary even if it’s a community decision.  It is also the current status quo.  All that’s happening is a suggestion that somehow its more moral if you are a worker to decide who gets what as opposed to a wealthy capitalist or government bureaucrat.  I.E. Its immoral to do x when you wear a purple costume, but suddenly moral when you wear a pink costume.  

Violent and immoral: A mass group of (armed?) individuals uprising against a smaller group individuals and taking things and willing to kill in order to get them no? That is, if the capitalist refuses and calls in the state or takes it upon himself by his own means to protect these items; will the would-be-expropriators just walk away?  Why encourage the state and that handful of capitalists closest to it to do what they do best and certainly much better than workers: wage war?  Retaliatory violence just encourages more in return.  Someone has to choose to finally respect the non-aggression principle.  

Impractical: The loss and destruction of otherwise perfectly functional buildings, machines, and other useful objects.  Deciding who to take what things from, how much to take and to whom it all should be given would be a massively impractical undertaking.  How the hell do I know as an individual what sort of life my neighbors deserve to have or not have?  Do I really want to initiate a huge undertaking and have to go to community meetings all the time to decide who gets what?  Not really.  I say let the individual decide how he wants to live.  What makes you as an individual more qualified to decide how he lives than himself?  By what standard? The one you and your friends invented?

Personally here’s how I’d like to go about it.  Reject and take no part in the apparatus that makes this unlawful claim to wealth possible (the state), except in those ways in which you are forced to do so (pay taxes, etc.).  Encourage others to do the same through conversation and voluntary exchange.  Refrain from violence towards your children from day one.  Plant the seed that using violence to acquire wealth and control over others is wrong and within a few generations (maybe?) watch as the state begins to deteriorate.  How easily then will corporations who rely so much on bailouts and campaign contributions to politicians who provide them with special legislation, be able to remain solvent without all those privileges?  Maybe I’m just incredibly naïve, but this process seems a hell of a lot more positive than bloodying my hands in battle against a massively powerful and corrupt group of individuals in a stubborn attempt to force them to live the way I think they should live.  Sure I don’t think many of these corrupt capitalists should have any of what they possess, but I’m not willing to kill them to prove/force my point.

However, I understand he is not an all-star QB, but he's the best option since 2000 when Aikman left. Everybody was riding the Romo bandwagon in his first few years, talking about how he's just like Favre, he's so great, etc. His playing style has evolved slightly, but he's still the same player. This last game against the Vikings, he was doing the one handed pitch that made everybody love him before.

People will just continue to go back to the ""CHOKE"" artist and the ""Going to Cabo"" nonsense. It won't go away until he wins a Super Bowl, and I'm not even sure if it will fully escape him at that time. Everybody is just looking for the next minor screw up (which all players do) so they can have some clout when they question his playing ability or his leadership.

That said, let me be the Frontius of 2011 and just throw a shout out out there for the Roman water systems. No, they weren't equivalent to modern day city system (obviously), but, for their day (and ... maybe the next 1900 years) they were the best of the best. (For example, there was more water flowing into the city of Rome in the 1st-2nd c. A.D. than into any city on the face of the Earth until around 19th c. London).

There's still going to be bad stuff in any pre-modern water system, no doubt. But, relatively speaking, if you HAD to deal with a city water system between (t-infinity - ~1800), you'd want to be in Rome somewhere between 50BC-200AD.

You quoted the second half of this sentence yourself, so you must have read it.

There are no semantics.  According to the article, 47% of US households paid no federal income tax, and 14% paid no federal income tax or payroll tax.  These are facts (though it has been estimated that 51% of taxpayers paid no federal income tax in 2009).  Federal income tax and federal payroll tax are two separate taxes.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","No, that *was* your claim, essentially.  Your claim was that all conspiracy theories regarding 9/11 are easily disproven, and in your parenthetical example you defined what you meant by ""easily disproven"" -- they can be proven false by employing elementary school mathematics:

&gt;because when simple facts come up (like, you know, measuring the time it took the towers to fall over the known distance of their height, and then using elementary school mathematics) that easily disprove their claims, and then they hand-wave it all away and pretend it didn't happen... yes. that's confirmation bias.

What is funnier still, though, is that you did exactly what you accused conspiracy theorists of doing:

&gt;the ""research"" they do isn't so much research, but digging for any little thing that confirms their bias, while rejecting the obvious. this is not research. this is intellectual masturbation.

Instead of providing a comprehensive equation, you used some 8th grade physics to disprove something totally absurd that is in no way representative of any of the 9/11 conspiracy theories I've been exposed to; i.e., the towers fell slower than they would've if they were theoretically free-falling.  Well, uh, even if they had fallen at an ""optimal"" speed, even an elementary student could probably tell you that your calculations leave out things like oh, say, friction and the composition of the materials resisting the downward motion.

So good job intellectually masturbating -- enjoy the upvotes, bro!","1314835997"

&gt;The Kinks were not punk, just as BB King was not rock and roll.

So now you get to decide what was punk and not? The kinks were one of the first bands to popularize distortion and that fuzzy sound so synonymous with punk rock, when they played they would have loudness contests with other bands, and they were one of the first bands to write a song railing against the record industry, sounds pretty fucking punk to me, especially when compared to the clash who made mediocre ska at best and used the punk movement to make money hand over fist. 


And if you don't want to credit the Kinks with starting Punk then you can go to MC-5, or NY Dolls, or a wealth of other amazing bands that were around before the clash or pistols. 

&gt;Also, stop being a hipster douche with the attitude of 'Oh my music is so much better and you don't know real music.' Get over it dude, please.

There are always going to be weaker people. And if it's possible to make them ""not weak"", it's not something you can do in weeks. Especially when tricks like ""pull out a revolver and shoot the fucker in the face"" are off the table.

The ""turn the bullied victim into a hero who can stand up for himself"" story is movie bullshit. And if the bullied victim is someone you love, filling their heads with bullshit just makes it hurt worse. If you're supposed to be able to make it stop but you can't... then they flaw's with you, after all. Or at least that's what a child will end up thinking.

&gt;  but i don't think in a self defense situation MMA is as useful and you can teach him a handful of things that he could use to defend himself

When I was in second grade, the bullies were highschool students that outweighed me by fuck... at least 140lbs. They were young adults. What in the fuck would you have taught me that would have made a difference? If I had managed to hurt them bad by grabbing their junk and giving it a nice hard twist or something like that it wouldn't have disabled them. I just would have gotten my head put through a glass window. The bus driver was old, nearly senile, and deaf as a wall. I had to ride on that bus for an hour. One of the bullies was his son.

Me and my friends were planning this for a while, and we acquired free grape chronic and even a piece! :D Okay, so, we went into the woods smoked a bowl, and the sensation of getting high was new to me and just weird but the first thing I did high was look at my best friend in the eyes with the most serious face and said ""I'm pretty sure I'm high"" *cue smirk*. Then, I preceded to jump around aimlessly lol. When we are on our way back to the car my friends, also high as fuck, remembered that we had ice cream(idk why ice cream was in the car). We RAN! I didn't here anything so I thought we were running from something, so I was scared shitless hahah. While in the car, I was in the back wondering what the fuck is going on, and my two friends were shoveling down ice cream, whilst driving lol. Throughout all this, I had remembered that we were going lazer tagging, thats right, BLAZER TAG! :D But, it was hosted by my school, I had to walk into my school and look so many teachers in the face. Blazer tag, wasnt too much fun but after we went back to my now friENTs house and just chilled for the night. It was, amazing:)

Here is a few to get started off, I'm going to ask a of questions, obviously I understand if there are confidentiality issues.

 I guess the thing that would be most interesting to me would be to know approximately how often they adjust positions. Meaning, are there daily adjustments, weekly or based more on inventory. 


I'd also be curious how delta neutral the positions are overall on average. Is the hedging mostly for large moves in the spread that could hurt profits, or is it more about locking in a particular spread to see a profit. Additionally I wonder if options are used at all, or if it is mostly straight futures.  

Essentially how tightly the risk is controlled, and I suppose as an addendum if limit moves propose any issue, or are crop reports like the WASDE not really a worry regarding her hedged positions. 

Thanks for any info she could provide.

1) Constantly watch the text file to see if it has changed.

2) If it changes, reload and recompile the script. Nothing too fancy here, most interpreted languages can do this.

3) Transfer the program's state from the old code to the new code. (by ""state"" I mean things like the position of the player, positions of the asteroids, etc). The way it knows how to do this, is that all pieces of stateful data are declared with the ""state"" keyword. So, the runtime knows which pieces of data it should try to preserve. It compares the old code against the new code (checking variable names and types) and transfers over as much of the state as it can.

Then it throws away the old code and starts running the new code, with (hopefully) the program's state preserved.","1314836024"

A very common belief, yet entirely unproven in science. We barely know anything about the human brain, it's ridiculous to presume that just because an animal is smaller that it is not sentient. Even minor changes in brain chemistry can produce wildly different thought and behavioural patterns. Even if we understood these effects properly, it is not viable to apply these conclusions to animals. Hence, your assumption that animals do not make conscious choices or weigh options remains just that-- an assumption.

Unless this guy WANTS to take pictures of HER (which he said he didn't! Pics of the Square! Honest!), then there is no will bending at all. The only way this he can be doing something she doesn't like (taking pictures of HER) is for him to be deliberately doing it. But no, she must submit to him taking pictures OF HER (not the square, there is a lot of square there for pictures that she isn't in! Heck, 2 steps to the left, *poof* shes not in the pictures anymore!) because that would be more polite. I'm not sure how she could single him out as taking pictures of her in a place like Dundas Square, that place is busy and has lots of people taking pictures all over. Was she jumping on everybody around the Square? No... just Menzies for some odd reason. 

The law agrees with him in the story *as written by this guy*. But was that what really happened? I mean, there is this little followup piece...

[During the investigation at the square, a security guard told police she remembers Menzies taking pictures of Muslim families two weeks earlier.](http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/08/columnist-seeks-cops-notes-in-alleged-dundas-square-smackdown)

Taking pictures of the square? Or her? Stalking/harassment is illegal too, and I wouldn't put it past a guy who has a history of writing pieces about how much foreigners suck and a witness saying he was doing this exact shit before. The police had 3 witnesses and a perpetrator who *admitted* that she hit him, and refused to do anything. Does that tell you something a little fishy was going on? That is a slam dunk case: multiple witnesses, evidence, confessions, everything.

For instance, I pursued the International Baccalaureate program under the British educational system, studied until year 13 - and my general impression is that I'd be repeating a fair amount of the coursework I'd already done (especially with regard to my higher level subjects). I *think* HL IB Subjects are slightly more difficult than AP ones. Of course, the experience in either is quite subjective but IB does subject its students to some vital components of the program such as Theory of Knowledge, CAS, and the Extended Essay (which I don't think AP is really capable of offering with the exception of TOK). Ultimately, I feel that there continue to be some vital components and implications in the GE structure which come off as 'cash milkers' rather than justified educational endeavours.

This is then aired on television for entertainment.

It is not ""a guy"" it is a television show showcasing sexual humiliation of women for entertainment.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;That doesn't matter for my point to hold up

Actually, your point that people worshiped Yahweh exclusively since the beginning of humanity is contingent on the Bible being historically true.  If there are parts of the Bible which are clearly false (and there are MANY parts that are clearly false) then there is no reason the entire thing couldn't be false.  And don't try that, ""the false parts are meant to be allegories"" crap, because that's just what it is.  Noah's Ark is written with the same tone as the Exodus.

&gt;Never said it was

But what makes your point of view more valid than say, that of the WBC?

&gt;Is a judge violent or evil because he sends criminals to prison, what about for life or death sentences?

Death sentences are bad.  Life sentences for repeatedly murdering people or murdering people of importance to a larger than normal amount of people is just.

Eternal torture for not believing a claim that is 100% evidence free is over the top beyond belief.  There isn't a crime that someone can commit that I would say that it it just to sentence them to eternal torture.

Except for maybe killing every human on Earth.  But no just and moral being would ever do that, would they?

&gt;He makes judgments

Based on laws that are determined to be just by the majority of the people.  God does no such thing.  He just says, ""This is wrong.  Do it and you get eternal torture.""

&gt;the bible is not perfectly clear on it

So you're saying that not only does God judge people based on ridiculously stupid things, but he also doesn't tell you what you can be judged on, either? 

&gt;Nobody can know what criteria god uses to judge, or even if there is a set criteria rather than looking at it on a case by case basis. 

And therein lies the difference between God and an actual Justice.  Justices criteria are clearly written out in plain English, most of the time open to very little to no interpretation.  As you have just admitted, you have no clear idea what God wants you to do, or if he's not just making shit up as he goes along.

God seems less like an all powerful all perfect being and more like someone who REALLY needs to think ahead more, be clearer about his intentions, and in general stop being such a massive prick.","1314836080"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","As someone who's gone from low bronze to diamond (and currently working towards the seemingly impossible goal of masters), I'd say if you're anything like me expect to get this feeling many many times.

I think one possible reason is that sometimes you will learn a new build, or a new style, and it will propel you higher up the leagues, but then you run into either people who can counter that build, or you run into builds that your main builds don't work again. Then it's a 'back to the drawing board moment' as you have to find out new ways to play, or at least better ways to respond.

It seems like hitting a brick wall at times, but it's basically just the long and never ending process of broadening your game knowledge and experience.

If you're losing games and you don't understand exactly why, go over the replays. First look for the obvious stuff.. did you lose because you're getting supply blocked, not constantly making probes, not producing army constantly.. Did you have the game won at some point without realising it (ie holy hell I could've a-moved at this point and won but I sat at home without scouting).

At other times maybe you lost because your build is bad against the enemy's build. Then you need to find out what kind of builds you need to learn to be able to play against that style. If you can't find any guides or help on forums, find some good protoss streamers and try to steal all their knowledge.","1314836087"

"wow","t5_2qio8","I am also an Arcane Mage hellbent on achieving Invocation whenever possible. I think the recommended extra talent points are for Prismatic Cloak and that anti-pushback in the fire tree, but since I am mostly still running heroics, Invocation seemed like a more useful talent for max dps.

As for the original post, I think the problem is twofold. A lot of players at that level are not accustomed to using interface mods (ie: DBM and castbar mods) to remind them when interrupts are ""important"". The other issue is that Wrath heroics were mostly ez-mode as far as I can remember and interrupting things was not nearly as essential as faceraping things with a faceroll rotation.

Cata has reintroduced a lot of aspects to dungeons such as crowd control and, indeed, interrupting caster mobs. Players that never had to deal with these kind of things are probably just inexperienced and need a little guidance.

My biggest petpeeve is players with interrupt abilities hounding me to constantly interrupt, ignoring the fact that Counterspell has a cooldown and I can't just spam it. When I'm playing with these types I'll usually POM-sheep if I absolutely have to.","1314836102"

Scaling per person matters. If you do not understand why, it is not possible to have meaningful discussion. 

&gt; and we want to reduce demand, right?

Why? Do we want to people wash clothes by hand, live without refrigeration and old people dying during heat waves? Do we want to stop life saving industries?

Or, I see. From your POV the virtue of solar is that it can not produces a lot of energy and therefore forces people to adjust.

Well, I am sure abstinence based energy policy will be much more successful then abstinence based sex education. 

&gt; and we'll see in 50 years time or so when the panels finally stop producing what might be done with them. Sound like a familiar strategy?

Yes, this is the standard policy for all industries but nuclear. Nuclear operators are required by law to set aside money for decommissioning  
 from day one. They are, however, sometimes prevented by politicians to use this money to achieve stated goals (see Yucca Mountain debacle).

* Switchblade - Will be feared and get a reaction out of any one who can't think for themselves. If you are caught with one, you are likely to be arrested regardless of if you were doing any thing worthwhile being arrested for etc. The reason for this is around the time it came out that opener method was demonized in popular media as being a tool of thugs etc as it was new and edgy. Unfortunately despite being wrong, this image has still persisted to this day.

* Multitool - No one will really care. They have all been socially conditioned to think it is cool/etc.

* Swiss army style folding knife - Same as a multitool.

* Fix blade knife - Similar issues as the switch blade, despite being cheaper, they are often times demonized as being only a weapon as the military issues them etc. Also as it will be on a belt, the a paranoid person, who thinks every one is out to get them, will get jittery over it.

* folding knives - Along the same lines of multitools/swiss army knives. Even though they are can easily be opened as fast as something like a switchblade and vastly more dangerous if used as a weapon(if it is a locking one), these have fortunately never been demonized in popular media.

In regards to the police, if they want to arrest you they can use any knife(even the one on a multitool) as a reason, saying you were planning to use it as a weapon etc.

Agnosticism, though, means so many different things to different people it's almost a useless word in a lot of discussions. On the tin it says ""without gnosticism"".. okay, but then you have to define what it means to be gnostic and what *not* being gnostic looks like. You end up having to define knowledge (something harder than you'd think in these discussions), what it means to ""believe"" and ""know"", whether or not those concepts are exclusive or complimentary to each other, whether you can be agnostic and also assert a positive potion at the same time, or a negative position ... it's just so messy. 

For me, I try not to assume what somebody means when they say ""agnostic"" unless there is a fairly clear context in the discussion. Most self-described agnostics I've run into would fall into the atheism ""camp"" whether they would admit that or not.","1314836110"

I prefer the three key layout of the macro keys on the G510 vs the G110 two key layout. Also, once you backlit, you never go back.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Wow, some pretty shitty advice in this thread.  

Your main goal is to get into college.  Majoring is something you do after you get in.  It is very important that you do well in classes this year.  College do not look at second semester Senior year and will primarily and sometimes, depending when you apply first semester Senior year.  So make sure your studies are your number one priority.  And it seems that you are already taking steps get that done.

Some school will base your acceptance just on grades and SAT/ACT.  Other schools will look for students who can do more than just get good grades.  But it would be advantageous to you to join a club in your high school to help you with your dreams.  Maybe join the Econ Club or something finance related.  Maybe next summer you can find an internship to help your cause.  

You also might want to look into these schools you are interested, visit their admission offices and campuses.  Even try to talk to professors and see what you need to help you get in.  They will provide you with more help.  

Good luck and study hard. ","1314836122"

With 5 CBs, it even gives Arsenal an opportunity to try things like a 3-CB formation with wingbacks.  With Andre Santos being more of a wingback than a fullback, and Sagna being comfortable moving forward, that kind of formation might be really interesting in certain situations.

If you you feel your son is really being bullied, please make an appointment to meet with his principal, guidance counselor and perhaps the police officer assigned to the school if there is one.  Treat the issues separately.  

Suck it up on the suspension.  He is only missing a day.  Here is the exact wording from my kids student hand book regarding breaking the cell phone rule:
""High School students will be given a Level 4 suspension (ISS 1-3 days) for the first offense, Level 5 suspension (OSS 1-5 days) for the second offense, Level 6 suspension (Request for OSS 6-10 days) for the third offense, and a Level 7 suspension (Long-term suspension recommendation) for the fourth offense:
So basically, if a teacher so much as catches a glimpse of a cell phone during the instructional day, these are the punishments.  One day is nothing.  The instructional day is anytime after the first bell rings til the final bell rings.

""Since the start of the season I've had a sneaking feeling that Kenny did not consider Raul to be a midfielder. I think he considered Raul to be the kind of player that can play as an Attacking Midfielder, Striker (In the VdV mold) or on the wings and no longer saw him as a central midfielder.  


Things that have confirmed this for my self were Meireles and Suarez coming on for Carroll and Kuyt against Arsenal, and Carroll coming on for Raul when he got injured.  


Also, I had a feeling that Henderson's position was never under threat from Raul. Henderson is much more fluid than Raul in terms of he can play on the wing or in the center of the field. (I'm not saying Meireles can't play there. I'm saying Kenny doesn't see him as a CMF). I honestly do believe that Henderson will get dropped but only when Gerrard is back and running. That will be his position I believe.  


That makes me reach the conclusion that Bellamy is in fact Meireles's replacement and not just a back up striker. I think we'll see Bellamy being deployed in the same manner that Raul was deployed this season.""

Yes really.  There have been several publicized attacks with illegal, unregistered, or cross-state weapons.  The more recent ones refer to the attacks on the Metropolitan Branch Trail.

It is legal, sort of, to own firearms in the district.  It's really complicated, and I've lived here most of my life.  If you want to try and familiarize yourself with gun laws in the district and just how fucked up it is, please do.  There are some caveats with what I said, registrations prior to 1975 are grandfathered, but the McDonald vs Chicago case and the Heller vs DC case created all kinds of changes.  For example, it now legal to purchase a handgun within the district, but there is no place within the district allowed to sell.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Until two years ago, I lived a very sedentary existence. Now that I've been exercising 1+ hours/day, I've completely changed my body composition and, I believe, my hormonal balance as well. I have noticed a marked difference in my behavior and patterns of thought. 

I used to be very sexually polite towards women and rarely initiated sex. My mind just didn't go there until after the act had already started. Now, every creature with a few curves in the right places evokes a sexual response in my mind. I often feel dirty for the places my mind goes after my eyes begin to casually wander. 

My interactions with other men have changed as well. When I meet someone for the first time, I immediately assess whether or not I could take them in a fight. This is during smiles and handshaking. When I pass another man on the street, I look at his eyes and feel a sense of power when his gaze averts before mine. The overweight guys never look you in the eyes - and neither did I when I was that size. 

At first, I really didn't like the change I was noticing in myself. My whole life I felt like I was a good person because I treated women with respect and didn't engage in monkey power struggles with other men. Well, I still treat women very well. I'm a good deal more sexually aggressive, but none more than the women I am pursuing are willing to tolerate. And I still don't go around starting fights. Most of what has changed is in my head. 

I used to have a very keen sense of other people's emotional states. Now I don't know and I don't really care how others are feeling. I used to enjoy deep emotional friendships with a small, close-knit group of friends. Now I much prefer to have a lot of less meaningful superficial relationships with people I can call upon when the mood strikes me for some single-serving companionship. I even find myself becoming annoyed with people trying to develop a deeper emotional bond with me. I recently took a solo vacation to fish at the beach despite the fact that I have throngs of friends who would have jumped at the chance to come with. For the first time in my life, I genuinely enjoyed my solitude. 

It's also interesting to note that the world seems to have more color and more moment-to-moment meaning than it did before. Just watching the leaves sway in the breeze can evoke within me an emotional response that I can only label as contentment.  

Hope you found this interesting! ","1314836140"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","1. First, please remember that most of my answers above were trying to clarify and expand what the author was saying, and therefore it doesn't completely align with my views.

2. I agree, we come to the same problem of asking why God exists, but this kind of question is a religious question and not a scientific question. Christianity posits that God has always existed, naturalism posits that matter has always existed. Not all religions posit the same reason for the beginning of the world; however, religious thinking can posit a reason whereas science cannot. If you want to seek an answer for the question why, you must go beyond science.

3. Here you are getting hung up on the issue of choosing which religion you might believe in. I believe that this is a very important issue; however, it is an entirely separate issue from what the author is talking about. For, if you are a person who accepts religious answers you have already chosen a framework that provides non-conflicting answers. No-one accepts a religion and believes every tenet of every religion. One chooses one religion to follow. Therefore, a person's religious beliefs offers them answers, not religion as a whole. It is these answers that can work together with science to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the universe. This raises other issues of course, but these issues go beyond what the author was trying to prove.

4. I never said that I believed that. Indeed, if you read my response again you will see that I am skeptical of this reasoning. Your theory here is also interesting; however, I am also skeptical of that reading as well. Either way, your reading also shows that the churches persecution of Galileo cannot be used as evidence that the church was anti-science because there were many other mitigating factors.

5. Again, you are expecting the article to do more than it does. The article is merely asking for acknowledgement that science does not answer every question about the universe and that extra-scientific knowledge can be answered by a religious system. To extend the metaphor of an anchor. Science can be seen as a boat. I would agree that it is a magnificent boat, larger than most of us can imagine. You as a naturalist believe that all there is in this universe can be found within the boundaries of the ship. That the all possible knowledge can be discovered without leaving the boat. The author is trying to argue, and I would agree, that the SS. Science is afloat in a larger ocean, that there is more to the universe than what can fit in the boat. Rather the boat is only a part of reality. Religion offers this larger perspective which can tell us where the ship is located, perhaps give us a clue at how big the ocean is, maybe alert us to sharp rocks towards which we are headed. The discussion of which religion has the right answers about where the physical world fits in is again a very important question, but it goes beyond what the author is trying to point out. Moreover, as I argued above, the problem of choosing a belief is a separate issue because once one has chosen a belief, there is only one answer.

&gt;Would it improve the science? Would a Christian scientist produce better results than a Muslim scientist?

Not necessarily, continuing the analogy of the ship, the boat is so very large and scientific knowledge so specialized that one could spend ones entire life analyzing and exploring the interior of the ship without ever needing to look over the side. Indeed, to study how an sub-atomic particle behaves, or how a DNA strand is structured requires no knowledge of what might be happening outside of the material world. At the same time, it does no harm to have a belief about what is happening beyond the material world. After all, many of the great scientists of yesteryear pursued science out of a passion for discovering God's majesty in his creation.

Your final question reminds me of a joke question badly paraphrased it is asked of a Christian who needs surgery: ""would you rather have a doctor who just graduated from college but is a devoted follower of Christ, or a specialist who has performed this surgery hundreds of times without issue?"" Of course one would chose the specialist because the specialist has much more knowledge and experience dealing with the things of the body than the new doctor. 

Because science is a specialized discipline, in which forces and effects are isolated from the whole, it is a discipline that can be pursued without any meta-narrative. But to deny that science and religion are completely opposed and can have no reconciliation is misguided.","1314836163"

1) Simply not true.  I'm cool with nuclear power, just be smart about it.  I'm not cool with putting a reactor on an active volcano, or fault line.  be smart about it.

2) Also not true.  Some chemicals are great.  Too many chemicals are bad.

3) Genetically modified crops are fine.  Patenting those crops and suing the farmer down the street who didn't plant them, but had seeds blow into his field isn't.  That farmer didn't ask for genetically modified crops.  It shouldn't be his problem.

4) I'm ok with some funding of trying things outside the box.  This is how we come up with cool ideas like the internet.  It needs to be a reasonable amount though.  Scrutiny should be applied here.  Tried and failed methods need to get the boot. 

5) Alternative energy sources will one day meet our requirements.  We are not there yet.  Technology is getting better.  More research required.  See the answer to number 4.

6) These people are idiots and I have no defense for them.

7) These people are also idiots.  I'm not convinced that there are no benefits, but there are no regulations for what ""organic"" means.  Its like putting a sticker on your product that says ""best."" 

8) I don't think there is any massive conspiracy theory.  I think we have a for profit health care system problem here.  My Girlfriend has MS, so here is an example for you.  Her old medication was 60k/year.  There are some very preliminary studies that vitamin D may or may not be more effective than that 60k/year medicine.  No one in the medical field is likely to pay for the study to find out because from a business perspective such a breakthrough would only have negative economic consequences.  These sort of situations come up all the time.  On the other side, we have amazing scientific and chemical breakthroughs because if you can patent something, you can make a crap ton of money from it.  

9) I think that conservatives are clinging to hope here.  I also feel the same way about evolution.  The amount and effect are debatable.  The fact that it happens isn't.  You can always find a dissenting opinion.  That doesn't mean that the opinion is valid.  according to wikipedia:
&gt;No scientific body of national or international standing has maintained a dissenting opinion; the last was the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, which in 2007 updated its 1999 statement rejecting the likelihood of human influence on recent climate with its current non-committal position.

10) I don't think this is a wide spread problem.  Sure you can find an example or two, but it just isn't very common.

11) This is so general, I'm not even going to start.

12) The biological explanations for intelligence vary more person to person than they do gender to gender.  It's such a small factor that it isn't worth much consideration.  

13) This all comes down to the fact that corporations look out for their own best interests.  Not necessarily those of the people around them.  If a corporation looses site of their bottom line, then they cease to exist.  Sometimes the things that corporations do conflict with the interests of other parties.  This often brings up complex ethical dilemmas that often get over simplified by both sides.  In instances such as fracking, I believe that the best course of action is to refrain.  I will admit that I know very little about the subject, but there does seem to be some concern for groundwater pollution and other potential hazards.  The logical side of me says that let's address these concerns first.   You can not un-frack to reverse damage done.  You can however frack a site in the future if it is determined that the practice is safe.  2a) I am unaware that the ban on DDT was unscientific or deadly in any way.  I'm not saying you are wrong, just that I have never read or learned anything about the topic.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Also, if you're just interested in the recorded sayings of the Buddha (the Pali Canon: http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/index.html ), that's definitely doable in a few years.  The Digha Nikaya (long length collection) is maybe 500 or so pages in english, the Majjhima Nikaya (middle length collection) is around 800 pages, the Samyutta Nikaya (grouped collection), Anguttara Nikaya (further factored collection) and Khuddaka Nikaya (collection little texts) are a couple thousand pages each.

It's kind of funny that the long collection is the shortest in the grand scheme of things, but each individual sutta within it is longer than those in the other collections.

I also found that having read the Majjhima Nikaya and Digha Nikaya there was a lot of overlap -- the same things presented in different ways to different audiences. The presentation is extremely consistent, and I think when you're reading them you reach a point where you really ""get"" what the Buddha was trying to say.

This is an unacceptable thing - you just don't write stories on ""bad"" dates you went on and call the person out by name.  That alone is grounds for people calling her out as being shallow.  But that happens all the time... so why did this story get so much traction?

By her own account, he was a tall, thin, somewhat interesting and seemingly rich guy (turned out that hes a self made multimillionaire).  So what was wrong with him?  Surely it had to be something bad.  But nope, all he did was play a geeky game at the championship level.  A decade ago.  That is seriously it.  That is the sole reason she found him to be an unacceptable date.  It was the most ""out of left field"" conclusion I've read in any story.  According to many *women* covering her article, it reinforces so many negative dating stereotypes that women face.

There are other factors why the story blew up.  A lot of the people read this story and assumed the author was at least very attractive.  But this was just a completely average (if anything below average) looking lady.  ""How does someone like *that* think she can be so picky - is she crazy,"" is what so many guys are thinking.

I have a hard time believing people who say they ""think they are in love"" because, more often than not, people who have been know exactly what it feels like. Scientific evidence has backed up these claims too--The person feels like an awesome drug you can't get enough of and is constantly on your mind. 

A female friend of 27 years old told me she thought she was in love with previous exes only to finally experience head-over-heels love and realized everything prior wasn't.

&gt;If the ratio of male to female suspects and victims differs substantially from those found above, departments should be alert to potential gender bias in their response to domestic violence. Ongoing training and supervision can address overrepresentation of female versus male arrests. (Research basis: Multiple studies of abusers and their victims brought to the attention of the criminal justice system [including civil protective orders] confirm the gender ratio as opposed to studies focusing on non-intimate and family conflict.)

Arrest more women then a certain quota and your department gets retrained and supervised on an 'ongoing' basis (ie. until you get that number to where it should be.)

It would be ironic in the common sense (cosmic irony) if, perhaps, by the very act of purchasing the ticket, or perhaps due to the conversation you had during the purchase, you influenced events in such a way as to cause the bus company to give free rides.

Out of any context though, the event 'free ride when you've already paid' is not ironic.

"Republican","t5_2qndt","&gt;how could the measurements in the first link even be taken with such accuracy with thermometers that only read in 0.5 degrees? (sarcastic) if you are going to try and throw out measurements, you have to do it consistently.

I didn't say the thermometers read in .5 degree increments.  You're confusing accuracy with precision.  A common mistake.  Digital instruments can read down to .01 degrees.  The problem with air temperature is that it is hard to get an accurate reading (ie, a low margin of error).  If you were in a lab environment, the way you'd account for this is to take multiple data sets and run a standard distribution.  But because these measurements, by definition, must be taken outside of the lab, the standard distribution method has embedded error as the conditions outdoors are constantly changing.  

So, what these scientist have done is compared apples to apples.  Using the same recording methods over a long period of time, they have developed the graph in the first link.  IMO, the results show that the data is inconclusive.  

Couple the difficulty of measuring temperature with the fact that scientist are trying to use tree rings and ice formations to determine temperature, and I am still not convinced we have a major catastrophe on our hands.  

Does this mean man can't influence temperature?  Absolutely not.  There is still good reasons to believe man can influence the earths temperature.  And green initiatives are certainly a good thing that I'd support.  I'm just not ready to go into a panic over global warming yet.  ","1314836257"

Give a shot of testosterone to a girl, you will see a direct effect to her biochemistry from that injection.  Give her regular treatments of testosterone, you will see progressive physiological changes.  Regular treatments of any levels of any chemical effects the organism taking them.

The chicken you eat all the time is bred to have extremely large breasts, and the cause of such large breasts?  The estrogen levels in their bodies.  You eat the meat with the higher estrogen all the time, you seriously doubt the hormones effect you?  Injection is not the only means by which you can get hormone treatment.

Hormone levels dictate your musculature and fat distribution, they turn on your breasts and they can increase or decrease body hair growth.

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","&gt;but the way I see it is that insofar as those are problems at all, at worst it's a necessary evil in order to achieve the greater good of achieving a dynamic that is able to aggregate the best of the web's content and create a thriving, dynamic community, even with as large a user base as it's become.

Is it really a *necessary* evil? I'd argue that the current culture of images, rabble-rousing, and karmawhoring actually creates an environment where it's more difficult to create quality content. I admit that there's a lot of room here to argue about the actual dynamics of content generation here. I can also see that your way of looking at things, as the overarching noise being an inevitable consequence of a thriving, dynamic community, is a valid and perhaps better perspective than the usual griping we do in r/ToR.

This discussion also hinges largely on what we consider quality content. In my experience, I generally learn new things and rethink my own ideas in communities without pun threads, meme jokes, and gif comments detracting from attempts at serious discussion. I've seen subreddits grow to the point where the R-tard behavior becomes noticeable and I strongly believe that it degrades the level of discourse substantially.

You could apply your argument to /b/ that the chaos and repetitive content is a necessary condition for some of the quality content (funny shit) they come up with. Perhaps that is the price of admission we must pay. The internet has nearly destroyed all barriers to ""publishing"" and sites like Reddit are experiments in curating through crowd-sourcing. It may indeed be the case that relying on democracy makes it impossible to avoid pandering to the largest common denominators.

Our cynical hand-wringing is futile, and maybe even accelerating the perceived decline in Reddit. After all, creating these opposite factions only further encourages both camps to retreat to extremes, especially since people tend to adopt antagonistic attitudes toward the Other.","1314836267"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","2017- Continuing to put his stamp on the NFL Commissioner for Life Roger Goddell is implementing new rules for the 2017 season to further protect players safety.

First, the players will no longer wear flags around their waste and be considered down when one is pulled by a player as implemented by Goodell in 2015. Concerned at the numerous hand and finger injuries created by reaching for flags, the league will now operate under a system where a player touched by a defender with one hand is considered down. The competition committee also passed by a very small margin the ""I got him"" rule which allows for the referee to blow the play dead if he doesnt have a good view of the runner but the defender yells ""I got him"" when reaching for a tag down.

Secondly, in an expansion of the Only Jogging Allowed rule which has dramatically reduced pulled muscles, in an attempt to totally eliminate them from the league, players moving faster than a brisk walk will be penalized 15 yards for Self Destructive Actions. Also included in the Self Destructive Actions penalty will be playing with an untied shoe, playing without league sanctioned ear plugs in place, a move being viewed as cutting edge thinking based upon the Hearing Aides of America study that ex-NFL players have a 1.7% greater occurrence of hearing loss after age 93 than the general population, excessive hand shaking, and sneezing.

CBS Sports went to Gillette Stadium for the October 4th season finale where the Patriots finished a 2-0 undefeated season with a win in the second round of punt offs to break the 0-0 tie, to get reaction to the rule changes by the fan in attendance. ""I think the new rules are great. I was able to stay awake well into the first drive of the game. Mr Goddell has done such a tremendous job of eliminating any chance of injury. When I walked into the stadium today I think the sign said the league is up to 700 days without a workplace injury. And I can't thank him enough for driving away all those blood thirsty fans. I can't tell you how great it is to be able to sit in any seat in the stadium since everyone else stopped showing up.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Reminds me of:

My job is so fucking unbelievable. I’ll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks I work with:   

First, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. Yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. The girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. She is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. She is as dumb as a box of rocks, and I still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe.    
   
The next chick is completely the opposite. She might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. Her career oppertunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. She is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. I’m not sure she even showers, much less shaves her “womanly” parts. I think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

But the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. And this guy is more than just your average pothead. In fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and I’m sure after work. He probably hasn’t been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he’s only 22. He dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960’s, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. Every fucking day I have to look at this huge Great Dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. Hell, sometimes I even think it’s trying to talk with its constant bellowing. Also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to McDonalds and Burger King, every single fucking day.

Anyway, I drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.","1314836275"

"technology","t5_2qh16","It's entirely possible that if the case were to go to trial, the fact the laptop was stolen could be suppressed and kept from the jury.  If you commit a crime, and than have a crime committed against you, the first fact does not matter and is usually withheld for fear of resulting in a mistrial.  For instance, when you read stories about a burglar suing a homeowner for falling through their sunroof and breaking their back?  The jury wasn't told the person was breaking into the house.  In the eyes of the law, whether a crime was committed against a person or committed against a person who happened to have broken another law, or was in the process of breaking a low when it happened to them boil down to the same thing.  This is why it's not OK for a police officer to punch a shoplifter in the face.  The fact they broke a law does not entitle anyone else to commit crimes against them.

The judge might very well rule the fact that the person recorded was not the legal owner, and that the legal owner did consent to permit LoJack to capture and transmit those images, but I find it highly unlikely that the judge would permit the fact that the laptop was stolen for fear of tainting the jury.","1314836276"

"politics","t5_2cneq","So lets recap.  You used specious logic to make a claim that no one would make.  I provide an argument that illustrates why that is wrong.

You respond by talking about sarcasm when none was used.  I illustrate the irony of your crusade in that you use shitty logic in efforts to destroy shitty logic.

You respond with personal attacks coupled with the mastery of mechanical engineering based logic to conclude that since I replied 4 days later than your arbitrarily based reply standard it must have taken a total of 4 days to come up with a reply.  Forgetting certain initial conditions such as I don't know, I have a life and am not necessarily on reddit every day like you appear to be.  In and of itself ironic since reddit appears to be your WoW.

I chastise you on the further use of shitty logic and state I would be happy to go over your argument.  Which should be a piece of cake since you're mister M.E. billion dollar project guy.

You use your systems analysis skills to determine I play WoW as a sort of insult.  Perhaps in efforts to avoid debate about your post about logic or because your mastery of statics makes you too chickenshit to interact with the real world and the constantly influx and changing multi-variables existing therein.

I (in the vernacular) WTFPWN you since it's obvious you can't argue or debate worth a shit or even state your position coherently although I've asked you to several times.  A hopeless endeavor as at most your repertoire consists of one liners, minimal introspective capabilities and a distinct fascination with wow.

You imply I'm high and in a turnabout tell me to go outside and get fresh air after having just chastised me for taking 4 days to respond because I was outside getting fresh air.

I respond to your obvious disconnect by guessing you're a Republican.  To which later you refuse to confirm or deny because obviously I'm correct and you can't give me a win so easily as it would speak of my valuation skills of yourself and the Republidumb philosophy and profile you match.  I'm Republican too btw.

Instead of attending to the matter at hand, your arguments, you feel you must defend your honor by expounding on your vast capabilities and life accomplishments.

You claim my arguments are sophomoric yet provide no counter.  Claim I'm a stereotypical armchair philosopher yet provide no examples or templates, or what have you, to validate your position or destroy mine.  Claim I use two cent words, stroke my soul patch (whatever that is) in efforts to convince myself that I'm genius, yet provide no examples.

Then you evaluate my life, offer advice and make other claims while doing the whole ""suddenly now *I'm* to busy for this"" excuse because you know I will own you.  Then as you run away with your tail between your legs you try to get in one last WoW jab.

Run away if you gotta.  If it saves your ego go for it.  Not everybody can make a statement and have the balls to defend it.  But if you can't, maybe you shouldn't make it in the first place.  People like me thrive on destroying closeminded simpletons as yourself.

Really, this whole ""you have to speak ENG/FRE to be citizen"" is a newish phenomenon.  Those who harken to go back to our real Canadian values of yore should take note that this means letting people become citizens as long as they are generally law-abiding, productive people, and not really giving much of a fuck if they don't speak our language.  

Not to say Canada was a bastion of tolerance back when or things were better then, but the fact remains the Canada, like all countries/states/city states/fiefdoms since whenever has had immigration/emigration of other sorts of ethnic groups who speak a wild variety of different tongues

"politics","t5_2cneq","No, it's not. Again, your interpretation is wrong by the context and further statements. Again, post the context, or are you too afraid to post it? I'm assuming you've read the surrounding sentences, you know, the parts which talk about right to privacy not being absolute, adding in considerations of other court decisions dealing WITH THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY, and thus ""qualifying"" it. There is no mistake here, the only way your ""interpretation"" works is by removing the context so that you can misconstrue what they are saying.

""just giving up on me""? When I asked for a quote what did you do? No seriously, do you really think your quote satisfies what I asked you to do? Where is the part about restrictions not denying it status as a fundamental right?

You probably still think the president appoint judges, even after being flat out wrong and even admitting that all he does is nominate them.

You still haven't given sources or evidence behind your claims really.

You haven't even given a good definition of a right. The claim that abortion is a right is like saying surgery for a new heart is a right.

You still haven't found out yet, even after given evidence and the direct 14th amendment, that the 14th amendment applies to states and not the federal government.

Can you get an abortion a week before the baby is due? I guess I'll answer for you since you'll try to say yes, the answer is no. That simple fact, literally means that abortion is not a right. Period. The only reason why the right to privacy is not absolute is due to the nature of privacy.

You seem to think your interpretation is the one that matters. I backed up my interpretation, but your baseless interpretation? You just claim mine is wrong and yours is right with literally nothing. Where do you come up with that? As if you are infallible, literally the only thing you supplied as proof was that it came from your mouth.

Listen up. When you come with arguments, you are supposed to provide the evidence and support for them. You can't do any of that, which simply means your arguments are nothing but your own opinion.

Again and again I have to bring up this point, just because America does some version of it, does not make it right. If you think China can do it because America does something similar, then that premise assumes that everything America does is OK, so then what's the harm in China doing the same?

There's also a difference in scale and intent. The American government obviously doesn't care a whole lot about what the international community thinks of it.

It's ok, I accept your apology for sounding like a douche.

&gt; no oriental chef uses a cast-iron wok

Who gives a shit? Does The OP sound like he wants to be a chef? Cast iron at high heat gives the good sear that is required for stir fry.

&gt;The reason is so that the wok can heat up fast and cool down fast according to their needs.

Who on this thread is concerned about this?

&gt; However, home cooks without the proper wok burners are better served with a nice skillet. It heats faster because it contacts all the burners rather than a small part at the bottom. 

You're making stupid assumptions. My cast iron wok has a flat bottom so its thermal transfer rate is quite sufficient for my purposes.

A skillet is not adequate for Chinese stir fry, because it lacks the rounded bottom.","1314836328"

My advice for a parent? Go talk to the bully's parents when they're home. Be nice to them, try to get them to invite you inside... even if it means telling them that your kids a little sissy and you don't believe it happened. Then once inside, pull out a handgun and shoot the father in the face. Tell the mother that if she so much as screams... she and the kid are next. Have her help you dispose of the body and tell her the police can't protect her. Make her believe it. Even if you are arrested, blame it on her that you only helped dispose of it once she killed him, that you were having an affair... even if you can't kill her, you can make her kid an orphan that way. If somehow you're acquitted, go finish her and the worthless offspring next.

Ron Paul is an isolationist. He wants to withdraw from the world. He'd like to see us drop out of NATO, the U.N., cancel trade agreements and generally turn his back on the world. That would be just a stupid foreign policy.

*Tell me you can't be serious.*

Of course I'm serious. Ron Paul is not only unwilling to compromise, he's unwilling to even listen to anyone else's ideas. He is so convinced of his correctness that he can't even acknowledge that different points of view exist. Demagogue pretty much sums him up.

*You should know that those newsletters weren't written by him by now.*

I know no such thing. They were written in first person, referenced his family and friends and were published under his name. He claims that he didn't write them but he says that he has no idea who did. Since the staff of the paper was something like four people and three of them were relatives of his one would think that he would have a pretty good idea who was writing those things.

*The NAACP has even said that he's not a racist.*

One member of the NAACP does not constitute the entire membership of the NAACP. The member in question had programs running that were dependent on Federal dollars to continue to operate. No one in that position is going to say anything bad about the King of Pork.

They involved: 

1 intaglio project (you scratch something into plexiglass, dab it with ink, and print)

1 block printing project (cut into a piece of rubber like a giant stamp and print)

1 silkscreen project (this one is the hardest by far and requires many steps and troubleshooting)

+ you have to document each of these processes and put them in a sketchbook, along with a few other exercises and a final ""lesson plan"" assignment.


Not much drawing experience is needed, but all of the technical skill (not getting paint everywhere, making sure your multiple prints are centered correctly, applied correctly, and clean) takes hours to manage. Also, like most Uvic courses, printmaking always requires you to go ""above and beyond"" your criteria and get really creative to get the A.

He gets to make a decision before his daughter does, and his decision impacts her ability to make her decision (if he disapproves and you concede, or if she has to make her decision with the knowledge of his disapproval, or if she doesn't want to marry you but feels pressure from her father's endorsement)

"snowboarding","t5_2qi0t","You def. don't have to stay with Libtech.   Never Summer makes very high quality boards and almost everyone has positive things to say about them.   I like Capita boards too.  That is a high price point you have to work with , so you will be able to get a real good board for that price.  

As far as boots and bindings go:  you HAVE to try on the boots in the shop.  All that matters is getting the most comfortable boots for your feet.  Try on everything.   Brand isn't important.  Fit is everything.

Once you get your boots sorted, then you can check out your bindings.  The key is to make sure the bindings you select fit your boots.  Again, you'll probably have to test it out in the shop, or if you order online, ask the sales rep.   Also ask people on forums if so-and-so boot fits so-and-so bindings.    If you get boots and bindings from the same manufacturer, they will 100% fit.  For bindings stick to the 'name' companies, as they tend to build the most quality units (Union, Rome, Ride, Forum...).    Burton makes quality bindings too, but be careful, as they often make models that only work with their propriety binding/board system (ie, you might not be able to use them with the board you bought).    

As an example: I ride a Libtech TRS, with Burton Ruler boots, and Ride Contraband bindings.  Everything fits and works well in concert.

You are probably going to want boots and bindings that are medium stiffness.  Real stiff boots/bindings are for freeride, whereas very flexible boots/bindings are pure park.  You want something that will give you and enjoyable feel where ever you ride, especially given that you are growing into the sport and still developing your technique.

A real good website for comparing different boards, boots, and bindings is [thegoodride.com](http://www.thegoodride.com).   It won't tell you fit of boot to bindings, just general overview stuff.  Tons of reviews and recos.

**EDIT**:   Just had a thought.  Check out the [GNU Riders Choice Wide c2BTX](http://www.thegoodride.com/snowboards/by-name/218-gnu-riders-choice-and-riders-choice-wide-snowboard-review.html).  GNU is made by Mervin, the same manufacturer as Libtech.   The new Riders Choice is an awesome all around board.  Excels in the park, but with changed design elements that allow it to work all over the mountain.  Great board.   A little cheaper than Libtech too.   From what you were describing, it sounds exactly in your wheelhouse given your needs/priorities.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; quantum physics seems to suggest that many things don't exist (or at least their properties are uncertain) until they are observed

It doesn't say it in the way that you're presenting it.  You seem to be treating an ""observer"" as if it is a mind, but the ""observer"" can even be a particle.  It really just means, loosely, that something is interacting with it in some way...not that some*one* is necessarily observing it in the sense of ""thinking about it"".

&gt; Couldn't that suggest that the external world is a product of the internal mind, and not the other way around?

Solipsism is unfalsifiable, so it will always remain a possibility.  We just don't have sufficient reason to believe that it *is* the case at the moment, and that's really all we can say.

&gt; Still sounds like a dualistic view to me. You're claiming that there are things that exist outside the material/physical world.

I think I figured out how to allay this confusion more concisely since I last posted.  ""Inside"" and ""Outside"" are not references to physical location.  They are references to where something is in relation to your own perception.  If something being referred to exists within your perception *only*, then it is ""inside"".  If the thing being referred to exists apart from your perception, then it is ""outside"".

&gt;&gt; The reason this matters is that your mind (self) is the only thing that you have direct access to. You can be 100% certain about the things that are within your mind

&gt; I disagree, I'm sure you've come across Descartes and the brain in a vat argument. I'd say the only thing we can really be certain of is that we had one experience.

No, it sounds like you agree.  The experience that you have in your mind right now *is* what I said you have direct access to.  Even if you are a brain in a vat, you can still be certain that you are thinking what you think you're thinking right now.


&gt; yet you base the one thing that you can be certain of (experience) on something that's uncertain.

I'm not really sure what you mean in ""basing our experience on something"".

&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense to base the external world (which you admitted to be degrees of certainty/uncertainty) on something you can be sure of (a moment of experience)?

It sounds like you're arguing for empiricism, because that's basically what it says:  Okay, so assuming there is an outside world, we want to learn things about it.  As humans, the only way we have to access the things we want to know about the world is through our sensory experiences.  We can be sure that we are having the experience, but we cannot be sure that what we are experiencing is giving us the full picture of the outside world, and we can make mistakes (see: optical illusions), so that is why we need to try to find as much corroborating experience as possible to justify whatever conclusions we draw about the world outside.  

So yes, empiricism calls for all of our beliefs about the outside world to be based in the experiences we have.  (We really don't have anything else to appeal to even if we wanted to)","1314836383"

They say that if you cannot *prove* your position, then you have to be agnostic about it, but then elsewhere in the discussion talk about agnosticism as if you feel both sides are equally supported. The chart comes into existence, I think, as a way to defuse this attempted conflation of ideas.

I've been in similar states of mind before, thinking that there's nothing really here to keep me going. but I see life as a challenge, and I'm not going down without a fight. plus it's worth it, for those moments when it all becomes clear - simple stuff like a shared joke, a kiss on the cheek from a hot girl, a blinding guitar solo that makes the hair on your neck stand on end. life is really just a series of moments strung together, but the gaps in between are opportunities to create situations where you can get more of the good stuff. like setting up events with friends or family, planning a nice meal, or getting tickets to a gig. my life is about creating moments that remind me why I'm here. because on my death bed, if I have a chance to think about my life, I know I'll miss those moments so much, and I'll be devastated that I can't have more of them. and I'll also realise how much I love the people around me.","1314836409"
"pics","t5_2qh0u","Just to clarify:

By law, the procedure must be done in the most painless way possible, using the least number of animals possible, with the best available techniques. Vivisection without sufficient analgesia to prevent perception of pain would be exceedingly rare, especially on animals ""above"" mice and rats.

Any research involving stents, for example, would be done with proper anesthesia administered by a laboratory animal veterinarian, just as it would be with a human receiving a stent.

Saying ""at the end, if they haven't died, they are given a lethal injection"" is also misleading. An endpoint must be clearly defined in the  paperwork submitted to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and it is not acceptable for animals to ""die"" as a result of a procedure if that procedure is not specifically intended to cause death (and if it is, the researcher would need a very strong justification.) If an animal appears at risk of dying from the procedure, it must be removed from the experiment and either treated or euthanized.

As far as ""a significant amount"" of research being BS: if anyone is concerned about this (and I personally am) you should become active in learning about how you can improve the IACUC committees at the universities and labs near you. Each state has its own rules, but generally speaking the committee consists of a veterinarian, a researcher, and at least one member of the public not affiliated in any other way with the research institution.

Unfortunately, most of these people are overworked, undertrained and underpaid for what they do. I've sat in many IACUC meetings, and I've seen for myself that the IACUC is not effective. Let me take a step back and talk about what the IACUC is: they are a committee at a particular institution that must review every research proposal that involves animals, and they must sign off that it is okay for that research to be done. Unfortunately, doing a good job at this would mean that you must 1) have a background in statistics to ensure that research is minimizing the number of animals without compromising data (most lab animal vets do not have such a background), 2) you must be familiar with the literature or you must become familiar with the literature of each little sub-specialty of research to ensure that every investigation is likely to provide new information; finally, 3) you must have sufficient time to apply 1) and 2) to every single request that comes across your desk.

At the institutions I've worked with, the research is split among IACUC members for an initial inspection-- a typical workload may consist of 10-30 proposals each week per person. The IACUC member must read each of the proposals, decide if all the legal requirements are met (including statistical, analgesic, etc issues), and if not, flag it for discussion later. Each week, the IACUC will then meet, and each person will give a rundown of their cases. Now you have 3-10 people in a room (some states have big IACUCs, some small) and they must go over dozens of cases. The person originally assigned the case will run it by the group really quickly. If they had a concern, they discuss it with the committee and decide what changes need to be made and the most tactful way to bring this to the attention of the researcher.

I've spent a number of years around IACUC committees and helping IACUC members review their stuff, and I've never seen any member who could calculate p-values or do a T-Test. I've never seen one search the literature for more than 5 minutes for a duplicate or near-duplicate paper.

I'm not trashing IACUCs here-- it's not their fault. Basically they are given an impossible job. The lab animal veterinarian, for example, generally has a full-time job caring for thousands of animals at a big research institution. Other than the hour they spend in a formal meeting, the rest of their job is done whenever possible between animal care tasks.

I feel very strongly that IACUCs should be bigger, they should have time mandated during which to review their paperwork, and that each committee should have a statistician or someone who the public can trust to be highly proficient in statistics on it. Until this happens, regulatory oversight will be impossible in any realistic sense. ","1314836409"

Inner game is fixing coping mechanisms that we have designed for ourselves. Sometimes this is hard to change if we are unsure of what those things are to change.

&gt; If you go in expecting defeat, you have already lost.

This is only a symptom of the problem and not the cause of it.

Most things we see are a symptom and not actually the cause. Sometimes those symptoms can be the cause of other issues that will show themselves with other symptoms.

Think pimple. A pimple is caused by a dirty pore. The body then tries to reject the dirt. In doing so it causes a deeper infection. This deeper infection then progresses into a bump. This bump is inflamed and therefore shows as a red bump. When popped it releases puss.

Cause &gt; effect &gt; cause &gt; effect &gt; ad infinitum

Generally we see an effect and go for the cause however the cause is actually produced by a deeper issue effect caused by a deeper cause ad infinitum. We generally will use logical constructs to try to fix or bandaide a cause or effect so that the issue does not progress with anymore causes or effects.

Your statement is a bandaid... one that rarely works. It is easier to dig further than to institute a bandaid over a deeper issue that has a stronger force than the logical construct can process or hold.

Here is a trick I used..

From your house, take a piece of aluminum foil and make a cell phone call. Then, in the middle of the call, wrap the phone in aluminum foil and this will cause your phone to lose service and drop the call. From AT&amp;T's end it shows up as a drop call in their system so then you call them up and say that in your house you get bad reception and sure enough when they look in the computer it will show a high drop call rate for your residential address.

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","Alright, keep in mind that I'm an amateur EE.

So ohms law as it applies to these system:

Assume your voltage remains more or less constant. When the ohms drop, your current increases to take up the slack in the equation. So as ohms drop power increases. To get your power in watts, use amps times volts.

So with the lower impedance headphones, you might be exceeding the current rating of your amp. Or the thermal specs. Or if you go below the internal impance of the amp that can cause trouble as well.

My thought would be to check the output voltage from the ipod when it's set at a volume you like, then calculate a gain figure to get that same voltage when you have your ipod set at about 25% or so.

Also, why the difference in voltages between L and R? And the figure in watts should be very small. 50 watts in an enclosed space will cause permanent hearing damage, let alone stuck straight in your ear. It should be less than a watt I would assume.","1314836440"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Today’s atheists claim they want proof, but they define that as something that can be verified by sensory data. But if something can be determined by sensory data, it cannot by definition be God.

If it has no discernible effect, it might as well not exist. There are lots of other things we can conceive of that similarly have no discernible effect. There is nothing special about your conception of ""god"" in this regard.

&gt; An atheist says there is no data that proves God, but there is much evidence.

Such as...? Please provide it.

I'll ignore use of the ""other"" definition of atheist and agnostic, and focus on the latter.

&gt; Millions have had very real claims to have a true relationship with God. In fact, many more claim to have a relationship with God than those who don’t.

Millions have had very real claims to have been abducted by aliens.

5. Is largely irrelevant. If there is no evidence to suggest ""god"" exists, then there isn't much to be said about its properties, good, cruel, or otherwise. That said, I do find the god of the judeo-christian tradition to be absolutely terrifyingly cruel and evil.

6. Is merely an argument from consequence. If something is unpleasant or undesirable, it does not follow that it must not be true. That is FAIL logic.

&gt; Do you really want to go down that road? Read “The Plague” by Camus or any of the writings of Kafka and you’ll see what that tastes like. 

Read some Sagan or Dawkins instead. There is much about life and the universe to be inspired by.

&gt; If you’re going to be an atheist, then at least be an honest one and don’t pretend anything means anything.

Meaning requires someone to give it. That someone is you.

&gt; If you told a doctor you don’t believe in heart disease any more and you’re going to eat bacon every meal from now on, he would not sugar coat it for you. Neither will I.

At least heart disease and bacon are observable. ;)

Institutionalized public defense is an extremely competitive field, and most are very competent attorneys (or at least as competent as their ADA counterparts). I've see more private defense attorneys be incompetent then the public ones.

I've also personally dismissed around 15% of my cases because there's not evidence sufficient to convict, and many of these are poor minorities with rap sheets fifty pages long. Tons of cases are dismissed for that reason, not just the ""high-profile and wealthy"".  You are absolutely incorrect about how ""in the majority of criminal cases where the defendant is poor and represented by a public defender"" the prosecutor just ""presses ahead regardless of the paucity of evidence"". Those cases are fucking dismissed. You know why? Because that prosecutor has a hundred other cases exactly like it where they CAN win at trial. 

And even with an incompetent public defender, thanks to discovery, the defendant knows what the prosecution's evidence is and who the witnesses will be. So he's not going to get surprised at trial with evidence he didn't know about. 

Where, exactly, do you get your perception of the justice system? Because it's not the system I've ever seen, as, y'know, someone who works in it. 

Do innocent people sometimes take guilty pleas to get things over with? Yes. Do innocent people get convicted at trial? Yes. Do prosecutors sometimes do immoral and unethical things? Yes. Are these instances even remotely statistically significant given the MILLIONS of criminal cases that go through the system every year? No.

The only people I've seen take guilty pleas when they were likely innocent are the ones with long records, who don't give a fuck about another conviction, and are pleading to time served so they can walk out and not bother with coming back.","1314836458"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Thank you for correcting me and for your concise and cogent explanation.

&gt; It's irresponsible to offer advice on an area of law as complex as defamation when you aren't at least passingly familiar with it. You have misstated the law and given some poor advice.

I accept that, although I hope it is still acceptable to offer advice from a personal perspective. Clearly I should not have tried to explain the law, although in my defence it was very clear that I am not a lawyer and I explicitly stated that I know nothing of Australian law.

In the same situation, I would still approach the company myself. I am reasonably savvy and I would be confident of achieving a fair outcome without a lawyer. However, I accept that this wouldn't be the right course of action for everyone.

Perhaps you can enlighten me - do you think there is a strong case that showing the wrong graphics in reference to another app would be considered defamation? I'm sure plenty of lawyers would take the case, but using common sense alone I'm not convinced. Again, if the company was offered an easy way out of any potential liability by simply apologising and setting the record straight, I am sure they would take it, and they would have little motivation to screw this guy over by broadcasting a 5 second apology at 4 am. It would not take much common sense to get a fair offer in writing before agreeing anything.

Obviously a lawyer will always offer advice based on getting the best possible material outcome for their client. However, the increasing prevalence of the 'get as much as you can' attitude has harmed, and is harming our society hugely. 

There are clearly good and bad lawyers, but as a generalization they are responsible for propagating this problem and the compensation culture. Constant fear of liability is draining the life out of decent people, companies and organizations. Going on the attack is becoming the default position. Personally, I consider a lot of successful actions to be frivolous and/or undeserving. 

In my view, the claimant who wins thousands from the council because they tripped over a broken paving slab and broke their arm is morally bereft - but less so than the lawyers who have created the expectation of a payout whenever something goes wrong. 

I suppose I am naieve - in my business dealings I have had a few people try to screw me but I have always done my reading and defended myself, and they have never been successful. I have also had a few situations where I could well have taken action successfully and made some good money - but that doesn't make it the right thing to do.

I am sure an awful lot of litigation could be avoided if people were more motivated to arrive at a fair outcome without getting lawyers involved. I would also like to see the maximum payouts to litigation lawyers reduced - I'm sure you wouldn't argue with the assertion that people go into the field for the money, not because of any sense of justice. 

Perhaps I need to revise my position, I'm sure I'm being hypocritical somewhere along the line. I suppose there are a lot of grey areas, but there is definitely a lot of damaging and parasitical practice in litigation.","1314836463"

Force yourself to use the new hotkeys and just keep at it.  When you get at the proficiency you were at with your old hotkeys, go onto ladder where using them will actually make a difference.  

I suggest comp first just because it gets rid of the psychological barrier we all have to deal with: ""omg I have to win!""  Against the comp if you lose it's just like whatever, so you can just practice your hotkeys without holding yourself back while you relearn them.

I think people either forget or underestimate just how well practicing simple things against the comp can be.  Not everything needs to be done on ladder, unless it's like testing a build which of course you'd need to do on ladder to be able to test how it reacts to other builds/reactions.  Stuff like macroing, creep spread/lava injects(for zerg), hotkeys, etc can be practiced effectively against a comp.","1314836467"

This reminds me somewhat of the arguments for abstinence-only sex education. Any entity that has studied it (or, say the DARE program), knows full well that it has zero impact on teen pregnancy rates (or narcotic consumption among our youth). And so while DARE and abstinence-only sex ed don't actually achieve much of anything in terms of results, we still feel that abandoning them constitutes some sort of moral hazard.

It's not 100% equivalency (useless education vs. useless enforcement), but it similar to one of those situations in which we support something out of principle and not out of results.

Moreover, I believe the longest that most everybody can receive unemployment benefits is 26 weeks. That's usually it, and the legal hurdles to getting them are pretty decent (in terms of paperwork and proof of eligibility). I believe that, at present, that term is extended a bit, but it's not as if people are receiving unemployment for 5-8 years at a time, all of the while that they're working.

It's such that, the amount of time to receive unemployment is so short that it's almost impossible to mount a comprehensive investigation on their behavior because, by the time you find out that they're scamming the system, perform the investigation, do the paperwork, and commence the prosecution, their bennies have already run out.","1314836468"

I remember a kid who suffered that in high school, and it was terrible. Every day during science class two or three of the kids would torment him (his face looked a little flat, so their nickname for him was 'compressed' or 'compressed face').

Its better that he be embarrassed and get over it than continue to suffer that treatment and be miserable.

So you don't have smoke detectors or insurance either, eh?

In a society without public-funded fire departments, you would subscribe to a fire protection service instead. Let's say it's $30 a month. You don't have to subscribe, of course, but if you own a mortgage on your home or have homeowners insurance, your mortgage or insurance company will certainly require you to purchase fire protection as a condition of their contracts with you so that they do not lose money. If you still don't feel you need to subscribe, and your house burns down, the fire service will still come to your house and rescue you to protect their reputation and avoid lawsuits. They probably wouldn't try to save your house though. Some people make bad bets in life, and betting against the possibility of your house burning down is not a good bet.

My point is not that I feel that all fire departments should be privatized instantly, because there are certainly many people who would *like* to live in a community with public-funded fire protection.

EDIT: Before you call bullshit, please read my other posts below in the thread.

I'm 52. This is only relevant as someone referenced the great Woz. It might help to know that I was in high school in the mid 70's when I did this. At that time there were a lot of people building micro-computers because there weren't any to buy. This was before IBM put out their first PC. Consequently, there were a lot of people sharing ideas and tips on the BBS's (bulletin boards - the pre-cursor to the internet).

Also, don't think of this as a gaming rig. It was really just keypad (hex) / cpu / memory / video driver. There wasn't even any storage, so if the power went out, I had to re-key the OS.

After high school I got a degree in physics and I took a lot of solid state physics courses. In those courses we actually did build various parts (ALU's etc.) from the diodes up.

EDIT2: I corrected the spelling of ""resistors"". Apparently geeks are all excellent spellers and my error destoyed my ""geek cred"". Who Knew?

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","This isn't really the right subreddit for bodybuilding bulking/cutting routines. We're more about maintaining a healthy weight for a very long period of time.

That out of the way: Ab definition is mainly based on body fat percentage and morphology, not based on how muscular you are underneath. At 10% body fat, you should have some nice definition, even if you have never done a crunch in your life, although you don't want to get the ""World of Warcraft 8-pack"" -- A scrawny person with low body fat whose pecs are the same size as their abs. Don't think I'm picking on nerds, I had that when I played Starcraft: Broodwar, and I half-wish I still looked like that now. Ugh.

Anyway, it doesn't surprise me that a 3 lb drop in total weight doesn't result in very noticeable appearance changes in your case. You have a pretty lean frame already (less than 15 lbs of body fat), but you used to lift a lot and now you don't lift at all. Your body thinks you have a lot of ""extra"" muscle that you're not using. Some of the weight that you're losing is muscle and not fat.

Yes, if you lean down to 10%, you'll have the nice abs you had before. Your calories are about right, maybe a little bit low. I worry about people who are not lifting and trying to get under 11-12% body fat because it's very difficult to cut those last few pounds of fat when your body is gobbling up as much protein as fat.","1314836489"

I found a drake in a belt, and pounced on it. By the time my buddy had dropped out of warp however he landed like 60k from where i was when he warped to me due to the drake i tackled having his mwd on and burning away the whole time.

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","* Is your institution R1? Put another way, what are the tenure expectations? Two classes a semester is not terribly difficult, but if it is two classes+the standard expectations of major universities (that is to say, publications, book, conferences, administrative work, etc.) then it quickly becomes quite a decent workload. 

* How much work a tenure-track asst. prof. takes on varies wildly between institutions. My undergraduate advisor is still an asst. prof., is just over 40, has yet to earn his doctorate, is extremely happy with his job at an SLAC in a Midwestern state, is widely liked, and is very secure with his job since the college is just that easy-going and flexible. In fact, I know adjuncts who've been there for decades now. This sort of thing has no normative rule. Quite aside from institutional profile, it depends on the person himself. For most people who I have known going from graduate to academic careers, the question of ""how many hours"" honestly never arises. Yes, they certainly make time for their personal lives. They make time for their partners, their family, etc. They make time to set up a family home and life, and all that. And they also work constantly. You have to realise that an academic career differs from ""professional"" (corporate) life chiefly in that an academic career *is* a way of life. You don't start at 9 and stop at 5. Consider not only your class/course responsibilities, but also your personal development as a scholar. Your research work, keeping up to date on developments, expanding and deepening your foundational knowledge of the discipline and then branching out to other disciplines (this applies much more to the humanities than the sciences). Then consider conferences. Then consider directing student theses and dissertations. So it goes.

* You implicitly make a much stronger case for a corporate career. That you were willing to think in the line of ""....consequences for my academic career be damned"" speaks volumes. There are plenty of couples who juggle a dual academic career-life as well as personal life. And then there are those who don't, or cannot. You fall into the latter. It is not intrinsically a negative thing, but it does reveal something about your (as a couple) limits. A low-profile state university is, bluntly, not going to be a glamorous life. Sure, if you can publish regularly and raise your profile you can get out to a leading R1 place...but what about your family in that context? Can you envision being stuck with a relatively low salary and working at a low-profile place for the rest of your life? If you can be content with that, by all means, go ahead. However it strongly sounds to me as though you personally find far more justification for the corporate career.","1314836498"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, I think the willingness to suspend reason in so serious and delicate aspects of ones life is a very serious issue that should not be looked over. I am fully aware where I am hypocritical with this statement, but I think it's clear how I argue that doing so for the sake of religion is always immoral, harmful etc. and thus universally bad and not tolerable.
I honestly don't care if anyone thinks a cat speaks to them. If they are reasonable it will be easy to prove to them beyond a reasonable doubt that only they hear the cat and they should see a doctor to get checked for schizophrenia. As you pointed out, they don't hurt anyone, so I'd obviously be less hostile than with religious people. Still, I kind of would have a problem trusting for example my doctor, even if I knew him for my whole life and the only strange quality about him was his cat. I guess you would too ;) I'd also argue that it's more reasonable to beliefe that a cat talks than that the abrahamic  God exists. While there is no evidence for both statements, one clearly assumes more than the other and you could say that it lacks more evidence. (By the way, a lot of psychologists argue schizophrenia is the main cause for serious gnostic belief in god.)

&gt;superstition - metaphor

I understood this definition of a god as something supernatural/spiritual that somewhat incarnates love and beauty, since it still is called god. This would be superstition.

What I (now) think you suggest for ""god"" really has nothing what so ever  to do with religion. I suggest it's called feel-good fluffy thoughtcloud instead.

We simply take a different approach on the issue of religion. You are willing to overlook flaws and problems for the sake of not offending. I made the experience that offending is the right and effective thing to do with believers, and to this point I wasn't disappointed.

First, don't make any assumptions on when it's okay to carry on with a turn, check first. 

State upkeep and going to combat always, and when playing a spell before proceeding check 'k?' This is simply so you don't get into the habit of just turning your guys sideways or boosting/equipping a guy when someone's still thinking about counters. It's always annoying having to untap mana since you couldn't do something anyway.

It's okay to take time thinking about stuff and absolutely OK to ask questions. Life totals on paper is the best and brightest way of doing it, but don't be surprised if people offer you dice. 

When you have choices but don't understand the result of one choice, *ask first*. For example, if there's an Illusion and an equipped guy on board and you have a bounce effect in your hand it may not be trivial to know that you basically have the choice of killing the enchantment or the Illusion. During your first games *(and indeed in the future, too)* it's not really assumed that you're playing to win so it's much better to ask ""what happens if I try to bounce one or the other"" than bouncing one then asking ""what happens if I bounce that guy instead? aww, can I switch?""","1314836511"

While I understand the importance of terminating at the repository level and exposing an IList as much as possible, there are casese where you want to punch a whole through and expose the IQueryable. In Asp.net mvc this is often the case when working with a server side grid component like the telerik grid for mvc. The telerik grid expects an IQueryable and applies sorting,filtering etc with very little work from the developer (it's actually pretty cool). It will still work with an IList but at that point you've lost the ability to perform all those operations server side and your forced to pull a crapload of data from the database.","1314836512"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Well firstly, if you're comparing the defensive plays of both the videos, Harden plays way better defense as compared to the Kobe video. We can see Lebron fending off Kobe with a bit of success and his lane is blocked by Brown and when he turned Kobe was in his face. This is not exactly a great defensive play on Kobe's side. Its more of a Lebron losing control and making a terrible decision to run into a double team. Of course, props to Kobe for being aware and having quick hands. Thats my point. Kobe is guarding a small forward not exactly known for his great handles. So in a way, the situation can easily be blamed on Lebron for being slow or making a poor decision. Credit partially goes to Brown's interference, Kobe Bryant's pressure and Lebron making a poor choice which could obviously be blamed on his inexperience in the ball handling area. 

While in this video, we see not just a physically adept defense from Harden, but also mental defense. You can see how Kobe wants to get back at him for the first play and keeps on calling for iso the next four times. The great thing about this video is how Harden mentally penetrates Kobe's thinking and shuts him down on each play. He knew when Kobe was gonna do each move. Now for someone who is known for his killer instinct and whatnot, that's a disappointment. Kobe fails in something he is supposed to excel at. And when you consider someone young like Harden being responsible for it, its just an added bonus. I know this is not the first time Kobe has demanded the ball to clear his own personal matter and put the team in danger, but i'm not even considering that here. This is a pretty straight forward video. Kobe did everything in his mental and physical arsenal to get by him in that game and he was stopped everytime because of the defensive awareness of Harden. Credit goes entirely to Harden for playing D.","1314836523"

Here, listen to this news report from NZ about the spear tackle on O'Driscoll.

They have all the nicer, upscale brands (Ann Taylor, WHBM, even Barney's), but at lower prices. Beware a bit - some of these stores (Banana, J. Crew), have cheaper, lower quality ""outlet"" lines, but others are shopping gold.

Cardigans and Pencil Skirts are my work uniform, and I shop mostly at Anne Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, Banana Republic, H&amp;M, Express, White House Black Market, Zara, occasionally J. Crew, and Anthropologie. The higher quality clothes are definitely worth it- but, as with all things, you can get a crappy item at a nice store and a nice item at a crappy store. Pay attention to fabric - choose silk/cashmere, linen, wool, etc. over polyester/ spandex. Pay attention to the fit of things, only buy things that are perfect. Examine details like how tight the stitching is, if there are any loose buttons/threads, etc. 

Also, final note - almost all of these stores have regular sales, so if you want to ease into the pricier stuff, sale stalk. For example, I know Anthro always marks clothes down on Tuesdays, so I always check their site then. I started looking at [this site](http://www.thechloeconspiracy.com/), she updates almost daily with new sales. I got $180 Ann Taylor pumps for $40 this way. Whee!

There was absolutely no way that the conditions for each subject were uniform nor ideal.  Subjects were treated horribly (starved, mistreated by guards, kept in horrible living conditions).  Nazi scientists admitted to feeling sorry for test subjects and screwing up the experiments by sneaking them food and performing other little acts of sympathy.  The data is wholly unusable from a scientific standpoint and there's evidence that they may have messed with data to make the study look legitimate.

It's perfectly okay to ""take the best and forget the rest"". Ideas like compassion and freedom from irrational cravings don't need to be grounded in their original ideologies.

He left politics to the NCC when the movement to unite the parties started and didn't get back into politics until after hundreds of meetings had occurred, Reform had been modified into the CA to make merging look more attractive, and they had draft deals already on the table between the two parties.  You talk as if he single-handedly pushed this through but that's not even remotely the case.

&gt; They said he'd never become PM. He did. They said he'd never last more than eighteen months. He did. They said he'd never win a majority. He did.

Holy moly, tone down the sycophancy.  The guy isn't standing behind your shoulders watching you type (or is he?).  The minute the two parties merged, the entire political class knew his chances went from slim to excellent for ALL of these things.  The only people who were consistent naysayers were the Liberals and you can hardly call them neutral observers.

13 years in a row is a very long political dynasty and it was on its last legs already before the merger.  After the merger, it was a fait accompli that the Liberals were going to get turfed at some point.  You didn't seriously think they'd rule forever, did you?

&gt;  He starts out as an academic who enters politics for policy reasons rather than for personal power, whereas charismatic politicians usually approach it from the other direction.

HAHAHAHAHAHA.  This is the funniest thing I've read all day.  He's no academic.  The only courses he's ever taught have been by invite at the U of C and he's never once held a teaching position in any Canadian university.  His entire resume is TWO JOBS - Imperial Oil and the NCC.

As for the personal power baloney ... maybe you missed it but he wants to brand the government with his own bloody name and he took down all the pictures of prior PMs in both 24 Sussex and parliament and replaced them with pictures of himself and his family.

"math","t5_2qh0n","If I asked you to think of the set of real numbers, you're probably thinking of the set of all numbers that include rationals and irrationals. Given two numbers, you can add, subtract, multiply, divide them, and say which one is greater than the other. You can also tell how far apart two numbers are. This isn't really a set, it's a set with a whole bunch of other things that you've been learning for quite some time. In general, a set with some other structures is called a space. A set with a way to tell how far apart two elements are is a metric space, for example. 

One thing we like to look at are continuous functions. You can give an example of a continuous function pretty easily, but if you try to take a function between two arbitrary sets, you find you don't have enough information to tell if it's continuous or not. If you take a function between two metric spaces, then you do have enough information, but one question that might arise is: do you really need to know the distance between any two points in sets just to tell if a function between them is continuous?

Topology is the study of topological spaces, or sets along with another set called the topology of the set that obeys certain rules. It basically says what elements of the set might be close together to some extent by giving all neighborhoods of any element and what elements are in them. As it turns out, if we have a function between two topological spaces, then we have enough information to tell if the function is continuous.

One consequence of saying about how close points are to each other, but not saying exactly how close they are is that if you visualize the set in a certain way, any continuous deformation of the set is equivalent to it topologically. One cliche example of this is that a coffee cup and a doughnut can be morphed into each other, so they are topologically the same. Really, any surface with one hole in it is the same as one of those two things. Topology gives us tools to ask questions like: Given an arbitrary set, how many holes does it have?

To answer your question of applicability to physics, topology has actually predicted the existence of different phases of matter for certain elements. It's also particularly applicable to General Relativity, which deals with continuous deformations of spacetime. Topology is what allowed us to guess at the shape of the universe.","1314836567"

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","Maybe you can relate to this...

One of my earliest memories is of running around my friend's house.  We were pretending to be superheroes, and all of a sudden I realized I looked different from him.  Turns out it was because I was starting to become overweight, whereas he continued to be (until today) slim, in shape, and attractive to nearly all women.

Since then it's been a constant struggle with weight and overeating.  The one time in my life I lost weight was at the end of highschool.  Somehow I just managed to eat less and try hard in gym class, and I started to look good.  Around that time I got a girlfriend.

Then, when the GF and I were apart, things got instantly worse.  I put weight back on, and as a result the relationship wasn't so easy.  I'm sure it wasn't everything, but at the end I was back to being overweight and I'm sure she wasn't too fond of me, especially when she was out fucking some tool on a sports team.  

Since then I've had some ""mild"" success, but for most normal people I've had nothing.  I know I'm not obese or otherwise ugly, but I'm not the kind of person girls would want to get into bed with.  

It sucks, but weight means so much in society.  Even for friendships.  I wish I had something better to say, but I'm in the same struggle you are.  As I type this, all I think about is food.  Some of us just aren't meant to be thin.  Some of us aren't meant to have relationship after relationship.

All I find myself thinking is: ""when is it my turn?  when is it my turn at happiness?""","1314836570"
"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Congratulations on the the weight loss! It's so exciting when you first start to lose the weight. Keep at it and enjoy all the time you get to spend with your walking buddies. I know they're really loving all the additional walk time. 

And just a small tip from me. I've found that I drop pounds -fast- when I cut out dairy. Whenever I need to loose weight in a hurry I cut the dairy out completely and it really does the trick. If you're not satisfied with your progress try doing that. It might just be the thing you need to push you over that edge. 

Good luck! You're doing great!","1314836570"

The parents were going nuts, as was the kid of course.  He was like 5 years old by this time.  Finally one doctor posited that his skull was too constrictive in one area, i forget which area exactly, but he suggested they cut part of his skull off to relieve the pressure it was putting on his brain.  so they tried it and the kid went to sleep just like a normal kid after that and he ceased to be all cranky and crazy and everyone was super happy.","1314836573"

On a serious note, yeah, you're right, the option key is pretty unpredictable before you learn what it does in specific areas of the OS, but I'd argue that almost all, if not all of these uses can be considered power-user features. Things like the option key and hiding things from the system preferences into terminal/plist files etc makes the UI more usable for normal people while keeping it powerful for power-users.

The problem with the contactual menu in earlier windows versions, I think, was that too many options used by many users were hidden there, wasn't it?

AFAIK the option key+letter brings up the same letter all the time but don't care to check out multiple cocoa apps right now, never noticed unexpected characters coming up personally.

Well, it matters a lot to me, but not so much to anyone else.

&gt;As for morality, Peter Singer has established one of the most consistent and rational approaches to ethics I've ever read. If you're actually interested, his book Practical Ethics outlines his position very clearly, and it's a very accessible book because he writes in normal language.

Just having read his [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer), about justification for morality it says:

&gt;Ethical conduct is justifiable by reasons that go beyond prudence to ""something bigger than the individual,"" addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as ""somehow universal"", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbor as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight to the interests of others as one gives to one's own interests.

I find it kind of surprising he's going back to Jesus here for justification.  Anyways, I'm just curious as to what the atheist justification for personal morality is.  Say you have a extremely self-obsessed person, is there any way you can (in a way logically consistent with atheist beliefs) argue that they should abandon their selfish ways and help other people?","1314836600"

Not get the rights to thousands of movies (which is clearly not a viable option) or pay mafia prices to the studios now that they know how much their movies are worth to Netflix.  People are acting like Netflix is a bunch of greedy assholes ripping them off, when in reality they are going to take a hit even with double fees.  Everyone screaming ""yeah fuck you Netflix!

""Thermal Armor"" is mostly a gimmick.

Crossfire scales better than SLI.

Those ""V"" CPU coolers are mostly form over function.

I notice you don't have any regular hard drives. Intentional?

PSU is $108 after rebates and promos are factored in. No need for 850w or ""gold"" rating.

Don't give up just because your weight hasn't changed in 1-2 weeks, a true plateau is more like a month or more.

edit, while on the aesthetic direction, maybe remodeling the barrel tip something like a barret m82 (but obviously to scail) in an effort to use the muzzle flare to steer the barrel and reduce recoil futher you seem to know what your talking about, i'd love to hear your opinions of this","1314836647"

So long as you aren't intending to show them round or publish them any further. It's not exactly citizen of the year behaviour, but I'm a realist and a pragmatist. BDSM is hot.

But what's happening here is people are excusing one persons despicable actions because they're profiting from them. You're getting porn so you're unwilling to denounce the person providing it, because you feel like that'd make you a bad person for siding with him, or a hypocrite for taking what he offers then calling him out for it.

I dont think this is the case, and it's frustrating to see. This epic-level asshole is doing something that reddit, in it's non-aroused state, would see as a dick thing to do, but he's getting a pat on the back for it. Why? Because in order for you to not feel like an asshole or a hypocrite for downloading the zip you have to pretend like it's not a big deal.

No.

Download it. Jack off. Then come back and say ""OP, you're a fucking asshole.""

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Your best bet, IMO, is to find a reputable eBay seller offering a NES where the 72-pin connector has already been replaced.  This is the internal connector that the game carts plug in to.  After years of use they get dirty and worn out, and this is a major cause of loading issues.  They can be cleaned/refurbished, but since a new connector is only $5-10, it's not worth the effort IMO.

*EDIT:* Another good bet is a local store, either a video game store or a pawn-like shop such as Cash Converters or Fast Cash On The Spot, that will let you either try the system before you buy it, or return it if it doesn't work.  However the NES is a sturdy console and you're unlikely to have issues.

Don't spend more than $50, and make sure it comes with controllers and a power adapter. [Here is an example](http://www.ebay.com/itm/HUGE-NINTENDO-ENTERTAINMENT-SYSTEM-BUNDLE-NES-/250884304426?pt=Video_Games&amp;hash=item3a69deae2a#ht_500wt_827), he says the 72-pin isn't installed, but it's not a big deal.  You just need a phillips head screwdriver, and look up how to install it on Youtube.

As for games, these are all relatively cheap, and fun:

* Super Mario Bros 1, 2, 3
* Legend of Zelda
* Metroid
* Kirby's Adventure
* Tetris
* Dr Mario

Clean your games before you use them - inserting dirty games in your clean 72-pin connector will gunk it up eventually and cause loading issues.  Some of these games are 30 years old, they're dirty.  Just use q-tips and rubbing alcohol on the contacts.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","I'll humor you, though I know you are a troll, so any impartial observer can learn something:

1) The article posted by abuali7866 completely ignores the fundamental ties between antisemitism and anti-Israelism and the reality that many veil their antisemitism by criticizing ""Israelis"" or ""Zionists"". This is a common thing for bigots to do lately - use carefully selective language to deflect such accusations. This does not mean that there is not legitimate criticism of Israel, but a lot of it - especially on the internet, where people don't have to publicly out themselves as bigots - is antisemitic, and places an unfair double standard on Israel, while ignoring far greater civil rights offenders around the world. This criticism also usually ignores the civil rights advantages that Israel has over every other nation in the middle east.

2) Sailer says ""I would take exception to one thing the author claimed, i.e., the ""near annihilation"" of European Jewry."" He also says ""At any rate, this is not near annihilation, and how the Germans rounded up and took fifteen million Jews prisoner and put them into camps which either killed them or entitled them to BEG compensation while they were also fighting Russia, France, Britain and the USA is quite a story.""

This directly questions the reality of the Holocaust and if you cannot see that he is denying that it happened, you are truly an idiot. ""Quite a story"" as though it is a fairy tale... while insulting, he only makes himself look like the bigoted moron he is. He might as well deny evolution as ""quite a story"" while he's at it.","1314836682"

Uh yeah, that means unlimited means unlimited dipshit. Yes, they throttle, but you can use 10gb of data if you want. Therefore unlimited.

Fuck that. I've seen the throttled speeds and you can't even load a fucking page. It's not unlimited. It's fucking 14k.

Unlimited means unlimited AT FULL SPEED. That is what I fucking pay for.

As far as your info about data usage? Guess what. I don't have a land line. My sprint data connection is fast enough for me to do all the torrenting I might desire... and I end up using a good 50-60GB of data per month. For me, there isn't cheaper than Sprint. Tmobile is fucking garbage because they don't offer REAL unlimited plans.

You wanna talk about flawed logic? You're comparing apples and oranges and thinking it's equal. Sprint provides quality coverage and super fast speeds that are actually unlimited. Tmobile doesn't... of course it will be cheaper when it's shit service! That's like saying ""Oh well my dial up is cheaper than your broadband! Must be a better deal! Derp!""

If you ask him first, his ""blessing""or lack thereof puts additional pressure on her in making her decision to say yes or not, regardless of his approval or disapproval, whether she agrees with him or not.

Edit - Personally I think the best way is just lie to the old guy if he's the type who would want it.  Ask her first. If she says yes, work it out with her that you'll stay quiet about it for a few days, and the next day go ask him for his blessing.  Everybody wins.   

If she's the type to expect you to ask him first, well then you don't have much of a choice either way.  How do you know if she's the type to expect this? Well, I certainly hope that you know her well enough to make this call if you're planning on a marriage.","1314836695"

**And for people that think voter fraud is real:**

&gt; Voter fraud is not rampant and actually extremely rare:

&gt;    - Fraud by individual voters is both irrational and extremely rare.
    - Many vivid anecdotes of purported voter fraud have been proven false or do not demonstrate fraud.
    - Voter fraud is often conflated with other forms of election misconduct.
    - Raising the unsubstantiated specter of mass voter fraud suits a particular policy agenda.
    - Claims of voter fraud should be carefully tested before they become the basis for action.

"math","t5_2qh0n","If you don't have any experience in a real proof class (calc 3 &amp; diff eq don't count) then Topology and Real Analysis will most likely be too much. 

But here's the rundown:

Topology - This subject is more synonymous to geometry in the modern math world, not because you look at triangles or the unit circle, but because it abstractizes what it means for two point to be ""near"" each other. It then explores what it means, in this new abstract setting, what it means to be connected or compact. You'll also talk about what it means to be able to transform one of these topological spaces into another via continuous functions. In essence, Topology takes everything that makes the Real Line and Real Analysis so nice and studies it abstractly.
* If you haven't taken a proof class such at Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra or even just a Logic &amp; Proof class, I wouldn't recommend it because in all likely hood you will never have to calculate anything in this class or find a derivative or an integral. Only proofs! (Although, that's what makes it fun!!)

Real Analysis - Think Calculus with proofs. This isn't as easy as it may sound because, again, there will be no taking of derivatives or finding the integral of a trig function. Basically all proofs. But it is good to see how all the stuff you learned in calculus really works and why it is all important. You'll start by constructing, or just defining, the real line. Then you will go over basic properties of it (every bounded set has a supremum), the arithmetic and prove that things like [;e^\pi ;] are actually well defined. Then you'll go into sequences and limits of sequences, then continuous functions (in a slightly different flavor than in topology, but equivalent), derivatives (again, not calculating them, proving properties about them and other things like the Mean-Value Theorem and such), clearly define Riemann Integrals, and prove a lot of stuff about them. Then go into series and taylor polynomials and the Weirstrass Approximation Thm. And, depending on the professor, you might see Lebesgue stuff.
* This is usually taken concurrently or before topology and is more intuitive and grounded. You should take this if you really liked calculus, feel good with basic proof techniques and want to understand more about the subject. 

Geometry - I never took the Geometry course in undergrad because, like you said, it is geared toward math education majors so it is a lot more accessible, at the price of being less interesting than it should. (Proofs are Fun!!) But, in general, you'll go over the basic axioms of Euclidean geometry and prove stuff about them, talk about triangles, constructions, trig and such, all with relatively down to earth and easy proofs. After the Euclidean stuff, you'll most likely go into nonstandard geometries like hyperbolic and such (they only differ by the parallel line axiom!). If you're lucky, you should see some projective geometry, which is kinda like adding a point at infinity so that there are some nice properties about lines and such. This class would be good if you want a relatively easy course and to see how a whole theory can be brought up from the axioms. This class, too, will be mostly proofs, but they will be a lot more elementary and not so exciting, but it will be easier than the others and you'll learn stuff that if super-intuitive, take this one if you are not comfortable doing proofs!

(None of these classes can really be applied directly to Physics/Cosmology, but Topology has widespread use in those subjects, though not in the flavor you'll learn in class, it's more differential geometry than point-set topology, and physicists won't do it right)

**EDIT:** If you have taken a course on proofs, as you say, then I say go ahead and do Real Analysis or maybe even Topology if you feel like a challenge, depending on the professor it should be with your limits (LOL!!). Geometry will probably be boring and useless, especially in physics, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you are really interested in ancient geometry (I wouldn't mind taking a rigorous course on it, then again I wouldn't mind taking a rigorous course in any math subject. Maybe a grad logic class would go over Tarski Gerometry, which is essentially Euclidean Geometry in modern notation, and prove that it is complete and consistent...)","1314836718"

To your point of no laws being enforced against someone not hurting anyone, the issue is easily raised that unwanted pregnancies are the cause of many of societies ills and we all bear the cost.

I can't possibly parse out the costs, but add in healthcare, welfare, court costs pursuing delinquent dads and hundreds of other ancillary expenses and I think you could make a strong case for doing it.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","My further advice considering your experience...

Definitely branch out into CentOS. It's a good way to get RedHat-area knowledge, and companies still love their RedHat and derivatives.

These days get into some kind of configuration management. There's cfengine, chef, puppet available these days. I've only tried puppet but it's going well so far.

Virtualization be a good way to set up networking, load balancing, and so on, without buying more hardware. Look into vlans if you're going corporate or large-scale. I've only skimmed the surface of vmware, but look into templating your server builds.

Backups. Learn them. Test your restores. Or considering the configuration management thing, work on keeping data on nfs/etc. so that you can destroy/rebuild a host.

Daemons and services. At least the basics: ntp, snmp, smtp, http, ldap, radius, sql, ssh, at, cron, syslog (local and remote), as well as apt and yum repositories.

Consider setting up a chaos monkey in your lab environment. You'll use the lessons it teaches to add redundancy and/or monitoring.

Also ditch any gui on your servers. Chances are you might not be in the same city, let alone the same building.

Also, good luck. It's less than it appears at first.","1314836729"

Except for a couple uppers that have stainless steel barrels, all of their barrels are chrome lined; their premium barreled uppers are 4150 steel and made by FN.

PSA currently makes a couple different barrel lengths, but are expanding their line up pretty quickly.  The rifle kits I linked are either 14.5"" barrels with a pinned flash hider (currently out of stock) or 16"".  They currently only offer mid-length gas systems in their stainless barreled uppers, but that should be changing this month.

1 x Chin up bar in my door
1 x Yoga Mat 
1 x Step 

I've always used http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises as my exercise bible to create exercises with using only my equipment I had.

I really enjoyed doing 1 body part. I've since switched to a split for the last few months but I may go back to 1 body part a day. My weight lifting was actually 4-5 days a week. For exercises I usually have and still do stick to the basics. Example:

Mon - Chest
Tue - Arms (Bi's/Tri's)
Wed - Shoulders
Thur - Back
Friday - Legs
Sat - Rest
Sun - Rest

Chest might look like:

Olympic Flat Bench - 3 sets x 8-12
Flat Bench Dumbell flies - 3 sets x 8-12
Incline Dumbell press - 3 sets x 8-12
Incline Push ups - 3 sets x as many as possible (usually 12-25)

1. Keep the secret tight: only you and the hooker should know, no other friends involved.

2. Plot a cover story: she should memorize certain facts about her ""character"", e.g., name, place and date of birth, education, occupation, phone nr (fake / prepaid) etc... she should also dress as a hot girl but not a whore. The story of the ""character"" must include an exit strategy for not seeing him afterwards. She should claim to be in your country/state temporarily (vacation/business trip/whatever), and after the ""act"", she should get out of the house (see 4.) after telling him or leaving a note saying she can't do it because she loves her husband/children/fiancée whose waiting for her at home.

3. Find a suitable candidate: ask how much she charges before explaining what you want her to do. Offer twice as her usual rate, paid 50/50 before/after. Make sure she assures you that she will be able do the acting/lying.

4. To allow a quick escape, the action can't take place at her house. They must do it at his house, a friend's house, or a hotel.

5. If you wanna be extra zealous and avoid getting trapped in blackmail (e.g. ""pay me extra or I tell""), find a hooker who has someone in their life (boyfriend, siblings, parents, grandparents, day-job colleagues, etc..) who doesn't know she sells her body. That should be threat enough to keep her quiet after payment.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Well it depends on the situation, for RAM, there's a special kind available called ECC, which stands for Error Correcting Code.

This RAM basically stores 9 bytes for every 8 bytes of data, the extra byte is used to store information that can be used to detect and reconstruct any error that happen in the data.
However obviously this takes more space than normal so that extra comes at a cost premium, so usually normal computers like yours or mine don't use ECC 
memory. Only servers and situations where a random crash every now and again could be fatal use it.

Most errors in memory come from cosmic rays or background radiation, because memory is holding bits of charge for a very long time, so its more vulnerable to that.

CPUs usually fall fowl to heat-based errors, so if your PC is over-heating it might randomly crash, but usually they have good enough cooling to mitigate the problem. Another example is GPUs, i'm not sure if you've ever seen it but when a GPU (which is the processor in your graphics card) starts to overheat, you often get speckles all over your screen, that or bits of the world geometry will spike out at odd angles it shouldnt be at. That's the graphics card over heating and making calculations wrong, which are changing the way the 3D is rendered.


So in answer to your questions, we do have safeguards, but often they cost more money. The actual chances of random errors in real computers is pretty small, and even when there are errors, its even more rare when they change something that has a big effect. (Imagine, you're playing a video, which takes up hundreds of MB of ram, a single bit being changed in the memory could only mean that a pixel on your screen is one shade lighter than it otherwise would have been, you'd never notice it)","1314836786"

The other girl waited about a month with me to meet in person. I didn't push it or anything, and she actually didn't include a picture on there so I was just going off my conversation with her. We met in person for lunch and hit it off right off the bat. There was a catch though - she was leaving at the end of the summer for New York. We hung out a couple times every week. After about two weeks we slept together ad it was some of the best sex I've ever had. After a few more weeks, she just upped and left me for someone else, didn't tell me about it or anything until she showed up to a Crew game with this new guy and was all touchy feely with him.

Even without crossing in to 'new territory' anonymous can be described, at least in part, like old autonomous, decentralized broad front movements.)

What I meant to say was that before you were criticizing the actual narrative device she was using, IE bringing up things that she could not elaborate on, in general; and then you moved on to a separate concern of, I dunno, I'd call it execution, but I guess you could say aesthetics? Specifics? Finer points. Things like how often this particular device or technique was used, or the tone with which it was used. I would argue that the former was a less valid critique, because it was attacking a narrative device that's widely used, sometimes to great effect, in general, and certainly isn't devoid of information in the context of the story, whereas the concerns regarding execution could be argued on the story's own specifics (Rather than some larger abstractified paradigm of storytelling), and make fewer broad generalizations.

That's a bit like concluding that speed chess between two evenly matched experts always comes down to the last few pawns, so we should only work on our end game. 

The proper place for groundfighting is *when you find yourself on the ground*. Which is a place you want to get off of as quickly as possible, either by disabling anyone who's holding you there, or just by getting the hell back up. ","1314836824"

With ants in an anthill, you'll see them doing amazingly complicated things, very coordinated... but they didn't need to conspire to do that. No conspirator ants met in dark rooms to plan it all out. Same thing with humans.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Death is the eternal unknown and we don't like the unknowable. Accepting that you will die and that you don't know when or how but that it will be permanent. The problem is that we don't want to lose our ""selves"". The whole appeal of heaven is that that ""self"" will somehow continue and that the continuation will be pleasant. 

As the Buddhists say there is no ""I"", no thing called ""me"". We are but the ongoing sum total of our experiences. We are not separate from our experiences for without the experiences there is no ""experiencer"". This thinking about the past and the future is what results in the concept of a ""self"". (A suffering self but I'm already digressing.)We are not the person we were when we were born or the person we were yesterday. Indeed, every moment is a new you. The point of Buddhist meditation and mindfulness is to more fully experience the present because this is all you really are. This experience in this moment. As this moment dies, we ""die"". When the body finally tires and dies (if we are lucky)this is nothing new for our ""selves"" it is just another moment. 

A form of Buddhist meditation is the meditation on death. It seems ghastly to Western culture (not nearly as ghastly as it actually is in Tibet). The entire purpose though is to accept that the body will die and without the input of the physical experiences, possibly the self. The ultimate mystery may reveal one last secret at the moment of death and it is up to us to ""be there"". After that.....who knows? 

(Jesus I talk a lot. Does this post even relate to the OP's question? Eh, it's got something about death in there. Close enough.)","1314836826"

Up until that point, they are kept well-anaesthetized and as comfortable as possible; we have heating pads to place under them, and we take them away from the other mice to avoid distressing anyone.  They're killed by breaking the neck while under anaesthesia, which is pretty much as quick and painless as it can possibly get.  Every university has extremely stringent standards for animal care and most of the research mice see a vet more times in 6 weeks than a family pet would in years.

Yet, as soon as I mention what I do to casual acquaintances, they're revolted.  I've had several get up and leave in disgust.  This seems extremely hypocritical to me; if you had mice in your home, what would you do with them?  You'd leave mouse traps and/or rat poison, causing them to die painfully of internal hemorrhaging and their young to starve waiting for food.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Wait - are you asking for advice about him being bullied or for his teachers suggestion for suspension? 

All students should not have phones in class. If there is a no-phone policy that is strictly enforced by the teacher and the student realizes they mistakenly have it, the student should bring it to the attention of the teacher before addressing the issue. Similar to going to the bathroom. A student doesn't just get and leave, the issue is addressed and permission granted. It's a somewhat a military style system because a teacher must teach, play police officer and babysitter for 15-40 student every hour. 

It's spelled ""Principal"". Have a separate meeting with the teacher to address the bullying to discuss what the teacher can do, what you can do, what your kid can do. Work *with* the teacher, don't make the your enemy. 

Every bully is different, every situation is different. Sometimes you can do this social-framing thing that people have mentioned. Sometimes acting completely crazy works. Sometimes you have to just turn around and run. Sometimes you just get beat up. If comes down to your kid getting beaten up, that bully can go to jail for assault and you sue the bully - or family - for damages, it's a life lesson can go both ways. Whatever your son does: make sure the bully throws the first punch, everything after that is self-defense.","1314836843"
"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","My $0.02.  

1) Each teacher, every year, before school starts, should have to pass the same subject-area test that teachers who get alternative certification have to pass in order to be able to teach.  If they don’t pass that test, then they get paid as a daily substitute teacher *(as opposed to salaried and full-time)* until they DO pass it.  The teacher pays to take the test out of their own pocket, but, if they pass it, the amount of the test is reimbursed *(by the state government)* to the teacher through their paycheck.  This alone will guarantee that we no longer have complete *(partial, sure, but not complete)* morons trying to educate kids on a subject about which they know nothing.
 
2) Special Education; both Real and Fake, needs to be revamped like a mo-fo.
 
Students need to be PROFESSIONALLY tested for any signs of mental retardation or deficiency before they begin school, and then again two or thee more times later down the road.  If the students test acceptably, but low, their first time, they should be put on a “watch list” of some sort, and given extra attention in their early classrooms, assuming that either their scholastic or their social behavior merits it.  Let’s say testing occurs before K, 3rd, and 6th grades.  So, by the time a student has even gotten to the jr. high level of achievement, they will have been tested three separate times for signs of any mental deficiences that could possibly be an impediment to their learning or to their ability to learn.
 
In response to this, the following…  All elementary school teachers have to also undergo at least the basic special education courses.  All elementary school teachers should be at the very minimum, qualified to substitute a special education classroom.  Because of this extra certification, however, they should also be paid more than their middle school and high school counterparts.  In addition, if the elementary teachers do get completely certified to teach special education in addition to elementary education *(why do I get the feeling that the two are very, very similiar?)* then they will be paid even more.  Similiar to the BA, MA, MD pay scale in many professions.
 
For the students that test below the cutoff point, they are to be placed in their school’s special education program for one year, at which time, they are welcome to test again to try to rejoin the regular curriculum.  

People can argue for self-esteem all they want, but the bottom line is, for kids who don’t care about school enough to try, even if they CAN do the work, why should they if they’re going to “not get left behind” and get to stay with all of their friends their own age anyway?  The IEP folders are FULL of kids like this; and yes, many of them have difficulties, but for just as many of them, their difficulty is a lack of early parental involvement, coupled with a “gimme-gimme” work ethic.  

Critics argue that separating the kids from their peers will only serve to further alienate them from school.  I argue “Good.”  If their parents aren’t ABLE to get involved, that’s one thing, but I know that, if I’d have gotten a note or a call from my school with a counselor telling my parents that I had tested into special ed. classes, I’d have caught a foot in my *ss, ”cause MY parents knew better.  *(But, sadly, this quickly turns into a discussion of generational poverty..)*

Many of the kids who are in the IEP program at the schools for which I have worked were embarassed to have anybody else know, and we do maintain a great, great deal of secrecy about their identities and their status…  

But there are also some who brag about it; wear it like a badge..  *“I don’t have to try ’cause they can’t fail me.”*  Guess what, we can.  In fact, I have.  All we have to do is justify said failure, and I guarantee you that I have documented their behavior much more accurately than they have mine.  *(August 23rd, Tardy.  August 24th, Tardy.  August 25, Tardy.  Student punished.  August 27th, Tardy.)*
 
So, to review:
 
- Kids get professionally tested often; before K, 3, and 6.
 - Those that pass move on, those that barely pass move on, but start receiving special attention.  (by the newly certified elementary teachers, no less) Those that do not pass join a seperate special education classroom for a minimum of one year, at which time they can attempt to test again to rejoin regular education classes.
 - For the kids that continue to fail, perhaps they truly do need the help of the special education teachers, in which case, to simply “get by” they will need more individualized attention and should not be in the regular cirricumum anyway.  *(Which, in addition, I have noted is what usually gets the borderline kids in trouble; their proximity to their peers.  Kids that age care a lot more about looking “cool” than they do looking smart.  If we take away the peer mirrors into whom they see the “cool” them, then perhaps they’ll give “smart” another try.)*
 - If a child fails a grade, *(4 out of the 7 classes, or tests, that they have to pass)* they repeat that grade.  If they fail a class or two, then they have to take summer classes, or they will have to still repeat the grade; even the classes they passed.  This will motivate students to stop d*cking around in one or two classes, but pass the rest.  If you fail all of them, you repeat.  If you fail a couple, you either take summer school, or repeat.  It’s a lose/lose for the losers.  You either get to see all of your friends that were smart enough to at least listen and try a little bit move on while you become “creepy person that’s a year older than us,” or you try a little bit in school.  *(A downright shock in this sue-happy, apologetic culture that our p*ssies-in-chief have created for us, I know…)*

 - Because of all of this, an extra change…  Call it 2B, or something…  Special Education, etc… students keep the current grading scale 60-69: D, 70-79: C, 80-89: B, and 90-100+ is an A.  Regular Education students go back to the “old-school” grading scale.  100-93: A, 92-84: B, etc…  (I don’t actually remember the numbers… but they were nice.) This will make the regular kids try *(have to try)* that much harder, and it will better prepare them for college so that we don’t have 50% or higher freshman to sophomore dropout rates like many major universities do now.  That way, we have more college-educated people in the workplace, and we can start seeing specialists get paid their worth again.  Good?  Good.

3)  More plain-clothes security.  I think that 1 for every 150 or so students would be a decent ratio.  These guys have one job:  Wander about the school grounds, hallways, bathrooms, gyms, cafeteria’s, etc… and be seen.  

It’s amazing how slowly a kid will pull their pants up when a 60 year-old female teachers asks them to, but how quickly they can do the exact same thing when a security guard asks them to.  It’s also amazing how much people like that can do for a school’s morale and overall feeling of safety and order.  I’ve worked in a school with one and a school without one, and the difference is night and day.  *(Think early-'90's NYC ""Broken Windows"" theory.)*

...I'd also like to see things implemented like, ""if you fail a school year, your parent's property taxes are increased the following school year,"" and ""if you don't have your high school equivalence by your 19th birthday, you sumbit to sterilization,"" but those are mainly because I'm an asshole that lives in constant fear of drowning in the dysgenic wave sweeping across the country.

We both no that you're just trying to be an asshole. That's not what I said. You need to work on your reading comprehension skills. 

&gt;On a non-grammar note, you, sir/madam are an imbecile. I can understand wanting to protect the environment and save animals from suffering, but what kind of idiotic elitist does one have to be to say that only certain privileged individuals can breed such common animals as cats and dogs?

You need to understand that limiting breeding privileges to those who have a license and are qualified is a great way to limit domesticated animal populations. The only other methods we have is fixing them and killing them. 

You don't understand what the words ""elitist"" and ""privileged"" mean. I'm not an elitist and someone isn't privileged by having a breeding license. It means that they went through the necessary steps to become qualified and they're serious about breeding the animals and finding homes for them. This is so that if they are irresponsible, abusive, or implement any ill-conceived practices there is some accountability. 

And you're calling me an elitist? Are you fucking retarded? And, yes, the people who have licenses are privileged. They're privileged because they went through the necessary steps to become qualified and they have accountability. That's why they're privileged. 

&gt;I suppose next you'll try to outlaw my vegetable garden, since I'm not a licensed farmer...

This statement proves how blatantly ignorant you are. Animals are living breathing things that can feel emotion and pain. A kitten is not a cabbage. They are not food that you grow in your garden. Get a fucking clue. Doing whatever the fuck you want with animals is not a basic human right. Not everyone should be allowed to own an animal, let alone breed them. It's fucking insane that you would think breeding animals should be a universal right. ITS NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE, IT'S ABOUT THE ANIMALS!

I use the phrase ""I like to say that I trust her"", because I do feel like I can, but I've lost so much faith in humanity before that at times it seems like she's too good to be true.
On 2 separate occasions one of our mutual friends has told me (in a private conversation) not to worry about her, and that she's loyal.

The last two relationships she has been in have been 9 months and 1 year. So I feel like she is faithful.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","OK, doubles might be ""becoming the new thing"", but MTBs traditionally have had triples.  

Perhaps I should have said ""granny rings are standard on MTB for a reason"".  :-P

You'd need some pretty big hills to get value out of a granny ring on a roadie, IMO - with modern 10-speed cassettes you can get the same range of gears as the old 5-speed cassettes with a triple.

My road bikes are setup as follows, and I rarely ""need"" the small ring, let alone a third, smaller one.

* 52/39x11-23 (44.6-124.4 gear inches) - race bike 

* 50/36x12-23 (41.2-109.6 gear inches) - comfy trainer

* 52/42x13-23 (48.0-105.2 gear inches) - classic steel

YMMV, of course, but with modern wide cassettes I just don't see the need for a triple unless you're lugging a lot of weight up some big hills.","1314836866"

He doesn't answer to you because you're an authority, he answers to you because he's in a 2-person relationship and what the other person thinks matters, how they are affected matters.  That's the only reason. Relationships don't happen without both people's consent to be in them and it needs to be worthwhile for you to stick around. If he truly doesn't want to have his actions affect anyone else, make it true for him and dump him. Then he doesn't have to answer to anyone, because he's alone. 

Do you really want to be in a relationship with someone this childish? Like darquewingduck said, it sounds awful. I can't help but think that the things you say about knowing it could be great and work out just seem to me like excuses to cover for the fact that you're afraid of being alone.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Ok, I can expand a little.  Because Q is orthonormal, the transpose of Q is also its inverse.  Therefore Q Q^T = I.  So substituting that into the equation above gives

Q^T D^T Q Q^T D Q = Q^T D^T I D Q = Q^T D^T D Q

Now remember that since D is diagonal, D^T = D, so we have

Q^T D^T D Q  = Q^T D D Q = Q^T D^2 Q

Now because this was Q^T D Q was an orthonormal decomposition, we know that D has the same eigenvalues as A.  And since Q will not change the eigenvalues of anything it multiplies, we know that Q^T D^2 Q will have the same eigenvalues as D^2, which is a diagonal matrix containing lambda_1^2, lambda_2^2, etc.

But Q^T D^2 Q=A^T A.

Yes freedom of speech have an arbitrary. By the one who speaks and by groups.
In this perticular group freedom to call a women a cunt isn't freedom of speech but a form of oppression.

If you think that words and speech isn't used to psychologicaly oppress people then you are ignoring a big issue were about mobbing. Is that ok as long as the mobbers claims that it's free speech?

* Understand that calling a person a cunt, is seen as mobbing/ make someone feel bad/ picking them down on a hierarical ladder/

And since Anarchist are against hierarcies this is the reason were against anyform of oppressive speech.

You must understand that anarchism isn't about (what most people seem to think) to do, OR SAY, what ever they want. 

It's about socialfreedom. 


Your own statement above wern't in any way oppressive to anyone.
You just spoke your views on freedom of speech. Nobody was harmed by that statement.

But if your reply was filled with:

""Oh your such an ass-cunt gay fuck that dosn't know any thing about freespech you faggot""

Then we would have an issue.


* Oppression is in the nature of how a person acts towards another.

* Oppression is in how a person treats another.

* If I say that you shouldn't treat me the way you do, Is that an oppression of your freedom to act the way you want? Ofcourse not. I give myself the right to deny you a freedom to oppress me. PERIOD.

"space","t5_2qh87","You could probably disassemble it and boost individual modules to the moon. But attaching an engine array to the ISS and boosting it out to the moon as an intact structure just wouldn't work. The load paths are all wrong -- think about pushing on the side of an empty soda can. Now try stringing together a bunch of soda cans in an elaborate structure and do it again.

You'd need to pinpoint the C.G. pretty well and still need a good control system to keep it from tumbling from really complex kinematics caused by really unusual mass distributions.

If you broke it up and took a handful of modules out to the moon, it might serve as a good orbiting station there, but it's unlikely to be cost-effective to bring the modules down to the surface as fragile as they are. 

Modules to be taken to the moon wouldn't be much stronger than those used on the ISS, but the *load paths* would be completely different. The ISS modules are designed to hold in pressure. I'm too lazy to run the stress calculations for the 7 or so psi atmosphere they hold in, but it's a safe bet the stresses caused by holding up their own weight would be close or greater. 

You would need to probably suspend the modules from the top via a complex frame from which you would attach descent thrusters and powered wheels to maneuver the modules back to each other after landing. Now imagine that all of that structure has to be strapped to the top of an old S-IVB stage from a Saturn V (or larger) to get from LEO to Lunar Orbit -- and that's just each *individual* module. Every module you want to send to the moon is going to require probably an entire Saturn V.

**Just to put some numbers together**

* The Destiny ISS module (one of the labs) weighs: [32,000 lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_%28ISS_module%29#Specifications)
* The Ascent Stage of the Apollo LM weighed: [10,024 lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_module)
* The *Descent* Stage of the Apollo LM weighed [22,375 lbf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_module)

The Destiny module weighs roughly three times the mass that was [carried to the surface of]* the moon during Apollo. Assuming the descent stage mass would scale the same (I don't have my copy of Space Mission Analysis and Design nearby so anyone feel free to correct me), landing the Destiny module on the moon would cost ~100,000 lbf [which it just so happens is right at the maximum payload the Saturn V could launch toward the moon.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V)

She was wearing a bikini top and shorts.  I asked her if she had a sweater or if she wanted to run to her room really quick since it was freezing in the building (seriously...I sit with a blanket and sweater at my desk).  She said no and so I called the Professor to let him know she was there and they had their meeting.  He called me into his office before I left for the evening and told me that she had told him that I called her a slut!  Umm...no.  I honestly was just worried that she would be cold and wanted to try to help her out (so that Prof. wouldn't think she was late if she ran home real quick).  I was even thinking of offering her my sweater if she seemed worried about the time.  But when she said no...I dropped it.  That is all.  I was smiling and nice the whole time.

"wow","t5_2qio8","What does having a rogue/hunter have to do with rage? MD and TotT threat is temporary and after that initial burst, your threat shouldn't ever be an issue.

The block gem probably sims lower because your avoidance/mitigation is wonky, but I'll take your word on that one.

If 30 stam is making/breaking you on that phase, then you should have picked up the 15 stam from the boots, as well, or try to move faster. The cooldown on heroic leap is the same as it is on the seeds, so as long as you time your leap correctly for the first one (about 2s before) you won't get hit by any of them after that by using it on cooldown.

Yay enchanting.

You still get rage from blocked attacks, and your main priority is survival over threat. My MT and I are threat capping bosses about 3-4 minutes into the fights, anyway, so your threat really shouldn't be that low.

"geek","t5_2qh17","That's your distinction.  But be aware that some people may think you're laughing at them. 

Let me put it this way-- I'm a med student, and we're told to never laugh loudly near patient areas.  Sometimes patients get the wrong idea and think we're laughing at them.  This isn't just speculation, patients have complained before when the doctors were just laughing at a random unrelated joke.  But sometimes they get offended, and so we avoid that situation. 

Similarly, we specifically avoid technical language.  If we know what the patient means, we don't correct their language.  Doing so often demeans the patients and makes them feel as if we're talking down to them.  Again, this isn't just what a textbook says.  I've heard this first-hand from patients that they really like it when doctors avoid using jargon and instead use normal language.  

You may argue that, as a gun store owner, you don't have to be so careful.  Doctors have a relationship with their patients, but you just own a store.  I would disagree-- often times inexperienced people buy guns.  The gun store owner may be the only person to educate them about gun safety.  What are the important things to tell them?  The four rules, right?  trigger discipline, muzzle discipline.   How important is it to correct them when they say clip?  And to do so pedantically?  

If they think you've been laughing at them, they're probably going to be less likely to take the four rules seriously.  Clip is not the same thing as magazine.  But it's not really that important.   And education about firearms is very important.  It saves lives.  The difference between clip and mag though?  Besides riling a few people up on the internet, I can't really think of a situation where using clip for mag would result in a death. 

But I can think of a scared woman going to buy a gun for self defense, who (maybe wrongly) thinks that the gun store owner is laughing at her a bit when she says clip, and declines to listen to the gun store owner's education about trigger and muzzle discipline, or decides not to sign up for an introductory class.  

That's my real problem with the distinction between clip and mag.  It doesn't hurt any lives, and I feel it separates those who know about guns from those who do.  And the larger that separation, the harder it is to educate the general populace about guns.  When I'm teaching my sister how to shoot, I really don't care if she calls the magazines clips-- as long as she follows the four rules. ","1314836930"

If you can't find bulk then I would pick a reputable name, like Morton &amp; Bassett and build your own collection rather than purchasing a set. Sets are usually inferior and almost always have spices that you will find you just don't use. A good rule of thumb is that if a spice can be had fresh, it's almost always better than dried (so I don't buy dried parsley or rosemary, for example) - with a notable exception to this rule being granulated garlic, which is always useful to have on hand, even if you're fond of using fresh garlic (and boy, am I ever).

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","In order of matureness? Twilight, Applejack, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, then Pinkie Pie.

Rarity isn't mature in the sense that she tries too much to be. I'm assuming, since her parents aren't mentioned in the show, and no one's ever implied that she has/had family, that she doesn't have any. So her being mature could be her compensating for lack of parents. She had no one to teach her manners or ediquette. That's probably why she started her shop, and acts so lady-like. It was the opposite response of an isolated kid, acting feral. She thought, ""I can be more mature than they ever could!"" However, that's a bit of a stretch.

As to what you said, I completely agree. It's sort of a mix between brother/sister and son/mother. To add on to what you said, I think twilight is an amazing mother, and is going to continue to be one. Seeing how mature she is, and how responsible, her parents must of done some amazing parenting. When you combine that with twilight's previous lack of friends, she must be very empathetic to how spike is feeling sometimes.

"RomeSweetRome","t5_2stb9","&gt;This style is considered Flash Fiction, so a book deal isn't really the best option unless you hire a ghost writer to turn each paragraph into a chapter. At this point, you have enough material for a 600 page novel, but you've condensed the action into 15 pages. The idea of a novel is to make the reader feel as if he is in the moment. Flash Fiction, on the other hand, is exactly what you've accomplished, and it's really good.
&gt;
My suggestion is register a domain name that fits your personality or the story and write more Flash Fiction and set up Google ad sense on the site and a Donation button to generate revenue. Eventually, a publisher will offer you a book deal or a studio will buy rights. This is how John Dies at the End was turned into a huge success. Wong basically wrote stories online and made them available for fans on his site. A publisher picked him up and sold it to bookstores, and now he's the Editor in Chief of Cracked. And be sure to link it here in this thread so we all know about it.

You do realize that those people have always been here, and will always be here? That of the 6.5 billion people out there, some are going to have differing tastes, different social behaviors, and different life experiences?  To simply state they are ""frothing idiots, people devoid of any form of intelligence,"" shows an alarming lack of understanding about the differences in this world.  Take this thread, for example.  A redditor wanted to celebrate a milestone on this site, and did so in the least ""karma-whorish"" way, and in doing so said a few nice things. And you truly believe that this person has a substandard IQ?  Maybe that's they way they operate in their own culture, that during a celebration they thank others for what they have done for them.  Or maybe its not a cultural thing, just a tradition their family engages in.  Or maybe the OP just had a fit of ""I'm going to say something nice to a bunch of people today because I'm in a good mood.""

So, rethink your reddit strategy, because all you are doing is making yourself sound like a rather unpleasant and unhappy person. I can guarentee that no one is going to reevaluate their life and personal choices because you called them a douchebag on the internet.","1314836968"

There are some sound advices in the thread. 
Don't stay in Siem Reap 5 days if you are only visiting the temples 3 days, the two extra days are not worth it.

As a serious hobbyist, I got my best shot ever at the 3rd level of Angkor Wat during sunrise, not in front of the pools among the crowds. Wake up early, it's really worth it, and heat during the day is strong.

Woks only work in oriental restaurants because of the massive heat output of the burners which heat all of the wok, bottom and sides. The point of the recommendation for skillets is to have maximum heat transfer to the greatest amount of food.

Don't know how much heat your stove puts out or if you have a wok burner. Never used an electric wok. But I put away my carbon wok and now use my 12"" skillet for wokery cooking.","1314836975"

Mom and Pop places are everywhere and are constantly filled. Just on the small walking street I used to live on in Tokyo there were more than I can remember, at least 6, but maybe as many as 10. There was a place called, ""Beer or Drunk?"" that was a punk-rock bar/cafe next to a sweet little pie shop with wooden framed open windows where you could watch the small 3 person staff make pies and operate the cash register. There was also a bar owned and operated by two buddhist priests who would sit there and talk about philosophy with you while you drink. They also made their own custom non-alcoholic cocktails, at least, their special cocktails seemed to be non-alcoholic because I couldn't taste the alcohol.

This was all just on my specific street, not particularly known for food or quaintness. If you go to the back streets of Shinjuku or Harajuku, you find the same thing, tons and tons of small places that are owned and operated by local people.

Thank you for your reply.  FYI: I wasn't pegging you as a polluter, or even a non-believer, so much as I was trying to point out that this was degenerating into a pissing contest.  The answer has to be somewhere in the middle.  (In this case, I hope it is further to the clean side than dead center, because of how seriously I believe the planet is in danger of permanent climate change and how toxic our earth is becoming.)  But thank you for agreeing on the pollution and global warming issues.

OK, I believe the EPA did spring the changes on Texas.  But I personally do not see much difference in the air pollution floating over the Gulf to settle into the gulf water and destroy needed sea life and having it floating over other states to bother humans while it settles into the ground, waterways and eventually out to the gulf.  (Do you want to get hit in the shin with a bat or a pipe.  Hmmm' decisions, decisions...)  But the Texas plants know they are polluting either way, right?  So I am completely living in a fantasy because I think they should have been putting these filters in place decades ago simply because it was the right thing to do, not waiting for the axe to fall from the hands of the EPA?  Of course I am because that would hurt stockholder dividends.  So what if the stock holders and everyone else have lung cancer? Isn't that how big business is supposed to work?

I like trees, but I don't want to hug them.  They are rough and scratchy.  I am 50 Years old this year.  I remember hearing about this stuff in assemblies in grade school, and so little has been done since then.  (Do you remember the movies they would show on the old noisy projector back in grade school?  I swear, it seemed like every single one had the same narrator and background music!)  The transition will take decades, not months, but the clock started like 40 friggin' years ago!  What the fuck have they been doing?  I do understand that the utilities are businesses.  They do expect to make money.  I get that, and I do not begrudge it to them.  If all the public utilities were run by the Government, they would be gigantic money pits plagued by inefficiencies and cost overruns.  Instead they are run by big business and are plagued with greed, corruption, always taking the easiest and fastest profit, and resisting any attempts at pollution control because it will hurt the bottom line.  (Aw, come on Monty.  Isn't there a door number three?)

I used to be a big proponent of Nuclear Power.  I was the nerdy fat kid obsessed with Star Trek, pretending to be the only chubby Vulcan in Star Fleet.  I could do the Vulcan salute and imitate Leonard Nimoy with the best of them.  Anything that sounded tech-y or scientific just had to be good, right?  Well, our nuclear program was so misguided, it is scary!  As I understand it from reading, used fuel rods only use 5% of their potential before they are too dirty to use in our reactors.  The waste has a half-life measured in the hundreds of thousands of years.  This isn't something we are qualified to play with!.  I read that we COULD have developed Nuclear power based on cleaner Radium, (The article I am basing this meager knowledge didn't go into specifics and I didn't pursue it on my own, so I cannot say any more on the Radium idea.) but we didn't because the government wanted to have lots of waste to make dirty bombs with.  (Yea for our side.  Woot woot!)  And don't forget the depleted uranium for artillery shells!  I read about them and had some lengthy conversations with a former tank gunner from the Army who swears that depleted uranium is safe because the Army told him so, as he sat there wheezing from chronic lung disease with his one lung that wasn't removed because of lung cancer.  Yeah, I have become very cynical, but I come by my cynicism honestly!

One parting analogy I would like to leave you with.  By the way, this is my own analogy, not something I read.  Over a decade ago, I remember all this fighting between the lumber industry and the environmentalists.  There was a protected area, one of the few untouched wooded areas left in the US.  The Loggers wanted to log this area.  The locals wanted the jobs of logging this area.  The environmentalists wanted to protect the natural woodland as we cannot make any more of it.  Even if you replant, it isn't the same.  The flora and fauna are all different afterwards.  Logging the area would have only lasted 5 years if they milked it.  Should we save the last trees and leave a few thousand people unemployed, or cut down the last of the trees and still have a few thousand people unemployed?  It didn't seem like a complicated decision to me.  So I started thinking...

At the time we only had about 4% of the natural forestland left in the states.  Everything else had been logged and replanted.  The natural diversity had been destroyed everywhere else.  So logging is business, and trees are money.  If you lost your job today and only had $100 dollars in your pocket, would you go to a bar to eat and drink, or would you start to conserve the money and make it last as long as possible?  When you are down to $50, do you start to conserve your money, or do you go to McDonalds to eat?  When you are down to $25 dollars, do you start to budget a little, or do you wait until you are down to $10?  Well, we are down to, like, the last 2 or 3% of our natural forest land.  Can we start preserving it now?!?

As always, thanks for sharing your opinions.

**Ravenclaw**: Renaissance, for the exploratory sounds departing from the Medieval era

**Slytherin**: Baroque, a darker and sometimes misunderstood aesthetic that introduced changes in the way instruments were played to manipulate new sounds

**Hufflepuff**: Classical, the lighter, less complex music, during an era with fewer musicians that forced composers to be more resourceful

I'm thinking if I ever buy a JB, I'll replace the controls with a stacked individual volume controls and passive treble and bass cuts. They just allow me to tailor the sound to my mood like nothing else, without ever sounding artificial. Plus it'll get me a bit of that awesome 62 vibe that I love.","1314837000"

First, Occam's razor specifically doesn't deal with probabilities, it deals with needlessly complicating the variables, but I still understand the crux of your argument.

The first question I have is, what exactly are the ""odds"" of a big bang occurring after a big crunch, and how did you calculate them?  What if, since forever, a big crunch has *always* immediately produced a big bang?  Wouldn't the odds then be 1 of this happening?  The point is that we don't really have *any* knowledge about these things, let alone enough to be doing things like probability calculations.

I'm not sure if you've heard it before, but the real application of Occam's razor to the question of the creation of our universe was best formulated by Bertrand Russel in *Why I'm Not A Christian*.  He pointed out that theism, to solve the infinite regress problem, claims that a being which has always existed must have created our universe.  However, why not stop the regress one step earlier and say that the universe has always existed?  So the theist position has one more variable (God) than the persistent universe option, so Occam's razor falls on the side of a persistent universe.  This also leaves us with the advantageous position of only talking about things which we have good reason to believe exist.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I believe that time will eventually grind down the marines to a more primitive state. A state in which the sheer Roman numbers will grind down the marines even more and ultimately win. The modern army's foothold will be temporary and insufficient. No supply will only worsen the situation. I believe those not killed in close combat will starve. Up until then, and until ammo and supplies are spent, I believe that the marines could wreak unimaginable havoc upon the Romans but nothing close to annihilation of Rome, let alone the entire empire. Bows and arrows and fire in the streets of Rome would prove deadly, while not as effective as rifles and limited mortar shells and bazooka missiles. What a glorious mess it would be. But still, I think they'd run out of ammo and find themselves on unknown terrain and simply starve.

Imho, marines' worst enemies: time, terrain, starvation, morale, weather

Given a set goal of ""kill person x in Rome within one week"", yeah, I think they could kill anyone they wanted to. With a goal of ""secure a foothold or conquer the Empire"" no chance whatsoever due to inadequate everything.","1314837051"

&gt;If you've had plenty of classes that started this way, then you're in a shitty school. If you think this is acceptable teaching practice, then your standards are too low.

Currently I have a site that does over a million in sales a year on this solution and it works like a champ.  Your pitfalls will depend on the business model.  Some of the biggies on the business side are payment authorizations - You can use paypal but also look into authorize.net.  Also depending on the business, you may need to make sure everything is PCI compliant - the bank may require this, so locking down your server and a basic SSL will get you by.  The bank may require a third party auditor and a good one will give you a report on what to fix.  Then you need to worry about shipping, making sure it is giving the correct pricing and the company may require a markup on the shipping cost.  The only other thing I can think of is getting the orders to the company.  If a lot of orders are coming in, there may need to be a process to export the orders and import to an internal accounting program.  Depending on that program, you may need to figure out workarounds.  We have a very locked down order processing system but I was able to use the EDI Export module for Drupal so the sales people can pull down the orders and import them into their order tracking software.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","The first rule is to buy used.  Depreciation hits hard with audiophile gear.  The good news is that used gear tends to hold value pretty well, so you won't lose much if you resell used.

You'll find a lot of people here opposed to 5.1 setups, myself included.  I think surround is a sales gimmick to get people to buy more.  I run two high-end speakers for movies.  They get the left and right fine and create a fine center image - a separate speaker wouldn't help.  I don't miss anything from the rear channels (I used to run 5.1) and enjoy movies just as much without them.  Subwoofers do cover the low end, but getting them to blend well with speakers and placing them correctly is another can of worms entirely.

Also, going two-channel reduces the amount of wires that need to be run, simplifies setup and lets you use inexpensive yet very good older receivers.

For a receiver, I like the older models from Adcom, Marantz, NAD, and Rotel.  All high quality brands with products that hold up for a long time.  $50-$200 will get you a very good one.

For speakers, I like Magnepan (their MMG is one of the best values out there), Vandersteen and PSB.  All have models that will fit your budget - but try to find used ones.  You'll get more value for your dollar.

If you want to try a project, consider the kits at Madisound.  Their Zaph kits are inexpensive and of high quality.  Go to Zaph's website for lots of measurements, explanation and documentation.  He's thorough.  Some of the kits come with everything.  No soldering, no woodshop.  Just assembly.  If you've assembled a PC and an Ikea desk, you can handle it with tools you already have.

I've built a few speakers and find it the best way to go.  The rule of thumb in audio is to charge about 4-5 times the cost of parts to arrive at a retail price.  You can skip the markup if you're willing to wield a screwdriver and finish it with a few cans of spraypaint.  You'll also find a lot of discussion and documentation online for building/finishing speakers and DIY forums that will give good advice.

Finally, if you want to stream music with Apple products, the AppleTV and Airport Express can be connected to an input on your receiver.  The AppleTV works well for me.","1314837063"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","To clean, depending on how delicate the fabric is, if it's a semi linen-ish fabric you can dampen a washcloth with hot water, wring it out, place inside the shoe. Leave it for a bit, then take it out. Then, you take a toothbrush that's wetted and dip it into baking soda. The damp fabric should be tough enough to take a bit of scrubbing- I mean, it's a part of footwear, they're designed to take a bit of beating, theoretically. Wipe down with the initial cloth, see how it looks/smells, go at it again or stop to allow to dry. If you have a lot of dry rice, tip some in and leave overnight in order to soak up moisture/odor. This is clearly not something you do on the go. Depending on how bad it is, sprinkling with baking soda and using a spritzer filled with white vinegar *might* take up some of the grease that's embedded itself. Again, wipe off any excess, unless you enjoy vinegary feet. Or, if you have hard plastic inserts, toothpaste scrubbed in should pull up some/most of that gunk you're describing, and impart a nice minty smell. Get cornstarch and put into the bottoms of cleaned, dry shoes. Johnson's baby powder has a cornstarch lavender scented baby powder, which you really shouldn't use on a baby(inhalation risk of all butt powders, talc is really not good) but is amazing for thigh chafe and shoe stink.

**Your dryer sheets are a scent contributor. They have heavy oils that are supposed to be transferred to clothing in the dryer for softening clothing and stopping static. You probably don't want to put your feet into shoes that have been pre-greased. At least use expended dryer sheets- you can get a good two or three uses out of a dryer sheet before they lose all scent on regular sized wash loads. Four or five if you do small loads.  Also, those oils do go rancid, so if you've been piling them up on the inside of the liner I can't imagine it's a pretty smell...

All said and done, footie socks will be your friend if you're wearing them for more than a few hours at a time. You're a foot breather like me, so you should be in lightweight, breathable shoes, or wearing socks of some variety to protect the lining. I bought a pair of leather loafers that can be tossed into the washing machine, not cheap but really keeps down any foot stink. The leather breathes, but I'd rather be barefoot. 

EDIT: Just thought I'd point out- I keep my footwear in really good shape. As in 7-10 years of consistant use. Sneakers get replaced every two years because they're my fall backs, but honestly, I've still got shoes from when I first met my husband in wearable tonight condition. It is *not* hard to keep your shoes lovely if you wipe them down frequently, deodorize and check for strain on buckles and zippers and do some cheap and cheerful repairs. I'm wearing a six year old pair of Birkenstocks that I've re-soled the rolled out heel using a rubberizing paint from Home Hardware. ","1314837082"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I think it helps to remember that the Bible is *literature*, and there are many genres and many ideas about God described therein. God is not literally in any book, so you have a bit of defining to do to even ask the question. Who specifically do you mean by ""God of the Old Testament"", and ""God of the New Testament""?

I'd note that many scholars consider ""Yahweh"" as he appears in many stories to simply be a literary character alongside Moses, Joseph, or whomever. Certainly the behaviour of Yahweh in stories is often at odds with descriptions of God elsewhere in both testaments. But were the authors generally attempting to describe the same God? I think so, at least in the exilic and post-exilic writings (which are most of them).","1314837097"

I think the path to enlightenment would lead us to nature and the interconnectivity seen throughout all of existence. Focusing too much on our world and our ego's get us caught into thinking of things in the same ways and eventually makes us miserable or kills us. I think consciousness, embodiment, and focusing on earthly things (including ourselves) is ultimately limiting as we get caught in paradigms, our own life rules, and one side of understanding. Letting go of yourself, your ego, your consciousness, will ultimately lead to enlightenment and true understanding. The only way to understand or know, is to experience and feel; raw processes, raw emotion.

It is easy to say his performance was mediocre because he had one of the best actors of all time (Pacino) and maybe the top actress working today (Theron) playing opposite to him. I rather think that Keanu allowed his fellow actors to give exaggerated yet believable performances while Keanu was the canvas or the person you identify with to make the other people come alive. And say what you will about the Matrix, but that movie would have been just another Will Smith vehicle rather than the extraoridinarily thought provoking and wonderful film it was. Would you really have wanted a, ""Welcome to Earf, Agent Smith"" from Neo? 

Also, I think that pitting Devil's Advocate to one of the top character study movies of the 1980's and arguably Deniro's best performance seems a little bit of a reach.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","1) Of the people residing in the Golan Heights, they are much better of in Israel and they know. Most of them are Druze and only refuse Israeli citizenship because they fear the Syrians will regain control and punish them. You are wrong in terms of the Golan Heights.

2) This 'ethnic cleansing' bullshit has to stop. Yes, some Palestinians were removed due to 'ethnic cleansing', because some asshole(s) with power got them evicted. But a majority and a far majority of Palestinians who lost their homes (in 1948) lost them because their landlords sold the land they lived on to Jews or for security reasons. Many were innocent, but it is ridiculous to expect the young and vulnerable Israel to allow hundreds of thousands of possible enemy to return to the newly established Israel. It was a legitimate security concern and still is.

Abbas stated that the settlers will be offered Palestinian citizenship and be allowed to stay, I don't think your opinion will be considered in this policy.

Israel doesn't have peace because as a country she is in war with an fanatical organization that states it won't stop until the Jews are pushed into the sea and all of 'Palestine' is liberated. Israel can't negotiate with them, that is why there is no peace. Israel can't do anything to make peace with Hamas except to disappear. 

And how are the Palestinians vulnerable? Yes they are vulnerable to attack from Israel but from whom else? 

Yeah I can see how Gaza is compared to a prison and I'm sypathetic for the Gazans. But as long as Gaza is ruled by an extremist government the Gazans will suffer. They voted in Hamas and they are in control of their own fate. People blame Israel for Gaza yet Israel acts much more humanely than any other country in the world would.

Did you know Israel allows hundreds-thousands of tons of humane aid into Gaza on a daily basis? A majority of that humane aid being funded by Israeli money. Did you know that Israel has the best civilian/militant death ratio in the world in regards to combating Guerrilla militants? 

Stop blaming Gaza on Israel. What do you expect Israel to do? I've talked to tons of people who take the same side as you do - Israel is terrible, look at the Gazan civilians. Yet not ONE person has offered a better solution.

What is happening is *illegal*. To quote from the top of this comment chain -

&gt;The primary objectives of the programs offered under these regulations are to enhance the skills and expertise of exchange visitors in their academic or occupational fields through participation in structured and guided work-based training and internship programs and to improve participants' knowledge of American techniques, methodologies, and expertise.

&gt;Exchange Visitor Program training and internship programs must not be used as substitutes for ordinary employment or work purposes; nor may they be used under any circumstances to displace American workers. The requirements in these regulations for trainees are designed to distinguish between bona fide training, which is permitted, and merely gaining additional work experience, which is not permitted. The requirements in these regulations for interns are designed to distinguish between a period of work-based learning in the intern's academic field, which is permitted, and unskilled labor, which is not.

More importantly, they aren't making anywhere close to $30/hr. I don't even see where you get the idea that their wage is the real issue here. The whole point of the J-1 program isn't cheap labor.

Class doesn't even come into play here - we have corporations exploiting our worlds youth, all to save on overhead.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","&gt; The club is closed at the top because you are not rotating your forearms on the takeaway.

I went to the range and I can confirm that this is correct. I took a few normal swings and I noticed I start back with the club face closed, without rotating my arms much at all. 

I tried to correct it, and it feels a little unnatural. But when I got that going, and had my club face pointing upwards at the sky at the 90 degree angle on takeaway, I noticed I was hitting the ball without the hook that I have tended to have recently. I still hit a draw, but I hit it with a much higher trajectory. 

As I said, it still feels a little weird, but I think I know what to work on now.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The equation for how fast you have to rotate a spacecraft of radius 'r' in order to achieve 1g of centripetal force is straight forward: ** mg = mw^2 *r ** where **w** is the angular velocity^1 of the rotating spacecraft (normally an *omega* but I can't make that here) So, you can chose a size or a speed and then set the other one in order to achieve 1g of ""gravity."" 

However, a small, quickly rotating craft will be uncomfortable for 2 reasons: First, to be comfortable you would like your surroundings to appear and feel flat and second you want gravity to feel constant across your height. We will look at both of these requirements and see which one causes a more constrictive requirement. 

First, humans can tell when a slope they are walking up becomes greater than 1%, it causes extra strain on them at 3%, so we'll split the difference and say that they slope shouldn't be greater than 2% in order to achieve long term, comfortable living. A 2% slope will happen when you have walked a distance of 100 meters and have risen an amount of 2 meters. The distance you walk is given by ** d = theta*r ** and using a small angle approximation the distance you have risen is given by ** r^2 + r^2 *sin(theta)^2 = (dr + d)^2 **. So setting **d = 100** and **dr = 2** we have two equations and two unknowns and we can use [wolframalpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+%28100%2Fx%29^2*%281+%2B+%28sin%28x%29^2%29%29+%3D+102^2) to help us solve^2 . This leads to a minimum *r* value of 71 meters. 

Secondly, we need to make sure gravity is basically a constant across a standard person's height. We'll say the ""average"" person is 2 meters, and (now is where I take a big guess based solely on my guy) that we would want gravity to stay within 5% of the same across our height^3 . Luckily, we know the force is linearly dependent on *r* so all we need to do is find which number for *r* is 2 meters only 5% of. So, ~~** 2 = (.03)x **~~ ** 2 = (.05)x ** which leads to ~~** x = 66.66... **~~ ** x = 40 ** meters. 

Thus, we see that the first requirement is more restrictive (71 meters compared to ~~66~~ 40 meters) so, using my conditions (2% slope and 5% gradient) we conclude that the space station would need to have a radius of at least 71 meters in order for long term habitation to be comfortable. 

As for your second question about the minimum gravity required for no long term health effects, this is ongoing research. I can't tell you the answer, but I can tell you [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Packing-Mars-Curious-Science-Life/dp/0393339912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314837063&amp;sr=1-1) discusses the research in an interesting way. However, reducing the gravity would only reduce the revolutions per second required, not the minimum *r*s we found. 

Hope this helps. 

1- Angular velocity is measured in radians per second in the above equation, but we can convert the answer we find to revolutions/sec by dividing w by 2pi. Also, we are using the w version of this eqn instead of the normal ** v^2 /r ** because w will be constant throughout the spacecraft, while *v* will be function of *r*

2- the link solved for theta, which we then plug into d = r(theta) and solve for r

3- I'm going to use 5%, but the math should be pretty easy to change following the example if you wanted to use a different number

He had been to doctors, he didn't had acid reflux, he didn't had celiacs, his stomach emptied normally, and he didn't had hepatitis.

HOWEVER, his sinuses were usually pretty inflamed. He had a constant lining of heavy mucus in his throat, that he could just feel sitting around. He was just at an ent for a sore throat, and the doctor said his throat was fine, the irritation was from all the mucus dripping down.","1314837139"

Much like when a good looking girl posts a nude picture of herself on the internet with the question ""Do you think I'm hideous?"". 
 
The *only* reason she posted it was because she was fishing for compliments. 
 
1. That sort of nonsense should not be tolerated. It is immature. 
 
2. In this particular case, the photo really is terrible. Everything from the color processing to the subject itself isn't noteworthy at all.
 
3. OP said that they were posting it because it was a personal favorite, while agreeing that it doesn't matter if other people like it; that the hobby is for personal enjoyment... If that were the case, why post it online at all? Worse yet, why get defensive when people call it crap?


I'm finding this sort of attitude in much of the art community. Where every ""work of art"" is to be praised in some way. Where it is impolite to call garbage, garbage out of fear that it would hinder the artist rather than motivate.

If OP thinks that this particular photo was their best, I shudder to think what other garbage they thing is on par with it. ","1314837139"

* Wheel of Time - (1) Eye of the World
 - I had some trouble getting into it after coming off the high of the first three Song of Ice and Fire books but I picked it up again at the start of summer with time for those expectations to cool and loved it

* Wheel of Time - (2) The Great Hunt
 - Really flew threw this one.  The more I soak in Jordan's world I see where GRRM and others draw many influences, most notably I feel ""the Game of Houses"". 

* Wheel of Time - (3) The Dragon Reborn
 - Had a lot less of Rand than I expected but it was good to see more of Mat and Perrin as seperate entities and getting even more fleshed out rather than as additions to Rand.  Black Ajah and magic swords galore!


GRRM

* Song of Ice and Fire - (5) Dance of Dragons
 - Glad to see the plot moving forward again after the stagnation (personal opinion) that was a feast of crows.  I'm always keen on staying as long as I can in GRRM's fantasy world but I feel like there could have been some cuts made to make the action a bit more fluid though it sounds like he's getting back on track.

Isaac Asimov

* I, Robot
- As always Asimov's imagination runs wild at the possibilities that arise out of Robot - Human interaction.  The religious robot story is probably my favourite because it looks at the traps that pure logical deduction can fall into.
 
Patrick Rothfuss

* Kingkiller Chronicles - (2) The Wise Man's Fear
- Took my sometime to get into the first book but I ended up really liking it.  I was really happy with this one because Rothfuss seems to have really matured in not only his writing (nothing seems forced) but also the world is given more life, especially with the introduction of the ""Fae"".  Can't wait for the next one.

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","There are a lot of little things that are either much more complicated in Windows or that just work better in Linux. Multiple workstations are awesome. It's like having multiple monitors or desktops to keep your tasks organized. Anything involving the Internet, or computers talking together in general, just feels more mature, powerful, and customizable.

I also appreciate having my computer treat me like a responsible adult. The error messages are usually pretty informative and I find them to be more helpful than Windows ones.  Having all the config files in plain text is great, and I appreciate how easy it is to make it look really good. Wobbly windows, speaking of eyecandy, and the burn-on-close effect also make it feel more alive, and it's fun to show off with too.

Which is my final point, that even though it's technically superior it's also a lot more fun to use, and a lot easier to make yours. It does take more brainpower to run, but it's fun in the way a Lego set is.

Just try to use it as much as possible and read about what the commands do and if you don't like it then it's not for you. Some people like the way a windows machine runs.","1314837170"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; You'd still need to get to water in order to sterilize it, and you'd still need a container.

You will need a container anyways...

&gt;You could always use rainwater as well.

Yes you could use rainwater, but this would be more of a luxury and would only be feasible down the line, at a point when you have a shelter made and multiple containers to store it in not to mention some sort of leaf based eavesdrop to accumulate the water. Until you reach such a point you will need to rely on streams, streams in which animals could be lying in upstream, defecating in, and ABOVE ALL ELSE there will be predators in lakes and streams as well... underwater ones such as crocs, large snakes, piranha like fish... you name it... it is probably there.

&gt;Large predators typically look for large prey. A T-Rex is not going to be very interested in a human. A bear-sized animal is what you are going to be worried about.

Are you willing to risk your life based on that assumption?

&gt;The issue with the smaller creatures is not that they can take you down. It's the infection they will leave you with if you even get a scratch. Which, again, is why you need the med kit.

In my entire life, I have been infected 0 times, I have scraped and cut myself countless times. The amount of times I have used an antibiotics? I could probably count on 1 hand. A wound can be cleaned just by the salt water in the ocean. Maybe you are referring to some sort of venomous creatures (because in that case I don't think the medkit would help much anyways, you would have to extract the venom with your mouth and then tough it out)? Because the risk of infection from a regular wound when combined with common sense is negligible.

&gt; But without a civilization, without a safe haven to work in, and without other people to help you survive, most people would probably die.

You know there are people who choose to live of the land even in this day and age, this is how our species started. I don't think you can argue that we can't survive without a civilization when that is precisely what we have done to get to this point.

But they've also brought me the most interesting academic challenges of my life, have made me think harder than I ever have, and I've met some really great people along the way.

I'm going to be approximately $150k in debt when I graduate. Nothing in the world terrifies me more than not getting a job where I can pay that back, especially since I have no desire to do Big Law. But as much as I stress about find a job (even tho I'm only a 1L), and final exams (they're months away), I wouldn't change my decision for anything. If you're going to law school for the right reasons, you'll be okay. Don't let the doomers and gloomers scare you (like they did me!) I think you'll be so glad you stayed.","1314837183"

Quoting the important parts

&gt;Words of Affirmation

&gt;Actions don’t always speak louder than words. If this is your love language, unsolicited compliments mean the world to you. Hearing the words, “I love you,” are important—hearing the reasons behind that love sends your spirits skyward. Insults can leave you shattered and are not easily forgotten.

&gt;Quality Time

&gt;In the vernacular of Quality Time, nothing says, “I love you,” like full, undivided attention. Being there for this type of person is critical, but really being there—with the TV off, fork and knife down, and all chores and tasks on standby—makes your significant other feel truly special and loved. Distractions, postponed dates, or the failure to listen can be especially hurtful.

&gt;Receiving Gifts

&gt;Don’t mistake this love language for materialism; the receiver of gifts thrives on the love, thoughtfulness, and effort behind the gift. If you speak this language, the perfect gift or gesture shows that you are known, you are cared for, and you are prized above whatever was sacrificed to bring the gift to you. A missed birthday, anniversary, or a hasty, thoughtless gift would be disastrous—so would the absence of everyday gestures.

&gt;Acts of Service

&gt;Can vacuuming the floors really be an expression of love? Absolutely! Anything you do to ease the burden of responsibilities weighing on an “Acts of Service” person will speak volumes. The words he or she most want to hear: “Let me do that for you.” Laziness, broken commitments, and making more work for them tell speakers of this language their feelings don’t matter.

&gt;Physical Touch

&gt;This language isn’t all about the bedroom. A person whose primary language is Physical Touch is, not surprisingly, very touchy. Hugs, pats on the back, holding hands, and thoughtful touches on the arm, shoulder, or face—they can all be ways to show excitement, concern, care, and love. Physical presence and accessibility are crucial, while neglect or abuse can be unforgivable and destructive.

Tell her what you want. ","1314837188"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","During surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, a _cardioplegic_ solution is instilled to stop the beating of the heart. It also has cardioprotective agents in it.

It's true that in advanced cardiac life support asystolic rhythms don't get a shock. I think (I'm not a cardiologist) the differentiating factor here is that in most cases of asystole, it's some one or a combination of factors leading to asystole (_H_s and _T_s: acidosis, tension pneumo, tamponade, hypovolaemia, hypo/hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, trauma, plus a few others): if they're not corrected, juice won't restore the rhythm.

Thanks to research, we can tell which cancers can simply be cut out, which need to be cut out and then irradiated, and which need to be cut out and followed with chemotherapeutic cocktails.

Those cocktails have also come a very long way. We know, thanks to research, that many cancers respond drastically to certain drug combinations, and we know that we can operate more effectively after a course of chemotherapy.

We know not to operate on some cancers. We know exactly what margins are necessary for many cancers-- do we need to take another centimeter margin of the skin on this person's chest, face, legs, to get a good cure? Or can we get a slim margin and be confident?

We know what factors contribute to many forms of cancer, and we can give advice on avoidance. We know how to prevent spread, and when we need to.

When you talk about radiation that could be done 60 years ago, you're clearly illustrating that you have no idea what today's irradiation treatments involve. There are various radiation protocols-- eg, single or low-repetition massive dose treatments vs weeks of low-dose treatment. These are done stereoscopically, with machines that rotate around a patient, and the programs are only possible thanks to highly advanced imaging and incredibly sophisticated computer algorithms. Much of our knowledge of which protocols are effective for which cancer and how to apply them come from, you guessed it, animal research.

http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/05/16/michigan.police.child/index.html?eref=igoogle_cnn

Seven year old, shot and killed by police during a raid on their home, video evidence eventually shows that police lie about events to make it look like her family was partially to blame, not only that, but this family lived in a duplex, the person the police were looking for was in the other unit.

A few cherry picked comments from that page:

&gt;This may sound insensitive but ... What happened happened, we all should be mad at the parents who brought this into their home instead of the cops who did the deed.. Think about what really caused this event...

So...don't blame the cops for shooing a 7 year old, blame the parents. Even if the person *were* in the house, I would blame the person with the gun for shooting a child. It's up to the discretion of the police about when to go in, and you don't go in if there is a risk of losing innocent life.

&gt;I think the parents are responsible only if they knew that the murderer was upstairs. Remember that he was technically part of the family so I find it hard to believe nobody knew he was there. They should have turned him in, but they didn't.

Same as above....

&gt;The real injustice is her safety was not assured in the first place by responsible parenting Very sad very unfortuneate but this is not the problem of law enforcement

I would say the **real** injustice is police firing a weapon when they don't know where or who that bullet is going to hit. But by all means, blame the family of the victim.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; This has brought about quicker resolutions to misbehavior, although the one with the aggression problem often breaks things﻿ after the punishment in anger, causing another round of spanking.

Contradictions, contradictions...

&gt; We don't like to spank, but it has often proven to be necessary,

Teach them by example, listen to them (I bet they were never actually listened to before you adopted them, and spanking only reinforces that observation).  Kids are generally very perceptive and smart, and will imitate you in ways you wouldn't even imagine.  If a kid is destroying shit, *there has to be a reason* that remains undiscovered, and it is *your mission* to discover it.

But now, with spanking, all you're teaching them right now is that the person with the most physical force gets to do whatever the fuck they want and is always ""right"".  Sure, it resolves the most immediate problem (sometimes), but you need to think of the long-term consequences: you're breeding *sociopaths*, if you didn't notice it before, now you know.

Of course, and pretty obviously if *they* use violence, they *need* to learn the lesson that violence is permissible to stop them.  But, obviously a well, holding them still while you beat them up and tell them ""violence and property destruction is wrong"" (the most obvious form of performative contradiction I know) will only cause the kid to eventually conclude that ""you're full of shit"" and hate you.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That may be true, but unless all that money you are using to pay down your CC debt comes from subsidized loans, the interest begun to accrue the moment that loan was dispersed to you and continues until you pay it back. Subsidized loan interest doesn't start until you are out of school and beginning your repayment. What this means is even though that interest may be lower (which as a grad student puts the rate at 6.8%, ) you will be adding extra time for interest to build on that debt.

So pay off the CC debt with actual money, and you limit interest down to a few years at most. Pay it down with that student loan money, and the interest will accrue for many more years (The two standard payment plans are either 10 yr or 25 yr payback, a lot longer than it would take to pay off the CC debt, so even the subsidized loans will accrue interest a lot longer than your CC debt will).

I mean, if you think it's worth it, go for it. I know it is generally a really bad financial move to pay one debt with another. You should run the numbers, and figure out how much interest you will actually be paying both ways. 

Another thing to think about is can you make it through the next semester with only $2100 in your account. So, what good would it be to pay off your CC with another form of debt, only just a few months later be in a position where you would need to use that your CCs. Then you would be accruing more debt at a high interest while still having your original $4500 debt (just being deferred).

We aren't accusing you of being bi but facts are facts - it happens, some people's sexualities change, some never do. Some people's sexualities are not concrete, others are.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;If God exists, and God is the architect of the universe (ie, he crated matter as well as space, time, energy and life), would it be possible for God to create a system of objective morality foreknowing how life would evolve?

God could create these rules, but that would still leave you with the problem of him choosing the rules to create, and still leaving morality a matter of his whim. This just knocks the problem one step higher in abstraction: Did God create these rules at the start of the universe because they were *already* good, or because he decided they were good?

&gt;On a side note, I also find myself curious if you believe in Karma. The implications that Karma exist, especially as a result of going with or against feelings of morality are fairly obvious.

Not really, I'd say I believe in karma in the same sense that I believe in luck. ""Luck"" is just a label we use to describe the outcome of random events, and I think too many atheists and people that call themselves rationalists get bogged down in declaring that ""luck"" is meaningless or nonexistent, when the concept clearly isn't. You can say you have bad luck and I know exactly what you're talking about without having any sort of supernatural fate or destiny involved, and I think the same way about karma. When someone says they're going to get bad karma if they do something, I understand what they mean without attributing anything supernatural to it, even if they themselves believe in the spiritual side of it. I assume they mean that they would feel bad about it, worry that their bad actions might come back to haunt them in some way, etc. If they also propose some backdrop of supernatural forces at work to ensure different outcomes happen, I don't buy into that, but it doesn't really change the outcome of what they think karma does in the real world.

&gt;Finally, I find myself unconvinced that morals could be objective for any reason outside of God.

I am too. :)

&gt;But if morals evolved as man became self aware, and they did so to help with mans survival, then I see no reason why these morals would be objective. Even in a case such as rape where it is possible that rape would reduce mans net survivability, there is nothing to say that 1 case of rape among 1000's of cases of consensual sex wouldn't lead to an increase in survivability. Thus, the moral value of rape being objectively wrong because it has a statistical negative net affect on evolution would be rendered subjective when compared to a case where rape was beneficial to humanity.

I think I agree with everything here. I don't know if it's possible to call this objective morality, even if it would be based on objective fact, because you'd have to work from the assumption that ""humans thriving"" is objectively the best moral outcome, and I don't see how. What if the best moral outcome is that we all die so that the Earth isn't polluted, for example? I still haven't read Sam Harris's book on this very issue, The Moral Landscape, despite having it sitting here. Maybe I'll get to it now!","1314837251"

Both say that the best they can hope for in German society is a job in an Eastern European office of a German company.

I heard the same thing from Turkish taxi drivers when I was in Germany 10 years ago : their children grew up in Germany, were not accepted despite perfect German, were ashamed of their parents because they were not German.

So, Germany has a long way to go in integrating foreigners.  Not as bad as the Japanese, but no where near the US, for example.

Of course, I am in California, full integration is the norm here, the only comments I ever hear about 'foreigners' are a) &lt;latest wave ethnic group&gt; are lousy drivers, b) &lt;ethnic groups with serious saving/bargaining cultures&gt; are lousy landlords, and c) Mexicans in the US are very nice and very hardworking people.","1314837276"

I prefer pump to semi-auto. I'm familiar with it in a stressful situation, it's not difficult for a family member to figure out if necessary, and IMO it's more reliable than an auto loader. I may be talking out of my ass here, but another negative to a semi-auto that springs to mind is the ""I only fired 2 shots, but how is my mag empty"" syndrome that happens a lot in life-or-death situations. You hear about it happening often with police. They think they fired twice, but ended up firing an entire mag because of the adrenaline pumping. I'd rather know I had to pump between rounds rather than just pull the trigger. Someone let me know if I'm an idiot for thinking this. ","1314837297"

a) Good background team.  The CPC are extremely well organized, fund raise like wild men, know their ridings like the back of their hands, etc.  That's not the PM's beat, that's the beat of the president and executive of the party.  What the CPC lacks in quality MPs, they make up for with excellent back room generals and strong riding level infrastructure.

b) Longevity - you'll see all sorts of CPC supporters and stooges crow about how long he's been in office.  In order to maintain power, he's had to chop into his legislative output horrifically, prorogue twice, etc.  He may not be the most productive PM, but he knows which way the wind is blowing and is willing to do ANYTHING to retain power.  He's the PM of a thousand lives.

c) $$$ - you cannot underestimate how much of his ""genius"" comes down to being able to drastically out advertise his opponents.  He's managed to define Martin, Dion and Iggy, successively, and the LPC hasn't been able to wrench the story back into their own court.  You don't lose elections if you can paint your opponents as bumbling boobs with impunity.

d) Information Control - he's the most secretive, controlling PM we've had to date, even surpassing Chretien.  His PMO advertises on the public dime for his government, using the public's own money against them, and he's spent record dollars in the PMO monitoring national media.  He knows exactly what the pulse of the public is, at all times of the day, and vets most of his MPs public statements through the PMO.  Only a handful of cabinet ministers can speak to the press without his prior approval.

e) Timing - he couldn't have re-entered politics at a better time.  The leadership race for the CA was a gimme because his biggest opponent had just been humiliated in a national campaign.  He took power just as the merger negotiations were showing fruit and got to take credit for a lot of other people's work on that file.  He arrived back just as Adscam hit, and just at the tail end of a long and increasingly corrupt Liberal dynasty.  Every possible factor was pointed his way.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I don't think this is going to be the advanced explanation, nor will it be a professional one, but here goes:

The strong and the weak forces are here to make matter stable, and to make sure energy is not wasted.

Sometimes, matter gets into situations where its hard for it to stay stable. Say in our sun.
The sun is a very hot place, and because of that the hydrogen, which makes up most of our sun, is moving very fast. This creates a nuclear reaction called fusion, where four hydrogen protons and two electrons become Helium.
""But wait!"" You'll say, ""Helium has two protons and two neutrons! not four protons!"", and you'll be right.
Helium cannot be stable with four protons, so using what we know about the **strong** force, we can see that energy was ejected from this nuclear reaction to compensate for the loss of charge from two of the protons.
At the end of this reaction, we are left with a Helium atom, which weighs like the four Hydrogen atoms that made it (which means it is stable), and the charge that was lost from two of the protons became energy (e.g. photons).

The weak force is a bit trickier for me to explain, but here goes.

Sometimes matter becomes extremely heavy. For example, Uranium.
Being this heavy, it has many electrons, which try to keep the balance of charges between themselves and the protons at the nucleus, however, matter at this state is not very stable.
On occasion, and this can be measured statistically using what we know of the **weak** force, there will be a ""surplus"" of energy in the uranium.
What happens after this surplus is Nuclear Decay.
There are quite a few kinds of decay. The kind of decay you will be getting depends on how ""excited"" the decaying matter is.

Hope this helps you.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; The Church has never blown off questions about nature and cosmology by simply resorting to ""God did it"". 

This is simply false. Well, technically the church didn't blow of questions about it but actively suppressed knowledge about it because they didn't want to admit that their earlier ""God did it"" statement was false, so, yeah.

&gt; Even if God is the ultimate cause of everything, he still works through natural means which are understood through science.

This is a God of the gaps. Some time ago we thought God moved the atoms, now we know that there is something smaller, and so on. If you want to argue that god is just an omniscient omnipotent being that somehow influences nature and science in an untestable way, well there you go you have just arrived at ""It's fucking magic."".

&gt;The only way this could be discredited is if we were able to observe something to the contrary. Until then, it's just rational to assume that what we have always observed without exception will continue to be the case. 

We have so little knowledge of how the universe really began that both the assumption that there is an end to the rabbit hole and the assumption that it's an endless fall are equally valid, since there is literally nothing known on that scale that points in one direction or the other. Assuming one over the other has to have a reason, you can't just assume that because our current universe behaves like that that physics at the very moment of the big bang or beyond that are the same. There is no scientific consensus on this and there are vastly differing and opposing theories present that support both a finite and infinite rabbit hole. The rational position is ""we don't know shit, assuming anything would be stupid"" not ""hey, God!"". It's, again, filling in the gaps in science with goal-oriented philosophy.


&gt;Do you apply this level of scrupulosity to everything else? Do you ever fail to wake up and eat meals because of the possibility that this world is the matrix? No. You make the rational assumption that this is not the matrix and live accordingly.

Personal expression is very important in the age group targeted by this t-shirt, and putting an end to it in one of the main arenas accessible to those children will not solve the problem either.

No one expects society to change on its own. That's why there was a petition to have this shirt removed. That's why people submitted reviews of the shirt voicing their disapproval. That's why an article was written about the damaging message found on this shirt. Individual members of society may seem insignificant on their own, but when they believe that something is wrong, and take actions to right that wrong, they can be pretty powerful. School administrations are not individual members of societies. They're bureaucracies. It would be wonderful if every middle school principal decided to hold an assembly on the dangers of misogynistic or misandristic language, but it's not going to happen.

And don't forget: [Austin Chapter NAACP President Backs Away from Ron Paul](http://ronpaulsurvivalreport.blogspot.com/2008/02/austin-chapter-naacp-president-backs.html) - The Ron Paul Survival Report (2/7/08)

When *Austin Chapter* NAACP President Nelson Linder defended Paul, the story morphed first into ""The NAACP President endorses Ron Paul,"" then ""The NAACP endorses Ron Paul."" Linder later stressed that he made his comments *as a private citizen*, not in his capacity as president of the Austin branch, and that, though the libertarian platform deserved the same scrutiny as that of the Democratic and Republican parties receive, *he was* ***not*** *endorsing Ron Paul*.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The types of cancer they are getting are directly stemming from being exposed to the 9/11 cleanup efforts. These are exceedingly rare forms of cancer, even more rare considering the age groups of people getting them, and all can be attributed to exposure to certain dusts and chemicals found at ground zero. The exact source of any cancer is difficult to pinpoint, no matter who it is or what they do. 

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_effects_arising_from_the_September_11_attacks#Ground_zero_workers_and_cancer) is a small statement about how many first responders had been diagnosed, though I don't know what percentage it would be today. 

There were tons of people donating to multiple causes in the wake of 9/11 and money to responders is no different. 

On the issue of city or state paying for them, you seem eager for a debate on this particular bit so I'll give it a stab. The bill passed to cover their medical bills was roughly $7 billion I think. The current NY state budget is $132 billion, or around there somewhere. That's a big percentage of a state budget to give to a handful of people when you have schools to fund, and that list could go on. The city is even less able to do this, having much smaller budgets. 

It's the same reasoning behind FEMA. When you have disasters, and the people affected by said disasters need help, the federal government steps in to provide that help.","1314837384"

Lost in this struggle are those who look objectively at all the scientific evidence for evolution without feeling any need to reject the notion of an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The D20 is your standard ""Roll for Success"" die - since each number has roughly a 5% chance of coming up, it's much easier to determine how likely you are to hit - for example, if I say ""Roll 15 or better on the D20"" it is much easier to guess your odds of success then if I say ""Roll a 13 or better with three D6s.""

The other dice are generally used to provide numbers in a specific range - for instance, a weapon might deal 1 to 4, 1 to 6, or 1 to 8 damage, and so you roll that type of die to determine how much damage you do.  Another area that dice were used for is ""Hit Dice"" - at each level, you would roll a die to see how many hit points you gain, and the tougher classes would use larger dice.

One thing you will see a lot of is the ""plus one"" type modifiers. Special talents, magic items, or other uncanny abilities will result in you having better (or worse) odds of success - for instance, a sword that had a mild enchantment might give a bonus to accuracy, which we refer to as a ""plus one to hit"" - when you roll the D20, you add one to your result. A more powerful weapon might be ""+2 to hit and damage"", which means you get to add 2 to your D20 roll AND to your damage roll - not bad!

One more bit of dice terminology - the Natural 20.  For as long as the game has been played, players have attached special significance to rolling a 20 or a 1 on the D20.  These are the absolute best and worst you can roll, obviously, and are traditionally treated as either a spectacular success or a critical failure.  Depending on your table, there may be special rules in play, but dealing double-damage on a weapon strike where you rolled a Natural 20 is pretty typical.

If you got through all of that, you are probably able to wade through some pretty dense jargon at this point.  Let's see it in action:

    Player: ""I want to attack the Ork Shaman with the dead guy's Elven Longsword.""
    DM: ""Okay, that's a +2 longsword, so roll D20+2.  You'll need to beat 14 to get past his defensive spells.""
    Player:  ""Natural 20!""
    Everyone: Cheers!
    GM: ""Well done! Your roll of 22 hits, obviously, and your longsword deals 1d6 damage +2. 
         You'll be dealing double that for the critical hit.""
    Player: ""Eh, 3.""
    GM: ""So that's 3+2 for 5, doubled for 10.""
    Player: ""...is he dead?""
    GM: ""If by dead you mean furiously casting dark magics, then...""
    Player: ""Little help, guys?""","1314837391"

Scientists generally understand that their conclusions are fallible.  

&gt;The foundation of science lies in the idea that under the same conditions an event will always unfold exactly the same way, or rather, you can repeat an experiment and get the same result time and time again.

It's more complex than that.  For the most part, scientific experiments are supposed to be repeatable, so other researchers can check if they get the same results.  Sometimes they do get consistent results, other times not so much.  There is also a whole class of processes we know about in which you can start with the same initial conditions and get *different* results.  These are known as [stochastic processes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stochastic_processes).  ","1314837405"

I have no desire to try to trick them out of their beliefs, information on a variety of social issues is out there for them to study up on if they so choose. It's up to them to live faithfully, as much as it's up to me to live however I like. Ideally, everyone votes based on their own researched or soulsearched personal beliefs that they hold to in all areas of life. This might not be how it actually plays out, but the church itself is an idealistic faith structure. They vote with their beliefs just as much as you or I do. They don't want to force them on anyone, they don't really seem to have a political agenda other than living for God however they can.

While I disagree with some of their moral stances, they themselves hold the law of the land to be a separate but vital entity in the hierarchy of which rules everyone abides by. They understand that, while homosexual marriage might be legalized in this state, it doesn't mean they have to agree with it or are obliged to participate. Their moral fabric includes laws of the state/country they live in but are not beholden to them and are vocal about the balance between obeying God, obeying the law, and obeying their families.

It's fair enough everyone gets to vote, don't you think? You encroach on their beliefs with the way you vote all the same as you said they do to you. And they mourn over the moral choices made by the majority vote they don't agree with as much as you would.","1314837422"

Humans also remember where things are spacially. So, for example, you remember that this button you want is in a particular spot on the ribbon. Except because of the way the ribbon works, each toolbar is in the same place as the others. That causes a moment of confusion when you realise the button isn't there.

Contrast the iPad screen - same sized icons, evenly spaced with a lot of white space around each.

A. the Knife is an excelent tool but defensewise it  lacks a lot unless you tie it to a stick or something. the medkit is nice but if you're injured the chances of surviving are dropped a looooot even with the medkit. the rifle is nice but you rely on having to look for ammo and it becomes uselees without it.

so even if he was an average-height frenchman he may have been small for an englishman, and since his military travels probably also brought him more to the north(I don't know much about napoleon but I do know that the netherlands also was under french rule at the time), the people there may have seen him as small

When they started to order whiskey and what not, it would be the time to strike. You out order them! order more whiskey! more tea! order all the things! The key here is to establish the alpha male dominance, let them know that they're in your house, playing by your rules.         


Finally, in order to make this a flawless victory, you must wait until the bill is triple or quadruple what they had initially planned, so in this case 6600RMB-8800RMB. This is when you execute your last, and most essential play.       


You look them dead in the eyes with the best poker face you can muster up. Takes out your wallet (make sure you've removed all content prior to this) whip that sucker at their face with all your might. 


Stand up, put your arms out like an airplane, starts spinning around in circles while singing at the top of your lungs ""HOTEL, MOTEL, HOLIDAY INN!"". while spinning, slowly inch your way to the exit.

As I said earlier, up to this point, we have never seen gear second simultaneously used with Luffy's vulcanization...unless of course Oda just didn't draw it when he fought the pacifista.

In the same way, the water around a bubble is denser than the air inside the bubble, so the bubble rises. This is also why balloons don't rise forever: As air molecules become more spread out the further you get away from the center of gravity, the weight of the balloon's material (rubber) balances the force the helium needs to rise above the normal but thinning air molecules.","1314837482"

True. But on a higher level it's an unnecessary crutch. I think if they can work up the courage to give a compliment, they can work up the courage to say Hey I'm X instead. If they can't though, sure, go for your approach.

False. To illustrate, if you like soft toys and have a couple, you're not going to go out wearing a jacket made of soft toys to illustrate to everyone, ""Hey I'm the soft toy guy, if you like soft toys, come talk to me!"" It's not who you are, it's just one of your interests. 

A few people might talk to you but it will put off a lot more (and those people probably like soft toys too, it's just that wearing them on a jacket is going too far and sets off a warning sign). For meeting people the first time, looking generic really is awesome, and it's something FA'ers probably have in spades!

It also takes the responsibility off of the FA'er for starting conversations and puts it back onto other people doing the work for them, and unfortunately after a little while (and snickers behind their back about them being the soft toy jacket weirdo), they're going to wonder what's wrong with them, etc.

We had to teach her to pick up and drop it just to get some of them out. Heck I have difficulty getting some pieces out. Even pieces of real peperoni (the slices) will be more difficult. There's a line though, too frustrating and they give up, too easy and they are done too quick. 

I'm not overly surprised with a trainer giving advice like that(especially after the ""trainer"" I met at the vet this morning). It may work but may also cause other behavior issues. The method I'm using to teach down and sit is to have a release word. So they know when it's time to get up. No reward if the get up without the word. So my pup gets told to sit and I wait a little bit and then say ""okay"" and she gets her treat. You gradually increase the time until they stay that way until you release them. This may take a while but is worth it in the end. I have a hard time pacing myself to go slower. If she's getting up without being told reduce the time and start over. Eventually it'll happen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hey, [The_Quiet_Earth](http://www.reddit.com/user/The_Quiet_Earth)! Here's your post in cockney.
------
&gt;So I've been watching HBO's Rome and Generation Kill simultaneously and it's lead me to fantasize about traveling back in time with modern troops and equipment to remove that self-righteous little twat [Octavian (Augustus)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus) from power. 
&gt;
&gt;Let's say we go back in time with a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), since the numbers of members and equipment is listed for our convenience in [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Expeditionary_Unit), could we destroy all 30 of Augustus' legions? 
&gt;
&gt;We'd be up against nearly 330,000 men since each legion was comprised of 11,000 men. These men are typically equipped with limb and torso armour made of metal, and for weaponry they carry swords, spears, bows and other stabbing implements. We'd also encounter siege weapons fancy catapults and crude incendiary weapons. 
&gt;
&gt;We'd be made up of about 2000 members, of which about half would be participating in ground attack operations. We can use our ~~four Abrams M1A1 tanks, our artillery and~~ mechanized vehicles (60 Humvees, 16 armored vehicles, etc), but we cannot use our attack air support, only our transport aircraft. 
&gt;
&gt;We also hae medics with us, modern medical equipment and drugs, engineers, but we no longer hae a magical time-traveling supply queue (we did hae but the timelords frowned upon it, sadly!) that provides us with all the ammunition, equipment and sustenance we need to survive. We'll hae to succeed with the stuff we brought with us.
&gt;
&gt;So, will we be victorious? 
&gt;
&gt;I really hope so because I really dislike Octavian and his horrible family. Getting Atia will be a bonus. 
&gt;
&gt;Edit - **Prufrock451**
&gt;
&gt;Big thanks to Prufrock451 for bringing this scenario to life in a truly captivating and fascinating manner. Prufrock clearly has a stonking talent, and today it appears that he or she has discovered that they possess the ability to convey their imagination - and the toodly ideas it contains - to people in a thoroughly entertaining and exciting way. thou hae a wonderful talent, Prufrock451, and I hope thou are able to use it to entertain people beyond Reddit and the internet. Thank thou for yer tremendous contribution to this thread.
&gt;
&gt;**Mustard-Tiger**
&gt;
&gt; bloody nora! Thank thou for gifting me Reddit Gold! I feel fancy a little kid who's won summat cool, fancy that time my grandma made me a robot fancy dress out of ol' cereal boxes and I won a $10 prize that I spent on a Thomas the Tank Engine book! That might seem as if I'm being unappreciative, but watching this topic grow today and seeing people derive enjoyment from all the different ideas and scenarios that hae been put forward by different posters has really made my day, and receiving Reddit Gold from Mustard-Tiger is the cherry on the top that has left me feeling just as giddy as that little kid who won a voucher for a bookshop. Again, thank thou to bits, Mustard-Tiger. I'm sure I will make mint use of Reddit Gold. 
&gt;
&gt;Thank thou to all the posters who've recommended books, comics and movies about alternative histories and time travel. I greatly appreciate being made aware of the types of stories and ideas that I really enjoy reading or watching. It's always noice to receive recommendations from people who share yer interest in the same things.
&gt;
&gt;Edit - In my head the magical resupply system only included sustenance, ammo and replacement equipment fancy armour. Men and vehicles would not be replaced if they died or were destroyed. I should hae made that clear in my OP. Okay, let's remove the magical resupply queue, instead replacing it with dooze equipment and ammo to last for, say, 6 months. Could we destroy all of the Roman Empire in that space of time before our modern technological advantages ceased to function owing to a lack of supplies?
&gt;
&gt;Edit 3 - Perhaps I've over estimated the capabilities of the Roman forces. If we remove the tanks and artillery will we still win? We now hae troops, their weapons, vehicles for mobility (including transport helicopters), medics and modern medicine, and engineers and all the other specialists needed to keep a MEU functional.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Sort of both. If I am in C major, there are several modes I could choose. ""Wrong"" isn't a good word for it, it's used to give a different sound. Indeed, the example you chose is a good one.

A dorian is C lydian (a major mode). So playing A dorian over C major will give you the lydian sound.

It won't sound like G major wanting to resolve to G, because of the context.

Since C lydian is a major mode, it isn't ""wrong"" for C major , it just gives a different sound.

This different sound is the useful bit.

For my recently completed 2nd AR, I bought a stripped lower and all of the parts and finished it myself, mainly because it was fun but also so I could learn more about how the AR functioned.

This person is almost certainly dead by now. You could just tell she was dumber than a sack of old yarn and this was habitual behavior. Hopefully she's unemployed and stays indoors most of the time...if she's still alive that is.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Can you show me any passage in the Republic equating (not correlating) possession of material wealth of any kind with fineness of soul? The ancient world is not a monolithic whole, and I will be very surprised if either Socrates or Plato is found to endorse such an idea seriously.

His entire rationalization of the soul system speaks to this. Gold, silver, and bronze? It is a subtle hint that those with wealth are the ones in charge, and those without are worth less. In addition, for him, at least the way he describes it, democracy is really a tyranny of the poor and stupid. 

And, on top of all this, to assume otherwise assumes Plato is somehow writing in a vacuum. He is not. In the ancient world... aristocracy, and the worth of a man, was directly proportional to his actual worth, as in his land holdings. Anyone reading his works when they were written would plainly understand it this way, and to try to reinterpret his meaning in a modern perspective while trying to retain the original intent is ignoring those facts. You can certainly find wisdom in Plato to apply to today, but trying to place value on his idealized form of government and phrasing his arguments in terms of modern values is, quite frankly, retarded.

&gt;Actually, I think it's a reasonable description of the city-in-speech. The city is governed by a group of the aristoi, the best men, whose status as best is determined by the quality of their souls. This status is not hereditary: children born to gold-souled parents may be assigned to the silver class, or lower, based on their own quality, and vice versa.

The original definition of aristocracy is land based, and in essence of the result of the gradual accumulation of wealth into familes via inheiretance.

Let me translate what you just wrote into what you are suggesting replacing the word aristocrat with what it actually means.

A non-hereditary hereditary-wealth-based-system-classified-by-land-wealth meritocracy.

EDIT: While Plato certainly might have argued for a meritocracy among the aristocracy, it still restricted the pool of possible candidates to the aristocracy, and was thus far from non-hereditary.

You determine how far someone's head is past the axis of rotation based on the dimensions of your spacecraft. I can have your 2 m tall man in a spacecraft spinning with the radius being 1.5 m. Then the head is 0.5 m past the axis of rotation, which also means that the head is experiencing a different pull than the rest of the body.

Again, all this boils down to how you want to define the space station's dimensions.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I am quite well versed in the particulars of Athenian democracy, and the proper use of the word tyranny.

What Plato advocated was, in effect, a tyranny, because only (who knows, just Plato himself?) was in a position to decide who was the best, and, ergo, who should rule.

Calvin was a totalitarian of the worst sort. Not only did he not believe in freedom, but he believed, sincerely, that your lack of freedom has been decided by God at the moment the universe was created, about 6000 years ago. 

I did not say Plato was any sort of apologist for any tyranny with which he would have been familiar. 

I will use Sung China, because it is a good example. All office holders had to pass a test. The test included sections on literature and poetry. It resulted in, perhaps, the most humane government which has ever existed on Earth (certainly an argument could be made, although, it is clear, they were no sexual egalitarians and had many faults).

However, could you submit ee cummings poetry and pass the test? How about Longfellow, or Wordsworth? How about Lord Byron?

No, even if artfully translated, the only poetry that qualified was classical Confucian poetry. This is, in effect, a tyranny of poetry. 

So, what sort of philosophers would Plato have found acceptable? Hegelians? Kantians? German Romantics? Or, more likely, would it have been those who were apt at the methods of debate that he consistently portrayed Socrates using?

More was a totalitarian, too. I'm less clear on where you are getting that from Paine, though I am not doubting you.","1314837545"

In hindsight, the call for ARRA should have been ""We're in some shit, this will help, but we may need to engage in further fiscal policy measures as the situation dictates.""  

From a politics standpoint, tax breaks should not have been part of the original proposal at all.  They should have been given away to get Republicans on board, so the resultant package would be (a) essentially what the econ team wanted, and (b) bipartisan.","1314837554"

"books","t5_2qh4i","Well, 2010 was pretty good, so far 2061 kind of feels pointless.  Each book is a totally different storyline so if you expect them to be ""2001: Part II &amp; III"" then you'll be disappointed.  2001 is definitely the best overall IMO, but the other two are pretty good (once you're invested in the few connections in the story).  

Regarding ""The Gunslinger"", I really didn't like it TBH.  Everyone I know that has followed the series basically tells me what you did: it get's better.  I'm sure I'll read the next one at some point, but after the first one I was left feeling like ""Is that it?  Why all the hype?"".  I did like ""Under the Dome"", I'd just read ""The Stand - unabridged"" after reading the ""original"" when I was a teenager (and loving it) and thought ""Under the Dome"" was great.  Both books have very similar themes, but I found ""UtD"" to be more insular which was a nice take...

If you still feel uneasy about accepting the action ethically, and yet allow that circumstances matter, what you're really struggling with is the following:  While animal research is necessary to produce medical advances, are the medical advances themselves really necessary?

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Bringing up the question is one thing; hitting us in the face with your conclusions, lying and distorting the success of research so far, and using inflammatory and inaccurate language are not ""questioning,"" they're haranguing.

Many of us are thankful for the quality of life we live. We're glad we dont' die of the flu, of routine infections, of dysentery, and so on. We recognize that animal research has played a major role in all of this. We know that if it continues, our conditions will be much better in the future. Many of us, if it were our children faced with a life-threatening illness, would kill a dog, a rabbit, or a truckload of mice in order to save our own children. We would also do the same for someone else's child. We don't feel that it's our right to declare that this time, here and now, is the optimal level of health; future generations can suffer the same diseases we do, because we're done with animal research.

Every generation thinks they are the modern generation, and take lots of things for granted. We can't imagine how awful it would be to live in a time when half of our children die routinely of disease, and it's likely that future families will be glad they don't live in a time when it was relatively common to get diseases, some of which could actually kill a person.","1314837557"
"self","t5_2qh96","There are things that are actually known to be helpful for treating migraines. A lot of the time migraines are caused by problems with sleep/lightness/darkness and such, and caused by imbalances in the hormone melatonin. That's why it sucks so bad when you get bright light in your eyes during a migraine (because it breaks down melatonin even further).

Source: [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15945613). The [wiki on dark therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_therapy) has a decent amount of info too. [Light Therapy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy) in conjunction with Dark Therapy is also likely helpful (Light Therapy during the day, Dark Therapy at night). You can also simulate darkness at night by wearing [orange coloured UV blocking glasses](http://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S1933X-Eyewear-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B000USRG90/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1295933133&amp;sr=8-4) at night, and it's been proven to be very helpful for treating many mood disorders like bipolar disorder with no negative side effects.

The hormone [melatonin itself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin#Headaches) has also been shown to be helpful for migraines.

As have [magnesium citrate, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q10#Migraine_headaches) when used in conjunction.","1314837557"

O Lordy - I'd NEVER say that elementary is anywhere close to middle or secondary school teaching. If I mistakenly let that come across, then slap me and call me mama, 'cause it just ain't right. I consider those who are good with that age... like, REALLY good... to be geniuses, Watching really good ones is like watching Picasso work - it just seems so effortless. To have the right combination of positive, nurturing demeanor, solidly logical mind, and selflessness is just so rare - I've tried that age, and even on my best days I'm light years behind the true masters.

I wasn't suggesting that the misspelling was some sort of test for the students. I was suggesting that the misspelling was indicative of overall sloppiness on the teacher's part. For a student who (presumably) was between 1st and 6th grade, modeling and imitation are one of the primary ways of conveying information. The rules need to be consistently enforced, otherwise they won't be able to deduce what the rules are. Explicitly saying it once in 4th grade: ""you're means 'you are'"" isn't enough.","1314837559"

YES, I've had at least 8 to 12 clients with that setup, AT&amp;T + Netgear about 5 years ago, Including myself at home, and It was unbearable until I replaced the router with their own Netopias, then I solved like 80% of the problems.

in my house however, Everytime there was going to rain, I will know because the internet will go down 20 minutes before the rain.

Call AT&amp;T and ask them to send you one of their Netopia routers, the blue ones for business, everything will calm down most of the times... IF that doesn't work, switch to comcast.

Edit: after reading your edit's I realized they already swapped for netopia, well as I told you, if after that problem persists, switch to comcast or anotehr provide, as there is no solution to the AT&amp;T problem, I've had the same exact problem with over a dozen clients.","1314837560"

Apple has been turning off features from consumer products for *a decade*. This is nothing new. They commonly remove features because they are too ""difficult"" or ""confusing,"" although the actual truth tends to be that they give the user a bit more power than Steve wants. Lion is the epitome of that. You will do it how Steve wants you to do it and you will like it. You have no choice. Lion is here to stay, and Apple will make sure of that by forcing 10.6 into obsolescence within a year, like they have done with so much software already in the past. ","1314837578"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","If she's never had an orgasm it could be apprehension that she is simply incapable of having one and not wanting to ruin the sexual relationship between the two of you. I can't tell you the number of times I've seen women and men express the thought that if you don't know what gets you off and can't tell your partner what to do, you shouldn't complain or expect an orgasm or however you'd like to phrase it. I used to feel so bad when I read or heard something like that. ""People say orgasms are great, but I don't feel them! What does that mean for me?!"" Cue faking, since I believed I wasn't entitled to sexual pleasure.

Now that I can orgasm but there are months at a time where it's infrequent and hard, I still get insecure and feel like less of a woman but I realize that I'm still entitled to get the pleasure I give to my partner. I don't know if I want you to rub my clit or not - try it and we'll see. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I don't know if I need you to be romantic or dirty or hard or soft or fast or slow or if I want you to spin me upside down for god's sake until we try it. Unfortunately, a lot of guys can be really hurtful about it - further, a lot of *girls*. The most insecure I ever feel about this problem is in a room full of girls who are talking as though they're the shit because they can get themselves off and poor little girls who just can't figure it out. It's taken me a long time to realize that I know damn well how to touch myself and what I want, it just doesn't always end that way for me.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","we can play ""adult"" all day, but at the end there is still no way for me to explain enough times to you that the US and china express hostilities currently through currency exchange rates, and the manner in which labor is treated in either country, let alone the smaller states which get caught and divided in the middle of the conflict between the giants.

and the burden of proof is on you, if we are to follow general procedure.  I have claimed that through a divided (third party) culture, which was put at war for reasons of differing economic systems competing for global supremacy, that the us and china are waging a war of attrition against each other which play to the differences in their economic models, it's pretty clear, if you deny this is the case, then which part do you deny? why?

you have offered nothing, anything you've said has barely scratched the surface of what i'm talking about, and is generally completely superficial. I don't usually reply with a string of obscenities unless the person talking to me is obviously using deflection or similar tactics to avoid confronting the main issue, this is called ""being a bitch"", sorry if the mean words hurt your proper sensibilities, but in certain circles it is nothing to be offended by, and is common parlance for expressing the qualities which are quite apparent in your argument style.

at no point have you offered an opinion, or attempted to actually discuss the relevant portions of this dialogue, you have only taken apart my writing style and word usage, which is not the point of this debate, as I remember this was an issue of politics, not linguistics, not semantics, so get over yourself and offer an opinion, otherwise I will continue to dismiss your pathetic derision as what it is, off topic and a waste of time, you mirror the current political process in this country, always avoiding the issue for the sake of your fragile little sense of self worth.

I will not explain anything further until you offer a counter to the claim that the us and china are not currently engaging in (at least one) proxy war. use korea, what is that if not a proxy war? do the north and south have differing allies for instance? political systems? why would this be? if a north korean escapes to china they return them, but the south will not, why?  figure this one out bucko. If you can offer a counter, then just let me know, otherwise keep yammering, and i'll keep comin back at you till this is settled.","1314837583"

Your response has shown me all I need to know about how you would react in a situation like this. You'd bring your little pocket knife, get swarmed, pull it out and say something scary. You'd try to stand your ground, get blindsided, and then someone would stab you with your own knife and then beat the shit out of you. Trying to stand your ground and fight a group of idiots is a great way to find yourself in a hospital.

One should be allowed to make an intellectual argument with the regards to the details of an historic narrative without being tagged a racist.  That you would characterize Sailer's concern over the use of the words ""near annihilation"" to him being a ""Holocaust denier"" is utterly absurd.

You're being unfair, awfully cruel, and extraordinarily judgmental.  Your camp routinely denies the existence of a Palestinian identity, culture, history, etc.  How is this any less ""racist"" than saying ""I don't agree that Jews were nearly annihilated in Europe?""

I'm big on going against the current (or wind)  as hard as I can.   I'm not big on lakes, but it would be easy on a lake as well if you are into serious flatwater.

I also live near a river,  so a few times,  I've driven to the beginning,  paddled down to a 1/2 mile from my house, then portaged back to my house,  rested a bit, then took my bike back to the beginning from there.
 
I also bum rides from people often.   Just paddle till I'm tired and near a road, then get on the cellphone till someone is willing to come get me.  :)  Usually I pay with lunch or some suitable bribe.
 
 
I also have friends who I yak with who know I usually only ask them cause I want to spot cars with them.  hehe.  Since I go so often, I know all the good routes, so it's usually not hard to get someone to go with me.

I keep thinking Hollywood's penchant for a ""built-in"" audience will translate for video games as well, since gaming actually pulls in more revenue than movies, but it's probably licensing factors keeping producers at bay. Perhaps for the 2010s, the movie will become a game tie-in.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Well I've always had some degree of generalised anxiety in my life.  My girlfriend of four years left me (and the way she did was really a bitch move--lied to my face for months; don't really feel like going into details unless someone wishes to know) which exacerbated it.  Drugs, sex and music defined the first 8-10 months after I left her.  I eventually found an amazing girl that I am now currently in a relationship with, and I am slowly getting myself off the medication.

In a nutshell, my mind doesn't stop.  No matter where I am or what I'm doing, whether it's out with friends, grocery shopping, or trying to sleep--my mind keeps thinking about random things here and there.  I have had trouble sleeping since I was a child because of this.  I was diagnosed with ADHD before ADD/ADHD diagnoses became common.  I was also diagnosed with anxiety later on when I decided to see a psychiatrist.  All throughout my life I assumed that everyone else suffered from the same symptoms that I did; after speaking with some friends in the psychology fields and finally scheduling an appointment with my psychiatrist, I came to the realisation that my mind works differently.

Let's say I have to go out and pick up some groceries.  I know that I have to, I know that I have the means to, and I love food and cooking.  However, my mind will keep thinking about every single aspect of it--going out and possibly running into people that I don't want to see; having to *leave* my place where it's nice and comfortable...and then my mind will transition to thinking about little things that I need to do, i.e. laundry, homework, calling my parents, paying off a bill, cleaning my room; eventually my mind becomes some overwhelmed by every single thought that pops up into my mind and I can't bring myself to budge.

Oh, I also get panic attacks on occasion.  They suck but since I have researched a lot of neuroscience, when I do get one, I can calm myself down knowing that it will pass eventually.  Unfortunately I cannot do the same with bouts of severe anxiety.","1314837599"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Worked a shitty part-time job for two years. I did what was asked of me, but the work was meaningless and no one seemed to pay much attention to or care what I did. I half-assedly looked for other better jobs, applying to maybe one a week. My parents started forwarding me job listings from Monster and craigslist. Toward the end, I barely bothered driving to the office - maybe 3 days a week if they were lucky. Some weeks, I didn't go in at all. 

One day, my boss popped in to the little room where my newest desk was (I'd been moved 4 times) and asked if he could speak with me. I thought for sure I was getting sacked. He took me into an office, closed the door, and told me to sit down. Then he said, ""Do you want a full time position?""

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;...the universe either was created by chance activation or after the remains of a previous universe's Big Crunch....The problem is, the event is SO UNLIKELY that it is near illogical to measure.

I see nothing unlikely about either of these propositions. Postulating an extra entity on top of this does not seem to be necessary.

However...

Occam's Razor says to not multiply entities beyond *necessity.* If we take the *principle of universal explanation*, which we assume all the time throughout science, then it would follow that the universe (meaning all time, space, energy, and physical laws) has an explanation as well. And, necessarily, that explanation would have to be something *other than* space, time, energy, and physical laws. I.e., something we might term ""supernatural"" if that word did not have so much baggage associated with it.

Is this a necessary entity? If not, then we have to specially plead that the universe is the *one thing* not subject to the principle of universal explanation. Why? Why does that get to be immune from it? On the other hand, if we don't specially plead for the universe, then it is necessary (and hence no violation of Occam) to keep going.

Why isn't the universe the stopping point? Because it's highly likely that it is contingent: there are many logically possible universes (or anything, really) that could have been in its place. This strongly suggests that there is ""more."" If not, then the universe is magically the one thing free of the principle of universal explanation.","1314837621"

There are a lot of reasons why the government gives licenses:

1) Filters out the people who are not serious from those who are. Only those willing to go through the process are allowed to breed cats, so they are more inclined to do it properly.

2) They become qualified to do it. They learn what to do and what not to do and the government makes sure they have the proper resources to do it well.

3) Accountability. With a license, the government can monitor you and make sure you aren't abusing the animals or doing anything irresponsible. 

It's not about the people, it's about the animals. They are living creatures that can feel emotion and pain. They are innocent and need us to take care of them. People abuse them all the fucking time one way or another. It is not a human right to be able to do whatever the fuck you want with other living things.

Wait, you became less of a Rarity fan from reading a fanfiction? I apologize, but that seems rather silly to me, though I admit I can't say much because for awhile there, I disliked Pinkie Pie because of Cupcakes, but I've gotten over Cupcakes and I happen to really like Pinkie Pie again. I happen to enjoy both character, despite some fanfiction because that's what fanfiction is, fiction. The characters wouldn't really do those things, the stories came from the authors minds.

But like I said, I can't say much because I did the exact same thing and I can see where you're coming from, but once I got over it I realized that it was a bit silly.

versus having her EAT it, which has an entirely different metabolic pathway....oh and when you say 'testosterone' which type are you talking about? It's a VERY broad category of hormones with a broad range of effects. This is why I get so annoyed with food 'purity moralities'.

&gt; ""Regular treatments of any levels of any chemical effects the organism taking them.""

No. It doesn't. I can drink vitamin c until I piss every hour on the hour but it will have no more effects on me. Mega doses of vitamin c has almost zero effects beyond the daily dosage requirements...why? because our bodies process and use only the amount we need and the rest passes right through. Hence why you piss orange. You can have effects when you take levels so insanely high that your body can't pass it out as waste, but those are levels most people will never come close to (most people never go above 50,000% of the daily dosage....and they still see no effects).

&gt; ""Hormone levels dictate your musculature and fat distribution, they turn on your breasts and they can increase or decrease body hair growth.""


Yes. YOUR hormone levels do this. So? What does this have to do with consuming a compound that can be broken down with ** saliva**.

&gt; ""You can make a calf breeding-ready, I really don't think humans are somehow special in that regard.""

We are not, but the compounds involved are different, processed metabolically differently, and lastly when you *do* give these hormones to cows in the usage levels which are considered normal (and effort is made to make it hard to overdose animals) the levels detected in random samples when it gets to the consumption stage is **within normal levels**.

It's like you're arguing that blueberries are bad for you because you have seen people eating blueberry flavored candy and those people tend to be fat.

That is a lot of anecdotal references and bad connecting logic man. I'm not trying to be rude about this (This is just my normal level of rudeness), but there is basically no science that would suggest that hormones in food is causing earlier pubescent onset. There *is* plenty of evidence that this is caused by better nutrition.

The whole scare over bgh was in relation to a claim that Puerto Rican girls in a single school in the 1980's where growing breasts at an early age. The CDC did tests on the meat in the lunch room and found one sample that had slightly high levels of an estrogen type compound, this was within normal levels though (the cow might have been a milk cow that died during birth for example. we rarely use these cows now for food but it was rather common in Puerto Rico at the time).

What they failed to mention in the subsequent news storm was the science that indicated that this was perfectly safe, the science of why they used bgh....but they felt perfectly justified in mentioning the estrogen like compound that **was** phased out of use in the 1970's after it was shown to have a slight link to cervical cancer. IE, news doing what news normally does to science stories. Fucking it up.

Later the CDC tested samples in 1985, and found *one* sample of fish (fucking FISH!) that had slight levels of one of the hormones used....but subsequent testing showed this was in error. Again...the news broke the story of 'hormones causing big breasts'. Further those Puerto Rican girls....this was right after new laws changed the nutrition levels they where receiving.

Bottom line. We need more testing in the food industry, we need more research into this shit, and you should be curious about what goes into your food. But the food you eat and have access to is plentiful and full of what your body needs and wants. that's the most serious problem currently. We have great access to the stuff we like because we haven't had access to it as easily in our evolutionary history. But the things we should be focusing on (like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, fish) are getting pushed to the side for access to ever easier packaged fatty meat and carb foods.

It's like worrying about a possible splinter as you saw a leg off. America's food hysteria is mind numbing once you start investigating specific claims. ","1314837647"

Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.

The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?

But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.

They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.

Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.

They share filehandles, all data, and various other things from their context, like the current working directory (Speaking from a unix POV here, I have little/no experience with windows), so if you do something wrong in one thread, the rest will very likely go down as well. So they might not be so well-suited if you're building an architecture where you want reliability, like a webserver, where one request handler does not affect the rest in any way. With modern operating systems, the overhead for creating a new process is not that important anymore, usually, since there are a bunch of optimizations applied (like COW), but if you spawn them fast, it might still matter. What really matters a lot in practice IME, however, is the overhead of data-sharing, which can really kill your performance (Even with threads it's not necessarily trivially solved, and one has to be very careful.) But on the other hand, if you're building the kind of application where throughput and latency of data-sharing is non-critical, using processes will encourage you to do it in an arguably ""better"" way, like through serializing your data through a FIFO or something like that -- which you can then later on more easily extend to actually work over several computers, if you want to parallellize that way.","1314837652"

Technology is evolution, and hindering it's expanse is hindering our evolution as a species. 
I agree that harming animals is terrible, and any cosmetic companies that test on animals should be dismantled, or forced to change their way of doing things. 
BUT, I personally believe that the benefits are to great to be overlooked on certain aspects of animal testing. Eventually, as I've seen in arguments from many people already, we can forgo these tests through algorithmic functions, and other types of computer testing, but currently we cannot reproduce fully real numbers beyond a preliminary stage through these means.

* A programming language
* An idea how to receive real-time input in your language (google: *language* game input)
* An idea how to set up a loop that'll run every X milliseconds in your language, or a loop that says how much time has passed since last loop (google: *language* timing loop)
* An idea how to display graphics with your language (google: *language* graphics, or *language* game graphics)

You don't need to worry about which language or library is best.  The best language is one you know.  You know Python?  Pygame will probably handle all your needs from the above, but if you don't like it, there are others.  Until recently I didn't use a game library for my games at all!

From there:

* Set up an ""init"" function for the starting conditions of your game
* Set up a ""redraw"" function that will render your game
* Set up a ""main loop"" function that calls redraw every frame
* Create a ""game object"" class with things like x/y/speed/health as needed for your game
* Add a ""step"" method that makes a game object update itself for a frame, such as incrementing position by speed
* Add a ""draw"" method that makes a game object output a representation of itself to the screen
* Create an array of game objects in init
* Loop through all game objects in main loop, and call their do step methods
* Loop through all game objects in redraw, and call all their draw methods
* Create extensions for your game object class that contain more specific types of game objects
* Create an extension of your game object class that reads player input and responds to it, and use that for your player
* Add things like object death (hide it or remove it from the game object list), per-frame game logic, victory conditions, defeat conditions, and whatever else your game needs

Some of the above advice is a little old-fashioned but it all still works and it'll get you up to speed with what you might actually be looking for libraries to do for you.  ","1314837661"

Regardless:
Modern physics present evidence against 1, 2, and 3 - basically quantum theory allows for the vacuum (i.e., nothing) to produce stuff (i.e., not nothing) though random variation on small scales.  The same theory predicts basic things like the properties of the electron very well, so we have good reason to believe that it's at least a good approximation of how things *really* are.

4: well, there is an absolute zero temperature, so the heat example doesn't work any more.  But I don't agree with the assertion that absolute good / evil have to exist to be able to judge whether something / someone is better / worse than another.  Five is bigger than four regardless of whether or not there is a ""biggest"" number.

5: Isn't assuming that natural bodies have some goal a pretty drastic assumption?  I'm not very good with philosophy though, so I'm wary of immediately throwing this one out due to its being unfalsifiable (I usually hear people griping about how falsifiability as a criterion is itself unfalsifiable or something?).

That may seem like nitpicking, but it's not; what the demon says changes the universe physically, in some way.  It affects sound waves.  The atoms around him would be different if he said ""apple"" instead of ""banana"".  It physically affects the universe, and therefore can be tested, (even if not probable).  

But since qualia is basically a ""raw feel"", that really can't be tested.  I guess it depends on how you define qualia, though.  If it's an emergent property of structure of a part of the brain (for example, people who see red things as my blue have a similar architecture in region X), then thats kinda different, but I feel as though that isn't really what qualia implies.  It is a very confusing term.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia

Ultimately I'd accept anything that can be phrased scientifically.  Not so much ""what if my red is your blue"" but more like ""Will my reactions to red things resemble your reactions to blue things"".  Or something like that.  Something we can physically test.

&gt;Now consider this: The universe was molded and developed EXACTLY like we think (""how""), but the only difference is such action was ignited by a Creator (""why""). This chance is more likely in almost all logical devices, Occam's Razor most prominent.

Why is this more likely than the end of a previous universe sparking the arising of a new one?

&gt;Now, it is possible that these events happened. There is no opposing that. The problem is, the event is SO UNLIKELY that it is near illogical to measure.

I think they're about all equally unlikely.  But interestingly, Hindu and Buddhist cosmology have held that the universe starts after the end of a previous one for longer than Christianity has been around, and longer than people have been studying physics and deep space astronomy in any depth.

There's a few big logical problems with a Creator God starting up the universe -- namely, what created God?

If something created God, then what created that? Turtles all the way down.

But if God was uncaused, then (s)he is beyond cause and effect, so how could God cause anything?

In other words, if God creates the universe, then God is now different having created the universe -- God must have done something to create it, and I think we can argue that a God that created a universe and a God that didn't are different -- but that means God is not beyond cause and effect,  because creating the universe had the effect of changing God.","1314837674"

take my case, for example.  I've always been fat.  @ 5'7"", I was clocking in just over 240 lbs.  I didn't want to be fat any more.  My new years resolution this year was to loose weight.   Time to stop making excuses, and just do it!  I've now lost 60lbs since jan 1, and am feeling better.

Wasn't my choice. I agree with you on the unhelpful way it abstracts away from the true nature of the Web and I would not recommend it for students. On the other hand, I still choose to use is when I consult for myself, for sites with light to medium functionality it is a powerful framework and highly productive. I see it being replaced by MVC over time. One thing I'd like to point out: I can produce Web Forms apps with really clean HTML because I know what I'm doing (example: using a ListView over a nested GridView!). At the end of the day, it's a tool which can be used wisely - it's all down to the developer and the way he/she chooses to leverage it for the particular job at hand...

It's a pretty meager existence. People on welfare don't like being on welfare. Everyone wants to better themselves. Everyone wants to be able to afford a car and a house, it's just the jobs aren't there. I've spent 3 months one time looking for a job. I happened to be living with a roommate with a trust fund though, so I got lucky and didn't need to go on welfare. If I didn't though, I would be living in a park getting rained on at that point. 3 months of going out every single day at 7AM, handing out at least 20 resumes per day, and it took 2 months, 3 weeks to find a minimum wage job. This happens. This is real. This is something that people have to face every single day. That's what welfare is for, it's not a fucking vacation spa where you sit back and live for free off someone else's hard work, it's a safety net that you pay into your entire life, and if you need it, it's there for you to get back on your feet.

The idea is to secure the end users card data, and to put security controls in place around business practices so they are not done outside of any controls.

You know and I know that on some occasions developers run live cards through their test environment to perform that last modicum of testing, that you can not DO in testing. not all emulated response of other sandboxes are accurate.

So instead of acting like we do not do this, we will put additional controls around the practice, such as no end users card data, which we do not have access to anyway, would ever go through our testing environments. Only the companies own live dedicated testing cards, can be used for this purpose.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","I really don't want to scare you, so please, don't be scared by my following comment(s)

(BTW I'm a senior in high school and I get the scary of the top of the food chain sort of thing. So damn weird O_O)

8th grade was a ROUGH year for me. Some combination of the hormones and the egos from being top of the food chain creates a mess. People are dicks, people are assholes. Middle schoolers are just angsty bitches.  At least, that's how it was for me in my school (obviously, all schools are different). I was also bored out of my mind in that grade, which didn't help. 

So you should know that, no matter if people act like super big assholes (it could go either way, I obviously don't know you or your thang), it gets WAY better after. Like, so much. Especially if you're merging with other schools. 

Okay, done with the scaring now, super sorry if I freaked you out. My intent was that, even if shit sucks in 8th grade, it'll get better, trust me :) Don't let it get ya down. People are dumb bitches a lot of the time, they're just trying to be cool and it's not worth  getting involved with those sorts of people cause they're just trying to knock you down.

On a separate note, I know a bunch of people who said 8th grade was the BEST year of their pre-high school experience, so (as stated multiple times) it really depends on your environment. 

My other piece of wisdom is that, if there's possibility for friendship, go for it. Obviously don't like, try too hard, but don't be afraid to have a chat with other people who you're friendly with, especially if you have class with them when you didn't before. Just chatting is a good way to establish friendships. I get ya, I'm super antisocial as well (always have been), but usually if I find a mutual interest (namely television show) with someone, I could talk for hours. It's good to practice those skills now so when you move on to high school, where you'll probably meet new people, then you have a small mastery of the art. 

Also, after-school activities. If there's any that strike your interest that you're not involved in yet, do it! Why not! This is your last year to try new things in middle school. I made new friends through doing theater and had an absolute blast when I did math club during middle school (our math club was really lame, we lost at every meet and most of us only went for the snacks. But hell, it was fun). 

So that's my advice. 

OH one last thing. If you don't have a work ethic yet, get one. I had shit work ethic in middle school (as stated earlier, MAD bored, classes were far too easy) and it screwed me in high school. I'd probably be getting straight A's if I had a work ethic, but I don't, so I get B's. If you can work on that NOW rather than later, it'll be awesome in the future. Get used to studying and doing homework when you get home (rather than after dinner or whatever) because those habits are a FANTASTIC thing to have.


Kay, I'm done.
Lemme know if I'm totally off base in everything. Obviously, I don't live your life so I don't know what your school or your life is like.

EDIT: this is way too long, super sorry about that. I ramble XD","1314837701"

"AnimalRights","t5_2qhtg","&gt; You did post a link claiming it encapsulated the ""full impact of meat &amp; dairy production,"" did you not? So, yes, you did indeed lump all consumers of meat (and dairy) into the same group.

There is some nuance to the argument I'm making. Let me try to clarify: You made an unfair and meaningless comparison between an irresponsible vegan consumer and a responsible omnivorous consumer. I am saying that the reasonable way to consider the issue is to assume the individual has an equal level of responsibility to either diet. Alternatively we could look at average level of responsibility between vegans and omnivores, however I doubt that would come out in favour of the omnivores. So, this is one aspect of the argument.

The other aspect is that **farmed animals eat farmed food**. I gave you the wiki article as a general overview to communicate this concept, not to establish the precise impact of *every* omnivore. Farmed animals eat far more of this farmed food to produce meat/milk/eggs than if we'd just eaten the food directly, so the impact of the omnivorous diet (in terms of the farmed grain/barley/corn) is far higher.

I really hope you grasp this soon, because it's becoming tedious.

You keep talking about the ""moral high ground"", and claiming that this is what I'm attempting to claim. I've never claimed this in the entire discussion, so it's tedious that you continue to harp on about it. Morality is relative, so if someone has a different moral system that is not about minimising suffering, then there is no way to compare or establish low/high ground. It's pointless talking in those terms, it only serves to make it look like you're trying to paint me as elitist. Let's talk about the issue in terms of what matters: minimisation of suffering.","1314837702"

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","Great Question! :D Here are some songs I think fit the houses pretty well, in my very, very humble opinion: 

**Gryffindor:** This one is seemingly easy: [""Courage""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw2DocjFG5w) by Manowar. It's pretty much the anthem for Gryffindor (propaganda...) with lyrics such as "" Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe"". But, on the flip side, I would point to Voltaire's [""Crusade""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQLEjBUU9kI) to show what I always thought to be the other potential of Gryffindor. This song reminds me of the dangers of blind courage and bravery. It's very reminiscent of the concept of ""for the greater good"" and all the misery that caused.  

**Ravenclaw:** I ALWAYS thought Johnathan Coulton's [""Mendelbrot Set""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ES-yKOYaXq0) fit Ravenclaw because it's so deliciously nerdy. I know a couple of Ravenclaws (all math and science majors...) and they love this song because it's an upbeat song and vocalizes all the awesomeness that is knowledge. Best line: ""I hate the Peano Space and the Koch Curve/ 
I fear the Cantor Ternary Set And the Sierpinski Gasket makes me want to cry."" 

**Hufflepuff:** I choose Get Set Go's surprisingly cheery [""Die Motherfucker Die""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hci2kZ8DlJM). Ok, so ever since I learned the qualities of Hufflepuff, I couldn't help but think of them as powder kegs, poised to go off at any moment. I mean, come on, those poor guys are CONSTANTLY getting the short end of the straw, but are expected to just bare it with a grin! If there is another Dark Lord, I wouldn't for a SECOND be surprised if s/he were a Hufflepuff. Best line:  ""Cause I, I'm having a bad day/So get out of my way/Or you will pay and you'll pay with your Life.""

**Slytherin:** I don't know why, but I find Marina and the Diamonds' [""Oh No""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1t77mkzVko) to be appropriate. There are several parts of the song that touch on topics such as the ends justifying the means; knowing exactly what your goals are; and holding yourself up higher than warranted or deserved. But, as the title would suggest, the song also muses that perhaps the aforementioned qualities might not be as completely beneficial. Best line: ""Maybe it is all a test: 'Cause I feel like I'm the worst, so I always act like I'm the best.""  

Anyway, that's just my two cents on the subject. :) These songs are by no means the most perfect match, but they are the ones that I associate with each house. Until I find more music, anyway! ","1314837724"

"gamernews","t5_2sc3f","&gt;Thing is though, there's a fairly finite amount of discussion you can have about LoL. 


&gt;In my opinion, memes are a necessary evil for a successful (general) gaming community.

I agree that the amount of discussion you can have is finite on r/leagueoflegends but this is not an excuse to let memes, rage comics and rants about Elo hell infest the subreddit. When there is no new content to submit there is a very simple thing to do: submit nothing. Do people complain that other LoL fan sites don't post news every minute? Do people complain that LoL Youtube channels don't upload a video every half an hour? If not then why should we expect r/leagueoflegends to get a new post on the front page if it contributes nothing of substance? And it is unlikely the existing members would just unsubscribe if they felt that the content is worthwhile.

Of course, you could argue that allowing memes would contribute to the growth and popularity of the subreddit significantly. But would you really want new members whose only intention is to turn your subreddit into r/pics and r/f7u12? In my opinion, the only solution is to create rules and regulations about what is allowed to be submitted and how to comment not unlike r/gamernews. But I fear that r/leagueoflegends is beyond saving and a new subreddit needs to be made.","1314837724"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","NOTE: I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. If you want legal advice, go to a lawyer. Gun laws vary wildly from state to state within the US, and even more so from country to country.

Assuming you don't want to give the gun back to them, you need a way to dispose of it. Giving it to the cops is probably not an option due to its illegality.

First things first: It needs to be made unloaded and mechanically disabled. Find someone who can safely and carefully unload/ensure the gun is unloaded for you. Don't try this yourself unless you have both gun safety training, and/or prior experience with this specific make and model of gun. This is not worth shooting yourself in the head over.

Once the gun has been unloaded and made safe to handle, figure out how to disassemble it. Disassemble it, and bury the parts somewhere wet. The theory being that you want them to rust and get ruined beyond all usability. Make sure nobody can tell by looking where they're buried. Or your mom/dad/the police can just dig them up.

You can also hide the parts (separately), and throw them out a month apart. The theory here being, they'll get taken to the dump in separate runs, and buried in entirely separate layers of garbage. Wrap the gun parts in newspaper and/or put them in a small box with newspaper padding so the garbage man won't see them and think ""hey neat - what's this?""

You don't want to toss the whole gun at once, because someone might pick it out of the garbage and then have a gun that belonged to you. Which will be a problem when they murder someone and the police come looking for you.

I suggest disassembly and then burying in wet soil, or throwing away in pieces a month apart, because these are the two most universal and easily implementable options. But there are others...

You can acquire thermite and cast the pieces into solid blocks of iron. This is about a sure a way to make them unusable as you can get. The only better way would be to melt them down, and most of us don't have access to metal smelting furnaces hot enough to melt the steel that most modern guns are made of.

You can take the wooden parts (if any) off and throw the metal parts into deep water. Deep salt water is especially good. Mud bottom is excellent. When I say ""deep"" I mean 150 ft (50m) or deeper - deep enough that a recreational scuba diver won't accidentally find them. Below about 130 ft you tend to need special air supplies, so most scuba divers won't dive deeper than that.

You can destroy them mechanically, by cutting them up with a hacksaw and a special blade designed to cut strong metals. I'd recommend a motorized tool for this, as doing it with a hand hacksaw may take a long, long time and leave you really sore... and tempted to not finish the job properly.

A welder's cutting torch can be used to ""cut"" them up as well, but it's difficult to get access to this and anyone who does let you play with their cutting torch is probably going to watch you carefully (lest you injure yourself and sue them), and ask some difficult questions when you pull out gun parts and start cutting them up.

If you have access to [an industrial shredder,](http://www.ssiworld.com/watch/engine_blocks.htm) toss the parts in there and watch it shred.

Etc.","1314837728"

&gt; Parry and Dodge are still valuable stats and should not be neglected. The way you prioritize one over the other, however, isn't perfectly obvious. The short answer is that Parry is better than Dodge due to the Hold the Line talent, but diminishing returns discourage you from ignoring Dodge entirely. Against a single mob with a normal attack speed, there exists a ""sweet spot"" ratio of Parry:Dodge which you should strive for. **Here is a graph made by swcarden which illustrates the ideal ratio depending on your character's Mastery rating and combined Parry/Dodge ratings.**

"PHP","t5_2qh38","The two features have completely divergent use-cases, once you think about it.

**Interfaces establish a contract** - If class Foo implements interface IBar, then all that's happening is that client code knows for sure that Foo implements whatever IBar says it has to.  The interface provides **zero implementation**.

**Abstract classes provide implementation, enabling polymorphism** if Foo extends an abstract class Bar, Foo inherits all of Bar's functionality.  Baz can extend Bar too, and then Foo and Baz will share some common implementation details (those defined by Bar).  

As you note, PHP doesn't have multiple inheritance.  If you go around using abstract classes in place of interfaces, you're likely to run into trouble when you later decide you need to refactor your code and actually need an abstract base class.  

One way to think about it, in order to keep things straight:

* Inheriting from an abstract class means **Foo is a variety of Bar**

* Foo implementing Bar means **Foo acts like a Bar**

Spiders regenerate legs if they lose them, but only if they lose them before their last molt (if they lose them after they're fully developed, that's it, no new legs will grow).  The earlier they lose a leg, the more similar it will be to the size of the other legs.  I.e., if they lose a leg right before their last molt, the new leg will be small.  I'm guessing this one lost that leg early on and had several molts since then, since the difference is not that dramatic.  I think it's interesting I seem to see a lot of fishing spiders like this.

The way I feel for my bear is that I did my work before hand.

on my pali my mind set is more I got my sword I got my shield and i got my tin-can armor. While I'm fighting I feel like I'm building up power and releasing it one way or another to get the boss down or keep my party members alive. I feel like I'd be to busy to be silly like a bear. I don't have a problem with that I like that variation. its why I have two tank toons.

You have to remember bear tanks are crazy; we don't have armor, we dont have weapons. we have our faces and claws, we are going wild when we're in a fight. Paladins are more centered and controlled sending their convictions into their weapons and releasing it upon the enemy. 

let me put it another way. its like comparing Daft Punk vs Bach, some people like one and some like the other and even fewer people like both. Both are music and they provide the same thing (enjoyment). Now lets say that you have to use the same strict rules of classical music when making a daft punk song.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At the end of my junior year of college, I lived in an apartment complex that, due to its location, was mainly inhabited by students. Apparently, the day before the last day of finals I was the only poor sap that actually had one the next morning, because the apartment below me decided to hold a loud, music booming, girls screaming, end of the semester party. It may also be worth mentioning here, that because there was no AC, I generally slept with the windows open. 

Now, I am not an incredibly confrontational person. If people are annoying me, I tend to grumble to myself and get very angry, but never actually let them know. However, seeing as I had a final at seven-thirty the next morning, and it was eleven thirty (or later) at night, I decided that I had to do *something* or I was never going to be able to sleep. So I climbed out of bed, went to the window, and slammed it as hard as I could. I then returned to bed, hoping that 1) they had heard the slam and would maybe quiet down a little, or at least turn their music down, and 2) that closing the window would block the sound out a little. No such luck. Now I'm beyond irrationally angry, so I climb out of bed and go to bang on the window. However, before my fist could actually hit the glass, the window literally *exploded*.

I blinked at it, looked at my still raised fist, examined my hand for scratches, and then further examined the window to see if something hit it from the outside. Nothing. On the other hand, I was so bewildered, and by this point incredibly tired from getting so angry, that I was able to return to bed and sleep through the party.

Tl;dr I made glass explode without touching it...or singing.","1314837778"

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","&gt;[...]one of the things I’ve always found is that you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backwards for the technology”. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to try to sell it.

&gt;It started with : What incredible benefits can we bring to the customer?  Where can we take the customer?” Not starting with “Let’s sit down with the engineers and figure out what awesome technology we have and then how are we going to market that?” And I think that’s the right path to take.

To me, seeing dozens of games an apps coming out, the largest number of them going after newer and better technology and more often than not gimmicky mechanics that *don't hold up as an experience*, this is an incredibly important idea - and a ripe one for discussion given that it's in many ways against the grain.

&gt;You don't have to know anything about what's in the box, all we have to do is hold this up and go ""do you want this?""

This is an incredibly important point for apps, where the market is competitive and despite the number of people saying ""a good game will sell itself"" and the other half generally falling into the trap of listing the specs and the less-relevant features and very seldom do you see a game where it's obvious that you need to get it.  The last original title I can remember that sold itself on just the game itself was....patapon, with Minecraft and Limbo in a sort-of halfway category.  Also ripe for discussion.

If this stuff is a 'huge stretch' while 'i released an app today' (with little or no discussion) is kosher here, i'm not really clear on what Gamedev is all about.  If this were a strictly technical subreddit i'd understand, but I see too many far-longer stretches to really believe that's the case, and I see many, many discussions of methodologies and mentalities which I would consider this well, well within.  I've seen your posts around would respect your opinion : do you still feel that this is too far removed from the intention of the subreddit?  Would it have been improved by a self-posting with the above quote pulled out for discussion?  Is it just not what folks feel like talking about?

I'm not trying to make this subreddit into something it isn't, i'm just curious as to why it's an apparently controversial post (5 up, 4 down in a few hours) but there's no discussion yet, not even flaming it, which is an interesting scenario.","1314837779"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Better example:

A lot of major cities around the world have large populations of pigeons. These populations are many times larger than a natural population due to the lack of predators in the cities (which we caused). The populations are so large, that the health of the overall population is lower than it otherwise would be. If you have ever seen a swarm of these rats, in areas where people don’t feed them, they are disease ridden and starving. With larger populations, disease can spread at higher rates, and available food resources become stressed. Because of our interference with nature we have caused unnaturally large populations of pigeons to exist, and for a significant number of them to suffer from disease and starvation. Because these large populations are a nuisance, these cities attempt to control the population through artificial means because of the lack of natural deaths. YOU are the activist who protests the cities attempts to control the populations because you think it is cruel. YOU are actively trying to prolong the suffering the population of a species because if your misguided morality which was also caused by YOU from interfering with nature. Congratulations, your twisted morality makes it perfectly fine in your world to kill off predators because you don’t like them, and then prolong the suffering of others because you do like them. When, if you would just stop screwing with nature, there would be less suffering and everything could live in natural harmony.

If you want to see how deep the rabbit hole goes in your attempt to convince me that my morality is wrong. I hate anyone who believes that human lives are superior to that of any other living creature on this planet, and places more value in them. I would put as much effort into saving a human from chocking to death as I would saving a deer stuck in mud. I am also equally against the curing of diseases like small pox as I am against the killing of predators because their prey is cute or useful. Saving a large number of lives by getting rid of a small number of causes does not always have the outcome you want or expect.

Second: If you disregard something central, you need to provide reasons for why you are doing it:

&gt;They're modeled only nominally on Judeo-Christian mythology

So we should basically ignore the fact about every supernatural thing in NGE borrows its name from Judeo-Christian mythology? Why? Oh, right:

If you're talking about any loved one, then no I don't still love them. They don't exist anymore. I love the memory of them and remember fondly. There seems to be a major difference between this true love you speak of and loving your family or friends.

I'd rather not waste time pondering if the person I was with before, now or in the future was/is/will be true love. The likelihood that there is a true love out of billions of people that exist now and those who did or haven't yet is too large a number to even fathom in such a short lifetime. I suppose what you speak of is fluffy romantic love. I do think it's silly to risk another relationship, for all you know that feeling is fleeting.

It isn't a matter of how true or strong the love is for a couple to stay together. It's hard work to have a great relationship. Love comes easy when you figure that out. In the end, life is chaotic and all during this unordered mess some of us are lucky enough take part in each other's lives at perfect times. I think that's more beautiful than true love.","1314837790"

Tells her that if I'm not welcome in the house for how I treat women, then their relationship may as well end now. 

I just left. She's ok with me know. Kind of. I think it was a bit of a shock to her that many (probably most) men are ok with paying for sex. She sees it as rape for money.

Sure, we ""can"" consider patterns to be anything we want. We can consider past configurations of ourselves to be a banana too. Different labels (e.g. ""dead"" vs ""banana"") convey different connotations, but that's basically all that labels are good for. You're not really ""learning"" anything new when you choose to label something as ""dead"". Instead, you should focus on what information it is that you're actually seeking (e.g. ""does 'murder is morally bad' imply 'teleportation is morally bad'?"") and try to directly seek that information, rather than misleading yourself by arguing about labels.","1314837813"

I have been looking for an old school piece of cast iron at the thrift stores, but havent found one yet.  The two best ways to cook beef, in my opinion, are on a wood fire grill, or on cast iron.  I like a steak Pittsburgh style on cast iron and blackened, with some caramelized onions and some decent blue cheese crumbled on top.   Maybe a roasted red pepper and smoked gouda mash with that.
  As far as my knives, I sharpen them with a rod guided system (edgepro) that is kind of a pain in the ass to use, so I dont do it very often...  I try instead to keep my knife from getting dull by not raking it across cutting boards, and by using fulcrum cutting technique rather than chopping.  Also I dont go crazy on the sharpening steel like caricature chefs always do.  I use a small ceramic rod to bring the edge back as needed.
  My kitchen tends to get greasy as fuck because I have no vent hood in this dump, so grease hangs in the air and drips down the walls.  I splatter shit everywhere when I saute.  Its a mess.  
  Most of my spices come from Big Lots (cheapest around) and they are not the best quality, but frugal is my game at the moment.  I use a lot of southwestern flavors...

Like the other posts, the most beneficial part of wow was the bracelet and night life.  HOWEVER, I'm getting the feeling that the police are going to crack down HARD this year.  You can no longer have a party at Mustang Appts past 10 pm without a permit ($), so the Popo are going to focus on house parties.  Also with the history of Wow week, the issues at Greek parties recently (and one house getting kicked off campus), I feel like the night life will lack considerably in comparison to years past.

Tl;dr-You have a good chance to make a lot of friends at Wow, night life might suck.  ","1314837836"

Don't do ANYTHING that involves reaching or stretching for about a month.  This includes driving, by the way.  You can't turn your head far enough to see oncoming traffic and turning the wheel...ouch.  I was feeling pretty good after a month...until I did laundry one day.  I paid for that with hours of pain after.

Longer term...I was one of the unfortunate 1 in 250 that sustained nerve damage from the surgery.  My voice is still froggy sounding (although better than it was at first), occasionally it cuts out altogether...lips move, but no sound.  Another ""fun"" side-effect of the nerve damage is that my throat can't always tell if I'm drinking or breathing.  I choke...a lot!

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You might want to add to that question. For example, when did the observed temperature start to climb?  (answer, just after the coldest date in the Little Ice Age, or around 1650).  What was the level of CO2 at that time?  (answer: around 300 ppm).  When did human caused CO2 emissions rapidly increase, thus causing global warming?  (answer: about 1946).  

Why do we only consider temperatures form 1865 to current?  because reliable thermometers were only invented about 130 years ago.  Does that mean we have no idea what temperature the world was?  No, it doesn't.  So, if the temperatures climbed rapidly between 1910 and 1945, then fell slightly between then and 1975, just when the CO2 emissions really got going,  why do we blame CO2?

There's no correlation between CO2 levels and temperature during the 1850 to 1910 period, (relatively stable CO2, rapidly rising and falling temperature) and a negative correlation between CO2 and temperature between 1946 and 1976 (climbing CO2 and falling temperature).  There does seem to be a good correlation between CO2 and temperature between 1979 and 1998, but that's only a 20 year period.  Since then, we've had ever more rapidly climbing emissions and stable temperatures.

The entire argument is that CO2 *can* cause temperature increase, and we have seen a general increase, therefore CO2 *must be* responsible for it.  

Even if additional CO2 is adding some increased temperature effect, (which it probably is) the effect of each additional percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere does less to warm the atmosphere than the one before it.  It's a logarithmic progression. 

The entire religion of global warming is dependent upon a ""tipping point"" where other effects take over and it's no longer about CO2, but about other effects. Without those other effects, no one would care about the effects of CO2.

Too many people are falling back on the statement that ""Scientists"" say it's true, therefore anyone who says otherwise is an idiot.  They fail to understand that science isn't done by popular vote.  Not *every* scientist agrees with the theory of Catastrophic Anthropogenic Climate Change.  Some say it's much ado about nothing.

The fact that the core scientists involved are not even willing to make a testable prediction says a lot to me.  The non-scientific ""projections"" they've put in so far have all been completely wrong for the last dozen years, and don't look like their going to ever be right.

Definitely come back via the Grampians, and if you pass through Hamilton, there's a really nice cafe called Gillies (or Gilly's  - can't remember) on Grey Street.

I second the mention of Fairhaven beach as easily the best beach along the coast - easy to spot - leave Airey's, cross the bridge and when you can see the house on a stilt, you're at Fairhaven. There are also some old volcano lakes on the Hamilton highway between Lake Bolac and I guess Colac, but if you take the Grampians road home, you'll be too far north (but pick the Grampians over the volcanoes if you've got the choice)

There's also some nice detours to make - Erskine Falls when you are in Lorne, the dirt road to Bambra from Airey's Inlet etc, but some of the really fun tracks are probably best enjoyed in a 4WD.

Then when it gets *really* tight, that truck you've been nurturing through the hard times, while he's promising to scratch your back when prices rise will turn around and stab you in the back, and demand $5/mile! The produce guys will be going crazy. Do they still call the produce section Compton? They used to call it that because we were too rough. They couldn't let a woman sit in the produce section alone.

Can I ask you to do me a favor? If you get a chance, will you tell me if an old customer of mine has grown at all?

I've never actually had a iPod, which is pretty rare I think for a 22 year old growing up in Upstate New York, and I'm not an Apple fanboy (since I don't own their stuff), but iPod are pretty awesome.

Anyways, I've gotten along fine in life without one, but I do have 9545 songs on my iTunes but can only listen to them when I'm in my room. It would be fucking epic if I could take some on the go. Especially at the gym. Oh god, my school plays the worst music at our gym (legit I'm talking Katy Perry.. in the fucking weight room, no lie).

So I've never bought an iPod, mainly cause I'm broke, and neither of my parents could ever afford those kinds of things. I don't know if the pity party route is what you're looking for, but they're divorced and neither make a ""good"" wage, the rest of my family lives in Algeria so at least none of my cousins show off their iPods to me I guess. I pay for school ($50k/yr) mainly because of academic scholarships, federal and state financial aid for being broke, loans, and out-of-pocket when I save any money up from work.

So that's why I want one. I imagine someone's going to post some incredible story of why they need one (or want, cause I don't think anyone actually *needs* one of these things), but if it's for a dying child or something, you should probably give it to them instead.

If none of those stories appear, I will gladly take it off your hands for whatever reason. Thanks for offering this by the way, it's a cool way to get rid of one if you don't want it and probably make someone else's day. Word.","1314837862"

Agreed. Forcing the alternator to continuously charge a weak battery will often overload and kill it. I'm not sure if the battery charging circuitry in a car is strongly current-limited but I don't think it's very sophisticated. A seemingly good battery can go directly to weak and then dead in a couple days. The quality control on batteries is pathetic. A dead battery can take out an alternator in a day.

2. .450 Marlin lever gun with open ghost ring sights. or 7mm.

3. Butcher most myself, steak, roast, stew meat, can a bunch, some burger and sausage. Bears get turned into polish sausage.

4. Do everything my self except for the polish sausage.

5. Filling my freezer.

6. Antler restrictions on Moose. (must be spike/fork or 50"" spread)

7. Hunt with my Son and Dad.

8. Alaska

9. With a river boat or ocean boat for deer.

10. My wife and 11 yo daughter both hunt. I don't find it hot but rather a necessary skill for Alaska in my opinion.

Moose and caribou hunting consists of sitting and glassing, late evening and early morning. Do not hunt in the midday as they bed down. Deer we shoot on the beach when the snow pushes them down.

The drunkenness was proof of her true feelings for him - being drunk removes inhibitions so deeper feelings can be expressed.

People sometimes have trouble sorting out their feelings at this age. This is her. She was attracted to a guy, and feels guilty about it because she is with you. So she tries to assuage the guilt by telling you, yet doesn't fully. And she tries to make it less worse in her own mind by blaming drink, and jealousy (?).

You don't say how long you've been together, or what she is like. If the trip was short (under 4 weeks), and you guys haven't been together long, it is very likely that she tends towards insecurity. The insecure can't stand separation from their partners, because they rely on them to shore up their insecurity. They start needing someone new right away. 

If you've been together longer (2-3 years), then she has probably grown, and her feelings for you are changing.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","You seem to be describing capitalism to me, in all honesty.  And it was stereoagnostic who keeps bringing up morality.  I'm not concerned with moral arguments.  I am against capitalism not because it is immoral.

On top of that, I do not believe in the non-aggression principle.  Further, I don't think such a things exists in reality.  The capitalist does not respect the non-aggression principle.  The state not does not respect it.  Making the argument you are making here is tantamount to telling the slave that they ought not be free and that they ought not rise up against the master.  I don't buy it.  Nevertheless, I think we are required to ask those in authority to respect it before we do.  

Next democratic administration of production is not impossible and has been done before (that's how we know).  And, as I think I stated above, most of it would just involve the utilizing occupancy and use as an means to expropriate wealth.  Deeds and mortgages would be eliminated and production would be physically seized by the workers.  Your house would become yours instead of the bank's.  Not impossible at all.  The rest can be sorted out pretty easily, I think.  

The problem here, is that you wind up making an argument for dictatorship (which is what capitalism is anyhow).  You think that administration of the economy ought to be limited to a small minority, the capitalists.  Here's the problem with your solution -- the state isn't the only one taking my money.  The capitalist takes it as well, both at the point of production and at the point where I am forced to repurchase commodities already produced.

I must reiterate my point above, however.  Capitalism is violence and theft, with or without the state.  So, it is false to say that (and this is what y'all always say) that resistance is violence but the status quo is not.  You see expropriation as violent (which it sometimes is) but that the current order is not.  As if wealth just magically and quite peaceably winds up in the capitalist's hands.  This is not the case.  It is a classic blame the victim argument, similar to the ""why did you make him mad?"" charge leveled against battered women and children.  It is quite backwards and reactionary.","1314837896"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","evidence of what?  That explosives were used in WTC 7?  I don't have any.  Is there evidence NIST lied in its report on how WTC 7 collapsed? Yes.

There was no structural damage to WTC 7 from falling debris.  This is confirmed in numerous places, NIST agrees.  FEMA report also corroborates this.  

NIST's official story is that roughly one fifth of the building caught fire, which led to steel support columns melting, causing the collapse.  The issue I have with this is that NIST's explanation of the whole Twin Tower collapse hinges on the fact that structural damage + fire insulation being dislodged (due to the jet impacts) + jet fuel fires caused the collapse.

In the WTC 7 case, however, the fires just don't get hot enough in an office building to melt steel, especially when there isn't any dislodged fire insulation.  So what did NIST do in it's report?  It said that there was 50% more fuel in each cubicle than in the Twin Towers cubes.  There's no citation or reason given for this, it's just an attempt to get the computer modeled fires up to a higher temperature.

So then it STILL isn't hot enough to melt steel in their simulation, so they give the simulation a margin of error by 10%, and that does the trick.   Basically, I believe they stretched the truth in little places in an attempt to fudge a computer simulation stating that a small fire brought down a huge building.

The other pretty damning piece of evidence is fairly new:  Way back when the investigation was going on, NIST was asked why they weren't testing for explosives etc.  Their response was a somewhat legit answer of ""we don't have any evidence of explosives, explosives to bring a building down are loud, people would have heard them, and we don't have any reports of anything like that"" (paraphrased of course).   There were one or two (if I recall) people who contradicted this, but not enough to cause most people to notice. 

However,   a couple years ago a group filed a FOIA lawsuit against NIST for releasing all the WTC videos and quotes they had collected in their interview.  It turns out NIST had videos of numerous people, firefighters, police, and civilians talking to cameras directly outside the WTC saying they heard explosions, that they thought there were bombs going off, etc.  This directly contradict's NIST's claims that there wasn't any reason to test for explosives.  Keep in mind, when investigating building collapses, it is *standard* to test for explosives and arson.  They ignored this.  

Now, that's not *evidence* of explosions, but given the fact that NIST had this information and both chose not to look into it, and *lied* about it makes it hard to believe in the integrity of their study.  ","1314837901"

1c. So you're going to blame WotC for someone having poor organization skills? And you could always write on an extra land.

2 Many actually believe flip cards to be utterly confusing and complicated. Secondly, you want to make a keyword that'll only ever exsist on werewolf flip cards? I think WotC is trying to cut down on needless keywords. Even then, there would still need to be reminder text, which giving what that text would be, would still take up a large space on a flip card (which it doesn't have).

 3 There's a large assumption on the werewolves, having not seen the whole set, so it might be powerful, or it could be weak given a few other cards not released. I think its too early to judge what cards will be strong in INN w/o ever playing in a draft.","1314837908"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Ask church elders for interviews (don't give specifics, and if they demand them, imply they have something to hide) - then when you get the interview, start soft (what do you donate to, etc) then hit hard (how much of church finances go to X) and finish strong (delineate your doctrine) but remain impartial and avoid leading questions.

Ask to tape the congregation from the back (that way the only faces are church elders and higher members that should not have a problem with publicity) and focus on the procession and the effects on people. Take care to focus on the qualitative points of the sermon that violate scientific truth but do not disclose to the church what your focal points are. Also focus on the collection plate - if you can get footage of an overloaded plate, awesome. It's telling when a small church pulls a lot of money. You could even try to get that golden picture of the hundred-dollar check - it's there, just keep your eyes open. If you can find a ""big donator"" in the congregation, pull them out for an interview. Try to focus on the money aspect, especially if there's a solicitation within the sermon.

I'd try to hit at least four churches if you can. Try to keep your documentary focused on a single point, I'm going with money on this one. If you want to do a follow-up, you can. If you're respectful and present your documentary as an impartial investigation into local churches, they should be glad for the publicity.

When interviewing, make sure you have a bunch (at least 50%) of dummy questions. These are questions you ask that give the interview legitimacy that you won't be adding to the footage; by asking these questions (""What has the church done for you? How has god improved your live through this church?"") you get the interviewee to open up, and then they'll be more likely to share incriminating information. Start soft, end hard, but keep it respectful. Try to not arouse suspicion, and if someone smells a rat, back off and fall onto the ""we love god"" type questions.

I suppose the main reasons i began hating it was firstly, the red headed girl, whose name i cant remember; every time she talked i felt like beating myself to death with my controller (im sure you must agree on that). Secondly, the linearity (not sure if word, or just made up) although it may be true on a free roaming rpg your just going from point A to B, you are still given the choice to go to C, D or even maybe E, while in FF13 you have but one choice, and that it it. Period. Lastly was the leveling system, which i found to be an extremely shallow version of the FF10 sphere grid offering little if any choice to the player.

I say, a good tip for practicing sniper is to have a good, solid backup class to play that you know you can be of some help as. That way, you can ""earn"" the right to try and go sniper. People won't be as critical of you if you're near the top of the scoreboard, most likely. I play lots of Pyro when I'm not feeling so great as Sniper, and a lot of the time I play more Pyro.

It's true that a two weeks notice is not necessary but often recommended if you don't want to burn your bridges. However I always think of giving 2 weeks notice is really dependent upon whether or not your employer is treating you fairly. If they treat you badly now, they're not going to say good things about you even if you do give your notice in advance. There was actually a post yesterday (or the day before) that I can't seem to find now where the employer was given a month's notice and that employer still ended up giving the person a bad reference so the applicant didn't land her dream job.

Besides, how is wanting to have *something* in common with the person I'm talking to, despite disagreeing with them on the subject at hand, not branching out?

Extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence. Well, sort of. Winning the lottery is an extraordinary claim, but simple evidence showing that the number match up is good enough for me. But all things, including extraordinary things, require evidence. And all those issues are things that I can address. I prefer however to start with speaking on the existence of God first and foremost though.

I have also often wondered what I would believe if I grew up somewhere else, or in a different time. That's why it's so important to question your beliefs, to look at everything out there, and to always look for the truth despite what you prefer to believe or what you'd like to believe.

Since Sweety Belle doesn't live with Rarity, its implied (at least as far as I can interpret it) is that she's still living with their parents, and that Rarity basically just grew up and moved out on her own to start her business.

Exactly.  I'd like to applaud Chipotle for at least *trying* to do something a little bit better, but (and in all honesty I know very little about their business practices) I can't get over the fact that the whole thing still smacks of *marketing*.  In society today people are becoming more health conscious and much more morally aware of the world around them and corporations and businesses realize this and are thus, regardless of their actual practices, making strong moves towards at least trying as hard as they can to *appear* to operate in a manner that appeases these demographics.  A lot of it really is just a dog and pony show, smoke and mirrors in order to make themselves look better.  The game still hasn't really changed, meet the old boss, same as the new boss, ect. and so forth.  

As I said, I really do know nothing of Chipotle or their business though, so I could be totally off base in regards to how that company is run.  ","1314837934"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I think it's sensible to accept that faith can be beneficial for a lot of people, but not always for everyone. Is there a place for faith within the Buddha-dharma? Certainly. After all, would any of us bother to study and practice if we didn't believe that it would yield desirable results?

I think this is a topic that will not go away as modernity meets and is transformed by the buddha-dharma (and vice versa). It seems unquestionably clear that the scientific method will be part of how buddhism continues to evolve. Part of what that method requires is that we pay no mind to what is demonstrably false. There are texts that describe the world as being made up of five elements - as though this is the way it actually is. This was written in a time long before the disciplines of chemistry and physics, as well as the powerful instruments used by these fields appeared and developed. We now know that our bodies are not composed of magical elements - we know they're composed of things like gold, sulfur, hydrogen, et cetera. These are things we can show to be true in repeatable experiments.

It doesn't make much sense to disregard these findings simply because some well-intentioned and very well-reasoned people over 1000 years ago thought that everything solid must contain the ""earth"" element. It doesn't really matter how skillful they were when it came to logic and reasoning - when you're wrong, you're wrong, and there's no getting passed that.","1314837949"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was a kid I was running down the stairs, excited to go see Fern Gully 2. Fell down from the very top set and hit my skull on a cactus pot that was at the bottom (the pot was about 1.5' diameter, 2"" thick). The pot cracked and the cactus (which was taller than me at the time) fell on my face. My parents drove me to my PCP and they didn't have the ability to perform an X-ray, so they were afraid to anesthetize me in case of a concussion. This meant that instead I was restrained with leather straps and both of my parents had to lay on me to hold me down while the doctor pulled each cactus spine out and then gave me 12 stitches on my forehead. One month later I have a grammal seizure and find out I did have a concussion and it gave me epilepsy. Oh, and I still haven't seen Fern Gully 2.

I also have a hyperflexation problem that causes me to dislocate things rather often/gives me permanent joint pain, had a stick go through my pupil, broke my nose (this hurt really bad, but I didn't know I had broken it because I expected a break to hurt more), had a reaction to the rabies vaccine, have hard to find veins so people have literally dug in my arm with the needle to find one, and sprained my pinkie toe the other day.

As for the coping mechanisms: When I'm going rock climbing or doing other things where I expect to dislocate something, I keep a strip of leather on hand to bite down on. Also, marigold is a cousin of the poppy-- you can find it labeled ""calendula"" at many herbal remedy shops for pain relief tea. Best method: curse a whole lot really loudly.","1314837953"

"economy","t5_2qhpn","I'll ty one last time, but it always turns out crackpots are resistant to learning precise usage of the terms they barely master.

You have a very vague and hand-waving understanding of alpha and beta, in the same manner crackpots try to apply Heisenberg Uncertainty to social situations or relativity to morals. In investment and finance, alpha and beta (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(investment)) are parameters of the [CAPM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model). This is a *model* of investment, and somehow you took these words and applied some form of foggy understanding common to those who do not understand the terms they are trying to apply. I have read other posts of yours and you wield these two terms like the holy grail of understanding but you barely understand them. So let's look at what they mean:

Alpha (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(investment)) measures roughly how well an investment performed compared to risk. **However alpha has a precise mathematical definition.** Note risk has a precise definition also and is not the hand waving ""it feels risky"" type. Note also even Wikipedia says what I said earlier: ""It can be shown that in an efficient market, the expected value of the alpha coefficient is zero."" Note this is all a *model*, not reality. (Note it says expected value. For a quick test, explain carefully what expected value means. If you don't understand it then you cannot understand alpha.) Note ""zero-sum"" appears nowhere on this page. However, another kind of alpha, [Jensen's Alpha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_alpha) does have the phrase zero-sum on the page. The discussion starts with ""Since Eugene Fama, many academics believe financial markets are too efficient to allow for repeatedly earning positive Alpha, unless by chance"". Note that they understand how efficient markets imply zero-sum. Note there is a chance alpha is not zero sum evenin this case. Note then the next statement: ""To the contrary, **empirical studies** of mutual funds spearheaded by Russ Wermers usually confirm managers' stock-picking talent, finding positive Alpha."" This means that when measuring reality, instead of just using the *model*, there is positive alpha. Learn carefully to understand the difference of a model and reality. You are completely incorrect and your insistence on using a word you do not understand as if you're correct is a sure sign of crackpottery, not a sign of an intelligent person who, as you put it, has a ""best ability is to think and consider"". Now is the time to ""think and consider"".

Remember: alpha and beta are precisely parameters of a *model* of reality that is well known only approximates real trading. Empirical alpha is not zero sum and theoretical alpha is only *expected value* zero sum given certain assumptions in the model. This is alpha.

&gt;I notice you didn't address my example of alpha and justify its nobility.

What does that even mean? Nobility? Are we knights of the round table? You also did not address the paper I posted. Trying to address your example when you don't understand the terminology is like trying to explain that special realtivity allows time to pass at different rates to somone ignorant of math and science and who only has one watch. Their inability to understand nuances of issues due to lack of learning makes it impossible to communicate. Your inability to understand alpha due to not understanding (as it seems) enough math to understand the model that defines alpha, nor how expected values work, makes it impossible to address your thought experiment. You don't have the vocabulary.

&gt;It's the sign of a weak hand to label your opponent as crazy.

It's also the sign of wisdom to recognize it and walk away when your hand is perfect but your opponent cannot understand your hand due to ignorance. You really don't have any background in finance or economics, do you, except blog posts and pop articles?

At some point if it is the truth then pointing it out and walking away as I am about to do is the best use of time. All crackpots are convinced they are right and when called crazy consider it a win. Let's go over some crackpot signs:

1. Crackpots adhere to statements even when given careful correction. At this point you will still claim ""alpha is zero-sum"" in spite of careful definitions and sources of empirical evidence otherwise. Check.
2. Crackpots try to contradict the results of empirical data with a thought experiment by using terms wrong. You just did that and called it noble. Check.
3. Crackpots call widely understood fundamentals wrong or misguided without understanding those fundamentals. You show a severe misunderstanding of the terms you wield as weapons. Check.
4. Crackpots deride the experts in the field as charlatans, or as you put it ""high priests"". Check.
5. Crackpots often need a large scale conspiracy for their world view to work. You have claimed this several times. Check.
6. Crackpots think they are right, often thinking they can see what experts and the public at large cannot, despite the experts having put in much more effort to learn the field. You fit this one as well. Check.
7. Crackpots categorize everyday activites with religious or emotional words like ""evil"" or ""good"" when trying to explain their ideas. Check.
8. Crackpots view the world in black and white, unable to notice nuances, give and take, and complexity. Check.

You really have quite a few characteristics of those called traditional crackpots. 

Before you apply invalid logic, note I did not say that anyone or any discussion with a few of these is immediately a crackpot. However I do say when all of these get ticked off there is a pretty good chance you're dealing with a crackpot. And you insistence on using alpha and beta wrong, even after having them shown to you, is a sure sign you're not trying to learn and understand how things work; instead you have made for yourself a religion that you must tell the world, even though it is false. And you block any chance of learning because you have decided you know it all already, deride those who might be able to help you overcome your ignorance as ""high-priests"", thereby locking yourself into lifelong ignorance. You're not interested in learning; you're interested in reinforcing and sharing your world view. That is the epitome of ignorance.

Hopefully one day you will learn how the topics you are obviously interested in really work. Insisting on stubborn, willful ignorance is not going to help you though. It just keeps you ignorant and on the crackpot fringe.

* Do not do it just for the sake of writing a framework, have a project line up, it helps a lot.
* Do not implement feature because you think you'll need them. (which is why it's good to write a framework when you have a project line up, much easier to define what you actually need)
* Do not use/implement design patterns or practices because you heard it was cool. Really think through your choices, it will dictate a lot the architecture of your framework.
* Write Unit Test from day 1. (and if you like it, i don't, do Test Driven Development)
* KISS . Always try to keep everything down to the minimum (Do not create useless interfaces, or chain function calls that could fit in one function).
* Depending on the scope, do not use a templating engine, and if you do, look into Blitz, it's really the best.
* Refactor frequently.
* Document everything correctly. (At least the docblock, no need for spec docs if you are not doing this at an enterprise level, schema scribbled on paper are perfectly fine)
* Get it out there (Github or Bitbucket), and get your friends to use it. You'll get a lot of really valuable feedback.
* On the same note, try to find an experienced ""mentor"", who can do code review session with you (even if it's somebody on the other side of the planet, internet is your ally).
* No matter what, you will not get it right the first - or even the second - time. But that's part of the process. I developed 5 full frameworks, and countless prototypes before i was satisfied with the result (over the course of 3years).
* Let it sleep. Write a first prototype, sit on it for a week or two, review it. Repeat until you get satisfied.
* Have a philosophy. Mine for example : ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."" (quote from Albert Einstein)

And that would be pretty much it. Again this is my take on it. I know quite a few people that despise my framework (coworkers even), i'm ok with it. And even me, i haven't really touched it in a month, and i want already to change couple of things.

Hope i was helpful.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Reddit's definition of agnosticism and atheism is what noitulove posted here... It doesn't appear to completely match the common perception of atheism and agnosticism, however.

This is what I used to think the common perception of these terms was (prior to lounging on reddit all day long)

Theist: Believes in a specific God.

Atheist: Rejects all beliefs in God that he/she is familiar with.

Agnostic: Isn't sure whether or not to believe in God. Does not believe in God, has not rejected belief in God. May have rejected beliefs in certain other Gods (Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, etc.)

Through this definition I make Agnostic and Atheist mutually exclusive. In this I disagree with the mantra that 'all babies are atheists' - instead, 'all babies are agnostics' - they haven't been exposed to the concept of God, so there is no acceptance of God, nor is there a rejection of God.

Agnosticism is that waffling state when you're faced with a decision or a question, and rather than answer or go one way or the other, you hesitate and delay. 

I dismiss the Gnostic/Agnostic scale as being pretty much useless, pretty much for the same reasons as zugi.","1314837972"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I don't think you have as much experience with hunting rifles as you think you do. Starting a fire with a bolt action hunting rifle is damn hard. Remove the bullet from the cartridge and the gas expansion often happens too fast to light anything directly from the muzzle blast. Unless you sit and pound rounds, getting even a dry cigarette to light would be very difficult. 

Hunting with a firearm also leads to many other problems. In many areas with large carnivores, hunters sometimes have to try and race to the kill as the local animals have learned that shot meat is free meat. The local dinosaurs may also learn this. Hunted game also makes you a target after the fact, as the smell of a kill may linger in the area you are living, or on you directly.

Hunting rifles require maintenance. It is unlikely that you will have the tools or the parts to clean and maintain your firearm properly. Some hunting rifles are precision firearms and regular barrel cleaning is a must for maintaining accuracy. Some hunting rifles are semi automatic. Any sort of water (dew, mist, rain, or just dropping the damn thing in the river) will start to turn the cordite (or carbon residue from firing the firearm) into a sludge rather than a dry lubricant. This was demonstrated by the M16 during the Vietnam Conflict. Lastly, rust is likely to form on the firearm very quickly and without any sort of quick response care and preventative maintenance, can lead to pitting of the barrel and other high stress, high strength parts, weakening their structure and causing catastrophic failure leading to a number of undesired outcomes (e.g. massive injury)

Simply put, having a single firearm in a survival situation for a long period of time in an environment such as this is not the great idea that it first seems.","1314837973"

The Court determined that Texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct, because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment “right to privacy.” Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be, there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the Constitution. There are, however, states' rights — rights plainly affirmed in the Ninth and Tenth amendments.

You should definitely check it out.  We also lucked out with Richie Hawtin, not only he did his Plastikman routine, but also he ended up playing an extra session because someone cancelled last minute. And you can be sure, with Detroit pride, you're always going to get Detroit legends playing at DEMF. Be careful with drugs, the place is crawling with undercover cops. Also, they search your bags/pockets/backpacks etc, before going in. We didn't do any after parties. Two single girls driving around Detroit at night just didn't sound like a good idea. We did go to some after hours club nearby, and again the DJ's were mind blowing. ","1314837990"

**This** is the problem I have with your comment, and you have not clarified it in the least bit. You are still fucking wrong to a degree that is reminiscent of the TEA party. It is simultaneously ignorant, bigoted, and fucking stupid. I appreciate your enthusiastic 17 year old rage at religion, but you must consolidate yourself and appreciate that you know little to nothing about the topics upon which you pontificate. 

I denounce unequivocally the atrocities raped upon the world by Nazism and the KKK. I am not concerned about ""the bigots who have those policies"" nearly as much as I am about **people like you**...people who are supposed to be the voice of reason and rationality in a thoroughly irrational and unreasonable society.  People like you are supposed to be the scientific and rational salvation for humanity, but if you give yourself over to such a void of nuance and historically ignorant nonsense then you are no better than the people against which you protest.  

&gt; Since you are in one of those groups, you are morally responsible for making an effort to clean up the mess or disassociating yourself with such people.

Fuck you. Fuck you and fuck you. The fact that you would group me in with these unabashed butchers of humanity show exactly how little appreciation you have for their atrocities, and that is *precisely* what a unrepentant classist would say. I have no interest in elevating nationalism, racism, or classism. I have every interest in ensuring that the denouncers of such things do so from an informed and nuanced perspective, to do so with an appreciation for the historicity and the potential for human cruelty in mind, and do so with more than the sophomoric desire to progress your own ideology. 

You are *every bit* as wrong as the Nazis and the Klan members in progressing your ideology on the fragile supports of misconception and ignorance as any historical precedence can afford. This is not how the society of tomorrow is built, and this is not the way in which to build it.

"japanlife","t5_2rg2o","Japanese credit cards are closer to North American debit cards that allow you to divide the cost of purchase over several payments. So, if you buy something for 120,000 yen and choose 12 payments, it'll be 10,000 a month for one year from your bank account, plus interest charges (which get higher than more payments you divide it into). If you try this with a NA card, it won't work, as NA credit cards create debt and let you pay it off as you choose.

The flexpay system is different store-to-store (it's called a Shopping Loan in some places too), but basically the store extends you credit  for a purchase at a lower cost than a credit card would charge. This encourages a customer who wants to buy a big ticket item and intends to use a credit card to buy it at that store instead of a competitor.
     
I'd haggle for it at a really low interest rate. If you're buying 100,000 yen or more, they'll likely be eager to make sure you buy at their store. Play a few stores off each other and you might even get it at no interest.

The point of the game show analogy that you refuse to answer because it doesn't support your original point... is that any answer could be correct. As you said, there are lots of stupid people in CA and NY. However, the correct guess would be Mississippi... even if you are wrong. You have a higher likelyhood of being correct.

You are like the poker player that plays 7/2 offsuit because you saw a guy win with it once. A profitable poker player plays the hands that win the most often because they know that in the long run, playing the odds leads to the most profit.

Some people aren't able to apply these concepts to real life, which is understandable because real life is much more nuanced and complicated than a game like poker.

If I told you that Person A owned 5 swimsuits.. then asked you to guess whether they were from Wisconsin, Florida, or Connecticut.. you would argue that they could be from any of the 3 and there are scenarios like indoor pools and high school / college swim teams that could mean the man owning 5 swimsuits could be from anywhere. Again, your response is correct, however.. the correct guess *based on the information available* is Florida.

""Consider [the Lawrence case decided by the Supreme Court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas#Arrest_of_Lawrence_and_Garner) in June. The Court determined that Texas had no right to establish its own standards for private sexual conduct, because gay sodomy is somehow protected under the 14th amendment “right to privacy.” Ridiculous as sodomy laws may be, there clearly is no right to privacy nor sodomy found anywhere in the Constitution. There are, however, states' rights — rights plainly affirmed in the Ninth and Tenth amendments. Under those amendments, the State of Texas has the right to decide for itself how to regulate social matters like sex, using its own local standards."" -  [Ron Paul](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul120.html)","1314838020"

My boyfriend loves it when I wear my hair down when we have sex because he can grab it, pull on it, run his fingers through it, and direct me on how he wants me to move for different positions. I love that he loves my long hair, but sometimes during sex it's a pain.

Why not ask him to hold it for you or push it back? If I'm in a real hurry to please him I'll throw it in a messy bun. It all comes down to what both of you like. All you have to do is ask him. :)

Ned and Jaime are the only locks for POV characters, although everyone else's suggestions are solid.  Rhaegar shouldn't have one, I always assumed Jaime kind of had an admirable view of him so I supposed his chapters would cover the view of Rhaegar.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","The thing is.... this is going to sound horrible but... women breed men for aggression. 

OK hear me out. Every female species breeds the males according to their preferences. This pressure is so strong it occasionally results in whole new species. On rare occasion a mutant female prefers her males to either look or behave or dance in some way significantly different from what the rest of the females prefer. If her offspring proves successful and shares the preference, over time you can end up with two reproductively isolated populations.  This has been observed in insect population.

But lets get back to larger animals. Peahens breed peacocks to have those ridiculous tails. Those tails are horrible for peacocks. They make them slower to take of and fly. They fly lower, this all means tigers can catch them much more easily then they could catch peahens. That tail takes a lot of energy and thus a lot of food to drag around. But its what peahens want and so that's what peacocks look like.

Lionesses do most of the hunting, because male lions are too big, too slow and have that ridiculous mane which makes them far easier to spot. Why do male lions have that mane? Did you know a male lion loses his mane if he is defeated by another male lion? It has been shown that lionesses prefer males with bigger and darker manes. 

In some song birds species it's not enough for the male to sing his lungs out, he should preferably do it in easy to spot place, and should draw as much attention as possible. Female song birds want make song birds that take crazy risks. 

Female kangaroos can select the sex of their offspring. If times are tough and food is scares they have daughters. If food is plenty they give birth to sons. Why? Because male kangaroos, like most other species, fight for the right to breed, and a lot of food means big strong males. 

And so on, you find this all over the animal world. You find this because the male sex is an extravagance. Males eat just as much or more food as females but only females give birth. Yes, a male might be necessary but one male can fertilize a lot more then one female. Not only do you not need a 50/50 split between males and females, that's actually kind of a waste. 
 

And you find it humans too. Here's a fun fact, your ancestors are not an even 50/50 male/female split. You have many fewer male ancestors, then you do female ones. 

Women have healthy normal levels of testosterone. Men have on average 200 times that. Testosterone is an immune system suppressant, this is why its used when someone has a life threatening allergic attack.  This is why a larger share of male infants die every year. This is true even in the industrialized world, the difference is small but real.

So why do men have these over the top levels of testosterone?
Because women prefer aggressive men. That's why the jocks get all the girls. That's why violent criminals on average father more children then men without a criminal record.

"running","t5_2qlit","I'm not saying that I'm running on my toes like a sprinter does, but I do find it more efficient to not allow my heel to drop down to the ground. I think that as long as you build up slowly your calves are able to build up the strength necessary to do this.  I'm not saying that it's bad to let your heel drop and touch the ground after your mid or forefoot strikes, but I don't think that it should be required either.  

Either way, I think it's really easy to fall in the trap of worrying too much about what part of your foot hits the ground when the more important aspect is where your foot strikes the ground in relation to your body.  As long as you are striking below the body with short quick strides you will end up hitting the ground with far less force than someone who is reaching out in front of them to hit the ground.

For the most part, I think we are on the same page, I just don't think it's necessary to allow your heel to hit the ground.  Like you said, it is more efficient and I have been able to maintain this form even on my longer runs of around 10 miles.  

As requested, my typical weekly mileage is about 20 miles per week. My average pace for my longer runs is around 7:30 - 7:45 per mile and my shorter runs are between 6:40 and 7:00 per mile.","1314838045"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","A lot of good ones mentioned here, so I'll list one I haven't seen yet.

Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter.  Throughout the entire game you have a counter at the top of your screen that slowly progresses, and it's strongly implied that something really bad will happen if it ever reaches 100%.  It goes up every time you do anything, essentially, and using your Dragon Form takes up big chunks.

[On a first playthrough, you'll probably get to the final boss with around 94% on the counter.  But for the very last fight you have to use a channeling ability that increases the counter while you use it.   So you warily use this ability and watch your counter move up and up, and try to stop it before it reaches 100%, but you can't.  You continue using it, going far past 100% until you finally win.  All the while I was saying ""Shit shit shit shit shit!"" because the game is essentially a survival horror RPG, and here you are dreading getting to 100%, and then you end up going far past it.  After the big baddie is defeated your main character falls to the ground, broken.](/spoiler)","1314838058"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","There is evidence to suggest, actually, that income inequality leads to an unhealthier society - *for rich people as well as poor*:

""Those who would deny a link between health and inequality must first grapple with the following paradox. There is a strong relationship between income and health within countries. In any nation you will find that people on high incomes tend to live longer and have fewer chronic illnesses than people on low incomes.

Yet, if you look for differences between countries, the relationship between income and health largely disintegrates. Rich Americans, for instance, are healthier on average than poor Americans, as measured by life expectancy. But, although the US is a much richer country than, say, Greece, Americans on average have a lower life expectancy than Greeks. More income, it seems, gives you a health advantage with respect to your fellow citizens, but not with respect to people living in other countries….

Once a floor standard of living is attained, people tend to be healthier when three conditions hold: they are valued and respected by others; they feel ‘in control’ in their work and home lives; and they enjoy a dense network of social contacts. Economically unequal societies tend to do poorly in all three respects: they tend to be characterised by big status differences, by big differences in people’s sense of control and by low levels of civic participation….

Unequal societies, in other words, will remain unhealthy societies – and also unhappy societies – no matter how wealthy they become. Their advocates – those who see no reason whatever to curb ever-widening income differentials – have a lot of explaining to do.""

This is special pleading. Why couldn't some non-deity do X? Not only that, but they haven't sufficiently supported all the premises.

The fourth is a little trickier, but is also unconvincing. First, the idea of greater and lesser is a human construct, and second, where there is a gradation from say, cold to hot, there generally isn't a hottest possible temperature. You name a temperature, and I can name a higher one. Same goes for brightness, mass, and electric charge. This is pretty much the ontological argument, which can also be used to prove that the perfect tropical island exists (and the perfect tropical island would be easily found and accessible, so we would know about it if it existed). It can even be used to directly disprove the existence of the so called greatest being that can be conceived, so if anything, it proves that there is no god.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Of course it's not difficult, and in terms of what the propagated myths are: water makes eggs fluffy, milk makes eggs creamy. So if you are going by myths, no, milk does not make eggs fluffy. 

At the very least, you have to recognize that there is a long-standing debate on whether to add anything, let alone eggs vs milk, to scrambled eggs. 

If you lived nearby, I'd be happy to invite you over and we can try out our various techniques. My own feeling is that adding more moisture to eggs invites the risk of making watery eggs. And if you cook them too long in the pan, as you say, ""more cooking = drier eggs,"" you risk ""done in the pan, overdone on the plate."" 

For years, yes, I added milk to eggs, but gave up the practice when a friend in culinary school taught me the technique he uses. Does that make him more right? Hell's no. My wife uses the Julia Child's technique with a reasonable amount of success. Good friends of mine slow cook, constantly stirring eggs that have nothing but butter in them. 

So yeah, I am going to stick to my statement, throwing milk into eggs is just inviting RISK of watery eggs. If you cook the eggs long enough to ensure that the added moisture has been evaporated out, you may ultimately end up with dry scrambled eggs.

I'm not going to downvote you, in fact, here, have an upvote, but don't downvote me simply because I point out the risks and the fact that there is far from consensus on how to make ""perfect"" scrambled eggs.","1314838070"

**Bangkok** - Hit up the tailors near Rambuttri Village.  I am currently ordering suits from St. Michaels Fashions, being delivered stateside.  Went there and by far the best of the 4 we used, more pricey but worth it.  Others are fine, but even if they are a small, they are still good too, tailors have books of fabrisc, so don't avoid it because some shops are bigger and have more fabrics on site.

**Phuket** - use it as a jump off point. Stay one night to soak it in.  The go-go district is just mind-blowing, not saying good or bad just saying an experience.  Use Phuket to get to the islands and spend your days there.  $12/night in Koh Phi Phi staying on the beach, a room with 3 beds, AC, 18-19 Euro chicks everywhere.  Beach parties are sick, a great island.  Don't spend 2 days in Phuket spend them at the islands.

Left to travel for a week and returned to our suits completed.  Needed 12 more hours of fittings and they were perfect.  So it is poss to leave and return BKK for suits.

All in all, skip Phenom Penh, 1 or 2 less days in Siem Reap, 1 Night in Phuket, 2-3 nights on the islands.  Make these changes and you are golden.","1314838076"

A racism scandal in Australia involves two white fans of a Samoan athelete painting their faces and wearing wigs. Racism scandals in other countries tend to involve bashings, rapes and murders. People in other countries don't really care about racism - it isn't seen as a problem, many countires don't even have EO legislation - so it isn't talked about.

Our fetishism of persecution and the endemic anglophobia of this nation have turned us into the people who *complain and accuse* most about racism, whilst being the least racsit nation on Earth.

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","If we didn't have such a large government obviously things would be paid for privately.  

What would take FEMA's place, well I imagine it could be offered as a add on to your insurance plan.  Pay extra premium so that not only will the insurance company replace you're property but they will also provide emergency services.   

Obviously those cost money, so it would be in the interest in the insurance companies to set up alerting services as well and to also advise on evacuations.  Pretty much everything we have now. ","1314838106"

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","The answer sort of depends on what your goal is. Why do you want to write a game? Is it more important for you to improve your programming skills? Or are you more interested in being able to implement ideas that you have?

I say this because game programming involves a ton of work. If your goal is to implement ideas you have, the best thing to do is fine tools that save you as much time as possible. Otherwise, you will progress very slowly and possibly lose motivation. The downsides to this is that you may not learn as much and that those tools might be less flexible. And there's options at various stages of the ""implement everything"" to ""get a lot of help"" spectrum.

One thing to consider is that you might want to take advantage of what you already know. You could stick with python and use something like pygame. For a simple game, it should be sufficient, but it might not be ideal for a more involved project. If you already spent time getting familiar with XNA, maybe stick to that rather than learning C++ for example.

That said, it looks like you're having trouble making a decision, so I'll give you two options that I think would work

* XNA + FlatRedBall - You already spent some time getting familiar with it. It's a good solution, especially if you want to sell your games in the future. Several popular indie games have used XNA and have done well. It makes things a lot easier for you than starting out with C++ and OpenGL, but you might want to look into using the FlatRedBall library to speed things up even further.

* Flash + Flixel or Flashpunk - If your game is simple getting people to install it and play it might more difficult than telling them all they need to do is visit a website to play. With Flash you could submit your game to one of the various Flash game websites around. Flixel and Flashpunk are both popular libraries that make game programming go a lot faster. My personal choice is Flashpunk because it's a bit more flexible, but if you're interested in a platformer Flixel is a great option too. They both have good tutorials available.

If you're stuck on simply drawing things to the screen, consider buying/borrowing a book that will take you all the way through making a game. Sometimes following a fractured curriculum using online tutorials can be difficult if you're new at it.","1314838106"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This isn't really the worst or even that bad, but it's kind of funny.

Before the interview I was required to ""check in"" as a visitor and write my interview start time: 12:00pm.

The interview went pretty well but I was interviewed by two people with some fairly technical questions. They were both really nice though, and it felt more like a casual conversation than an interview.

When I left I was kind of exhausted. I went to go ""check out"" and hand in my visitor card. I looked at my watch, which said 1:00pm. I assumed it was still off from daylight savings for some reason, even though I knew it wasn't when I went in. In my lapse of attention, I wrote down 12:00pm as my check out time.

Yeah. Didn't realize it until I was on the road out of there. ""CRAP!""

So according to their logs, I had entered the building at 12:00pm, had a one-hour interview in a time-sealed HR office, and left at 12:00pm.

I was pretty convinced that they were going to look at that, see I'm an idiot, and then give it to the next guy. Instead, the receptionist called my cell 15 minutes after I had left, and she offered me the job. Funny thing is, she was the one managing the log and would have seen the idiot record I left.","1314838112"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","It's all about team comp.  Characters like Morde, Renekton, Cait, Singed, Chogath, Garen, Garagas, Kennen, Nidalee, Malphite, Maokai, Nasus, Nunu, and rumble are a few I think are COMPLETELY capable if not excel.  Now when it comes to being 2v1 you play extremely safe.  Focus on last hitting and don't push past river alone.  Now on to why.  When you have someone in jungle that opens up your top lane to level up almost twice as fast.  This means by the time your enemies are lvl 4 you will be 6 and when they get 6 you're generally 8 to 9.  So thats level advantage.  Also, you wont have to share last hits, which means one champ will recieve approx. 125 per 30 at optimal capacity.  By the 10 min mark of laning that is approx. 1,250 gold advantage over any duo lane character's possibility.  So that is a big advantage in the gold department.  The jungler will receive approximately 72 gold per 30 seconds of jungle (assuming they start at 1:55 and finish at 4:00).  This isn't as good but the jungler has the opportunity to get many kills/assists as they generally are MIA (of course) and allow for great ganks.  They also finish first run of jungle at lvl 4, which depending on your jungler's abilitys can go straight into a gank (xin xhao is a great example of this as he generally finishes with a slow and a knock up and finished 3/4 health).  So..honestly...it's RETARDED to not have a jungler.  So I wrote this fast and I'm at work.  Not checking for mistakes, I'll leave that to you reddit trolls. :D

TL;DR- Gold/xp advantage, surprise advantage, buff advantage, gank advantage.  ","1314838117"

The only change I would make would be to switch the positions of the New Yorker and the New Republic.  The New Republic typically adopts a pretty hawkish point of view regarding foreign policy (most columnists were staunch supporters of the Iraq war).

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt; So the idea is that if you have excess glucose the body will turn to catabolic glycolysis first before it does any lipolysis and beta oxidation, right?

From everything I have read, yeah. Not so much glucose made from gluconeogenesis, but from diet. There seems to be a hierarchy of substrate utilization in which alcohol &gt; dietary glucose &gt; dietary fats.

&gt; How does this factor into anabolic amino acid synthesis?

Not sure how to answer this, can you clarify what you mean?

&gt; What happens if I consume nothing but 400 grams of protein everyday (assuming I'm lifting heavy)?

Gluconeogensis will definitely occur; but I believe under most circumstances you would still be in a positive nitrogen balance or at least equal (nitrogen excretion would definitely go up, but you are also eating more)

&gt;  I obviously won't have excess glucose. But does that also mean that there's no anabolic protein synthesis, despite tissue damage?

This method (CBT) works by setting out simple goals that you must accomplish throughout your treatment, as well as weekly meetings.  You'll discuss your feelings and lay out plans at the meetings, and things you will accomplish vary from buying a newspaper every day instead of staying inside to smiling at a new person.  Over time, you will see yourself changing because the thoughts that underly, and ultimately control, your conscious self will be changed, allowing you to take advantage of what you were once afraid of. 

Meditation has shown to accomplish the same goals.

Medication will help, but it will likely end all effectiveness once you stop taking meds.

People like hal2k1 gave a false sense of hope for those of us who were left high and dry by ATI, saying how a workable 3D mesa stack was just around the corner.

I have made no comment whatsoever regarding the status **at times past** of Linux graphics drivers.

A workable open source 3D mesa stack for AMD/ATI GPUs, including legacy GPUs, is available now.

One point is that the intended market of the shirt is young girls.  Kids are pretty easily influenced and very much affected by peer pressure.  This is not the same as ""banning"" a product for adults because some people disapprove of it.  Girls should not be encouraged to think like this (the message of the shirt).  I frequently see guys complaining about pretty girls getting a free ride because of their looks.  I damn sure hope that they are not among those calling ""censorship"" here.  Things intended for children are screened (or ""censored"") all the time!  Music and movies are rated, parents seek ways to keep their kids from the seedier parts of the internet, etc, etc.  It is the consensus in our society that children need to be protected from certain things that their still developing brains do not yet have the capacity to process and categorize correctly.  Why are people all up in arms about this one stupid shirt?  


In no way should kids see the slogan on this shirt as an acceptable way to think.  It's not just a bad message for the particular girl wearing the shirt.  It's bad for them, it's bad for boys and it's bad for society.  ","1314838141"

In a programming system where objects are mutable, object-identity is important, and it's meaningful to talk about the lifespan of those objects. In contrast, a programming system with immutable objects, lazy construction and memoization make object-identity irrelevant: If you were previously working with the string ""Foo"", and later on you again work with the string ""Foo"", it doesn't matter whether that's the same string, or some different string with indistinguishable values: the outcome is indistinguishable.","1314838146"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Thats how this game works. It has the worst community of any game I have ever played. Makes WoW's community look like mature adults. 

Lots of people ignore this because they only play with friends. So they act like this stuff isn't a big deal. They also act like ELO hell doesn't exist. Hell, there was a stream on here saying ""watch me raise my ELO from 900 to 1900"". Yet he was duo quo'ing with very very highly skilled friend. 

Riot also seems to be ignoring the issue. They refuse to put in strict rules, they also refuse to re-structure que'ing. Money is more of a priority for Riot, and lots of the people who feed, complain, and ruin games, also pay lots of money to buy skins and champions. 

League of Legends is also one of my favorite games, and I know what you mean. When I only played on my main, and was fairly high elo, I ignored the problem. I knew it existed, but I didn't pay attention to it enough. Even the worst players at 1800 are gods compared to what 90 percent of the community is stuck with. 

However, when I made a smurf and began testing builds and champions in normal que. I realized just how fucked the game is. They que you against pre-mades. You get stuck with completely awful players. No matter how goods you are, especially if all you do is normal, you can't carry 4 people who dont even know how to build their champions. Let alone split push, or re-act to pings. It was not this bad when the game came out, and many of the vets were raising their ELO, making friends and doing normal games. Now that those vets are all in teams, have buddies and are high ELO, they do NOT see the problem unless they directly make a smurf for testing (most make one and get it carried to high ELO by friends). 

So, long story short, I know what you mean. There are days when I log in, and think about playing with some of the bad players, and immediately log out. Although the game is fun, playing with people who ruin it, also ruins the experience.

Any source you find saying it was greater than 1 will come from a Keynesian, and any source you find saying it was lower will come from a Monetarist.

That's because this ""multiplier"" is a theoretical outcome - it's quite literally the [Higgs boson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) of the financial world.

Many of the nerves run between muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments and any sort of inflammation can pinch the nerve causing pain. Maybe sleeping on his stomach was causing some sort of inflammation which lead to nerve pinching. The thing is, there would have been long lasting nerve damage if he says its so long.

 Also, to get him away from his loser pals, mom instigates a move to a remote coastal area, where my sister and I would ride a school bus. School claims we have to meet bus at a 'common' point if less than a mile from our home. Mom informs them this area has a LOT of wild dogs and children couldn't safely wait for a bus. School is adamant, so Day 1- bus meets us at designated spot- to find 5 dead dogs strewn around our car and my mom holding a shotgun. She was handling the problem the only way possible.

August 31st, 2011 - whoisearth has said the NDP will eventually merge with the Liberals.

Now as for why.  Look at the UK.  There's your answer.  Study their political history in the last 100+ years.

The ""left"" has nowhere to move but the ""center"".  The NDP has already started moving to the center.  The next logical choice is to swallow the Liberals.  They almost have already in everything but name.  Look back in Canadian politics 25 years.  The current NDP looks nothing like the NDP of old.  The current NDP looks more like the Liberals of old.  Likewise, the current Liberals look suspiciously like the federal PC party of old.

Joe Clarke would be proud.  Not only has he changed the Conservatives he's also changed the Liberals to the point of decimating them not with his own actions buy by them tearing apart their ideology until they've lost themselves.

"booksuggestions","t5_2ryqe","I've read most of what's on the shelf at your local bookstore in the same section as those books.  Gawande is a terrific writer and therefore a hard act to follow but I would suggest looking into some of these:

* Gawande's latest book, The Checklist Manifesto
* The House of God by Samuel Shem (a classic book on the medical training of the past generation, not exactly similar to Gawande but a very intriguing look into medicine)
* How Doctors Think by Jerome Groopman (he occasionally writes for the New Yorker like Gawande so you might enjoy it)
* Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder (warning: you might become simultaneously depressed--that you'll never be as smart or driven as Paul Farmer--and inspired--that people like Paul Farmer exist.)
* Doctors by Sherwin Nuland (nice collection of portraits of famous physicians)
* Genius on the Edge by Gerard Imber (not the most well written but it does a good job of telling the remarkable story of William Halstead, arguably the father of modern surgery)
* The Knife Man by Wendy Moore (biography of John Hunter, a fun read about a true innovator)
* Soul Made Flesh by Carl Zimmer (very good book about the history involved with the study of neuroanatomy)
* When the Air Hits Your Brain by Frank Verotosick (autobiography of a neurosurgeon)

Here are some that I didn't care for very much about medicine:

* Another Day in the Frontal Lobe by Katrina Firlik (meh.)
* Intern by Sandeep Jauhar (meh.)
* Stiff by Mary Roach (interesting but didn't really do much for me)
* White Coat by Ellen Rothman (meh.)

And finally, there's a great blog that's now defunct written by a retired surgeon, Sid Schwab, called [Surgeonsblog](http://surgeonsblog.blogspot.com/) that is well written and a very interesting perspective on surgery.

If it's Gawande's style of writing you like, I find it to be most similar to Malcolm Gladwell.  If that's the case then I suggest you look into Outliers.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It would be rare to test ""new makeup"" per se on animals. There is also no such thing as a cosmetic product not ""tested on animals"" in a significant sense. A novel compound must be tested on animals before being sold to humans for use in cosmetics; ""not tested on animals"" just means that they used compounds that someone else paid to test on animals.

I think the ""no cosmetic testing"" argument is definitely emotionally appealing, but it's not very complete. While it does seem really absurd to be testing things on animals just so that people can wear more makeup, it would also be pretty bad if parents had to worry every time their children bought makeup that they might absorb a toxin through their skin and get pancreatic cancer or develop immune failure, etc.

I'm not taking a hard stance either way here, just trying to present both sides. I think it's a shame that there's such a huge market for new things to smear on your face, but as long as many people are smearing things on their face, I do think there's some merit to ensuring that those things are safe for the population.

I suppose you could argue that if we let bad things happen from makeup, this might reduce demand and solve its own problem. Of course in that case, some companies would voluntarily test on animals anyway (possibly with less public disclosure if possible).

Anyway, yeah, I agree that it really sucks to test animals for cosmetic things, but in the end you're not testing the cosmetic effects, you're testing the health effects. It's no better to be harmed by your makeup than by your prescriptions or your dinner.","1314838214"

Second, she may of written the piece, but as an intern, I'm positive it didn't get posted without approval from her supervisors, so I very much doubt that she would receive the full force of the blame ofthis article.

Third, how much do you want to bet somebody told her to write this piece?  There was probably an editorial meeting, and people were pitching story ideas, and she said, ""I went on an OKCupid date with a guy who ended up being the world champ of Magic The Gathering.""  Then they all laughed for a sec and somebody asked, ""Do you think could get a story out that?  Maybe about how in online dating, people are not necessarily what their profile shows them to be?""  And she was like, ""Uh, yeah, probably.""

Fourth, Gizmodo probably saw this artcle as a success since it drove a lot of viewers to their site, including some who probably had never heard of it before.

As far as I can tell there are vastly different levels of transuranic and actinide wastes depending on the designs. Either way we are not dealing effectively with other nuclear wastes at this point.

Do I think it has potential? Sure.

let's say you have the same class with someone but you've never talked to him before. but at the end of class he just asks you if you want to come to a public event or something (say, a public talk or some organization gathering). he's even a bit awkward/anxious about it. but you recall him being very outspoken (in a good way) in class, a meeting, or something. do you think a guy like that can pull it off (for you, for example)?

He is easily led astray though. Jane led him astray and [spoiler](/s he blames himself for her death.) Walt joined him at the start for his connections and ability to deal but amps everything up for money which takes Jesse further down the path of unrighteousness than he ever went on his own. Walt's pride rubs off on him as we can see when he goes to make his own crystal and tries to make money on the side. 

Up to Problem Dog I have always felt that Jesse was a good person that has circumstantially done bad things. But after his speech at the support group, I believe he has come to grips with what he has done and has decided that he can no longer redeem himself as a human being. So, he's a bad guy now.

Belvedere markets itself as being made from Polish potatoes.  Grey Goose markets itself as being French quality.  The impurities and distinctions between vodkas is a product of the demands of marketing - not for the purpose of creating a superior vodka - because the purest most perfect vodka could be made from distilling municipal tap water and adding the right quantity of ethanol.

There is a principle in ecology called the competitive exclusion principle.  It states that no two species occupying the same niche, or ecological role, can coexist indefinitely.  The mnemonic to remember it is CCCC:  Complete Competitors Cannot Coexist.

Basically, there would be double competition for most niches.  Some species would go extinct, some would dominate their niches, some would adapt, and some would partition their niches so that they could both exist.  My initial thought is that in the end there would be less biodiversity than each ocean had beforehand.

Still, if I could read minds or see the other side of playing cards, or make dice land on sevens, I sure wouldn't let the world know.

I never felt nearly as annoyed when watching Zero no Tsukaima as I did when watching Shana season 2, because at least ZnT was light hearted and fun. SnS, however, tries to take itself too seriously, which worked well for the first season because there was enough character development going on to make it feel good. However, in season 2 the characters mostly just stop developing, but it still tries to be very serious, so you end up with very little reason to come back and watch more. If the characters aren't changing much and the humor is very sparse, then the only thing left is the overarching story, which itself got kind of bland in S2 as well (oh Bel Masque is back... again...).","1314838271"

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","*Here they were, two mortal enemies, locked in a battle for the silent yellow pegasus lying on the ground. One enormous, slimy foe, driven by hunger alone, defended what it had previously assumed to be an easy meal. The other, a tiny rainbow blur in flight, defended one of the best friends she had ever known.*

*Rainbow Dash was doing her very best to keep Fluttershy's unconscious body in sight. She had to protect her. She had to. And yet, she found herself at times unable to keep her eyes off of the hydra she was fighting. The light that glinted off its hide was somehow mesmerizing, each scale sparkling like a tiny waterfall as the hydra dodged Dash's attacks. Dumb as the beast was, it also had an otherworldly sense of animal intelligence that took the pony by surprise.
Though it was no match for Rainbow's superior flying skills, the beast was still quite a fighter - and Rainbow admired that.*

*Ultimately, Rainbow beat down the hydra. Though she took a few good hits from the creature's talons, she managed to kick and slam each head into submission. With a cacophony of whines and roars, the monster turned its enormous form around and took off into Froggy Bottom Bog, soon disappearing into the inky gloom. Although Rainbow gave no chase, she allowed herself a few moments to watch the oddly-graceful creature. She had enjoyed this fight more than most. The hydra was certainly a worthy opponent, and not just for its size. Even though it had the worst of intentions, Rainbow admired the creature. In fact... even though it was a different species altogether, and one hundred times her size...*

*""Come on, Dash, that's just crazy talk. Fluttershy still needs your help, so get your head in the game,"" she muttered to herself, floating down towards the pony in question. But as she lifted the unconscious pony on her shoulders and began to carry her out of the swamp, Rainbow Dash knew that she would be back.*

1. Follow the instructions and Flash [CF-Root](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1103399&amp;)

2. Install something like Titanium Backup and backup all your data and apps (you'll need another apps for backing up SMS and Call log, I us My Backup Pro for this since I bought it before I got TB. But I believe ""Ritesh Sahu""'s free apps works just as well.)

3. Download a custom rom and put it at the root of your SD card. My mom's on [VillainRom](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1198334) while I've moved on to [Cognition](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1124396). (I suspect Cognition might be comparable/better, but I have never tested standby battery life on it. The way I use my phone they barely last 10 hours).

4. Boot in to ClockworkMod Recovery (you'll see an icon called CWM in your app drawer after step 1, goi in there, click ""reboot into clockworkmod recovery).

5. In CWM, wipe data (only the first time you flash a new rom, no need to do this for most upgrades in the future), cache, and then ""Install zip from sdcard"" and find the zip you downloaded.

For more details, read the instruction on the rom you're trying to flash.


All the ""do at your own risk"" blah blah blah apply.

But honestly tho', if you really use the phone so little, you might want to consider selling your SGS2 and getting something less powerful, with smaller screen, etc that has longer battery life?

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Kamigawa was already nearly finished when Mirrodin was found to be so powerful. Wotc snuck Granulate into Fifth Dawn when they found out about Skullclamp, to little effect. They also threw Pithing Needle into Saviors but it was too little, too late.

R&amp;D severely underestimated the ease of getting cheap artifacts out. They likely expected Broodstar to dominate, so artifacts would have needed to stick around instead of [wanting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=247201) to [die](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=49090). Add spiritcraft and Soulshift into this hypothetical environment and they're actually (somewhat) competitive. Since then they have been much more careful with ""free stuff"". It took until the final Alara set for Wizards to release another ""gimme"" mechanic in Cascade, and even then it was only on a handful of cards. Which all require you to play an overcosted card to get lesser-costing free stuff.

Ravnica introduced hybrid mana, making multiple-color decks extremely simple to build and play. Instead of worrying about color fixing, people could just put a multicolor deck together without worry. Furthermore, it provided ten different guilds to align oneself with (each with its own two legendary creatures), and as many differing mechanics to exploit.

There was no shortage of big creatures for Timmy players that could be cast simply by Convoking your smaller creatures, or small creatures that turned into Bloodthirsty fatties. Johnny players loved the quirkiness of the Izzet, and Simic's combo potential. Spikes were ecstatic at the dual lands, Transmute tutors, Dredge brokenness, and the crazy synergy and removal that comes from running white and black.

Contrasting to both of these, is Kamigawa. A set full of slightly overcosted legends. Legends, by definition, are difficult to build your deck around. You want to have your creature out, but more than one is a dead draw. It was dominated by Mirrodin, either by Affinity or its natural enemies (Red Deck Wins, Tooth and Nail). Some cards saw play, sure. But the majority of Kamigawa sat on the sidelines while artifact creatures were eating faces. Then Ravnica dropped. Easy to play, easy to identify with. Kamigawa was old! It was the next to die! You like smashing through the enemy lines, regardless of the consequences? You're Gruul! You want to sit back and control the field, while bleeding your enemy out? Orzhov! Nobody gave [Thief of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=77920) or [Wicked Akuba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=50432) a second thought. Why build a deck around spirits and arcane spells, when you could be pinging away with a nigh-immortal Ghost Council of Orzhova?

**tl;dr** Kamigawa was stuck between one of the most powerful blocks of all time and one of the most loved blocks of all time. It just fell between the cracks.","1314838290"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There are several ways.  One of the branches of the military is an option, but there are some pros and cons you should consider before going that route:

Pros: They will of course pay for your school, as well as give you a monthly living stipend of around 2500. You will be commissioned as an officer upon graduation from med school (only if you do a military residency-more on this later).  FYI, a residency is the post-medical school training you receive in the hospital that can be anywhere in the range of 3-7 years, depending on the specialty.

Cons: When I interviewed for HPSP (the name of the military scholarship), I was informed that you will owe a debt of service to the military for the amount of time you are in medical school PLUS the time of your residency (if you do a civilian one-a military residency counts as time served).  What they DIDNT tell me was that if you do a civilian residency, the time served does not start to count until AFTER you complete that residency.  So to do the math, you'd graduate from med school (if you started right now) at 34, finish a residency at the earliest by 37, and be 44 by the time you'd paid off your service debt. For a comparison, this is about the same age (give or take a couple years) you'd finish paying off your loan debt if you'd started med school in your mid twenties.

At that point you might as well stick around for the pension. Also keep in mind that the military does not operate its training hospitals just anywhere.  Your choice of location would not only be dictated to you, but also quite limited. This is not one of those 'join the army, see the world' deals. Living the life of a career officer can put strain on family and relationships (in addition to the already busy and personally taxing life of a physician), and you need to be sure that's something you want to do. Every single person I know at my med school who are is HPSP is doing so because they have prior experience in the military or are at least familiar with the military lifestyle.

Now, you don't have to go the military route. You can do what's called a loan forgiveness program through the Health Corps. Basically, they pay for your school and you commit to serve in a poor rural area for a number of years. Once your time's up, you walk away debt free. Why doesn't everyone do this, you ask?  Well, you don't get paid much for one (you're not going to be supporting a family on that stipend), and two the spots are hyper-competitive.  Think thousands of applicants for around a hundred slots competitive.

There are also debt forgiveness programs for docs pledging to do primary care, although I haven't researched these enough yet to give you concrete advice on them.


Also, most doctors (unless they work for a large healthsystem or under an HMO) do not get paid a salary. The vast majority of physicians perform procedures or do exams in their private offices or at hospitals and then bill insurance companies or the government for the expenses later. As any doc will tell you, they almost never get reimbursed the full amount.

This is starting to change, however, as the younger generation of physicians is realizing the difficulty of managing family life alongside the 60-80 hr/wk and up workweeks of the physician. More and more doctors are opting to take positions outside of private practice, preferring instead to work as employees for a salary. I think that I'm ultimately going to fall into this category as well.  I know a lot of physician's children that despise their doctor parents for not being around all that much. 

The best piece of advice (and tough love) I can give you is DONT GO INTO IT FOR THE MONEY. Medicine is changing, and in a few years, reimbursement rates for doctors are going to be far lower than they are now, and the costs of medical school are only going to go up for the forseeable future. NPs and other mid-level providers are going to be more empowered to take on primary care provider roles as our already-overspent Medicare and Medicaid programs dry up-and there's nothing anyone can do about it-there just isn't enough money to keep the current system going.  What this means is that you're going to have to work hard to find a niche as a specialist, or accept being paid a LOT less.

What's the bottom line here?  The workload, stresses on your personal life, and financial costs are immense, and medicine is only a profession you should enter if you feel that the reward of helping others live healthier, happier lives offsets those costs.","1314838292"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I can't speak for Reddit as a whole, but personally I find truthers frustrating and sometimes enraging because it seems to me a) a whole lot of wasted effort and intelligence b) a distraction from far more provable and addressable outrages and c) an example of a particularly terrifying kind of confirmation bias, the kind suffered by smart people with a lot of info but also with an agenda and a hypnotic over-analysis that allows for total bass-ackwards conclusions; not so much failing to see the forest for the trees, but staring so closely for so long at the trees that you begin to insist that it's not a forest at all.  As usual [Randy said it best](http://xkcd.com/258/).     

Tho I should caveat that I can understand the appeal - yeah, it's counter-intuitive that big buildings would collapse after being hit by planes.  But there are plausible enough explanations of how it happened, and I find them way more plausible on the whole than the generally vague and sometimes downright ridiculous alternate theories.  Show me a complete, plausible theory of how and when explosives were planted, how that was kept completely silent, and a coherent motivation, and I'll take another look.  But it seems that most truther effort is spent on freeze-framing and circling things, which way madness lies.

Highschool photography class... Some of  my friends had to go around town to get some pictures to develop their selves for a group project. They deiced to head down and not do anything for the rest of class.  One of the guys said ""get ready with the camera"" and started walking down to the lake towards this mother and 2 kids.  This is the picture that was taken that day...

The mother started flipping out screaming for police... And guess how was right down the road...  They split up bolted out the hell out of there!

2 of them ended up running towards city hall to hide.  One of them being a quick thinker saw the mayor and started talking to him telling him they wanted to get an interview for the school news paper...  I guess the police ended up coming in there and walked right by the 2 guys and didn't say a word...

The guy that ended up pushing the kid in the water did get caught and had to do some community service.

But, we still have this picture... It speaks a million words...

**Pusher** - Just looking to get a good picture...

**Mother** - Shocked as she sees her kid being pushed in to the water...

**Kid 1 (left)** - Derping...

**Kid 2 (right)** - Wet, face first in water, feet up in the air, did not see it coming...

Eisenhorn is an ordo xenos inquisitor, but it wasn't until pretty late in his investigation that there were any xenos involved. One would think that most of what he was doing would fall under the jurisdiction of the Ordo Hereticus. I believe that this partly has to do with the nature of space travel in the 41st millenium. Eisenhorn's investigation was contained within only one subsector, but travel between even those relatively close planets takes weeks or months.  If every inquisitor was required to turn over their investigation to another ordo when something fell out of their purview, the threat may have gotten much worse when the appropriate inquisitor arrived to handle it. As such, an inquisitor has supreme authority in any investigation, except in cases where a more experienced or knowledgeable inquisitor is also present.","1314838345"

An abortion should be a medical procedure utilized when necessary.  It shouldn't be done arbitrarily unless you can determine a clear cut ""point of no return"".

For example, I think we can all agree that aborting a baby a minute before the mother goes into labor would be murder.  For all intents and purposes, that baby is as fully developed as it needs to be to be born.  

From this point we simply start moving backwards.  At what point can a baby be born and survive?  That is probably the point at which abortions should be illegal.  That point would also have to be determined by a doctor since babies develop at different rates.   ","1314838349"

I know all about Dubstep now, but before I'd actually talked ot any real dubstep enthusiasts about it, I'd only heard skrillex (literally - not just similar artists), and only a few times.  Finally, one day, there was this really nice speaker setup and I loved Cinema and Scary Monsters.  I looked his stuff up, and started listen to other popular artists in that genre.

Now, my favorite artist is Glitch Mob, and one of my favorites is Skream.  I like both sides, and understand both, but I didn't become intelligent after my first listen to Skream.

Tinkering around for awhile with it, learning IT, as it were.  Me and my brother went to a Best Buy so I could check out some cool software.

Brother gets annoyed that he can't get onto the display models (passworded using 3rd party software).  I offhandedly mentioned that he could probably still get into the BIOS when the computer boots up, so he'd let me get back to shopping around, figuring he'd find something else to do.

Yeahhhhhmmm, he didn't know what BIOS was, but, he caught the part where he could get into the computer as it booted up... ~30-40 min later he grabs my arm and says, ""We've gotta go.  We've gotta go, RIGHT NOW.""  And drags me after him out of the store.

Turns out he wasn't just happy to be able to get into the BIOS, when I finally had a chance to ask him ""What the hell?""  He said he'd gone into the BIOS of all the computers and randomly changed stuff.  He had a knack for vengeance and all, but I seriously doubt he could have gotten to every display model there, even on a slow day -RIGHT??  We didn't go back to that Best Buy for a long, long time.


(EDIT:  I've always worked on my own gear and habitually password the BIOS of my home PC.  And Packard Hell, I should probably thank you.  By shipping my computer with the incorrect windows disk and then sending me incorrect replacement boot disks no less than 4 times, I finally gave up and learned to fix the thing myself.)","1314838369"

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","I am going to get blasted for this, especially by women and I mean all the respect to them, but I am going to come across the wrong way. Like I mentioned earlier, I am hypothyroid with low sex drive. It was once not this way. I loved looking at girls and marveling at their beauty, but now I am empty and numb. Does this bother me? A little, I would be a liar if I told you differently. But at the same time, I never long for female companionship for two reasons 1) I am sexually disabled and 2) I cannot relate to women. I can however still see girls and be attracted to them, however my body doesn't connect the two like before. Which brings me to companionship; I am socially awkward. I cannot talk to people easily and I find girls very difficult to communicate with. I don't really share their hobbies or their personalities. In my mind, I always viewed them as sexual partners and not companions (this is what I was getting at ladies) and my only reasoning to communicate with them mostly was to get into their pants. To this day, I still desire for that, but mentally it isn't the same anymore. I have to turn to drugs to get my fix. It is all the same to me, whatever makes my dopamine receptors or serotonin increase, it makes me happy and drugs are a good substitute for that. Would I like sex? Of course. Can I get it? Not really physically (I've been in situations) and metally. It is always nice to have people to talk to though, but after awhile I become drained and I want to be on my way. It takes me years in order to come out of my shell, and even then I do 30% of the talking, and because of my uncertainty I am happy to be alone a lot. This is why I am okay at college by myself.

After that, make a sploof by stuffing dryer sheets into the cardboard toilet paper. Blow hits out into this. There will be no scent remaining. Stoned showers feel awesome, as well!

I read on 420chan that most college smoke detectors can't detect weed smoke. The dude said he blew hits out into the detectors as a cool party trick that freaked everyone out. I find this hard to believe, and 420chan isn't really that reliable a source of information.

* *According to the report, those provisions - which come largely as a result of EU demands - would result in more dollars flowing out of Canada and in increased Canadian consumer prices. Moreover, the report acknowledges that the incremental IP reforms are unlikely to increase spending on research and development* ([source](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5691/125/))
* *The Globe covers a new report that projects that the proposed Canada - European Union Trade Agreement could add nearly $3 billion in additional costs to provincial drug plans. * ([source](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/5624/196/))
* *European Union negotiators want access to procurement competitions in an extensive list of Canadian cities, utilities and Crown corporations in a market they estimate is worth $86 billion, according to confidential EU briefing notes provided to Embassy. … Canada doesn't necessarily have procurement interests in the EU that equal the same value, but will balance out the negotiations with items from other areas, he continued. ([source](http://www.embassymag.ca/page/view/eu-02-10-2010))
* *In conclusion, because a potential Canada-EU economic agreement has the potential to adversely impact intermediaries operating in full compliance with domestic law, and deprive Canadian consumer access to the full benefits of the 21st Century Market, the Canada-EU trade negotiating process should be as open and transparent as possible.* ([ebay on CETA](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/4709/125/))","1314838392"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;Implementing uniforms just seems like a way to sweep the issue under the rug. I don't advocate stamping out individuality in a group of people who are struggling every day with their identities. Personal expression is very important in the age group targeted by this t-shirt, and putting an end to it in one of the main arenas accessible to those children will not solve the problem either.

This is part of my original post. American children have a lot more to worry about in terms of education than what they're wearing. Schools abroad, for the most part, enforce a uniform dress code. Most students will still find a way to express themselves by modifying those uniforms. Individuality isn't stamped out simply because a dress code is enforced. It is an acceptable way to solve this problem that has been used and is continuously being used abroad. The cognitive dissonance associated with uniforms is a better price to pay than the consequences of allowing personal expression as you see it.

&gt;No one expects society to change on its own. That's why there was a petition to have this shirt removed. That's why people submitted reviews of the shirt voicing their disapproval. That's why an article was written about the damaging message found on this shirt. Individual members of society may seem insignificant on their own, but when they believe that something is wrong, and take actions to right that wrong, they can be pretty powerful.

This seems a tad hyperbolic in relation to the issue at hand. I'm going to assume JCPenny took this down to try not to tarnish their brand and to keep people complaining about this particular shirt quiet. That doesn't mean there won't be another shirt out that delivers the message but is more covert about it. 

&gt;School administrations are not individual members of societies. They're bureaucracies. It would be wonderful if every middle school principal decided to hold an assembly on the dangers of misogynistic or misandristic language, but it's not going to happen. I would much rather schools stick to teaching academic subjects and see instances of personal involvement bring about societal change.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't your original argument state that school administrators are part of society and thus can be influenced just like the rest of society? If that is the case the absolutely they can hold assemblies about the things you've stated. Just like they can have assemblies and classes about drugs and just like they can teach sexual education. If you're willing to fight for corporations to stop selling shirts like these with such conviction, you should be willing to fight for schools to teach awareness of these things with the same conviction.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","I didn't really have anyone who inspired me to start playing, and after almost 5 years I still don't have a ""guitar hero"". The idea of being able to play just seemed cool to me. When I first started with lessons (my first experience playing), I hadn't even thought about the kind of music I wanted to play. My teacher taught me to read sheet music by having me play some simple tunes and exercises he wrote, which I was fine with. He had me playing these exercises for more than a year before I started learning my first full songs. He helped me learn some easy Led Zeppelin and GnR songs, which I didn't really care for. At the time I listened to a lot of alternative rock, but had a very undeveloped ear and hardly paid attention to the guitar in the music that I listened to. Over a few years my tastes changed and I started getting into mellow and indie rock. I bought a book that had more than a dozen Dispatch songs and learned most of those. I slowly got more into Dispatch and eventually became a huge fan. One of the band's three members, Chad Urmston, was the closest thing to a guitar hero that I ever had. He really only plays rhythm and is far from what anyone might consider a guitar god, but I always liked the way his hands looked when he played, so as any envious kid does I gradually copied his habits and mannerisms as my skill improved over the years. As it turns out, I now sound very similar to him whenever I play because I developed similar habits and a gentle touch that uses subtle nuances in articulation to shape my tone like his. It was sort of an accident; I just wanted my hands movements to look efficient, gentle, and deliberate like Chad's. More recently I'm getting into playing blues, still without any guitar god to admire and learn from along my journey. However, listening to Dispatch has given me a great appreciation for rhythm guitar and the subtleties of playing that are essential to the blues. So, while by no means a trio of guitar gods, Dispatch, and in particular Chad Urmston, has inspired me to play in a sort of indirect way.","1314838417"

"bisexual","t5_2qwnx","I didn't say that **your** sexuality can change.
No one is saying that it's quick or predictable or under anyone's control or even common in people who are very gay or very straight. It's uncommon for people at the extremes to have plastic sexuality simply because those that do drift toward the middle, but it is very common for people in the middle to shift drastically along the continuum througout their lifetimes.

As an analogy, all I'm saying is ""appendixes explode sometimes."" and you're hearing ""all appendixes explode always for sure and there's nothing you can do to stop it."" 

Get a grip man. 


Let me state it clearly. This is nonsense:

*""When a bisexual person says ""sexuality is fluid and on a continuum and can change"" that offends some gay people. Why? It insinuates that their homosexuality can altered and they could turn straight.""*

That some people are fluid and some are not is not grounds to say or even think that a homosexual can be made straight or think that that is even a sensible goal. Frankly if I thought that could be done, I'd do the opposite - I'd make tons of people gay in the hopes that it might create in them a semblance of respect for those that are different and thereby end discrimination of LGBT communities.

In fact, I think they'd have the exact same problem Hannibal did: the marines can't take Rome.

"swtor","t5_2qxih","I'm also playing a sniper in Beta - I'm only 13 right now though. I was wondering how fun they are as I gain more levels, as right now I'm not having that much fun. I absolutely love the damage, I crit constantly and its cool, but I have two big qualms with the class:

First, I think cover is inherently flawed. It's *necessary* to do big damage, but hard to stay in in pvp. Since it's such a crutch mechanic, the balance is weird. If I stay unnoticed in PvP I do a ton of damage, but if I'm seen and someone comes up to me I'm essentially screwed. I don't like mechanics like this. Does it improve with more abilities?

Second, as I said before I love the dps. But is that what the class will be end-game? Just hiding behind a wall raining damage on enemies in PvE or PvP? That doesn't seem that engaging (although critting and taking 50-60% of the enemy's HP out in 1 shot is pretty satisfying).

I rolled one because I think the concept is cool. As I play, though, I'm having second thoughts. What is your overall opinion of the class?","1314838430"

I think he had something like 2 or 3 successful implants. He was removed from his university position, in part because he kept trying, and got no useful results.

Prior to using beagles, he used greyhounds- animals that were purchased from the Phoenix greyhound park. When PGP found out what was happening to these dogs, they were so appalled that they ordered such releases be halted, under penalty of trainers being excluded from racing their dogs at Phoenix.

Meanwhile, [Covance Labs](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Covance_Laboratories) (with a facility in Phoenix metro) breeds more beagles for experimental purposes than any other source.","1314838461"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Here's the thing, I agree with you, but to a point. Certain things aren't taste based, such as classic music. Now, you may not enjoy classical music and that's entirely fine, but you'd have to be an idiot to say that it's bad. To say ""Beethovens' 5th is a shitty piece"" is entirely wrong, only an idiot would say that.

Now, Transformers 2 is an absolute piece of shit in every manner possible. It is absolutely bad, there is nothing redeeming about it whatsoever. If you think it's good, which most people who enjoyed it do, you are a fucking idiot.

Now do you see what I'm trying to say? Yeah, of course everything is based on taste, but at the root of it, most things do meet criteria which allows one to deem it bad or good.

Party Rock isn't a ""bad"" song musically speaking, but it's so generic, static, monotonous, and boring that I wouldn't call it good. I fucking hate the song, but it's not an absolute piece of shit like Transformers 2.

she was working for a group trying to provide internet access and skills to the poor.
Everyone else had gone out for the day. The doorbell rang, when i answered it there was a large women standing there with a baby in her arms. She started taking to me in the local language and I tried to tell her i didn't understand. She then tried to tell me in french, pointing to the baby and then to her face alot, I tried to tell her that i was sorry but still didn't understand and that my sister would be home soon and to come back later. 
She then handed me the baby and walked off! I freaked out, she came back after only a minute or so laughing and smiling and took the child back from me.
I later found out she was asking for some money for formula for the baby (this was something my sister often did for her and others) she had only walked around the corner and did it as a joke.
The rest of my family found this to be the funniest thing in the world when given the desription of my face with the child in my arms, I was very embarrest because my ingnorance of languages made that child go hungry for nearly 3 hours but i can laugh about it now.

I smoke on a daily or near daily basis ([0] presently though). I have attended class high maybe a total of 5 times, and those were art classes where I wanted to not have the urge to murder someone after a 3 hour critique. if I'm high in class I am most assuredly not broadcasting the fact to all around me or attempting to distract people who are sober. I also remain focused because I am in college for a reason.

I have never attended a lecture class while high and I do not intend to ever do so. Were I to, however, I would again not be distracting people and would probably say little to nothing given that I'd be high in class and would not want to draw attention to that.

I am a sophomore interior design student. It is not difficult to separate ""work"" and ""play"" (read: class and drugs) and the folks that I've seen high in class do not act anything like the character portrayed in your bigoted comic.

EDIT: I forgot to address your key point. I'm in college because I want an education. Specifically I require a sizable mountain of information regarding my chosen field that I can best obtain in a learning environment such as a university. Drugs never top that.","1314838486"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;I can't think of an industry where this is true. As someone who worked retail through high school I can attest that we did far more business than $15 / hr / employee.

More revenue, or more in profits? Sales/administrative expense is usually high for these kinds of businesses. Starbucks spends more than 60% of its gross operating profit (revenue minus direct cost of goods sold) on sales/administrative expense. Sears Holdings spends almost 90% (check the annual filings, or look them up on [Fool.com](http://caps.fool.com) or some financial website). 
 
&gt;Were salary costs to grow, businesses would be forced to renegotiate the remaining aspects of their budgets, not merely the employee share. This would drive down business waste.

Renegotiations would hurt the businesses in question and their providers. Almost doubling the minimum wage would probably force many to go under entirely. Furthermore, who is to decide that other expenses are ""business waste"" rather than just operational requirements?

&gt;On the flip side, newly enriched employees

if they existed

&gt;would have more money to spend and therefore become more beneficial to their local economies. Their wages would quickly be converted into revenues for communities they patron.

Increased costs for businesses to pay a wage higher than what the market demands would offset any increases in income for some employees. It's just misdistribution of resources. Businesses provide benefits to the communities they patron, too.

&gt;This is exactly what happens in lower income neighborhoods when wages are increased. Spending goes up. Crime goes down. And neighborhoods that were once impoverished flourish.

Higher real wages are a good thing if they come from increased productivity. If they come from a price floor on labor, the higher wages just apply to fewer people anyway and are harmful to workers who get their hours cut or get fired, and to businesses which have to bear added costs.

He's written [books about squirrels](http://www.amazon.com/Natural-History-Tassel-Eared-Squirrels/dp/0826346553/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314838380&amp;sr=8-1), including a [children's book](http://www.amazon.com/Rascal-Tassel-Eared-Squirrel-Sylvester-Allred/dp/0938216449/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314838380&amp;sr=8-2). Whoever gets the highest grade in the class at the end of the semester gets a signed copy of Rascal!

Anyway, you've so wittingly jumped to an assumption about age whereas I was poking fun at how you were, and are, acting. It's called hypocrisy, cupcake.

All you've pretty much done was rage like a child losing in Call of Duty, throwing around profanities as though they validate your point. Check your undies to make sure all that exertion didn't cause you to skidmark.

*District  3: (electronics)  Former Silicon Valley, so California

*District  4: (fishing)  Way north east;  Nova Scotia or Newfoundland

*District  5: (power)  Former Hoover Dam - so Nevada

*District  6: (transportation)  Since trains are big, as are hovercraft, I'd go for the former Chicago area and the rest of Illinois / Indiana

*District  7: (lumber)  The Pacific Northwest, Oregon / Washington / British Columbia

*District  8: (textiles)  Somewhere with lots of cotton, so the Carolinas / Georgia

*District  9: (grain)  Kansas / Iowa

*District  10: (livestock)  Texas and northern Mexico

*District  11: (agriculture)  Florida and Alabama

*District  12: (mining)  West Virginia / Pennsylvania - mainly because of the proximity to District 13 - it was quick to travel between them

The Nexus Prime is supposed to have a very high resolution.  They will adapt these to smaller screens once it becomes economical to do so.

All of the high resolution screens you see now are pentile matrix screens, like the Droid 3 and Atrix.  Samsung got rid of the pentile matrix with the GSII, which is a HUGE step forward in Super AMOLED technology, much bigger than a resolution bump with similar pentile matrix would have been.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It's generally not possible to bring someone back to life because death is defined as the _irreversible_ cessation of some crucial life process, which as others have pointed out has been breathing, or heartbeat, or neural activity, or something similar. If it's reversible in modern medical usage, it's not death. A stopped heart can be restarted, sometimes as much as thirty to forty minutes later. A comatose person may not breathe on his own, but will once (if) he wakes up.

The threshold right now is at the level of the brain for a few reasons. First is that brain cells start dying pretty damn fast without circulation or oxygen, and generally don't come back. The brain is considered the seat of consciousness and personality, and thus what constitutes a person, and loss of the brain implies death of the individual. But also, frankly, the need for organ donation has made it attractive to be able to declare a person with a dead brain but well-perfused lungs, liver, heart, and kidneys ethically fit for donation.

In some cases, one trades on the differences. True brain death is not real common. Usually there's just an itsy bitsy grain of functioning brain left, but basically no prospect for any sort of meaningful recovery. The patient can still donate by being allowed to die by cardiovascular criteria: ""irreversible"" cessation of the heartbeat after withdrawal of life support. The withdrawal is done in such a way that the dead patient, after a few minutes to ensure no spontaneous return of heartbeat, can be wheeled quickly to an OR and have his organs removed. I have put scare quotes around ""irreversible"" because in these cases the irreversibility is theoretical and practical: one is deliberately withholding further resuscitation (always in accordance with patient wishes), which could in some cases (although unlikely) restore a heartbeat.

That said, irreversibility is practically always determined by some physician's judgement anyway.

**EDIT:** I want to emphasize, I am not condemning the practice of _donation after cardiac death_, and I don't mean to dissuade people from donating. It is completely appropriate to withhold care from patients in cases where A) further care is futile; and/or B) it is the patient's stated or understood (by the family) wish in such-and-such circumstances which are irreversible and terminal not to be maintained by futile care. Donation after cardiac death is only carried out on dead donors. The donors, while alive, had no chance for meaningful recovery and had a grave prognosis. Complete cardiorespiratory collapse, and the completion of brain death, is assured sooner rather than later even with supportive care.","1314838528"

Whether that decision in and of itself is indicative of lacking common sense is another question, but they sacrifice a lot (including getting a ""good"" education, reading, studying the sciences, etc). The fact that he has an academic interest--and yes, poetry and philosophy are academic interests-- says a lot in my book. Personally, I've found some of his recent comments pretty witty (in a sarcastic way):

""I have to do well week 1, because I'm on my mother's fantasy team.""

""For those who actually care about how I'm doing, I'm doing fine, for those who only care about me because of fantasy football, you guys are sick."" 

And now this. (By the way, above is obviously paraphrased)

Most ""Christian churches"", and other religions for that matter, are more about gaining power over others to control them,  They treat people in any way different from them without empathy and compassion, which you have unhappily experienced.

I, as a Christian, find more common cause with you and with the gay, black scholar [Bayard Rustin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayard_Rustin) than with those who proudly proclaim their Christianity to defend that which is shameful.

I don't mean to imply that all women on the internet are being relentlessly bullied. But I have noticed that women are astonishingly good at provoking the kind of internet backlash that male trolls have to work really hard for.

Take the whole Alyssa Bereznak saga. If a male blogger wrote a mildly disparaging article about his date with a high-status female geek, I doubt it would have provoked a similar outrage. Were the geek in question reasonably hot, we'd see a display of geek solidarity and probably a regiment of white knights - but very little outrage.","1314838574"

I did forget to mention that the adjuster won't talk to the patient because the patient has a lawyer (who's office is closed on Wednesdays) who's supposed to handle it. We still can't seek approval for the medication until it's due to be filled for the *month*. Otherwise they will tell us it's too soon and refuse to approve it for a later date.

Also, it is not unheard of for a long term med to be filled in short increments, though it was not the case with Sarah. If a patient is forgetful or can't control themselves enough to get a one-month's supply, they may shorten it to 2 weeks. We even saw someone who got it in 3-4 day increments.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","A few Biblical passages Anthony Navarro Sr. and Jr have overlooked:

&gt;Don't speak evil against each other, my dear brothers and sisters. If you criticize each other and condemn each other, then you are criticizing and condemning God's law. But you are not a judge who can decide whether the law is right or wrong. Your job is to obey it. God alone, who made the law, can rightly judge among us. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to condemn your neighbor? *James 4:11-12*

&gt;Whenever you speak, or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law of love, the law that set you free. For there will be no mercy for you if you have not been merciful to others. But if you have been merciful, then God's mercy toward you will win out over his judgment against you. *James 2:12-13*

&gt;Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. *Ephesians 4:29 - 5:1*

&gt;But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.  Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
&gt;Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. *Luke 6:35-37*","1314838611"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","If they were trespassing, yes.  But trespassing has two parts: 

You have to A) have the authority to tell them to leave (you're the owner, or act on their behalf), and B) they have to not have legal authority to be there. 

Examples of B)
If you've granted (or been forced to grant by law) a right-of-way on the property for instance, or if they're, say, cops, investigating under exigent circumstances, or, unfortunately for these folks, if the person has established residency.  In this case, by tenancy laws, they've granted the person the right to be there, until such time as they leave of their own accord, or they are evicted. 

Unfortunately, since the law explicitly says they have a right to be there, you can't just say ""I'm above the law - they're tresspassing!"" and make it so. ","1314838615"

My suspicion is that, to the extent that people like Mubarak and Gaddafi have any self awareness whatsoever, they might actually want roughly what the protesters want for their countries. They might even agree with the protesters on specific points about what's wrong with their societies. If they really could turn over a new leaf and join the revolution, why not?","1314838615"

They would probably move to Constantinople or Greece and wage wars from there, probably sending archers to your cities where they would fight you in an urban environment where guns lose much of their advantage. 

The best tactic for marines would be to either try and capture Augustus or whichever major enemy they can capture or friend first. You lack legitimacy, so you need to install somebody to rule Rome on your behalf. If marines get Augustus then they could force him to recognize them as friends of Rome while his marine body guards see that he behaves. If Augustus escapes then his enemies are next best thing, install them as rulers of Rome and a few marines will tip the scale when you would later have to fight legions of Augustus. ","1314838620"

Hitler's persecution of the Poles had squat to do with their Catholicism.  He co-opted the German Catholic Church and most Nazis were Catholic.  Hitler often publicly spoke of the need for God and that he was doing God's work.  Heck, the official SS belt buckle had the motto ""God is with us"" as part of its design.

For that matter, do you think Hitler invented pogroms against Jews?  Persecution of Jews is a long European Catholic tradition stretching back many centuries.  Hitler just made it an industrial process.

As far as atheism goes, Hitler prohibited atheism, burned atheist books, and persecuted atheists.

Whether or not Hitler was personally a Catholic or Christian is somewhat debatable, there are some records of him saying some pretty anti-Christian stuff in private.  But his public face was always that of a devout Christian, if for no other reason than that the average German of the era was a devout Christian (mostly Catholic) and he had to appeal to them.","1314838632"

C++ redistributables of 2005 and 2008 are needed to run any games or apps you have installed that require them! A vague answer, but true. Google for the links to download them again if required, then uninstall them and see [no pun] what, if anything, breaks.

Back in the pre 1700s (going from memory) everything was called a ""law"". It was then considered that the term ""law"" was not accurate enough given the domains of science, so it was changed to the scientific definition of ""theory"" which we use today.

We still refer to Gravity as a law, but it is actually: ""The Theory of Universal Gravitation, or The Theory of General Relativity"" when you get right down to it. The usage of the word ""law"" is depricated, we only use it currently in common language, even though it is out of date.

Maybe they are fishing for compliments and are immature, *because they're young and just starting out*. Who the hell are you to decide that this subreddit is only for the over 30 crowd now? And I'm sure the redditor whose name reads as ""Fuck You Newb"" is generally full of love for strangers on the internet. This is what pisses me off about this forum - you think you're all brave and bold by ""calling it like you see it"" but really it's cowardly cos you're doing it under an alias and anonymously over the internet, with zero proof that you have any talent of your own. 

&gt;If OP thinks that this particular photo was their best, I shudder to think what other garbage they thing is on par with it.

Firstly, you don't have to click the goddamn link in the first place so why it's an issue for you baffles the fuck out of me. Secondly, just insulting someone won't help them produce better work, so what's the point? Just to be a dick, it would seem. Congrats. 

&gt;Where every ""work of art"" is to be praised in some way. Where it is impolite to call garbage, garbage out of fear that it would hinder the artist rather than motivate. 

They don't *have to be praised in some way*, you don't even have to visit the image. And you can just as easily click the downvote button. Instead phukunewb chose to come here just to hate and not offer anything constructive other than that. And then you defend that as absolutely the right thing. At this point, I'm not even trying to defend this or any other image, just the notion that it'd be really nice to see some fucking courtesy shown to total strangers that share our mutual hobby.

It's fine to pay the private sector to still develop the spacecraft (as it really has from the beginning), but there is never going to be a private customer for a manned mission to mars until the government buys one first and reduces it to common practice like it did with the launching of satellites and people. 

NASA has only ever really gone wrong when they decided they could develop spacecraft in-house rather than outsource the development to private companies -- go look up the problems that eventually brought down the original shuttle replacement -- the unmanned X-33 and later VentureStar.","1314838714"

"ihaveissues","t5_2s90u","Sounds like you've taken the first step already - you realized there's a problem and want to do something about it. That's huge, but it is just the first step. Issues like this will inevitably destroy a relationship, given enough time. 

Insecurity and distrust are things I deal with too, and it's not easy. The best advice I can give you is what giigu already said - see a therapist. Having someone to talk to can help in a lot of ways. It gives you an opportunity to vent, provides a sanity check for your behavior and will hopefully give you some ways to deal with your issues constructively. You may also want to see a doctor - they can check your bloodwork and see if you have any genetic pre-disposition towards anxiety or chemical imbalances that are making the situation worse. I was recently prescribed Ativan for anxiety and it has helped level me out somewhat. YMMV, but it's worth looking into. Ultimately though, therapy is going to be a better long-term solution.

It sounds like this guy is a good friend, someone worth keeping around. Talk with him about this, if you haven't already. Let him know that you know your behavior isn't ok, and that you're actively doing something to change that. Tell him how much you value your friendship and ask him to be patient with you - this isn't something that's going to change overnight, it will take time. 

Try to focus on what's important: that you have someone who cares about you and wants to be in your life. When you remember that it's easier not to get caught up in the little things. 

Best of luck! :)","1314838717"

Is there some other way that money could be spent that would save more lives, like better seatbelts for the back seat or free cancer screenings?

The benefit here is rather small. if each latch adds $10 to the price of a car, it costs the country $50M a year.  If the government had to pay to put those things in, they'd never do it.","1314838721"

He changed the outcome of the chief's conquest single handedly. At point he rowed up a river to a village that didn't support the chief, anchored his boat across the river, and just began shooting everyone. Despite having spears and bows the villagers couldn't reach him, nor could they run. He killed so many of them that they eventually began stacking dead bodies to use as barriers to hide from him.","1314838721"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Um, again, I'm not endorsing the way the Cheney/W. Bush office was run, but, to address your point:



What Nixon did *was* illegal.  So to say it's not illegal because the President is doing it, which is what your quote says, is meaningful.



But, in the case of Bush/Cheney, it's a different thing -- neither laws nor the Constitution were violated.



The President can listen to any advisor he or she sees fit.  It can be a named cabinet member, a member of the public, his own wife if he wants to.  At the end of the day, the decisions are his, and his signature is his, regardless of who helped him make the decisions.  There are no laws saying he can't take the advice of those around him. 



Plus, not that this is the main point, Cheney was voted in as well.  And the fact is that people who voted for them (the so-called ""Red State"" voters) knew what Cheney was all about, and nearly all of the conservative voters are perfectly happy with the decisions he and Bush made.  They miss them, in fact, now that Obama is in office.



So I don't see how the Nixon situation even compares, quite frankly.  Nixon broke into the opposition headquarters, wiretapped conversations, used those recordings to his political advantage, breaking dozens of laws in the process.  Bush took counsel from the people around him.  How are these two even similar?","1314838764"

Unless you don't believe your consciousnesses is the same from one moment to the next anyway, as some people are suggesting, it matters quite a bit if the person on the other end of that machine is ""you"" or not. It might not matter to anyone else because there is indeed no way for them to tell the difference, in fact if the machine worked as advertised there is no possible test to distinguish a difference.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;Yeah, but animal testing might not catch these things.

True, but as in all scientific research, the *likelihood* of an reaction is what's measured. 

&gt;It's a myth that they care about the long term effects, there are a ton of poisonous and carcinogenic cosmetic products out there right now.

Which is why we need more long-term studies. Involving animals. 

&gt;Just look a sunblock, there's so much controversy over the carcinogenic ingredients that there's a dispute over whether it's worse than the cancer you get from not wearing it or not.

Not familiar with a ""big"" controversy. I know that there's some dispute over vitamin A increasing growth of existing cancers, but the risks of not using sunblock far, *far* outweigh the risks of using sunblock. Also, I'm perfectly fine with a few carcinogens in my products, I just want to know that their degree of toxicity, routes of absorption, retention times and affected tissues don't make routine usage a problem. I mean, steak's got [heterocyclic amines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterocyclic_amine), but there's no way in heck I'm not going to chow down on a good brisket occasionally.

&gt;Also, you mention how a ""safe"" product can change into something more dangerous when mixed with the wrong chemicals or enzymes, that can also happen after animal testing.

Again, absolutely true, but as I mentioned above, I'm just concerned with the likelihood of a product being toxic. Since a cosmetic is being applied to the skin, I'd like to know what will happen during routine usage. A rabbit model give a good simulation what'll happen in humans. As for solvents in clothing... I'd hope they test their product on the animals after the product's been exposed to some detergents, some pH changes, and a few other commonly-occurring chemical treatments that people experience during the course of the day. That said, you can't test for everything, and if a product *does* turn out to be dangerous, that's what recalls and class-action lawsuits are for.

&gt;Animal testing is not to make sure it's safe, just to make sure they can sell it.

Yeah... And? Look, you're never going to make a corporation anything less than a manipulative, sociopathic entity with nigh-endless economic and political ambitions. Those traits are exactly what make them so effective at producing crap we love. The current laws are aimed at making production of an unsafe product unprofitable, which is the only thing corporations care about. The success or failure of those aims are not an indictment of the use of animal testing, but rather of the laws concerning the scale and length of that testing, and the fines involved after release of the product.","1314838776"

&gt; The youth replied, 'Throwing starfish back into the ocean.'
&gt; The surf is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them back, &gt; they'll die.
&gt; 'Son,' the man said, 'don't you realize there are miles and miles of

&gt; After listening politely, the boy bent down, picked up another

&gt; he said, 'I made a difference for that one.'

&gt;At the same time as some scientists were suggesting we might be facing another ice age, a greater number published contradicting studies. Their papers showed that the growing amount of greenhouse gasses that humans were putting into the atmosphere would cause much greater warming – warming that would a much greater influence on global temperature than any possible natural or human-caused cooling effects.

&gt;By 1980 the predictions about ice ages had ceased, due to the overwhelming evidence contained in an increasing number of reports that warned of global warming. Unfortunately, the small number of predictions of an ice age appeared to be much more interesting than those of global warming, so it was those sensational 'Ice Age' stories in the press that so many people tend to remember.

&gt;The fact is that around 1970 there were 6 times as many scientists predicting a warming rather than a cooling planet. Today, with 30+years more data to analyse, we've reached a clear scientific consensus: 97% of working climate scientists agree with the view that human beings are causing global warming.","1314838788"

You can't carpet bomb your way to victory when you're fighting a decentralized force like the Viet Cong/Taliban. You'll kill a bunch of people you didn't mean to kill and miss all of the bad guys who are smart enough to stay out of the open. 


That's one of the reasons we're using drones now instead of hundreds of 750lb bombs. We can take out specific targets in real time without creating dozens of brand new enemies by destroying everything in a 10 mile radius to take out one or two high value targets. ","1314838808"

Then he asks me how badly I want the bread. I'm even more perplexed, but answer anyway, telling him I kinda need the bread because we're out and my family has to eat tonight and everything else is closed.
The baker does some calculations, and tells me ""ok, that'll be $685 please!""
After arguing he told me the last guy only earned $11k/year, has plenty of food at home, and has no family to feed at all, thus justifying the difference.
""Because after all"", the baker says, ""what are you gonna do? Not buy the bread? You're free to do so and not feed your family tonight. After all, it's a free market!""

If animal models have shown no benefit, decades of well-conducted research has shown no benefit, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacoavailability studies show no site activation... why on earth would *any* oversight board consent to a trial occurring?

Plenty of people are willing to die for preposterously stupid reasons.  Part of the ideology behind modern society is that we seek to reduce those deaths because we value lives more than their misguided opinions.

That differences should be obvious but feeble minded people like you hear the word ""security"" and freak out instead of thinking.","1314838866"
