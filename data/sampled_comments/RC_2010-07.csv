"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","From the OED :  
German Pumpernickel, Pompernickel, Bompernickel black bread, especially of the type characteristic of Westphalia (mid 17th cent.; earlier apparently in sense ‘lout’ (1628 as pumpernikel: see note); compare later regional (southern) use in sense ‘vivacious child’, ‘a small plump person or child’), probably &lt; early modern German pumper fart (1558 in this sense; German regional (Austria) Pumper) or its etymon pumpern to knock, fall noisily (Middle High German pumpern, of ultimately imitative origin (compare BUMP v.1, BUMP n.1); compare -ern -ER suffix5) + Nickel, pet-form of the male fore-name Nikolaus Nicholas. Compare French pumpernickel (1765; also as bonpournickel).
  Although the meaning of the earliest attestation of the word in German is not entirely certain, it is clearly depreciative. As applied to bread it was apparently also originally depreciative and was perhaps originally applied to Westphalian bread by outsiders. This type of bread was probably so called either on account of its being difficult to digest and causing flatulence or in a more general allusion to its hardness and poor quality.
  For evidence that the name was unknown in Westphalia in the early 17th cent., compare: 
  1617 F. MORYSON Itinerary III. 50 That West-Phalians deuoure..browne bread (vulgarly cranck broat, that is, sicke bread).(With cranck in cranck broat compare CRANK adj.3).
  From the 17th cent. onwards a popular etymology is found that the name derives from French bon pour Nicol ‘good (only) for Nicol’, Nicol being taken as the name of a horse, and the form bon pour Nicol is actually found in early modern German in allusion to this. This is reflected in the form bonpournikel (compare also French bonpournickel","1277942417"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It's not a ""claim"". Almost every economist whose view I've read on this situation, be they rigid Austrians or Keynesians, has agreed that stimulus spending was needed. Low interest rates certainly did feed the bubble throughout the 2000's, but that was the fault of the Greenspan/Friedman acolytes who ignored all of the lessons that were learned during and after the Great Depression. 

There IS a clear and grave danger of long-term deflation. The situation we're in today is strikingly similar to what Japan went through. They have been caught in a cycle of deflation and low growth for the last 20+ years. Every time their economy perked up a bit, it was killed with premature spending cuts and tax increases. 

People go on about the ""war on the dollar"" and how the currency is going to be destroyed, but as I said before, T-bills are at their lowest yields in a very long time, and the dollar is stronger than it has been in years. Undoubtedly, in about 20 years if we're still pushing stimulus spending, then we'll be in a gigantic world of hurt, but for the next 5 years or so? We're absolutely fine, particularly as long as Europe and the EU remains in the funk. The only thing that could cause the deficit to do us big-time harm in the short and medium term is if another reserve currency magically appears. The Euro threatened to do that for awhile, but it's pretty obvious that won't be happening, and China shows no signs whatsoever of wanting the Yuan to become the world's de-facto reserve currency anytime soon. 

Honestly, the Social Security problem is pretty simple: the age at which people can qualify just has to be bumped up by 5 years or so. That won't fully fill the hole, but will go a very long way to doing so. No desperate austerity measures are needed.

I don't think you understand what an austerity program at this point will do to the economy. Or, if you do, you don't give a shit. Talk about the American economy ""surviving""? If massive spending cuts were enacted, what we would see would be beyond anything those advocating such measures possibly imagine. For an idea, look at the Baltic states, particularly Latvia. GDP dropped by almost 25% since initiation of an austerity program. *THAT* is economic destruction.

I don't think there's anyone who knows anything about economics who's saying ""deficits should continue to be built up forever!"" The budget deficit has to be cut. But the time to do so. Is. *not*. now. ","1277942435"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I've had this issue before (and maybe still do). When my boyfriend and I first started dating, one of my close friends often made fun of him and stuff but would never outright admit she didn't like him. Later on she wrote an entry in my journal (something for school, it was lame) basically going on about what a loser he was and how stupid I was for dating him. I pretty much stopped being friends with her then.

Another friend reacted similarly and some of my family doesn't like him because they think he's too meek or shy maybe? But he's introverted - that doesn't make him a bad person! I guess everyone in my life has the feeling that I need to end up with someone who takes charge and is super ""manly,"" but god forbid I actually know what I like best.

Point is, these people clearly dislike him for stupid reasons such as personality traits he can't control (introverted, harsh/sarcastic humor, etc.), but I love those things about him! If he was beating me up every night, then I could understand the sour reactions, but he doesn't.

None of that really matters though, the point is that in my head, I feel as though my mind is an incorporeal entity, I always have.

At first I try and think of an explanation, but then a heavy object on a shelf above my bed hit me on the head and that is when I really got scared. I was absolutely totally paralyzed with fear, I had my arms at my side laying on my back perfectly stiff.

I sat there for what must have been a half hour contemplating my situation. I was sweating profusely, shivering and ready to cry. All the while objects fall to the floor, glass shatters around me, my books topple over like dominoes. I was going back to my childhood trying to remember prayers from church, I threw away all my atheistic beliefs because I was completely certain a ghost was in my room taunting me.

Prayer having no affect, I decided on one possible solution. I set turning on the light as my next immediate goal, I would have to get up and dash across the room to turn it on. I waited for a pause in the commotion got up and fully expected to be confronted by a ghost or demon and killed immediately. I hit the light switch and leapt back onto my bed and under my covers. Aside from a totally wrecked room I could see nothing, then I heard a little pat on the carpet. I looked down and to my relief saw a flying squirrel on the floor.

Scientists, particularly medical scientists, are notoriously bad at working across disciplinary lines.

From the link in your post OP.

""Though controversial (many clinicians continue to conclude that the relatively mild withdrawal syndrome associated with cannabis indicates that dependence is unlikely and treatment unnecessary), research has shown that some cannabis users may develop cannabis-related problems, including dependency.""

But basically, people can become addicted to doughnuts or running or all sorts of various things if they have addictive personalities.

I have also heard a lot of studies saying that it can cause cancer, but almost an identical amount claiming that it can help in the treatment of cancer (not for appetite, that it actually can help break down the tumors)

I wont even justify the slacker stereotype, I know guys who are making 500k Plus a year who get high every day.  Police officers, lawyers, computer programmers.  All walks of life.  That said, the deuche bags out there spraypainting the sides of buildings yelling 420 4 lyfe! definitely can give the wrong impression.

So yes, idiots get high and do idiotic things.

I think the benefits of having a non-prescription stress and sleep aid is huge.  I also dont really see the point in keeping it illegal.  

And yes...a big part of the ""its harmless"" comes from OMG REEEFER MADNESSSSS!!!!  IF YOU SMOKE POT YOU WILL MURDER YOUR FAMILY TO GET MONEY TO BUY MORE POT!.... oh... hey... wait... all it did was give me the munchies and make me enjoy spongebob squarepants more.

But to be perfectly honest I think we all need to spend less time self medicating ourselves and more time getting our shit together for the class war that we are all embroiled in.  Willfully or not, we exist in the time that defines the future of our children, and anything we do that makes us pay LESS attention to the world around us and keeps us from doing our duty as citizens* is a negative.  That goes for social networks, TV, Alcohol and other drugs... and yes... even websites like reddit.  :(

Actually, it is your job to explain what you mean.  I can't figure out what **you** mean by reading **my** comments.

The whole point of this conversation, from my point of view, is an honest exchange of ideas.  I'm actually trying to understand where you're coming from.  Perhaps you're not approaching it with the same goal in mind.  It seems more like you want to ""win"" .  Perhaps you'd care to illuminate me and actually say what you're referring to.  What specific equivocation did I make that you find objectionable?

&gt;Well, then. No.

Just to be absolutely clear, you're saying that members of a society see absolutely no benefit from being a part of it?

&gt;That wasn't the question. Everybody knows you can't do business with yourself, unless this ""second person"" you speak of is some uninspired metaphor.

I don't quite follow you here.  I never said someone could do business with themselves.  I was inquiring about the nature of your comment ""It would be the same either way"", which was a response to this question: ""Would they be able to have the same quality of business relationship -- or even have the luxury of having business at all -- without a society built up around them in which to do business?""  You seem to be saying here that, whether someone is part of a society or simply a loner in a log cabin in the woods, they'd be able to do business exactly the same.  As this seems an odd position -- from my point of view, anyway -- I was hoping for some clarity.

Once again, I'm genuinely trying to understand your point of view on this.  I hope, perhaps naively, that you're approaching it the same way.  It doesn't really seem like it so far.","1277942491"

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","Check the FIFA wiki for international structure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA#Structure


FIFA is made of CONCACAF (N.A, Carribean), UEFA (europe), CONMEBOL (S.A.),  CAF (africa), AFC (asia and Australia), OFC (new zealand and pacific islands)

FIFA - World Cup, Club World Cup, Confederations Cup (nations), and replicas of this stuff at youth and women's levels.


CONCACAF - Gold Cup (nations), Champions League (winning clubs), Superliga (lesser clubs)


UEFA - Euro Cup (nations), Champions League (winners), Europa Cup (lesser clubs)


CONMEBOL - Copa America (Nations), Copa Libertadores (clubs), Copa Sudamericana (lesser clubs..thats debatable)


CAF - African Cup of Nations (nations), African Champions League (clubs), some other shit


AFC - Asian Cup (nations), Asian Champions League (clubs), other shit. 


Oceania - Polynesia Cup (nations), Oceania Champions League (clubs)


Each nation has a league (and possibly lower level leagues), and a cup, and sometimes additional cups. The league is always regarded as the most important thing to win, and the Cup usually is lower on the priority list. 


The USA has MLS for its league, and the US Open Cup for it's cup. Winners of the league (MLS Cup) and the shield (best regular season record) get automatic qualification to the CONCACAF Champions League. MLS Cup runner up and the US Open Cup winner get to play into that tournament with a qualifier. The next 4 MLS teams get to play in the less glamorous SuperLiga. Winning CONCACAF Champions league gets you to the FIFA Club World Cup. Superliga just gets you money.


All in all, it's pretty awesome that any team from anywhere can end up world champions by proving it. Samoa FC could win the Oceania champions league, and then pull off miraculous upsets to beat major South American and European competition to win the Club World Cup. 

Theoretically, you could start a team in the USA with your friends, miraculously win the US Open Cup, play in the CONCACAF Champions League, win that, and play in the FIFA Club World Cup. ","1277942509"

After turning down $90 blowjobs from a row of mediocre looking african immigrants I stumbled back to see my captain talking to a beautiful Austrian blonde.  Hey!, I shouted.

"math","t5_2qh0n","""Maximizing the log"" comes from information theory (and in fact encompasses a fatal flaw of most risk management methods derived from or akin to it).

Entropy or information is given as \sum_{i=0}^n p(x_i) log(p(x_i)).  This is where the ""log"" comes from.  (I suck at LaTeX so bear with).

The greatest entropy occurs when all p(x_i) are exactly equal and thus the individual event probabilities are independent of one another.  This is also called ""maximum entropy"".  Also the maximum randomness condition (or ""white noise"").  This is also the maximally unpredictable state - predictability implies structure rather than randomness.

*If you presume that risk is the case where you know the least, then maximally random/entropic is the worst-case scenario of any unknown case* because maximum randomness is the most unstructured (and unpredictable) ensemble of states. So if you maximize the utility function of a stochastic system, you have obtained the maximal risk variance by presuming maximum entropy.  This is how you end up with ""maximizing the log of something"".

The problem is that you can't blithely (and correctly) assume many of the critical requirements of maximum entropy in economic systems.  Namely presuming economic event (transactions, decisions, etc.) independence is generally a wrong assumption.

What can occur is scale-free and multi-scale phenomena which don't have this statistic and actually get discarded when you assume maximum entropy.  This would be the ""maximum correlative cascade"" case instead where events are not even independent and uncorrelated but have a very definite non-independence.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry to be a polemical dick but I just need to correct a few things there. What economists found is that anything ""luxury"" is often elastic - as there are substitutes and buyers have no OBLIGATION per se to buy. So while it is ""moralistically"" sound to tax luxury boats in reality the rich man can always chose simply not to buy, or to buy a ferrari instead. Your tax will make very little revenue because it crushes demand. It will ruin the luxury boat industry and give rise an angry mob of jobless workers who will riot because they were unfairly punished. (This has happened in the 70s before but I can't be arsed finding you a citation.)

Compare that to inelastic things like alcohol and cigarettes. Because they are socially ingrained, habit forming and no really viable substitutes exist, taxes do not damage demand. Which is good because your sinners will all begrudgingly pay your sin tax, which nets you a LOT of revenue. 

What arealreactionary got fundamentally wrong is that when governments introduce sin taxes - while they will put the moralistic banner to push these things through - they're really in it for the money. Sin taxes bring in a LOT of steady money, and it is AGAINST the gov's interests for demand to decrease because that will damage their bottom line.","1277942624"

I'm not saying it makes no difference, I'm just saying that showing a graph and going look, look, computers aren't getting faster is moronic. 

The CPU speeds have been growing steadily, and even if silicon has hit a limit, which apparently it hasn't as Intel is promising 10GHZ next year, there are plenty of other things to improve meanwhile. So, on a short timescale clock speeds aren't a good measure, and on a large scale there's already plenty of technologies lined up to pick up the slack.

Do you seriously think that there will be no increase in clock speeds in the same time span it took to go from MC68000 to Core i7?

Pretty much this. A certain degree of chauvinism is pretty much inevitable in any society that has agriculture, given that on average men are physically stronger (and thus better adapted to most forms of combat), and that women are severely constrained by pregnancy. Pregnancy is necessary to keep population levels up, especially with the high infant mortality rates of pre-scientific societies, and it also effectively incapacitates a woman for months at a time. Sociologically, there were good reasons behind the idea that women shouldn't be fighting and adventuring, although they were blown all out of proportion by most societies. For the sake of survival in early agricultural communities, the job of women was making babies. (The fact that they got no *respect* for that all-important task is a different problem entirely.) The idea of absolute equality is a modern thing, and could only arise in a society that is largely post-agricultural and has the medical science to ensure that most children will live to adulthood. I'd say that it's a good change, but the fact that gender equality is the norm in the quasi-medieval worlds of most fantasy settings is quite frankly implausible.

As for disability: it depends on what sort of disability you're looking for. Most obvious physical or mental handicaps would disqualify someone from adventuring right off the bat. I mean, would *you* want to go dungeon-running with an epileptic sorcerer? One *color spray*, and you're picking up the flambe'd bits of your party members off the wall. Not to say that he wouldn't be an interesting character, but in terms of RP qualifications for the adventurer's life, most groups would throw that guy out on his ass rather than risk their own hides.","1277942704"

Before, I wanted all roads to have a bike lane, now I think intelligently designed communities have a network of bike paths through hem.

Whats even more interesting is that there is a 15 mile trail being built that will connect to this one, and it takes the path very close to where I live.  That segment will go under the power lines.

&gt; I buy a lot of games, probably the most prolific purchaser out of my gaming friends and family. I noticed over time that I would mention games that I really enjoyed and wanted to talk about and few of my friends had played them. The ones that hadn't generally said they couldn't buy games at the rate I did and thus tended to buy mostly multiplayer games that had more longevity for the cost.

I don't buy boxed anymore for several reasons. I love Steam and would rather spend my money there instead of at a retail outlet or even a retail website. Digital download/install is much more convenient for me and for sharing, especially with my brother who is out of state.

Back then most games were perhaps 7 or 8 disks, as in 3.5 inch floppies - this was before the CDRom explosion, and even during it as ""stripped"" releases - no sound, etc. to shrink the size were popular. What I'd do was upload 1.44 megs of crap (the game Cool Spot with the character from 7-up was frequently used because it was the perfect size) which would give me exactly 1 disk's worth of credit.

I would then download a game 1 disk at a time (at 14.4), aborting it at the last second with 1K left to download. I would then PKZIPFIX all of the disks because I knew the last few bytes of the file would always be FILE_IDs or NFOs or some such. The BBS would give me the credit back, as it was an aborted download, and I'd just do it again and again.

I thought I was the coolest hax0r in the world for figuring this out, but I've always wondered if I was the only one to come up with this idea. Any thoughts?","1277942772"

"feminisms","t5_2qhba","We people who live in Western countries take far too much for granted regarding the psychology of the broken and oppressed. Just because these people are not screaming at the top of their lungs about the rapes does not mean that they accept it as a part of their lives. A slave never ""accepts"" their state of enslavement as ""a part of their lives."" It is something that ""must be endured"" or ""the situation that they are in at this point in their lives,"" but it is never a part of their lives.

It is not part of their culture and it's disingenuous of you to state it as an ""accepted part of their lives."" Congo is in the midst of a holocaust due to the actions of the individual men who are in control of their country and terrorizing the regular citizenry. 

Rape is not part of the culture of the average citizen of this country and they do not ""accept it as part of their lives."" The regular husbands and fathers in Congo are not the ones going around raping the women. The husbands and fathers who live/lived in Darfur, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and the other African countries who are or were in the midst of being controlled or ruled by these military dictatorships/rebellions consisting of these ""crazy men"" do not accept rape as a part of their lives. The regular men are either tortured and forced to watch their women being raped or are outright killed either for refusing to participate or just to add to the rape victim's horror during the rape. The boys from these environments are taken from their families and homes, subjected to physical and psychological abuse/torture (not limited to homosexual rape, alcohol, drugs- my ""favorite"" is ""brown-brown"" a mixture of gunpowder and coke), and are eventually forced to become monsters like the men who abducted them. 

And as for the women and girls; we already know what they go through. God help them because they are the ones left to endure (if they survive) the damned thing with having their lives ruined by the hell they personally endured and by the additional  horror of having their loved ones taken from them (either by death or abduction). And there are many cases where both the men and women who are subjected to this end up committing suicide.

Now, if you want to call these militarized camps/organizations of violent men who subscribe to this behavior a ""culture,"" then go ahead. While I mildly disagree with you as it being a culture, I can't disagree with it being systematic. History has always shown that there are evil people who will use whatever tools are at hand to terrorize those who they feel are beneath them. And as we all know, rape is one of the easiest of those tools to employ. On that scale and in that context, rape hurts the entire community/family that is subjected to its horrors. 

But to say that this atrocity is part of their culture and part of their way of life is an insult to the people of Congo. It will forever be a part of their history (albeit one that they would probably give anything to forget), but it can never be a part of their culture.","1277942805"

So the other day, I ordered one, and the gal I was with at the time told me to get an extra toothpick of olives so she could have a couple.  ""No problem,"" says I; I explained that I've never eaten an olive, and she could have mine.  She couldn't understand how I like dirty martinis and yet have never actually eaten the included olives.

After teasing me about it for a while, I told her that I'd eat an olive if she'd give me her number.  Somehow, that worked, but then I actually had to eat the damn olive.   I was fairly confident that it wouldn't taste too bad; heck, I've been drinking dirty martinis every once in a while since I turned 21.  Fuck no.

I was not prepared for that at *all.*  Olives are fucking disgusting.  Just a bitter, salty, poorly-textured piece of awfulness.  It was like eating solidified sea water. Never again.  I learned that I might not like dirty martinis, but that I must just really love gin.","1277942807"

"trees","t5_2r9vp","&gt; I believe that with the legalization of weed, the personal feel to it will disappear.

I'd disagree, and assert that you'll be able to be more open with growers/distributors and enjoy communal activities without fear of incarceration. You can always continue to buy on the potentially 'more personal' black market (as most will), but won't have to worry about arrest on the way home. 

&gt;They'd find ways to mass produce the shit as cheap as possible, and would probably start using chemicals and who knows what just as with produce and whatnot. 

There will be cheaper and less natural/organic products available, but don't let that blind you to the often ugly truth of the status quo. Also, keep in mind that a legal market will bring greater access to rare/gourmet varietals, whereas most smokers now don't have choice/information about what strains they smoke. Legalization will foster diversity, expanding both low- and high-quality markets. It's also worth noting that InBev brews awful beer, but that doesn't stop my friendly neighborhood brewer from turning out the best Imperial Bock on the planet. The presence of low-quality beer on the market does not preclude the availability of high-quality beer, and the same applies for cannabis.

&gt;They'd wipe out local dispensaries who, not only need their jobs, but truly believe and are passionate about what they are doing. 

Dispensaries would have a LARGER market. They may have more competition within that market, but they've also got networks of growers/customers that new startups would lack. It's also worth noting that Kevin Reed, who wrote that message and owns The Green Cross in San Francisco, sits on a 'citizens advisory board' on cannabis-related issues in SF. These boards (all around CA), are advocating for counties to stop giving business licenses for new dispensaries. The first ones in the door are trying to shut it behind them, with a significant profit incentives. Not exactly pure motives, if you ask me.

&gt;I feel like it would just be another part of this country that would become all about money.

I fear you're romanticising the present market for cannabis. There's a reason that we see a lot of fast/fat indicas on the market at the expense of slow/spindly sativas, and it has more to do with profit margins than passionate love of the product. ","1277942811"

The gradual increase in power held by HOAs is something that I've watched for years and it thoroughly disgusts me. I have personally witnessed someone evicted from their home because they ran afoul of the wrong person in their housing division. In many cases (at least from my experience) an HOA operates not so much as a collaboration of neighbors maintaining public structures and general upkeep of their collective living areas, and much more as a form of ultra-local government--a government that operates with little if any oversight and often controlled by people who think nothing of using their power to settle personal disputes between them and their neighbors.","1277942867"

At the risk of sounding patronizing when I'm being just the opposite: At age 19, you haven't done much yet, the world and your body have a lot more neat shit for you to experience! I am a formerly lazy geek, now a 33yo semi-lazy geek. :)  I quite literally did zero exercise from age 18 to age 27. Biggest, longest mistake of my life! The only reason that you haven't found joy in movement is because you haven't done enough of it! The human body evolved to MOVE! Ranging, foraging, hunting, fleeing. Watch a documentary on tribal lifestyle, they never stop! There is a happy middle-ground though, and I've found my part of it. Just took me a year or two of not giving up and trying different things. 

 War walking is a **great** idea if it will get you moving and keep you happy. I actually started by just walking, moved into barefoot-style walking when my back hurt, and after 2 years, into sprint intervals/hard hill walking as I really started to love it. Started lifting in there somewhere, after a big masonry project that my dad and I did made me realize that all that muscle that I had gained made life more fun but didn't turn me into a muscle-head. Exercise only sucked at first, now i'm an addict! 

 Speaking of war walking and other geekified exercise, my cousin the uber-geek wanted to design a ""geek gym"" to get into shape and also torture his newly hired employees (he does high-end IT and telecom on a few college campuses). Attach a metal plate to a laptop to stabilize it and work the arms/back, and run from job site to job site, configuring stuff on the way, then wiring stuff in a low horse stance with a heavy backpack full of cable spools, move from job to job jumping over obstacles and by only touching the ground when you absolutely have to, basically doing every geek job the hardest but fastest way you can think of, lol.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","So i guess what you would be saying in opposing merely having the option, that you think *you* would be better qualified to make decisions for the baby over its actual parents on this matter. 

Its a sticky subject I think though I support the discovery of such technology in the end. Even though parents should be wary of the long term effect of any treatment from flu shots to something like this, I think that parents should be able to ""determine the morphology of their children"" as enkiam put it. This treatment is no different in an ideological sense than determining the child's eye color or small doses of steroids during puberty if the child is not ""blossoming""(the penis isn't growing balls aren't dropping no interest in sexuality, no mature physical growth for instance).

All of these things come from a parent's effort to shape their child into what they consider to be an ideal person that would be best equipped to have a happy life under any situation. While I agree it is always tricky when someone is making decisions for somebody else, it is baby. It cannot live on its own and so the parents have no choice but to make the best decisions for the child that they can until it can do it themselves. These decisions include breast feeding, circumcision whether or not to home school them, and yes even medical procedures. And like with any ordeal between parents and children, the child just have to wait until its all grown up to find out if the parents made a big mistake.

In the end it is a choice that a parent has to make just like all of the other ones i presented, and I hope that nobody, especially an Anarchist would be so gay and proud that that they would even consider opposing choice itself, especially for someone else. The baby gets no choice in this matter obviously, and wont have a choice in the matter when it is all grown up, whether or not it is gay or straight anyway. So were not talking about choice for the child but the choice of the parents.

""...restore this baby to the normal female appearance which would be compatible with her parents presenting her as a girl, with her eventually becoming somebody’s wife, and having normal sexual development, and becoming a mother.""

This is a little bit of a fucked up way to communicate your expectations for the program though. Especially since gender roles are a bit intangible in the first place.

Understand that I don't really like it in particular. I wouldn't do that to my child if i ever have one. But, like circumcision of someone else's child, its really not my call. There's a difference between rescuing someone from harmful parents, and simply not liking how other parents are raising their kids. ","1277942905"

"hardware","t5_2qh18","If the drive just doesn't operate enough to boot and then grab the info off of it, try following the directions below. Hopefully you'll get 20-30 minutes more out of the drive. If the home folder is not encrypted or secured by NTFS permissioning you might want to try hooking the drive up as a slave to a secondary computer. This way you can transfer data fast.

-------
1. Put masking tape over the data and electrical connectors of the drive.
2. Immerse the drive in a ziplock bag of minute-rice, with the data/power connectors sticking up. This can't be regular rice, it MUST be minute rice. This acts as a poor man's silica gel later in the process (Tyler's note: certain kitty liter brands are silica based and are an effective substitute). Close the zip-lock.
3. Freeze the bag of rice with the hard drive in it in the deep freeze for 24 hours. You want it completely frozen, patience is a virtue.
4. Remove the bag from the freezer, and take it to a pre-prepared computer where the drive is ready to be received and plugged in (longer data cable, longer power cable, etc...) You should have another big data drive in the system ready to receive the data from the frozen drive.
5. Leave the drive immersed in the minute rice except for the data/power connector. Remove the tape. Plug in the data and power cables. Try to re-seal the zip-lock bag as much as possible so you don't have rice grains escaping.
6. Orient the drive so it's laying in as natural of a position as possible with as much frozen rice around it.
7. Fire up the system, and try to access the frozen drive. This is the moment of truth. If you're lucky, it'll identify and respond, and you'll have access to the file system. 
8. You now about 20 reliable minutes to copy data. You may get more if you're lucky. Copy copy copy. Note: The drive WILL be slow at first, and will speed up as it starts to warm.

Why the minute rice? It performs two functions: First, it keeps the moisture from condensing on, and in the drive's metal parts. Moisture's the killer when you power up a frozen drive. Second, it provides an additional thermal block of ""cool"" to help keep the driveat a lower temperature while you perform the copy.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;I also find it slightly hypocritcal of you to have such a holier than thou outlook on this, when you yourself have tested marijuana and LSD on your body. Just because you don't like the effects it has on you: DOES NOT MEAN OTHERS DO NOT LIKE IT. Seriously, my rights as an American are tested every day while weed is still illegal. I don't trample your rights, or come down to where you work and slap the cock out of your mouth. So please don't do so to me.

I never did any of the sort.  I'm sorry if I come across as hypocritical or self righteous, but I was asking a question about peoples perceptions about drug use and it seems a large number of the answers I have received are, ""You're fucking stupid, shut the fuck up.""

I know I am not as educated about the issue, and all who have presented counter arguments with facts are most welcome.  Yet, telling me I'm fucking stupid and an authoritarian for feeling that there needs to be some regulation doesn't endear me to supporting ""the cause"" with any more than lip service.

The fact that some people have had negative effects from the use of the drug goes back to my point that it *can* be harmful.  At the same time at every point I said that, I framed it in the aspect of ""relatively"", and ""no more so.""  Yet, it seems that where I agreed with most people, and that I received a hell of a lot of rhetoric, personal attacks, and outright dismissals of what is a valid point...that it *can* be harmful.  People seem to miss the italics and emphasis there and go straight for the ""Shut the fuck up you are out of your element and WRONG.""

Those kind of counter arguments infuriate me since I am trying to understand with reason and understanding yet the feedback I get is aggressive and close minded to other perspectives.","1277942924"

My second point is that copyright is, for the most part, wrong.  

 * When it was established (in the US) copyrights lasted for 14 years.  Now every time That Fucking Mouse is about to go out of copyright, a coven of lawyers descends on DC and gets another lifetime to it.  Is this reasonable?  Is this encouraging artists?
 * In the article, a young woman wants to sing a song.  She wants to collaborate with other artists, put on a show, but she is forbidden by copyright law.  Is this how music has worked for the last 10,000 years?  Or do artists generally share, copy and imitate one another?  Has society been improved by this prohibition?  
 * In the young woman's example, she suggests that she will sing the song for other people and increase the artist's exposure.  Is that valid?  I can say from personal experience that Internet copyright infringement is an outstanding way to introduce artists - especially smaller, more remote acts - to audiences that would otherwise never hear them.  I have stacks of tickets stubs, tshirts and whatnot from bands i would *never* had heard of, without an act of copyright infringement.  Copyright infringement puts money in artists pockets.  
 * In the composers example, one should pay to get his ""intellectual property.""  This puts money in the music company's pocket, and tends to suppress the work of smaller, and more distant acts.  Is this really better for artists?  For society?

Also, theres many dealers out there who move bud so quickly with one strain that theres no reason to move up and buy another strain. 

The main trick will be smoking with people, but its not only that. You should try to be smoking with new people as well. Friends tend to all go to the same dealers (in my experience). Thus, you need new friends with new dealers to really move up.

"funny","t5_2qh33","The thing is that when billions and billions of dollars go into something (like TV advertising) then even a 1% improvement in the effectiveness of the market is worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. 

If I take this Old Spice commercial as an example; there are a couple of main factors in making this particular advert successful. 

Number one is the flawless, brazen delivery of the clever lines by a *man's man* ( &amp; total stud TBH) who is talking to *our* women (sat beside us on the couch) and openly acknowleding to the men watching that yes, he's 100x more 'attractive' than most of us and yes, Old Spice only makes us smell like him but that that's a start. They get away with this by being *extremely* facetious with their choice of visuals and script.

The second quality is that because the adverts are visually clever and actually *not* CG they are worthy of social media attention as a sort of 'oh, that was clever' curiosity. The linked vid has 5k views right now, but the ad will probably top something in the order of 5 million online views on youtube in the next couple of weeks. We probably wouldn't be quite as frothy-mouthed if this was some kind of CGfest.

The fact that Old Spice was by now a quasi-retro or maybe slightly old fashioned (yet still insanely well known brand) really helps here.

What I'm trying to articulate is that if you reverse-engineer this ad and assess what they're trying to do with it we see that they're trying to create something that's virally marketable and aimed directly at young men and women who will dig this script, be in turns jealous of/attracted to this guy on screen and tacitly agree that it might sort of be a good idea to smell like that. These guys have been planning to break the product into a younger market and they've done exceptionally well.

Please excuse the scatty writing, it's 1am and I'm shattered :D

The only renewable that works at large scales is hydroelectric. It has been around forever and has reached critical mass in most places. Wind can help a bit (but not as much as nuclear), and the other renewables are marginal, as the EIA report *you cited* said. 

The really funny (er, I mean sad) thing about your claims about renewables if you include hydroelectric, is that the share of renewables in the United States has decreased from about [31% of electricity in 1949 to 8% in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USRenewableElectricity.jpg).

The best that you can find are writings outside of the bible that mention Jesus, however those that are early enough to show for a fact that Jesus was a real person are non existent, and those even old enough to indicate that it may be true are rare and far in between.

The Road to Ascension: David Wilcock (Part 1) A video interview with David Wilcock Los Angeles, May/June 2007 Our interview with David Wilcock is part of our redirecting our focus toward the future of our planet in the years leading up to 2012. As the self-professed reincarnation of Edgar Cayce, he's a good person to start with. In some ways, we've approached David less in the traditional interview mode and more with the stance that all we at Camelot had to do was to place the camera there and the rest would take care of itself. And so it happened. David is extremely well-read, eloquent and dynamic and was able to hit the ground running. He launches into a saga of his own spiritual journey of self discovery, how he came to the realization of one of his past lives as Edgar Cayce, his meetings with members of the Black Ops community and ultimate introduction into the world of the Illuminati, his exposure to the Law of One, Ra material and his scientific investigations. Wrapping his own considerable channeling abilities into a vast and lucid review of the scientific basis for the coming changes around 2012, this interview promises to raise many questions and provoke great deal of thought in the viewer. To his credit, in this lifetime, David has duly recognized the areas where his prior self required growth and has set to work rectifying these things with a frank self appraisal in the spirit of truth. He has not lost his former channeling ability but in this lifetime has complimented that skill with a solid grounding in science to augment his knowledge and gain greater leverage into the social and mental thought framework of today's world. He's currently working with Richard Hoagland on an investigation into the planetary changes surrounding 2012, and is the co-author of the extremely important and well-researched article to be found on Hoagland's website titled The Interplanetary Day After Tomorrow. This is recommended reading for all. In presenting this material, we at Project Camelot recognize that some of this material is contentious, and encourage everyone to consider David's conclusions in the spirit of open inquiry and as part of an ongoing investigation into the mystery surrounding 2012.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The HOA doesn't really do the foreclosure.  They place a lien on the house saying the owner owes them money that is secured by the home (like a home mortgage would be).

Once a certain amount of time has gone by the HOA shows they have attempted to collect the debt (usually by showing the certified letters they send).  The HOA asks the county to collect on the debt.  To recover the money the county auctions the home (they of course send notices and run a public announcement in the local paper).  The home's starting price is usually the amount owed in liens.

Once the house is sold the liens are paid out and any remaining money goes to the homeowner.  The fishy part of this story is that it sold for $3,000 to someone involved with the HOA and was then turned and sold to another person/company involved with the HOA for a reasonable price.  That kept the owner from getting the money they should have.

So if the house sold for 200k, the HOA should have got 3k and the owner 197k and it would all be done.  ","1277943069"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","My problem with Signs wasn't the abysmally stupid aliens; it was the stunner of a ""reveal"" that I found so offensive I came close to walking out of the theater. Mel Gibson's final flashback of his wife's death is when she tells him to have his brother swing away. Later in their living room, Joaquin Phoenix does indeed grab his bat off the wall, swings away and beats the alien's brains in.

One result of *that* (other than victory over the aliens) is Gibson's renewal of faith, from which I presume we were supposed to understand that Gibson's wife had a vision of the future at her death, a vision presumably granted to her by God. A God who, presumably, allowed her to be killed in a grisly car crash (killed by Shyamalan!) so that she'd have this vision. How this was supposed to have led to a renewal of faith to a fallen priest is beyond me, but this conceit, this ""God works in mysterious ways"" bullshit I seem to hear every time there's a tragedy, *enraged* me. I don't think I've ever been that angry after walking out of a movie theater.

Also: Joaquin Phoenix's character, IIRC, was a baseball lifer who held several minor league home run records, who never made it to the show because he struck out too much. I found Shyamalan's abject baseball ignorance -- that something as irrelevant as striking out a ton would hold back such a masher from the majors -- to be silly, but in an amusing, non-stabby way.","1277943106"

Somebody had to have come along at one point and said something along the lines of ""Hey, those guys that are getting tipped are making quite a lot of money.  Why should I have to pay them so much if they make so much in tips anyway?  Also, if I cut their pay, I can cut prices and/or increase profit for me, the entrepreneur.""  Maybe it was tough economically, or maybe the business owners became greedy/had entitlement issues.  In any way, it became standard practice, and once a practice has become commonplace, it is tough to change.

EDIT:  Also, the US has a tradition of economic competition.  It is less important to make sure your employees earn enough and more important for the workers to take care of themselves, at least in the food service industry anyway.  If they don't earn enough, it is their own fault for not being good enough.  They should be striving to be a better waiter/waitress/delivery person/etc...

If a lesser-known company had made a game exactly like Mario Galaxy, except with a new character that had nothing to do with Mario's universe, it would've sold less.  I don't see that as a reason to be resentful toward Nintendo, or Nintendo's fans for buying it.

I mean, maybe if Apple was releasing *shit*, and it was overshadowing the quality work of others...I could see that.  But it would take an anti-Apple fanboy of large dimension to call the iPhone 4 shit.  From what I hear, it's debatably one of the best phones on the market.  Where's this resentment coming from?  Back to the video game analogy, this whole thing sometimes reminds me of Sega vs. Nintendo fans going at it from years past.

EDIT:  Actually, I think that'd be the perfect comparison.  I mean, if you prefer one of the consoles...great!  That's great, and I'm glad you found something you like out of that one.  But I like *this* one.  And no, no, don't pretend that there isn't a legitimate reason for me to like it.  Don't pretend that I'm an idiot for buying it.  It does many things very well.

They do. Teachers travel to the school on public roads. The water and food served for lunch in the cafeteria is inspected by public inspectors. Etc. 

&gt; Why can't I pay for everyone else's private schooling.

You could, if you wanted. 

&gt; What I would like, is a fairer more voluntary way of paying for taxes.

First, if they were voluntary, they wouldn't be taxes. :-) What you're asking for there is the ability to not pay so many taxes.

As for ""fair"", I don't believe that word has any meaning. By the time anyone uses the word ""fair"", there's already disagreement to what constitutes ""fair"". 

&gt; is not the other person benefiting from my education as well?

Certainly. They have a job because you're educated enough to have money to spend on take-out. 

&gt; Should they be forced to subsidize my education as well?

Errrr, they are!  Or at least they're subsidizing your retirement and your neighbor's education and etc.

&gt; What if they're poor and can't afford it?

Then they're probably not paying many taxes, and they're probably renting which means they're paying property indirectly.

&gt; In a more voluntary society I would not expect them to subsidize my education if they did not want to.

Then it wouldn't be taxes. It would be, like, buying take-out or something, where you might or might not.  All you're really saying here is ""taxes should be lower, the government is spending too much."" I can certainly agree with that without calling myself a libertarian. ","1277943217"

I got to the onsite portion of the first Google Code Jam and they hired me from there. To be honest, I've never been sure how much the lack of degree was a problem. I did feel somewhat underappreciated, which was one of several factors that led to me quitting - I don't know how much of that was just the areas I ended up in, how much of that was the manager, or if some of it really was the lack of degree. Impossible to say.
Needless to say, I wouldn't have gotten in in the first place without real concrete demonstration of my skills, which - in my case - took the form of TopCoder.

As for the actors changing, the Doctor can regenerate when he's badly wounded, and when that happens he regenerates into a new body.  It's basically a story mechanism that allows the writers to keep world continuity (the Doctor encounters the same bad guys in different seasons) while changing the actors that play the Doctor.

The WHO system does not escape political bias. It advances ideological assumptions that most Americans might find questionable under the guise of objectivity.


As for the Union of Concerned Scientists (they're not)

UCS embraces an environmental agenda that often stands at odds with the “rigorous scientific analysis” it claims to employ. A radical green wolf in sheep’s clothing, UCS tries to distinguish itself from the Greenpeaces of the world by convincing the media that its recommendations reflect a consensus among the scientific community. And that’s what makes it so dangerous. Whether it’s energy policy or agricultural issues, UCS’s “experts” are routinely given a free pass from newspaper reporters and television producers when they claim that mainstream science endorses their radical agenda.

Michael Pollan responsible for children going blind in third world countries:

&gt;The articulate yet know-nothing writer Michael Pollan took to the New York Times Magazine to dub Golden Rice “the great yellow hype.” They all condemned the developers of Golden Rice for working with for-profit companies to make seed available to the poor.

&gt;These reactions are the most detestable sort of distortion and misrepresentation. Even small amounts of vitamin supplementation to treat deficiencies can have huge effects, and the second-generation varieties of Golden Rice contain abundant amounts of such supplementation. Golden Rice and other similar products can be life-enhancing, life-saving adjuncts to persons with vitamin a deficiency — but only if their producers can overcome ngo opposition, media misreporting, and regulatory excesses, and get the new varieties to the farmers who wish to grow it.

This is but one of my ""beefs"" with the Pollan source.  He is like making Charles Manson a male nurse...

I think calculus is required for lots of linear algebra classes for two reasons:
(1) It's a ""mathematical maturity"" prerequisite -- it shows the professor that you've taken some math already
(2) Lots of textbooks like to use differentiation as the example of a linear transformation on a vector space, since differentiation is already linear.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I suppose, but frankly, whether that happens or not isn't really your decision, nor that of any other ""moral"" authority.  

Education on the actual reality of drugs would be much more beneficial than our abstinence only approach at curbing drug based health issues.  I was taught all about drugs from my uncle who did everything under the sun before going clean and becoming a pharmacist years later.  Luckily he never had a drug record that might prevent him from being getting his license.  In any case, suffice to say he knew just about all there is to know about drugs, their effects and how to avoid problems.  

For instance, he did mention that Heroin and Opium (and many other drugs) should be approached very cautiously and only with the knowledge that they can be so good that it can be difficult to stop.

What was probably the most important rule and the thing he drove home during all of his lectures, was that I should never ever slam/IV anything regardless of what it is, since it makes it about ten times harder to walk away from a drug and basically makes it so that the first use is going to surpass any other method of consumption and it would be nigh impossible to work back to a lesser dose or another safer method.  With Opium, he mentioned that I shouldn't smoke it due to the nature of the euphoria and compulsive nature that causes smokers to only smoke, instead of just consuming the drug and actually doing something fun.  Instead, he said to only eat it or have it in a laudanum of some sort.  Also, with opium, no more than once every two weeks at the very most,with heroin, not more than once a month or so, and with lesser opiates, about every week would be alright.  Also, that as soon as I have to increase a dose more than twenty percent to get a similar effect as the first dose while following the normal rules, I need to take a significant break of at least a couple of months or so. He also mentioned that Meth, while a lot of fun when used responsibly, and not actually very disruptive for the first night after taking it, it should only be done one night every month or so.  Otherwise Meth tends to cause priorities to become shuffled to the point where you only make time for Meth and everything starts to not be as important and priorities get lost.  In addition to that, he was very clear that I need to never slam or smoke Meth under any circumstance and instead eat or snort is as the former methods cause many more problems as far as addiction and time wasting is concerned since addicts will literally sit all day and night passing a pipe instead of doing anything fun while on meth.  By only snorting and parachuting meth, I have have avoided addiction for many years, even though I do occasionally partake about twice a year when the time and situation is right.

There are many rules that apply across the board.  Of course, never IV/slam.  Always know the effects and side-effects of the drug you are taking and read about the effects of the drug in combination with any medical conditions you might have.  Be conservative with dosing and always dose reasonably with an understanding that increasing your dose above 20% of baseline should cause you to quit for a significant amount of time.

In any case, this is only a small part of the information he was able to pass on to me, however it would take me hours to create a comprehensive guide.  

That said, I have never been addicted to a drug I wasn't forced to be addicted to by a doctor.  I have tried almost everything, more than once at least on all listed and quite a few times on a few listed, Opium, Heroin, Meth, Shrooms, Pot, Coke, Mephedrone, X and some things I cannot really recall are things that I have used for recreation while applying my understanding of chemicals and their effects on me.  I have been very sure to follow my rules closely and and it has led to me never being addicted to an illicit drug and I have never had any of the social or economical problems normally associated with addiction in a atmosphere of sever prohibition and misunderstanding.

In our society, without a proper education, people are unprepared for dealing with chemicals.  I am sure that educating our populace would do more for our public health and wellfare than prohibition ever could, even if it worked.","1277943426"

So first week of college I meet this other guy that lives on my floor in the dorms and we start hanging out.  We were going to get beer to pre-party one night and he is talking all about how he is a big time Budweiser guy and that is all he drinks.  At the time I think that I am a coors guy, so I tell him we should definitely buy Miller.  He says that we should compromise and get Bud that night and next time get Miller.  Since this is the first week or two of school, I have no idea if I will ever see or drink with this guy again, so I suggest we suggest we compromise with Coors and that is what we do.

We end up being roommates for several years during and after college, drinking our compromise beer the whole time.  One day he gets a job at a bud brewery and starts getting free / very discounted Budweiser products and says, ""I guess Coors worked out pretty well as a compromise, but now it makes sense to drink Bud.""  

I said, ""yeah, about that...""    He was surprisingly cool about the whole thing, and congratulated me for my cunning and fortitude (to keep MGD down when making reenforcement displays.)  It was a dick move, but of the big three, Coors is clearly superior.

I can probably explain this better with diagrams than words, but if you imagine a big great fuck-off n-dimension multivariate gaussian distribution (imagine something ellipsoid-like) sitting around the origin in n-dimensional space (2- or 3-dimensional is good to visualise in), SVD is like figuring out how to rotate it so its axes line up with those of your frame of reference (the first matrix, which is a rotation) then stretching it along those axes to make it all even and spherical (the diagonal matrix) then rotating it back so its axes are aligned the way they were to start with.

Here's a little perspective on it, however:  

Depending on the conditions of insurance where you live, midwifery may not be covered by your medical insurance.  Midwives may not even be licensed in your state.  So while the rest of the world fully integrates midwifery into their medical pantheon, in These Modern United States the women who tend to go to midwives also tend to be a) uberhippies or b) die-hard fundamentalists (mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mennonites, Amish).  As a result, anyone working with these women pretty much has to meet them half-way.  And ""half way"" may very well be ""Take the fasting glucose test so I can check for gestational diabetes and I'll hook you up with a compounder who will turn your placenta into a bottle of pills.""

My wife is a naturopathic doctor.  And she's a midwife.  And the reason she's a naturopathic doctor and a midwife is that she had a choice between doing five years of school and ending up a naturopathic doctor and a midwife or doing five years of school and ending up a nurse and a midwife and she decided that being a doctor was cooler.

And she's one of the most ""medical"" naturopathic doctors out there... which means we get both barrels: her Ph.D biochemist father thinks she' a witch doctor, and lots of the hippies think she's the worst Western medicine has to offer.  And discussions like this?

And unfortunately do not have this calculator now, or any programs (and even a game or two) I have written there. All this learned myself from english instruction mainly (i'm polish ). :D

It started when my father (electric engineer) did bring it to home, and wasn't use it so often. :)

It was quite slow, but actually steping funcionality and seeing how it executes everything was really good. My first debugger :)

I think that this calculator highly influcenced my interest in numbers, mathematics, combinatorics, algorithmic, statistis, numerical methods and many other topics.

As of game on it I was also dreaming about haveing two such calculators and connect them together to form a network game. (There was a link for it).



Must buy one now. It real was very good, and easier to use than even newest cheap pseudo-graphic calculators. Not to mention, extensions.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; My tone is not intolerant. I am not trying to dismiss your arguments. I respect them by answering them. I don't refuse to acknowledge your value because you disagree with me.

**Liar**.

I asked you seven posts back:

&gt; Let's go back to the things you've not answered.

&gt;    * Your perception of a ""god"", please; specifically, the one which causes you to be a theist.

&gt;    * Your acceptance that ""evolution"" is not an accidental or random phenomenon.

&gt;    * life sharing ""a common code"" meaning that it's more likely that it means all life descended from an earlier form of life with that ""code"".

&gt;    * And why you assume the universe has to be the product of ""design"".

&gt;    * And your lack of explanation for the framework required to create a creator who ""designed"" the universe.

And I see you still, further down, called the existence of DNA ""random chance"".

&gt; My understanding is that if the force of gravity crosses the threshold at either end the results would be measured in minutes not millennium. The point is a stable universe that supports perpetual at a different tuning than ours.

a) I'd like to know where you get your understanding. Because - and I'll say this for the third time, rephrased - it still depends on the *degree* of the threshold. Why are you ignoring this point? Because it works against you?

b) ""... that supports perpetual at a different tuning...""? Why is the quality of your English so mixed? Is this account run by different people? Am I debating with multiple people here?

c) Your understanding is very deficient. Who said this was a ""stable universe""? **The universe will end**. Observations indicate that this universe is *inflationary*.

&gt; I usually do but there are certain things that are well stated and concise and keep coming up. The point for me is the idea and the debate not the source.

You stole and pasted entire paragraphs *verbatim*. You are not *just* a thieving plagiarist, you are a **liar**.

&gt; I stated my ideas were my own because you seemed obsessed with this Ray Comfort character.

**Diversionary** liar. I mentioned his name **twice**. Now you're using this to divert the point.

**Thieving** liar. You still stole whole chunks of Sawyer's text.

&gt; but honestly what does it matter.

**Stupid** liar. **You stole the text**. How are you not understanding this?

&gt; The idea stands waiting for a challenge regardless of whether it is from me or from Robert J Sawyer or Comfort or my great aunt Sally.

**Idiot**. The very same page from which you **stole** the text ***has a challenge on it***.

Not to mention, every single post of mine on **this thread** has ""challenged"" your points.

&gt; &gt;     Double slit. Radioactive decay.  
&gt; Let's take the other road.

Why? Because this is another one of those cases where I demonstrated where you were wrong, so you change the topic?

&gt; Trial and error could a sign of intelligence or it could brute force random chance.

Which means the entire argument is **useless** to you because you can't distinguish which.

&gt; You are being disingenuous when you state that I do not understand the basics or philosophy or science.

But you **don't**. At least twice I've had to call you on the *basics* of how science dismisses a sole hypothesis.

&gt; I do understand those things I just disagree with you.

The idea of multiple universes? Then why did you argue it further with your ""100 variable"" illustration?

The philosophy of science? Then you have **no right** to argue science, **because this is how science works**.

&gt; I don't accept multiple universe theory as a reason to completely disprove tuning could be god theory

You misunderstand **again**. And again and again and again. You say that ""god theory"" is reasonable and fits the observations.

Ignoring, even for a second, that it's **not** reasonable and **doesn't fit observations**; the point is that you **don't automatically assume it's true** simply because there's another theory, **simpler**, which **does** fit observations.

Stepping aside from the question of multiple universes or god, just for a minute: the above paragraph is a basic of science and its philosophy. If you don't accept that, then **you are not entitled to talk about science**, ***because that is what science is about***.

&gt; It really does not matter who I am but I assure my college days are long past.

You should go back.

&gt; As a scientific argument it is example of one of the weak anthropic principles of life fitting the tuning and life not being the purpose of the tuning. I debunked that. remember?

a) ""life not being the purpose of the tuning"" implies **some kind of life doing that tuning**. Which renders your argument worse-than-worthless.

b) Your ""debunking"" was to say that there was more evidence of ""god theory"" than there was of ""multiple universes""; to which I said there was more evidence suggesting multiple universes. To which you responded ""let's change tack here and talk about something else"".

&gt; &gt;     The source is not an issue. Your wholesale theft is.

&gt; Why? What does my character have to do with it.

The first problem is the issue of your plagiaristic theft. You tried to pass off somebody else's work - not as an *inspiration or source* - but as **your own words**. If you're capable of that kind of dishonesty, then it makes it much harder to trust you.

The second problem is that you assumed your opponent was stupid enough to miss your inconsistency.

Adding to that, you tried to talk about ""having respect for you"" **while having no respect yourself by trying to be so dishonest**. Which **also** makes you a ***hypocrite***.

The third problem is you tried to **compound** your dishonesty, implying you **were** Robert Sawyer. Even more dishonesty **and setting a pattern** which indicates you are *habitually* dishonest and maybe *shouldn't be trusted*; and calls the rest of your testimony in question.

&gt; You are looking for an out. A disqualifier. A way to not address the idea that your bag of pat answers has already failed against.

a) *The entire Reddit record demonstrates that I have addressed all of your ideas*.

b) *The entire Reddit record demonstrates that you have no right to talk about ""pat answers"" when you* **plagiarised someone else's work**.

c) And the only ""out"" I want is to avoid your dishonesty; ***all*** of the multiple levels and kinds of dishonesty you've displayed in this entire thread. Not to mention the dishonesties I've called you on in **this post alone**, before you try repeating your lying rubbish claims ""you haven't proved me wrong, where have you proved me wrong"".

You still haven't addressed the questions I summarised nearly ten posts ago and **repeated** for you a couple of posts ago.

If you could discuss this *honestly*, I wouldn't want any kind of ""out"".

&gt; &gt;     Storage capacity means nothing. Storage capacity irrelevant in relation to this entire argument.

&gt; I did not make it an issue.

Rubbish.

1) **You** brought it up.

2) You're the one who even tried to change the point by saying it was about ""storage capacity""; when I first read what you said about ""not being able to begin to understand the machinery of the cell"" and **you** said it was about ""storage capacity"".

Oh, by the way: even if I accepted your lie about ""it being about storage capacity"", your claim about ""us not being able to even begin to understand how to replicate it"" would still be *absolute rubbish*, ***as demonstrated by the very paper you pointed me to***.

&gt; I still think it is amazing to the point of impossible that a ""random chance"" created DNA cell

**Not** ***random***. **We already covered this.**

&gt; There is not a published paper, book or degree in the name of mrhymer from reddit.

***Are you Robert J. Sawyer?***

&gt;  In the academic world my reddit handle is not a source that can take credit for someone else's work. mrhymer does not exist in the academic world. I cannot take credit for someone else's work unless I attach my real name (not my reddit handle) to the work.

**We covered this already**. ""Plagiarism"" is **not** limited to the academic world. You reproduced whole paragraphs verbatim without attribution. ***Unless you are Robert J. Sawyer, you are a plagiarist***.

&gt; I accept your resignation. It has been fun.

I'm not resigning.

Why would I resign when your points have been demonstrated false? Is this just that creationist ""crapping on the chessboard"" feature the the more-*dishonest* theists do?

- It's not just that you're arrogant. I'd forgive that if you were right.  
- It's not just that you're ignorant. I'd forgive that if you'd stop repeating already demonstrated-false arguments.  
- It's not just that you're unintelligent. I'd forgive that if you'd at least show some interest in learning where you're wrong.  
- It's not just that you're patronising. I'd forgive that if you were right and I was wrong.  

It's that you're arrogant **and** ignorant **and** unintelligent **and** patronising **and** ***wrong*** **and** ***dishonest, compounding that dishonesty and stupid into the bargain***.","1277943507"

In the United case, they went bankrupt - I'm sure the reasons are complicated but their union contracts no doubt contributed, which makes it harder to sympathize with the workers who want to have their cake and eat it too.

Controlling medical costs would be great but we saw how hard that is to do through legislation.

* If you want to attract and retain top flight people you have to pay them.  As pollies get fuckall the super is one of the enticements
* He has been a politician for sometime and rose to the top job, therefore his super is actually quite reasonable

If people want to get outraged at how much politicians make on their super then lets lower it so no really capable people will enter politics. That would work really well wouldn't it.  Lets pay so little that only the bottom half of society would become politicians.

"self","t5_2qh96","I had a less serious but really unsetteling experience.

Some friends and I were bbqing in the park. Some other people were poking and torturing a bird with stick. The bird must have had some genetic malformation or been really ill because it didn't react as it should and it wasn't afraid of people. And of course the soon-to-be-drunk assholes didn't miss the oportunity to ""experiment"" with the poor bird.

So I decided, as the grew-up-on-a-farm kid I am, to do the merciful thing and kill the bird. (Yes yes, it sound cruel. But either I euthanised the poor thing or the park sadists would torture it, and the ravens would have it for lunch eventually. No, really. That's what happens.) So I picked up the bird (it wasn't afraid of humans at all) and killed it by hitting its head against a telephone pole.

I knew I had done the right thing by killing it. Letting it go would onely have postponed it dying a day or two while it suffered. But I felt awful. And I had blood on my hands. Literally. It was distusting and I didn't eat those hot dogs.

But. The next day my sisiter called me. After talking a minute or two she told me she had a nightmare last night. I had been really bad. The two of us had been out playing in the yard where we lived when we were kids. And the horrible thing was that I had blood on my hands..... Small drops of blood.

For 15 seconds I thought she must have some kind of connection with my mind. I too had a nightmare about killing the bird and having blood spray on my hands. For those 15 seconds I was revising my entire scpetical worldview to accomodate these new facts about reality. Ofcourse she then told me she had just spoken to one of my friends from the park...

(Almost) needless to say, I was relieved.","1277943563"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in thailand in 08. I decided that i would tag along with these two guys i met in the hostel for a night out. They were both a little older than me, but also i little more... shall we say, unrefined. One was 6'7 and south african. Quite obviously a rugby player. The other guy was english and probably 6'1. Anyway they take me to Pat pong, which is the red light district in Bangkok. They ask me if I've ever seen a ping pong show. I reply that no i haven't. So they lead me to this dingy little upstairs club where girls are doing various disgusting things. We get some beers and sit down by the stage. Eventually this quite portly middle age thai woman comes on stage. Her trick is shooting a rubber pickle out of her cooch. The second time she does it, she decides to aim the pickle in our direction. She shoots this pickle in a high arc. It glides gracefully through the air, bounces of the mouth of my beer bottle and lands square in the lap of the south african guy. He picks up the pickle, starts waving it around and yelling in the thickest south african accent ive ever heard ""I GOT DA PICKLE MAN!!!!"" if I hadn't seen the next part i wouldn't have believed it. Two of the bouncers try and wrestle the rubber pickle of this giant of a man. He's holding the pickle up as high as he can, with a bouncer hanging off each arm, their legs at least two feet of the ground, and he's acting as if they weight nothing. He gives them the pickle eventually and we get kicked out. We ended up at another bar where they have girls who pretend to like you and give you massages to encourage you to drink more. The giant south african passed out across 4 chairs and he had 4 tiny thai girls trying to life him while we watched. We left him in the bar for an hour to sleep. We came back the 4 thai girls were still trying to move/wake him. The english guy walked over to him. Slapped him in the face as hard as he could as said ""get up"". The giant woke up and we left. The english guy later that night fucked a thai hooker and locked her in the bathroom to avoid paying her. That was possibly the most surreal night of my life.

If this is true then the grant making culture is extremely toxic.  Why would I reject the proposal from a team that clearly has indicated that they will only accept my money if they believe they can get results and if they realize part way through that they cannot get them they will return what remains of my money?

A huge portion of the grants for these things come from the *government* so neither the grantor nor the grantee has a right to waste this money.  Just because the system is deeply corrupt and incentives waste, does not mean that this is the right thing to do.

&gt;All to save a little bit of money, when ""we tried hard and couldn't find any males who'd never looked at porn"" is a noteworthy result.

If your goal is to find a link between sexual pathology and porn and you are unable to create a valid control then you should not waste more money on the study.  If your goal is to research the general topic of porn then these results are very noteworthy.

I don't know where you got that idea.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;Huh? Where did I say they shouldn't be able to do what they want? The question is whether or not people act a certain way due to free choice, or circumstances that lead to a choice.

When the situational argument is used against pornography it becomes a matter of whether or not the people who choose to go into pornography have the ability to consent to do so. Saying that people who have gone through *x* don't get to make choices about how they live their lives is reprehensible. It's as degrading as people claim porn is.

People who choose to go into all kinds of work do so for reasons that if they were going into pornography would be considered grounds to take away their initiative. But not nearly as many people care about the rest of these workers because their work doesn't make them so squeamish.

&gt;I think you may glean a better understanding of the concept by reading the article. I did.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Most of that can be dealt with before hand.  Discuss openly that you're sexually attracted to her, and verify that she is attracted to you.  If either of you isn't, then you're barking up the wrong tree.  If she's lying, then there's little you can do about it in any case until you find out.

If one of you loses the attraction after you've ""stuck it in,"" then you've got a mental problem that you need to deal with that's nothing to do with how compatible you are.

Quite frankly, a lot of the expectations that people have toward sex are things that they've set themselves over a lifetime of experience.  Until you have the experience, you don't have nearly as many expectations.  All I want out of it is:
1. Regular sex.
2. Not having sex used to punish or reward me, as if I were a child.
3. Sex just between us and no one else.

I can work with the rest.  I don't know how she'd get all kinky being a virgin, but you can still set boundaries on that sort of thing, if it bother you.

I'm not undermining the importance of sex, but I do think you're underestimating the ability of two people who have never had sex with others to enjoy it when they finally start.  Especially if they're reasonable enough to discuss problems that arise.  Think back to when you never had sex.  It was probably pretty awesome once you did, right?

Yes, there may be some smoking hot girl out there who's better at sex than the future wife, but if my only goal is to find out who the best lay is, then I wouldn't be here looking for a lasting relationship.  Best match doesn't mean they're perfect, but if you're both willing to work to please, I don't see how you can't make it work.","1277943641"

As a benchmark, I have a Core i7-930 overclocked to 4.0ghz with GTX 480 SLI and I get 4600 score. I've seen people run that with 9800GTX and 8800GT's and get 1000-1500 score.

Easily capable of running the game on the highest settings.

[5500–7999] Very High Performance
Easily capable of running the game. Should perform exceptionally well, even at higher resolutions.

[4500-5499] High Performance
Easily capable of running the game. Should perform well, even at higher resolutions.

[3000-4499] Fairly High Performance
Capable of running the game on default settings. Consider switching to a higher resolution depending on performance.

[2500-2999] Standard Performance
Capable of running the game on default settings.

[2000-2499] Slightly Low Performance
Capable of running the game, but may experience some slowdown. Adjust settings to improve performance.

[1500-1999] Low Performance
Capable of running the game, but will experience considerable slowdown. Adjusting settings is unlikely to improve performance.

Unknown bands constantly get fucked over by venues not paying or cancelling after you drove all the way out (due to shitty management or low turnout) and travel problems that usually stem from not having money in the first place so you bought a used van.

They were *late* at the end of '07 on their dues...  up until Feb '09 they could have paid and avoided all this.  The fees bringing it to $3,000+ were not until after they tried to collect on the ~$800 (iirc) for over a year....

You are right about small claims court but an HOA is usually seen as a different kind of contract than just a personal financial arrangement.  It is more like a credit card by design, you agree to pay a certain amount and they have the responsibility of whatever that particular HOA does.  The real problem is why would someone pay after a small claims judgment if they have not already paid?

It would be like your credit card company suing you in small claims for the $5,000 you owe them...  there is no point, unless they have done something outside the contract.

Unfortunately it is the way we set up our laws.  On the flip side though I can guarantee you that house is only a $300,000 house because it is in a neighborhood that has an HOA.  ","1277943769"

The title 'Lady' can refer to the wife of a Lord *or* the wife of a knighted male (ie, a Sir). So in a sense, 'Sir' is as correct as 'Lord'.

But. 'Lord' isn't really a title, it's an address; the actual titles would be Duke (Duchess), Marquess (Marchioness), Earl (no feminine equivalent), Viscount (Viscountess) or Baron (Baroness). All[1] of which could be addressed as Lord or Lady, and the wife of any of these could/should be addressed as Lady. (I'm not actually sure how you address the husband of any of the female equivalents - thankfully, I don't hobnob with the upper class all that often)

'Dame' would be the correct title for a female knighted person, of course.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Atheism is simply the state of not believing in any god(s). Atheists may accept or reject any number of things as a matter of personal preference. However, atheism is NOT the rejection of theistic religions - some theists do that too. For example; deists and pantheists. 

One who rejects religions must first find something that collectively defines all religions. One thing is that they all propose some supernatural form of consciousness - another is that they all require faith in that belief of supernatural ""self"". One who rejects the supernatural would be accurately defined as a material rationalist - one who rejects faith itself would be accurately defined as an infidel (it's not just a naughty word that muslims call everyone else - it literally means ""without faith"").

I, personally am:

An atheist: because I don't believe in the existence of god(s).

A gnostic: I believe that everything that really exists has properties, because if they have no determinable cause or effect in our universe then by definition they don't exist, so if god(s) really do exist, then we should one day be able to detect them.

An agnostic: because the dual-definition of the word also includes those who believe there is no evidence of god(s) currently, regardless of whether or not we can possibly detect that in the future. 

A rationalist: because I require all claims be supported by evidence.

A materialist: because I believe that anything that is actually real has to exist in the natural world. Is there really an alternative?

An infidel: I reject the idea of faith as a wholly dishonest position. It is not a virtue; it's the very antithesis of it.

I think most of r/atheism would be accurately described as infidels, rationalists, materialists and (of course) atheists. But MOST atheists are not infidels, nor rationalists, nor even materialists; and it's dishonest to claim it as such. MOST atheists *are* religious and *do* believe in supernatural. Chinese religion is largely based on a non-theist mixture of taoism, confusionism and ancestor worship. Approximately 40% of buddhists do not believe in any god. Those are **huge** groups of people who are atheist by definition.","1277943792"

So it loses indestructibility, and also stays in the graveyard if it's killed, since it doesn't have that ability until after it hits the graveyard. If it has an aura or equipment on it, any abilities granted by the aura/equipment (flying, trample, lifelink, etc.) are removed, but any power/toughness bonuses are kept. Also, bonuses granted by +1/+1 counters are kept as well. So if you played it against, say, a Mycoloth with 6 +1/+1 tokens, it'd be a 6/8 with no abilities.

Perhaps the lack of clarity is just that it's an introspective thought question to get at the core reasons behind your high degree of confidence. You seem more comfortable with logical reasoning than with introspection.

* One the one hand, you've shown (as described above) that logical reasoning leads to a dead end in the [dis]proof debate.

* On the other hand, your answer to why you have a high degree of confidence that God's existence cannot be proven refers to empiricism (as described above) and history of philosophy (as described above.)

Perhaps here's another way to clarify my question. Your arguments above show that *it is possible* that God can exist and yet His existence cannot be proven. My question is, why are you so certain that that is the case? There are plenty of believers out there who think God's existence *can* be proven, and refer to evidence of floods, problems with evolution, studies showing the efficacy of prayer, etc. to buttress their positions.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt;That Fucking Mouse

The fact that copyright is poorly legislated does not make music piracy ok. I'll stand right there with you in the fight to reform it, up to a point. It sounds like you'd rather it be done away with entirely, and I can't go along with that.

&gt;In the article, a young woman wants to sing a song. She wants to collaborate with other artists, put on a show, but she is forbidden by copyright law.

She can't purchase a copy of the sheet music because she doesn't have a credit card. She is not forbidden from singing, collaborating or putting on a show. It's kind of sad, but not a violation of any inherent rights.

&gt;do artists generally share, copy and imitate one another?

That's whole other can of worms. Do artists share? I'm sure they do. When/If they do *it's their choice to do so*. They grant permission. That's very important. Copy/imitate: This is getting into the field of who influenced who, and that's not really what I'm talking about at all.

&gt;In the young woman's example, she suggests that she will sing the song for other people and increase the artist's exposure. Is that valid?

Not at all. The original posting has a complete rebuttal of her remarks and I don't think I could or need to expand or improve upon it. You're pretty much mirroring her exactly, and Brown's response works just as well in both cases.

&gt;In the composers example, one should pay to get his ""intellectual property.""

People should be paid for their efforts, yes. That's how capitalism works. Actually, that's how most economic systems work.

&gt;This puts money in the music company's pocket, and tends to suppress the work of smaller, and more distant acts. Is this really better for artists? For society?

Again, this is a separate issue. What this really means is that artists have shitty contracts. I think they deserve better pay too, and I love it when I see independent record companies paying artists better than the majors. But that does not make piracy OK. You're still gaining possession of something you did not pay for. It doesn't make the pirate a modern day Robin Hood. It just makes them a pirate.

But perv is a good example, so is 'creep' or 'creeper' - in fact it's worse because it's used so easily, and is completely subjective - one person's creep is another person's hopeless romantic probably depending on how good looking he is.

The fact is, you aren't going to find a tit for tat analogue for each word as each gender has it's unique issues with another.

""psycho"" probably resonates more with guys describing crazy hormonal women, perhaps women have another word.

Also, what I describe as a slut may well be different to what some prissy middle class know-nothing describes as a slut.

One of them may well be said out of anger, and one may be a judgmental act that implies a sense of morality you disagree with.

But the fact is, you shouldn't be telling people what you ""like"" or don't because all you are doing is applying peer pressure on your brother to emotionally manipulate him into behaving in a way that fits with your morals - a behaviour that I could easily dig up a few derogatory words for.","1277943855"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I am pretty sure temperature depends only on kinetic energy, e.g. translations.  Each molecule has 3N-6 orthogonal vibrations, where N is the number of atoms in the molecule.  These correspond with the 3N-6 degrees of freedom, which basically means you need 3N-6 (orthogonal) data points to uniquely specify the geometry of a molecule.  The 6 comes from rotation and translation in 3 dimensions (3 orthogonal rotations + 3 orthogonal translations).  Only the magnitude of the translations affect temperature.  Other vibrations or rotations can be converted into translational energy, or heat, by molecules colliding.  For example, microwaves work by energizing certain vibrations in molecules, and this energy is transferred into heat by the molecules bumping into one another, which transfers energy between the vibrations and translations.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that while molecules can store energy in vibrations and rotations, these do not directly contribute to heat.  Only translational energy contributes to heat.  The other vibrations are energy sinks which vary from substance to substance, which is why some substances require more energy to heat up (higher heat capacity).","1277943863"

Along with my best wishes, here are some design/layout suggestions for the homepage that I would maybe play about with:

1.) The text underneath the main image that introduces the site and explains how it works looks rather squashed and hard to read.


If you got rid of 'Latest Blog' (which isn't as high priority) it would leave more room for you to make the intro text bigger/clearer and allow you to fit more words on fewer lines ('Blog' could maybe be moved to a page of its own?)


2). Where you have the games listed at the bottom (i.e. Action, Puzzle etc.) You need a heading saying 'Games by Category' (or something like that) just like you have headings for 'Newest Games' and 'Popular Games'. 


Use the same colour and font size as this baiscally helps keep the look/use of headings consistent throughout the site and makes it 100% clear what content is below. I think this also applies to game category pages where at the moment plain body text has been used for headings which look at bit weak.


3). Try and keep 'Last Week's Winners' entries all on one line if you can. It helps the eye read the entries easier/quicker, while at the same time saving you a lot of vertical space.


The games are awesome! Keep up the good work mate! :)

My entire point is that the import of the two terms need not be the same just because the same word is used to express them. I will grant that 'the cause of what exists mod X cannot itself exist mod X' If you allow the wider definition, then you come up with 'the cause of what exists, including things of which we cannot conceive, cannot itself be in the set of what exists, including things of which we cannot conceive. I would grant this as well.

Cool.

&gt; Here is your problem. You have yet to give me a reason why this can't be true: 'the cause of what exists, not including the things of which we cannot conceive, may be in the set of what exists, including things of which we cannot conceive.

Ah, well I never intended to prove *that*. The cause of something we can conceive may very well be something we cannot conceive. As a matter of fact, quantum mechanics comes to mind. That stuff seems inconceivable to me yet it seems to explain a lot of conceivable things. But I think of what exists as both the conceivable and the inconceivable so I prefer to take all of it into consideration instead of separating them. It all matters as long as it all exists.

&gt; You are assuming that all things have a cause

No, no, no. I thought by now you would have heard what I'm saying: existence has no cause.

&gt; You can arbitrarily decide that 'to exist' means 'to cause and be caused', but I don't necessarily have to accept that definition

I agree. Pick any definition you like. I seem to be repeating myself.

&gt; whether or not I can conceive of something as existing without a cause, except in the abstract, doesn't have any bearing on whether or not such a thing exists.

I agree again. As I said before, existence doesn't care about what humans can or cannot conceive.

To top it off, you can't get your money back, and you can't stop halfway and ask for a refund because the movie sucks.  So either the movie studios/theatres get to rip you off for $11.50, or you can turn around and rip them for $15.

Several people have stated quality over quantity - and that may be where I am missing. Right now I've been riding for base, what I need to do going forward isn't necessarily doing longer rides but for the time being push my self harder.

Actually, it pretty clearly is.

&gt;""I love my girlfriend."" This can be neither invalidated nor validated. I guess I shouldn't entertain such feelings?

You are free to do so, since you can easily prove that your girlfriend actually exists.

&gt;I don't know if you're just a bit dense or if you're intentionally misunderstanding me.

You are either communicating poorly or pretending that I don't understand rather than having to concede that your assertion is nonsensical.

&gt;This ""the moderates enable the extremists"" argument is completely intellectually bankrupt. You can discredit literally any ideology or belief on these grounds.

You can keep on ignoring the threats inherent to magical thinking, but that will not change the truth of that I am saying.

&gt;It was an exaggeration, obviously.

Then why say it -- obviously.

&gt;Because people have never gone to war, committed genocide, or enslaved without using religion as a justification.

This assertion is so staggeringly ignorant that I cannot comment on it in a civil manner. Pass.

&gt;Hmmm, it's almost as if...bad people use religion to justify their bad actions after the fact!

Quite intriguing that you apparently completely miss that you are arguing my point.

&gt;Ummm...it's not the 16th century dude.

It is the 16th century in many parts of Africa and the Middle East. Or do you feel comfortable walking into a bazaar in Medina and announcing that you are rejecting Islam? Perhaps you can illuminate the joys of the 21st century for a 12-year old girl who's not allowed to learn how to read and had acid thrown on her face because she didn't want to marry a 60 year-old pedophile. Maybe you can explain to the Congolese how raping a virgin doesn't cure you of AIDs, nor will your village be saved from drought when you burn a girl at the stake because you think she's a witch. 

Then come back here and tell us what century it is. Come back and tell us that these problems have nothing to do with religion and its enforcement of ignorance in the name of maintaining control. Come back and tell us that we're moving along just fine. Dude.","1277943992"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","I'm a fan of services which do one thine very well.  For instance I'd rather use a great photo site and a great video site, then tie it together with a site that's great for sending updates out to groups of people vs using facebook's sub-par photo galleries and video pages.  I'm also a fan of the 37 Signals apps which are very focused, but work very well to fill their niche.  When the Blackberry came out, that's what it was.  It did email and it did it really well.  However, I think we've reached a point where many devices can do email really well, or at least well enough where it can't stand on its own.  In the same vein, I think updating social networks can be done well, or at least well enough, on so many other devices that we've moved beyond the point where a dedicated device is useful (without ever having that device).    

Dedicated devices and service are also good when you are in a place where you can have multiple device/services around.  For instance, it works on the web because I can go to multiple sites easily.  When it comes to something you are going to want with you all the time you don't want it to only do one thing.  For instance when I got an iPhone I could carry just that vs my phone, iPod, and camera... and it some cases even my laptop when going on short trips.  It wasn't the best camera, but the iPhone 4 reaches that ""good enough"" stage for 95% of my needs.  And of course the best camera is the one you have with you.  That doesn't mean an SLR isn't needed for a job occasionally and they are better cameras without question.  It does one thing and does it well, but I wouldn't want to carry it with me all the time.  If I was at a studio I'd want an SLR, lights, and a computer running something like Aperture.  In something you carry with you, you compromise to get the most out of what you have.  A 5MP camera, with an LED flash, and a limited editing app.  Not the best, not single devices, but if you're running around and need to take some quick pictures, do a quick color correction and send it off... it's may be a preferred method.    

I know the difference between ""enticing"" and ""exciting""... I wasn't really reading that closely, my apologies.  Although, in this case I think I could have also used ""enticing"" (maybe with slightly fewer exclamations) and it still would have conveyed what I was trying to get across... the loop is neither enticing, nor exciting.","1277944006"

She never said, or implied, anything about education taxes. You're reading something into the quote that simply is not there. Your error, not mine.  

You see we were both being selective as neither of us focused on the insurance comment.  We can argue if immigrants cost more money than they give but i think you would find yourself on the losing end of that stick.  We both know that the benefit of illegals to society transcends the taxes they pay.

""Just because you consider a service the government provides a waste, does not mean people are not receiving a benefit from it. Everyone who is inside the US, whether they make a penny or a trillion dollars, receives protection from our defense budget. While I agree we spend too much on defense, it is still a service that is provided pretty equally to all people.""

Ok do I receive a benefit from F-22's or B-1's even though they are completely ineffective?  Yes everyone pays for it but what benefit does the US receive?  I think you are making a logical fail their and maybe an equivication, when u say benefit you are meaning directly like child education but in this sense you are using a societal benefit.  In this sense we all benefit from kids being educated, so you can't make an argument utilizing your argument that people receive more services than they pay for.
 
Per Capitia old people cost me Medicare and Social Security: $37,680 max payout per year and $14477 for medicare.  Try to beat that with an illegal with kids, on welfare, food stamps, and section 8.  

Sorry about the 1% opinion I thought you were the one that made a comment about not being a trumpeter of the rich and I thought I would tell you I felt the same.

Ok then lets address your inconsistencies in full, you think everyone benefits from the military but we don't all benefit in public education, I infer this because you hint that the costs of military are on the shoulder of everyone, but don't make the same extension to education.  So your argument is that the rich pay for everything, then by this fact wouldn't just about every child in that school be a drain?  Couldn't she have said that to any kid.  Lastly you didn't provide per capita numbers only a statement about the rich paying most of the taxes.  I provided the numbers so who is bring in irrelevant facts?","1277944018"

...and then three months later the Pentiums came out, and the PCI bus came out, and our modem pool only had 2 9600 baud modems and 18 2800 baud modems and it took half an hour to connect to one most of the time and I when the SCSI card went out I had to mutherfucking check resistances on traces on the goddamn board with a voltmeter and that's when I decided that no matter how fast your computer is, it will still suck within minutes of getting it out of the box.","1277944069"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","His personal experience of his orientation absolutely does disprove your limited understanding of sexual orientation to him, because he, like I know you're just simply wrong because we've always just been attracted to one gender. Some people are, in fact arousal studies have suggested that most people are only attracted to one gender.

Society desperately pushes us to be attracted to the opposite gender, but some of us just aren't. It took me a long time to even accept that bisexuality exists (and many gay people still don't believe in it), because it's so far outside my own experience. This is where you seem to have failed - you can't understand other people being different to yourself.

And there's a long history of exclusive homosexual attraction. Aristophanes wrote about orientations. There's the North American berdache and the hijra of India. Zeno, Bion, Alexander the Great, Virgil, and Plato were exclusively homosexual. Ptolemaeus suggested homosexuality was caused by astrology. Ephesiaca had a main character who was not interested in women, but was in men. etc. etc. 

Plus even if you weren't wrong, and there had never been a single person writing about it, that in no way indicates it didn't happen. More primitive cultures had more primitive understandings of sexuality, and still had social reasons to hide theirs.","1277944117"

However this argument then depends on the particular logic you are using and on the way programs are written. I'm not at all convinced that this is the case.

Yup.   I'm looking at long term (100's to 100's of years from now) what the goal should be.   We won't get there if we don't have a vision.

&gt;. But, I hope society can use a combination of energy sources to limit polluting sources like coal and oil. Again, we have to be realistic. We can't (as a race) digress back to a hunter/gatherer society.

I agree.   What we need is clean and safe energy technology that doesn't mess up our ecosystem.  Same with fertilizers etc.    I would also agree we should try to stabilize world population at a much smaller number than now (several billion would be doable but I would like to see less).

&gt;Cars may not be green, but that doesn't mean the people who drive them (since you can only realistically live in certain areas without a car) can't try to live a green life. We have to work with what we have, you know?

I would argue that it's being pretend green if you have a car.

Keep in mind that I'm pursuing these goals in a different way.   I own a car (2 actually) and drive pretty much every day.  So I'm a total hypocrite when it comes to this stuff.   At our current level of social technology we are basically doomed to pollute until we start dying en mass.

Whose Conspiracy?

By Eoghan Sweeney
Chief Football Writer
It has taken the form of a trial. Media, coaches and players - generally from countries whose teams are now on their summer holidays - arm themselves with statistics that add up to ""evidence'' proving there is a conspiracy by South Korea.

Taken at face value, the figures seem compelling. Portugal had two red cards against the home side. Italy had one. Italy and Spain had ""goals'' disallowed. Clear proof of favoritism - or is it?

Take these incidents one by one, rather than as a single lump, and the picture is somewhat different.

Portugal did indeed have two players sent off. Both were thoroughly deserved. Joao Pinto's airborne, two-footed lunge from behind on Park Ji-sung was one of the worst fouls of the entire tournament. Beto received two yellow cards, both for blatantly taking down a player who had beaten him - a clearly bookable offense.

Football has rules for a reason, and when a team runs foul of them, who is to blame? Rather than showing bias, the referee was applying those rules.

Francesco Totti could consider himself unlucky for his second yellow card. Unlucky, but not dreadfully sinned against. There was contact when the Italian forward went down under a clean tackle, Song Chong-gug getting a foot in and taking the ball away, but the melodramatic appeals for a penalty that may have decided the game hardly helped his case.

The next statistic is that Italy had a goal disallowed, and Spain, two.

Again, there were poor decisions. Tommasi appeared to be onside in the South Korea-Italy match, and the ball was clearly still in play when Spain's Joaquin crossed for Morientes.

To call these ""disallowed goals,'' however, ignores the fact that Lee Woon-jae, one of the tournament's best goalkeepers, made no attempt to save.

Indeed, a biased referee would have been well within his rights to book Tommasi for running on and putting the ball in the net after the whistle had gone and the South Koreans had stopped playing.

The assertion on one of the world's most influential football websites that ""Spain were robbed of a golden-goal winner'' is a shameful overstatement of the reality of the situation, and it is interesting that having originally said that Fernando Morientes had headed home ""with goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae stranded,'' this latter part was later removed, presumably after someone had paid more attention to the replay.

Two poor decisions, certainly, but ""two goals disallowed'' sounds a tad exaggerated.

Spain did have one disallowed in the second half, but again replays show a clear foul.

Just as disturbing as this skewed use of statistics is the tendency to take a one-sided view.

South Korea have benefited from poor refereeing decisions. That is a simple fact. Just as simple is that so have other teams. Furthermore, South Korea have also suffered from poor decisions.

Quite how Spanish midfielder Romero escaped unpunished for two scandalous tackles is mystifying. Had Kim Nam-il gone in, studs up, into a Spanish player's shin, ending his involvement in the game, and got off scot-free, rather than vice-versa, it would no doubt have been cited as further proof of a ""fix."" How would things have turned out if Spain had been down to 10 men from the 13th minute on?

Joaquin had a marvelous match, but won such a number of dubious free-kicks that one had to wonder whether the referee had his mind partly on the disgraceful public intervention by Sepp Blatter the day before. Is the FIFA chief so naive as to think fair play could be served by publicly supporting Italy, a team who were claiming to have been robbed by South Korea and the officials?

Ironically, South Korea were among the first victims the last time FIFA put pressure on referees, Ha Seok-ju getting red-carded against Mexico in 1998 for a tackle from behind shortly after the governing body had ordered a clampdown and thrown players and officials into confusion.

Watching the quarterfinal, Ha must have been bemused to see Romero clatter into Song Chong-gug in identical fashion in the second half and escape without even a booking.

Italian players twice got the benefit of the doubt when swinging the arm into players' faces in a manner that in the English Premier League at least is generally punished with red. Totti got yellow for felling Kim Nam-il; Vieri broke Kim Tae-young's nose without any repercussions.

Anyone looking at statistics might be interested to note that South Korea have conceded more free-kicks than any other team in the World Cup. It would take some stretch of the imagination to see them as being among the tournament's dirtier sides.

Of course, it is fascinating to have conspiracy stories flying around. It also helps fallen giants deflect responsibility for their own shortcomings - We didn't really lose; we were robbed. It is also misleading, and detracts from the achievements of a team who have worked their socks off to get to where they are. ","1277944140"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I disagree.  Voldemort is just another depiction of utter evil - terrible, but typical.  In this case, he's also fairly incompetent - his arrogance allows him to be beaten by an 11-year-old boy who's barely learned to hold a wand.  And a 12-year-old boy, etc.  Harry isn't all that spectacular as a hero, either.  He's brave, but pretty static.  If I had to vote best hero in that series, it would probably be Neville Longbottom, simply for character growth.

Umbridge, on the other hand, thinks she's a good guy.  She believes that she is saving the ministry from the evil child.  And she's enjoying her little power trip, being the right-hand of the Minister of Magic.  When evil is shown to truly exist, she completely fails to recognize it and continues her quest for power, shielded by denial.  

Her willful obliviousness makes me hate her even more than Voldemort - at least he can be honest with himself about it.  If Voldemort wanted something, he would torture and kill to get it, but he wouldn't mess around.  For him, the ends and the means were pretty much the same thing - kill muggles and supporters, gain power.  Umbridge, on the other hand, liked to humiliate her enemies, and made excuses so that she could behave in ways that she thought were against her character.  Torture was bad, but the ends justified the means - and she made every excuse she could for her behavior to avoid admitting that she just wanted the Minister of Magic to pat her on the back and give her yet another promotion. 

I wanted to see Voldemort defeated; I wanted to see Umbridge defeated in the most humiliating way possible.

The dust doesn't specifically make you sneeze/water up - the fact that it's traveling through your nose/eyes, when it shouldn't, does. Sneezing is more of a defense mechanism to keep particles out of your airways, so the fact that you sneeze when you breathe dust isn't really ""specific"" to dust. 

Dust becomes an allergy when your immune system recognizes it as harmful (even though it's not), and attacks it - so every time you come in contact with dust, you'll have an allergic reaction. Merely sneezing because dust has irritated your nose does not make it an allergy.","1277944250"

"Team_Awesome","t5_2rkx6","id say the SAW has the single most distinctive recoil in the game, strange gun to get used to compared to the other guns.  The funny part is Mos H8ted on, who plays with us rdt dudes occasionally and is actually in the army and has fired many of these weapons, told me the SAW was by far the closest to the real gun in the way it fired.  Considering that medics are by far the best overall class by a mile, I find it weird that the most realistic acting gun in a game is also the best, because that usually isn't the case.   I find the SAW is basically as good as the PKM at long range, PKM might have a slight edge but the actual time it takes to drop someone is about the same.  The SAW is just a little bit harder to control at really long ranges, but it's so much better at close and mid range that the point is moot.  Also, if you need a long range Medic weapon, especially on an open map like Arica Harbor, use the MG36 with Magnum, nothing will beat it in a long range open field firefight.  So the PKM doesn't really fit into my game, because for almost all situations I'll whip out the SAW and for really long range I'd rather have an MG36 over an AN94 or anything really because the scope on MG36 seems faster and more precise than a 4x to me and lightweight is free.

Mario has become the butt of all jokes regarding continuous use of an IP. With each new game heralded by the jokes that Princess Peach has once again be stolen away to some remote castle. And rather than be imaginative, or develop a new IP for a different game or genre, Nintendo prefers to go for easy recognition and sure money.

At least with different IPs, each game has a different story to tell. So it's not nearly as boring as telling either the same story, finding where to insert the game in an existing story, or just saying to ignore the previous story completely.

A lot of these people know they need to change. But it's more often easier said than done. What's worse for them is the social stigma attached to each of their problems and the shame of it. If you ever try having a serious conversation with any of them about it, you'll find they know they need to change, they're aware of what people think of them and they know the damage they're doing to themselves. But over/under eating, thinking a certain way etc. are habit forming. It's hard to break and with the added shame, it makes people want to escape, often by turning to said habit. 

If you really think a person should change their weight, you'd not crack weight jokes around them. One of the first steps to overcoming my sisters anorexia/borderline bulimia was getting family members to stop cracking weight related jokes. Now that she's recovered she can joke about this sort of stuff, but back then it would have made her go purge herself.

"fashion","t5_2qhoq","If you want really good fitting shirts, especially if you have a thin frame, you'll need to get made-to-measure. Brooks Brother does it if you want B&amp;M (I think they charge $150?), but the cheapest places are going to be online where they outsource to Asia (around $80). You'll have to be really good with measuring though.

Another option is to alter your shirts. Tailors can completely remove the sleeves/arm, narrow/raise the armhole, pull in the shoulder seam, and shorten the arm length. In narrowing the armhole, the sides get tapered as a result. This may sound complicated, but it's really easy. Any good tailor will know how to do this, and mine charges $30.

Pants are much easier to alter, and you can have the legs easily tapered to your liking. The disadvantage is that it raises the crotch/rise, so don't buy low-rise pants for this!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","We lived in the country, so I had put aside 50 bucks to buy fireworks with. I was popping firecrackers and my Mom's husband (who is 10 years older than me) heard me popping firecrackers. He comes out of the house, so drunk he can't really see. He lights off pack of 100 firecrackers and throws it. With his drunken aim, they arch up in the sky and land *behind* one lens of my glasses. My left eye socket swelled up to about 3 times normal size and I couldn't see out it. Since this is not city limits, there wasn't an ambulance and I had to call my girlfriend to come take me to the emergency room. Since it was the 4th of July, the doctors were apathetic. ""I'm not looking at that,"" said the doctor. ""You have to go to Brady Green (halfway across town)."" Top it off, he says I *have* to take an ambulance since he already talked to me. So I got an eyepatch and a $250 ambulance bill for the 4th.

There are some kids, that when adopted go through a 'honeymoon phase'.  The kid acts like a angel for fear of being 'returned' to the orphanage.   That period lasts a few months 
and then the 'fun' begins.  With Josie we skipped the honeymoon stage and went straight to the testing phase.  She soon found out that yes, there is ample food and a large degree of freedom but there are also rules which need to be followed.  You can't just grab toys from people, you can't have water or food whenever you want.  I distinctly remember her 'packing' her backpack after the first meltdown and me holding open the hotel door for her to 'leave'.

After China, a big issue we discovered was 'idle' time.  On days without a 'schedule' she would get very anxious and often start misbehaving for attention.

More recently our biggest issue is that, simply put Josie is a very strong willed child that has a lot if survival mechanisms built in.  She hates 'thinking'.  She is very impulsive and is 100% cause, 0% effect.   My wife summed it up well in the blog post.

I've been in a few indie bands that draw decent crowds to shows and didn't even have a record or t-shirts, but the kind of money you make from a well attended show every now and then is not nearly enough to make a living off of.

Hell if you just say the name I will assume you are at least a friend. Plus email coupons can be forwarded very easily.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There is no model, mathematical models about human action are bullshit, you can never measure what people with free will want or will do. (You can form a model about a corporation's working upto some extent though, because you are modeling roles like manager, salesman, programmer, not individuals with free will).

The only way something like that would happen less if a society just becomes a lot more prosperous(even that is not that much of a solution to be honest considering the amount of domestic violence and abuse in America), but from what I have seen in India when people get richer, and there are more jobs for woman, they feel easy to walk out of an abusive household(you would rarely find an alcoholic woman who abuses her husband) so these things come down, but its rarely a big figure.

For example a woman who lived in 18th century would find it much harder to leave her alcoholic husband compared to a 21st century NYC working woman, simply because there is a lot more capital accumulation in 21st century than in 18th century, menial jobs aren't the only jobs out there.

About crime linked to alcohol, just reduce the goddamn taxes on it already. Its my another observation, in India taxes on alcohol are really high, so nobody drinks beer, people stick to hard liquors(more value for their buck), so someone who drinks in India is almost as useless as an alcoholic in America. My dad would tolerate me doing cannabis after work, but he wouldn't tolerate me drinking(coz he has never seen cannabis addicts, never heard of it, coz its more easily available than alcohol and safer than illegal liquor in India).
If I lived in India, I would not drink alcohol, because I wouldn't be able to afford it on my salary, and it will cause massive economic problems(and violence).","1277944396"

This however, has god only knows what consequences.

To risk future people with a drug that clearly has ethical concerns, without any kind of formal testing, just to 'cure' something that isn't even known to be curable, or even whether the foetus is likely to actually BE homosexual, is not only ridiculous, but it is monstrous too.

Even more disgusting is that the kind of people that actively WANT this kind of thing to be tried, are the same kinds of people that will turn their back on the thousands of sufferers when/if it turns out that they develop something horrific such as Phocomelia, and are the same people that generally want to restrict free health care and welfare in the US.

Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss ... and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way.

In early high school, my science teacher caught me reading a book by [Immanuel Velikovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Velikovsky), either [Worlds in Collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision) or *Earth in Upheaval*, a writer I was much impressed with at the time.  We talked about it for five or ten minutes.  I can no longer remember any of what he said, but I remember the general character of the conversation, and interpret it differently now than I did then.  At the time, I thought he was making some pretty obvious statements that made me generally unimpressed with his knowledge.  Now I think he was attempting to use the Socratic method to draw me into a discussion that would allow me to discover for myself the woolly thinking that Velikovsky's work is full of.  He probably realized that an outright attack this book I was so impressed by would make me turn a deaf ear to his arguments, but I was too stupid for the Socratic method to even have any traction with me.

The other time was in one of my early programming jobs, we had a code generation tool that took an object model specified using a [relational model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model) of data to generate code.  I had a conversation with someone that went something like this:

&gt; ME: Why don't we just introduce the option of having directed associations?  Then we don't have to do all this work in code generation to figure out which associators we need to generate and which would never be used and we could leave out?
&gt;
&gt; HIM: Then our model would no longer be relational (*subtext: our whole process assumes the model is relational, a bunch of other things would probably break if it couldn't make this assumption any more*)
&gt;
&gt; ME: Yes. Yes, it would no longer be relational. (*subtext: well yes, that is an obvious consequence, it doesn't even need to be said… (speaking over the whooshing noise*))

If 90% of the population believed that unicorns cause tornadoes, and had various groups and names for the groups based on the different theories about the unicorns and the tornadoes, and you were part of the 10% who realize that unicorns don't in fact cause tornadoes, you might create a name that would describe your lack of belief in such a strange concept.

Until the 19th century the full punishment for men in England for the crime of treason was drawing and quartering. (Women were burned at the stake.) The punishment more accurately should be called drawing, hanging, and quartering. The condemned person was dragged, or drawn, to the place of execution on a hurdle, a panel of fencing made from thin branches. He was hanged by the neck but cut down while still alive. His belly was cut open and his intestines removed and then burned before his eyes. He then was decapitated and his body was divided into four parts, or quartered.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Those changes are driven by clock speed.

1) If we increase clock speed from 4 GHz to 6 GHz (a massive increase by historical standards), that's only a 50% increase in processing power, holding the architecture steady.  Plus, you've just cranked up power use, heat, fan noise, and lowered the expected life of the component.  However, if you shrink the transistor size such that you can fit 2x as many on a die, you've doubled the processing speed of the chip, lowered power use, heat, and fan noise, and the component life is the same.  

2) You do that generation after generation, and very quickly you get 100X to 1000X improvements. Did you suppose those huge improvements weren't made up of 2X and 4X increments compounded over time?

Moore's Law is/was about transistor size, not clock speed. Clock speed was only ever a one-time ramp up to the material limits, which may happen again if we switch to a more robust material.","1277944605"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;If you really have to supplement on the diet for it to be successful it really shows that it isn't a natural, ideal diet.

Not necessarily. The diet in many ways approximates a neolithic diet, and our digestive systems haven't evolved significantly since then, but our food systems have changed to where they are almost completely unrecognizable from neolithic sources. Almost all plants we eat have been hybridized for yield, pest resistance, shelf-life, etc., often at the expense of nutrition. B12 is abundant in soil and humans didn't used to wash off their veggies the way we do. Or whereas neolithic man might have had fish, he wouldn't have had fish laden with industrial effluent mercury and other toxins. So if there's an ""unnatural"" way to get the DHA, it's combating the *unnatural* state of today's fish. (I would eat fish if it could be found pristine, but that's almost impossible now, anywhere in the world.)

(As for B12, I mention this because it comes up a lot. My wife and I get our B12 tested annually and it's never low whether we supplement or not. But we started supplementing just to be safe when we started trying to have a kid.)

It's also actually quite possible to improve upon even an idealized neolithic diet, such as by adding anti-oxidants or phytonutrients that may have been available in one neolithic region but not another.

Anyway, ignore all of the above... I've known through online venues a couple thousand people on the raw vegan diet and never heard about hypothyroidism as a result. Is it possible you were predisposed to a genetic issue? It's hard to think of any ingredient in a standard diet that you would have added that eliminated the condition, except more food (calories and nutrients) overall. Or perhaps you avoided an allergen that you had inadvertently concentrated by going raw (nuts?). 
Most of your symptoms actually sound like things the diet cures in most people (evens out blood sugar levels, creates VERY regular bowel movements, etc.). 

There are a handful of arguments for saying some meat (not a lot) in a diet is optimal, but very few for supporting cooked vs raw plants, and none at all for grains vs fruits/veggies.

* Dynamic Import example is flat out broke; it only works for importing modules, pulling attributes from module space.  timedelta is a type, not a module, thus the equivalent 'import datetime.timedelta' isn't going to work.
* Object-dict hybrid is flat out broke... should be using __getitem__/__setitem__/__getattr__ ; further, it's bad design, use getattr/setattr/delattr instead (while that code forces old style class w/out much gain, new style is what makes sense and said functions would work seemlessly regardless of the class inheritance, or __slots__ abuse).
* The Error Recovery Pattern swallows keyboard interupts, memory errors, and all sorts of other valid shutdown exceptions.  Further, because it invokes start itself (meaning it recurses), it'll sooner or later blow up- due to it relying on self recursion to handle exceptions, it'll go deeper and deeper till it hits a stack exception trying to invoke 'start', then collapse all the way down.
* Raising Meaningful Errors has a nasty gotcha in it's ValueError example (realistically in all of them, but ValueError is the most likely copy/paste/bite-you-in-the-ass); simply put, consider if 'v' is a sequence.  It'll try to expand it, and... boom.","1277944807"

You now need to learn how to pedal properly and your speed will go up again. The important thing to understand is that you can now apply power through almost all of the pedals stoke. Basically what you need to do is focus on the upstroke of your revolution.  The best analogy I have heard is to imagine throwing your knee over the handlebars.  Gravity and the weight of your leg will take care of the downstroke.  You need to pedal so that your cadence is a bit higher than you are used to and in that way the downstroke wont bleed you of too much energy. 

I have taken this to the extreme in my case by using these [chainrings](http://www.rotorbikeusa.com/index.html), watch the video its quite interesting, which take much of the dead spot out of your stroke.

"technology","t5_2qh16","i don't really buy that idea, apple got tons of hype because of their branding, but the truth is that the product was leaps and bounds ahead of anything else on the market in terms of usability, not features, not storage, but usability. That polish and attention to detail and a well thought out ecosystem is what made it a continued success. Other phones have had big hype (not as big of course), only to fizzle out as soon as people had to use the thing, think Palm Pre. To say that the hype and branding alone has made the iphone sell as well as it has is misguided when there are recent examples of other apple products with tons of hype flopping once users got a shot at them (G4 cube, appletv) 


Also to say that ""if anyone else would have made the iphone first..."" is ridiculous, that was the whole reason it sold so well, every other company out there had no idea how to make a phone with the attention to detail and prioritizing of usability that apple brings to the table. Shoot, features wise (the usual metric for every other phone company out there) the iphone has always been out-gunned (just as the ipod was for most of its history), but what people figured out when they used it is that bullet points on the back of the box weren't all that mattered.


I just think apple earned the success of its latest products, they just out classed their competitors and bring much more to the table. They didn't have to keep others out of the arena or smash competitors to stay on top, they've simply competed. (we'll see how i feel about that after the HTC hearings get going of course)

Moreover, the driver will probably not be getting paid minimum wage if the wages are being paid under the table (which happens a lot for these small operations). As a result, he may rely on tips for most of his income. 

I was a delivery driver for a Chinese restaurant and I got shit for tips all the time. Even though I never said or did anything as drastic as your delivery guy (and I'll admit that he was way out of line especially when you already offered $2), I was exasperated by the fact that I would get no tips about 30% of the time and nominal tips 50% of the time (i.e., a nickel in change).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked as a tennis club grounds keeper one summer. It was a place in the mountains, so it was pretty hilly. One day, it was rainy/wet, and the owner had armor-alled the seat to the golf cart earlier in the day. The courts are scattered all over the place at different elevations and I was driving down to a lower set of them.  It's a fairly steep hill, with a nasty, rocky, 50 or 60ft dropoff at the end and the road curves around it. 

So, me and the perpetual child in me decided to barrel down the hill, as I always did, with more velocity than the golf cart was really designed to handle. As I'm approaching the curve and starting to brake, my foot slips off the brake pedal, I manage to jerk the steering wheel a bit in my clumsy attempt at regaining my balance, and the momentum of that transaction sent me gliding across the freshly armor-alled seat to the passenger side.  

At this point, I'm awkwardly dangling out of the passenger side of the golf cart, pretty much being held in by the armrest, a mere 4 seconds from flying this thing into the ravine. I have to get myself in a position to reach the brake pedal and then push down on it with both my hands as violently as I could. This results in a Hollywood-esque skid to within a foot of the dropoff before reaching a stop.  I then slowly gather my wits, do the standard ""Did anyone just see that?"" check, get the cart back on the road, and then continue on my way.

TL;DR I almost drove a golf cart off a cliff because it was rainy and the seats were slippery.","1277944971"

I'm really not proud of this. Each character represents countless hours spent on my computer. I recently cut back my hours and actually haven't played in about 2 weeks. WoW is turning to shit.

Basically what happens is I have my prot pally main. Until my recent cutback he was guilded and I'd play him most of the time. You can only tank so many heroics in your non-raiding time before you really get fed up with playing that one char all the time. You can obviously only do dailies once each day and PVP gets old after a while too.

So... I'll get one of my alts guilded. I'll buy all the heirlooms for that char and power-level the hell out of him and since hes guilded I'm still around to help guildies out or go tank an impromptu raid. I don't have to entirely exclude myself from essentially being my pally to stop playing him if that makes sense. If anyone needs my pally I'm only a relog away.

This then gives me a fresh set of goals to achieve. Since my pally (was) geared the only place I could upgrade was raids. Having a fresh 80 means I have blues all over the place so I could start running heroics with purpose and start focusing on my rotation, gear, gems etc and watch the DPS go up. I get to go from 'herp de durp I'm a typically retarded rogue who can't play his class' to outperforming my expected dps given my GS.

Its kind of like starting the game from scratch with all the fun challenges without having to actually lose all the progress I made on my main.","1277944986"

Luckily, Valve generally listens to customers. I even believe they occasionally read the Steam forums, so if you post there, it might actually lead to a fix. I think the ""remove finished downloads from list"" button is a direct result of community requests.

The only reason I can imagine this not being easier in the first place is *because* of the potentially gigabytes of downloads. You want to avoid people accidentally canceling a 10GB download by clicking some ""X"" on the downloads page, so you can only do that by removing the game manually from the list.

If you're looking to get in shape, it's just about calories burned, so either way is fine.  I was thinking more about developing your cycling endurance, specifically.

HIIT has lots of benefits, but if you *did* want to work toward longer rides, nothing beats hours in the saddle, IMO.  Plus HIIT!

I guess for me cycling is a way of life (daily transport as well as weekend recreation) so I don't see it in terms of a ""workout regime"" where I have to achieve a certain goal every week - I just ride whenever/wherever I can, and that seems to be working for me.  Just push yourself whenever you're riding.

I do set long term goals (doing a 220km ride in Oct, and have a weight target that I track weekly, for example...)

But they just ran around, hardly taking any cover of any sort.  In a group of 16, I was kicking names and taking butt.  Got shot a total of 23 times during the 15 minute period.  So I thought that because I was doing so well, I was surely going to be in first place once the scores were printed out.  This was unfortunately not the case.

Apparently, one of the laser tag packs was not functioning correctly.  It said that one person had ended up shooting only once but had a hit percentage of 12,531%.  She ended up having over a million points.  As for this guy who came in second, I only ended up with 15,000 points.  Oh well.

"opensource","t5_2qh4n","I've had the most success by trying to solve specific problems or add specific features.  After a few rounds of this I pick up on the high level structure of the project and I can work with it more smoothly.  The first time I work on a project it is very hard, but it pays off when I want to work on it later.

Generally I try and find some trick to take me to the most detailed code for the specific thing I want to change.  Trying to dig down from main.c will require learning lots and lots of extra stuff that is best learned slowly over the course of many tasks.  The most convenient trick I have is to find an error message or log message that occurs in the code I am looking for and then searching for that.  Sometimes this just leads to a resource id, but that can be tracked to an error handler, which can be tracked to the code I'm looking for.  More often I need something else.  Preferences are a good trick.  Figure out what preferences will change the behavior of the code you are looking for and follow that to the code.  Sometimes I can't come up with any good paths in.  I'd prefer to look at file names before attacking the program from from main().

"wallpapers","t5_2qhw4","HDR (High Dynamic Range, IIRC) is a gimmick where the photographer takes the same shot with different exposure levels and blends them together.  Supposedly it's so that you can get a picture like that where both the sky and the buildings are well-illuminated, but instead you just get annoying stuff.

For a more reasonable example (though bad photography), I took [this picture](http://imgur.com/cPSvz) as a test.  Without any HDR blending, one of two things would have happened:  The trees/grass would be completely black and the sky looks ok, OR the sky would be completely white and the trees would look ok.

**Edit:** I call it a gimmick because it's a relatively new thing - everyone's abusing the hell out of it right now.  Eventually the collective ""we"" will get over it and turn it into a useful tool.  For now, it usually makes your eyes hurt.","1277945107"

Josie would watch children interact with their parents and try new things on us.  She'd come home from school and would act like a three year old.  Trying to pout, being demanding.  All trying to figure out her 'role'.  
We are working on owning our behavior / decisions now which means being consistent and calling her on everything.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I graduated college in '04 and thought the world would be awesome. Turns out that's a bit of a lie. My boyfriend and I were fighting, my 2 best friends had decided to move to California (out of the blue) and I had a job I hated.

One night my friends and I were all getting together to watch the mlb playoffs. One of my roommates decided to introduce coke into the mix. She brought this full-length mirror from her room and laid it over the coffee table. ""Just snort and drink. Drink a beer though, otherwise you'll feel like shit in 20 minutes,"" is what she said to me. That night I bought a gram from the person who had brought the coke into our house.

I bought from that person for a couple weeks before I realized my friends would notice if I kept my buying on the ""inside."" So I contacted a bit of a shady friend for a source. On my 23rd birthday I got a call from him.

It started with a bag and soon I was buying an 8 ball a day. I lost 20 pounds in a time period that seemed like overnight. I never knew when my nose was going to bleed and walked around with parts of a cotton ball up my nose daily claiming it was allergies and I was ""puffy."" 

I had no idea what coming down from a drug like that was like because the worst I had done before it was pot, but the best way I can describe coming down is like a million ants trying to eat you alive. 

So yeah, long story short, (and I can give details if you ask specific questions) I lost everything in the span of 6 months.

**Edit:** I know I should have posted this at the top, but I'm a bit new to reddit, so I apologize.

**Edit:** I need to step away for about an hour. I'll be back to answer questions and also trying to get a blog set up where I can post the whole story that I wrote way back when. I was in talks with 17 magazine for them to feature it, but I think they decided it was a bit much for their publication at the time.

http://www.icfpconference.org/

From the past few years:

* 2010: Experience Report: Haskell as a reagent. Results and observations on the use of Haskell in a Python project (Google)
* 2010: Using Functional Programming within an Industrial Product Group: Perspectives and Perceptions (Citrix)
* 2009: Experience Report: Using Objective Caml to Develop Safety-Critical Embedded Tools in a Certification Framework (some French company)
* 2008: Experience Report: A Pure Shirt Fits Reflections on Haskell at Bluespec

Galois, Inc., and Jane Street Capital are a couple companies that often publicly discuss building non-trivial software using FP basically everywhere (Haskell and OCaml, respectively).  A few friends of mine in the financial sector say that much of the trading backends where they work are build in Haskell, OCaml, or F#.  Going that far has to say something about these companies believing FP is pretty valuable.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; If your prices are lower than your competitors, you're illegally engaging in predatory pricing.

False. Predatory pricing means deliberately selling your stuff *below cost* to undercut &amp; destroy a competing business. It does NOT simply mean selling stuff for less than your competitors. A large corporation wishing to expand in a new market can quite easily tolerate a temporary loss in that market and finance it with profits from other sources. Faced with predatory pricing, a small shop which cannot rely on other sources of income will go out of business, and then it's hello monopoly!

&gt; If your prices are higher than your competitors, you're illegally engaging in price gouging and/or monopoly pricing.

False. Price gouging is what a corporation does right after destroying the small competitors: raise prices to levels well above those that free market would support. Since the competition is destroyed and there are usually barriers to entry for new potential competitors, a monopoly can engage in price gouging for quite a long time.

&gt; If your prices are the same as your competitors, you're illegally engaging in price fixing.

False. Price fixing is when nominal competitors collude not to compete. One famous example being the competing gas stations simultaneously raising prices during holiday season and having a gentlemen's agreement not to undercut each other.

&gt; All prices are illegal if the government wants to prosecute.

* She eats in her office on a regular basis. She wondered why the keys were sticking or no longer working. I found out she spilled an entire Diet Coke on her keyboard and I found what turned out to be a piece of sour kraut from her sandwich in her keyboard, along with all the other nasties you'd expect to see - crumbs, hair, I even found a piece of a paper clip and a small stem from a cherry tomato.
* She runs IE6 on one of the laptops because she says she doesn't like the way the ""new stuff"" works. That and apparently there's an IBM page she uses that doesn't work in anything but IE6 - which I can actually believe.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","There seems to be some confusion of language. This is why I personally prefer Aristotle's own term for it, rather than the name applied after, of ""first philosophy."" What I take this to mean is the philosophy of first principles, or rather the first principles from which the following philosophy is based. An adequate analogy, at least in capacity, are the first principles of mathematics which are axioms or postulates. If your friend is using his terminology correctly, I think he  is correct. A consistent and useful philosophy must begin with assumptions that cannot be proven. Thus, metaphysics, as a field, is necessary to arrive at those first principles. However, like the axioms of mathematics, these first principles are incapable of being proven through empirical means and are, thus, nonsense but that's more a statement of the now obvious that doesn't, in itself, invalidate the field of study. For empiricism to be a consistent means to critique anything, it too must be based in first principles. However, the real confusion lies in taking ""metaphysics"" to mean classical first principles such as the independent existence of ideas, God (in the many ways that is defined), *cogito ergo sum*, monism, turtles all the way down, or whatever you have in mind. But to logically demonstrate that first principles are a necessary and legitimate precondition to philosophy doesn't make those ideas ""real."" If your friend is making an argument contrary to that, he is wrong. 

It's also extremely important to note that first philosophy comes *after* physics (or, maybe a better term, second philosophy). I think this is important because first principles cannot be proven in themselves but, I believe, are derived in the implication of second philosophy. Thus, it is and always has been the task of philosophy to accumulate a more sound second philosophy, this includes the sciences, in order to postulate a more adequate first philosophy. These older concepts are incorrect *in the field of metaphysics* precisely because the philosophy they've predicated have been invalidated. ","1277945327"

I wouldn't HAVE to study abroad in England if that's the case. I'd prefer to go to Germany, anyway. ;D I want to work so I can earn money for my trip over the summer, once the semester is over.

Followed by this backpedal:
&gt;Obviously, I think that there isn't any significant free market in existence now, there wasn't any in the past, and there won't be any in the future.

I am not sure what you consider to be significant.  I believe there is a significant population who do not want any government to supervise, manipulate and skim off of their economic activities.  Many of them are willing to live in areas with no *significant* economy, in exchange for autonomy.

OK, number one: *you are talking about the brain misinterpreting itself.*  That has nothing to do with ""reason.""  If your senses start ""lying"" to you, you have no way of knowing it, *because they are all you've got.*  

Or to put it another way, there is not a human being alive who is so hyper-aware that they would be able to tell at any given moment whether their senses are deceiving them.

And otherwise, if you want to look at it that way, then even the founder of Objectivism was unable to live up to its tenets, as she was unable to discern hallucination from reality.  Which just leads me right back to one of the points I made way up above: if Ayn Rand wasn't even able to do Objectivism right, that's a pretty big condemnation of the philosophy in general.

But, really now.  I wrote a few pages of discussion of the is\ought problem, and this is all you have?  Quibbling over the exact nature of hallucinations?

I believe that to snipe aggressively/quick scope well you need to be very skilled and have extremely quick eyes and reflexes. You also need to know at what ranges and areas you are capable of dispatching people without getting killed first. I agree with what some people have said here in that the people who have shitty &lt;1 kdrs while trying to quick scope are indeed annoying players. I don't see them that frequently on PC and I heard that there are many more wannabe snipers on the consoles (because of a larger pool of players) So that could explain a difference in our experience. I will stand by my word and say that many pc snipers and quick scopers are amongst the most skilled in the game. :D","1277945531"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","As for the verbal trickery of ""counting myself a Christian"".  That's what I call myself since I still love to praise God and still think Jesus' teachings are unparelleled.  It is also what I may continue to be until I die, at the very least until my children are grown.  I'm in the same boat that everyone else in Christianity is in regarding theology, I can't be perfectly honest about my ideas and, yes, that does kind of stink.  But, at the same time, my family and church are doing great.  What I may or may not believe in this lifetime isn't a huge issue.  It isn't all about me...  Humanity isn't perfect.  I'm in no rush to perfect it by screwing up a marriage that I have, by and large, been very happy in for a number of years now.  I'll be fine pretending to believe in heaven, I don't absolutely know for sure that that isn't where I am going so...

As for Jesus hating religion.  You've heard the stories, yeah?  Jesus wants to show the Jews a lesson about mercy so he heals people even though it isn't the Sabbath - a pretty recurrent theme in the gospels.  That's what I was talking about.

I don't know about PR, I don't live in a big city with a church that advertises on TV or anything.  I do belong to a church that really seems to emphasize relationship over hype.  The sense of community is pretty strong.

I could always chunk it all and embrace logic to the maximum.  But you know what?  There is always someone just a little more logical.  Many of you guys don't care for Christians because they are being less logical than you are, but that's just human nature.  I think people are idiots who can't seem to keep their checkbook balanced - where is the logic in that?  

You can pretend that all life is completely logical, but it isn't.  I'm sure list have already been posted in forums describing things that Christians will point out aren't logical but that are part of life.  Then you guys come back and say something ridiculous like ""Love can measured.""  Whatever...

We are going to be debating this stuff forever...  You think your views are perfectly logical I'm sure.  I could point out that we could make families more healthy by eliminating public schools and letting parents decide how they wanted their children to be educated.  It would eliminate an incredible amount of energy being wasted keeping huge school buildings cool, eliminate an incredible amount of pollution from those noxious yellow buses, bring efficiency and innovation to education as the private sector looked to fill the void.  Kids might, overall, not go to school as many hours a day.  Some kids might not get a great education, many would get great ones.  Families would be tighter, there would be less divorce, many kids would end up learning a lot more about how to cook some really great, homemade meals, which I would assume even atheists agree would be a good thing.

I can give you all kind of logical improvements for our country and world.  Ironically, when I suggest that we end public education all I get from most people is blank stares and ""you can't do that"".  Then they started feeding me a bunch of crap they've been brainwashed to believe about public schooling.  However, being perfectly logical atheists, and seeing the way that the private market would be more likely to produce a good product and admitting that if some people couldn't afford to educate their children, that it is just as well, because it's students and parents from those kinds of families that drag our educational system down in the first place.

But I don't see many atheists agreeing with me.  Instead, I expect liberal brainwashing to kick in as you describe education as some right of humanity, or something like that.

Which is it?  Can you see the logic in a completely privatized education system.  You don't have to elaborate so that we get off topic.  It is just a simple logic test.  From any logic I can see, perfect government only does those things that it will do equally for everyone, irregardless of ANY personal characteristic, including age or class.  That means no public schools, no social security, no welfare at all.  Logical?  You should see it that way because this is exactly what destroys democratic government.  As soon as government does for some what it does not do equally for all it plays right in to the hands of party politics.  A favor for these folks for their vote, a favor for these others for theirs until, oh gee, we're running out of money!

Come on guys.  This is logic.  Let humanity sink or swim.  No mercy, no handouts, no government trying to successfully run institutions that require a high degree of accountability, nuance, and innovation, give me a break.  

I want some agreement with my logic...

Oh, and btw, women have absolutely no logical need for a guy to romance them , surprise them with a gift, take them out to dinner when they aren't expecting  it.   Et cetera.  Neither do you need to waste your time trying to build a relationship with anyone.  Can't you function without that fuzzy feeling that you get when you around people that you like?  Don't you know that we are just made up of a bunch of cells?  Isn't the only reason we think we like anyone because we happen to have some complimentary thought processes and some common positive responses to certain type stimuli? 

How logical do you want to get?  Friendship and love are just stupid emotions, who needs them?

Yeah, yeah, I know, I only got 4 hours of sleep last night, maybe less, and I need much more to function.  Minor tangent?

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Actually, as far as a *web framework* goes, it might be a poor idea to begin writing it in Python 3.

WSGI is the protocol on which most existing Python web frameworks have settled to do communication between applications and servers.  The WSGI specification (v 1.0) does not really apply to Python 3 because existing WSGI applications are expected to return ""str"" objects that signify byte arrays; but this data type has actually been removed from the language.  The spec hasn't yet been amended, and there's a good deal of confusion about exactly how it should be amended to support Python 3.  http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/5/25/wsgi-on-python-3 is a good summary of the situation.

Because of this, the most popular WSGI libraries such as Paste, WebOb, Werkzeug, and a raft of others don't actually work under Python 3.  Indeed WSGI itself (at least as defined in any existing specification) doesn't work under Python 3.  Even the stdlib CGI module, which is depended on by higher-level libraries for dealing with, for example, form input submissions, doesn't work 100% in Python 3 yet: file uploads in multipart encoded form posts can't be pulled out properly by the stdlib.

So, sure, if you want to be on the very bleedingest of edges, you can indeed implement a web framework in Python 3.  But if you do, you had best be prepared to write a lot of stuff yourself, or at least make continual changes to forks of existing systems.","1277945584"

But so you wouldn't have a problem with a royalty scheme that recognized a term of, say, 100 years after the date of publication? Give an average writer maybe 50 years during their lifetime, 50 years for the estate, to profit from the work?

And actually, then you fairly compensate the estate in situations where the writer/composer died shortly after publication, allowing the estate to earn the same amount as an average writer. And other estates don't 'over' earn royalties when the writer lived years and years after the publication. It evens everything out. Written pieces have 100 years to earn their creator, and their creator's estate, a profit.

&gt; It was originally crafted over 200 years ago, times have changed and just as not every article within it should be considered sacrosanct, some rights not guaranteed within it should.

Our constitution does not spell out the rights our government grants us; it grants the federal government certain powers and reserves all else for the states and the people. To my knowledge it is the only national constitution which does so. This is not some subtle point of law; this is a fundamental difference in the way statehood is viewed by the populace.

This is not to say that the implementation of the idea in our constitution is perfect, or that every citizen understands this difference; far from it. The founding fathers knew that government was a ""necessary evil"", a fearsome master if left unchecked. For the most part I'm a social liberal and a fiscal libertarian (though I believe in socialist ideas like a national defence and public schooling), but on things like gun ownership I ask the simple question ""does government deserve a monopoly on the use of force?"". I think the sad answer is that our government is far too corrupt and incompetent to be trusted with such a monopoly. On other issues (see the general over-broad interpretation of the commerce clause for the root of a lot of the bad law on our books) the government is clearly overstepping it's bounds, and I do my best to voice my opinion to both my fellow citizens and my elected leadership.

I think the difference in perspective is that most citizens of this country still feel like we built our government the best we knew how, rather than being subjects of it.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","At the time the Wind Waker E3 demo was first shown, the Gamecube had been getting flak for being the ""kiddie"" system for *years*.  The XBox and PS2 were getting all the popular cross-platform franchises, and the Gamecube was often skipped because of the low market share and perception that it was mostly for kids.  Nintendo fans were tired of getting the short end of the stick and wanted Nintendo to release more ""mature"" games to attract an older audience and get more cross-platform games.

Also, when the Gamecube was revealed at Spaceworld 2000 there was a [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBtAvX4Pkyk) showing a mocked-up Zelda game.  Fans were *rabid* for this game.

Then ""Celda"" gets shown at E3.  The bait-and-switch from the gritty, realistic demo to the happy, cartoony Wind Waker was too much for some people.

I think Nintendo is doing a MUCH better job at managing expectations this generation, and I believe a large part of that is hiring Reggie as Marketing VP (and later COO).  So much of Nintendo's failure in the N64 and Gamecube era came from not understanding the market outside of Japan.","1277945695"

That's not all I'm saying. What I'm really saying is that ideally, I wouldn't like there to be any taxes. I would like everything to based on voluntary action. This isn't as far fetched as it sounds because there are still many important services that people want or need and are willing to pay for but, that's a different conversation.

I would like the people to be able to manage some of their money they give to government. What I'm really asking for is that I don't want the government to force others to subsidize me, and likewise I don't want the government to force me to subsidize others. If other people want to give me money that's fine, or if I'm feeling charitable and want to give to other people then that's fine too.

&gt;They do. Teachers travel to the school on public roads. The water and food served for lunch in the cafeteria is inspected by public inspectors. Etc.

I meant directly for budget, tuition or books, in the same ways that tax payers pay for public schools, but they don't. But you bring up a good point. However, the private schools don’t choose how their teachers should get to work, nor can they choose which water and food inspection agency will test their cafeterias because the FDA has a monopoly on food regulation. Nor can the school opt out of some of these things with out violations of the law and thus perhaps closure (not that having unregulated food or drink wouldn't quickly ruin a private school to begin with). While I’ll agree that private schools do benefit from these things, these benefits are forced upon them. 

In a more voluntary society the private school would be directly responsible for these things and the public wouldn't be indirectly subsidizing them unless they wanted to.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm still processing it, to be honest, and it's at least in part due to how I see the Toy Story movies, as a metaphor for common parenting issues in general, and fatherhood specifically.

This may seem strange, but think to yourself, honestly, about the relationship the toys have with Andy, and how that mirrors anything we see in real life. The toys obviously love Andy, but the way they talk about him, it's specifically the kind of love a parent has for a child. They talk about how they need to ""be there"" for Andy, and how Andy needs them... they treat him with the same kind of protective care as a parent. At least, that's how I see it. As an aside, notice how Andy's father is never so much as mentioned.

The first Toy Story was, in my opinion, about being a divorced parent, feeling the need to compete for your kid's love. Woody (dad) always had a great relationship with Andy (son), even though he and Andy's mom have little to do with each other. Andy is the world to Woody, and being such an important part in Andy's life is a pure joy to him.

Suddenly, mom brings Buzz (another guy) into Andy's life, and now Andy seems far more interested in the new guy. Woody is jealous of Buzz for all this attention Buzz is getting, and making things worse, Buzz doesn't even really care about Andy - he's far more involved in his own hobby (the Space Ranger thing), and yet Andy doesn't really care about this. Quite the contrary - Andy digs Buzz's hobby too, and now the stuff Woody and Andy used to do together are swiftly forgotten, as is Woody.

Woody, despairing at losing his role in Andy's life, quickly becomes furious with Buzz, an anger that Buzz doesn't understand and doesn't even notice at first - he's not trying to shoulder in on Woody's turf or anything, and he's treated Woody politely, so why should there be a problem between them? It finally gets to the point where Woody's jealousy sets off a series of events that lead to the two coming to blows, which causes *both* of them to be distanced from Andy.

Andy at this point still cares deeply about both Woody and Buzz, but with the two of them fighting he can't keep spending time with them. Meanwhile, Woody and Buzz get a little perspective in the form of Sid, a child who is only using his toys (parents) to get his kicks - he doesn't actually love them back like Andy does. Sid is the worst kind of sociopath, and having to spend time with him serves as a wake-up call to both Woody and Buzz. Woody realizes that playing a role in Andy's life, even if it's a secondary role, is still the best thing for both him and Andy. Buzz realizes that his hobby is kinda' pointless, and that the time he spends with Andy is far more important and meaningful. Thus, Buzz and Woody settle their differences and return to Andy, both now wanting to play a part in Andy's life, whatever that part may be.

In Toy Story 2, the story is about the prospect of getting old, and the certain knowledge that things as they are now are finite. Woody gets a sharp reminder that he's not as young as he used to when he injures himself while playing with his kid. This brings him to worry that Andy will lose interest in him, as he'll be unable to do the same things they used to do together. Through a stroke of luck, he suddenly finds that he may have another calling in life - fame (a career).

Woody realizes that while his days with Andy will someday increasingly soon be coming to a close, this career (of sorts) opens a new world to him. There are amazing opportunities for him, and while it would require him to abandon his role as a parent, those days are getting fewer in number, and Andy won't be needing him much longer anyway, especially with Buzz still around to keep Andy company.

Buzz reminds Woody that Woody himself said that Andy was the most important thing to him, and ends up getting Woody to realize that while the days remaining grow fewer, there are still days remaining, and as promising as this career may be, it is still meaningless next to his role as a parent. This also has the effect of renewing Jessie's passion for parenting, despite how hurt Jessie was after her girl stopped speaking to her. Jessie knows she still has a lot of love to give, and the opportunity to once again play that role in a child's life is still something she desires. Pete, meanwhile, never was a parent, and couldn't contemplate Woody abandoning a career for a kid.

Toy Story 3 now has Woody and Buzz facing obsolescence, and possibly death, but I'm still considering all of the implications. It's largely a surprisingly melancholy film compared to its predecessors, with the toys resigned to one form or another of their end of days. However, I still have a bit of thinking to do before I settle on my own preferred interpretation of the film.

I know not everyone will agree with this, and I don't doubt that Pixar's folks would probably dissuade anyone from looking this deeply into the plot of the film, but I personally enjoy seeing a deeper meaning in these wonderful films, even if it wasn't necessarily intended.","1277945726"

Since the money is going to all candidates equally, the donaters might give all candidates the benefit of the doubt and actually pay attention to what they are saying, since they are paying for it, instead of ignoring them or brushing them off since they are from another party.

Are pro-marijauana legalization people touting this fact to help promote their agenda?  Of course they are.  But that doesn't mean there isn't real science to be done in this area.  There are many scientists examining the endocannabinoid system as a target for anti-cancer drugs.

Why I mentioned Howard's history in the Liberal Party is to show that he was the opposite of a person who brings disparate parties together, a unifier. Instead he was a purger, an enforcer, a tough liner. You appear to think this approach would have worked in the role. I don't. The ICC does not have real political power and the member countries can thumb their nose at it as we have just seen.

Bob Hawke, to speak of another prime-ministerial cricket fan, certainly had this ability. He had a reputation for keeping people in a meeting until consensus was reached.

Howard was ill-advised to make the comments about Muttiah Muralitharan while he was PM. A Prime Minister should not make such partisan comments. I think this particular bit of his history is what harmed him the most in his bid attempt and it is only fitting that it came back to bite him on the bum.

People said the SCRA would cover him, end of story.  Then it came out that he was already at least 6 months past due on the HOA when he deployed.  When he returned a year later it was still another 2-3 months before the sale took place, and the HOA had sent certified letters in that timeframe (iirc).  

The argument even went into how the original filing went in on the foreclosure that he was listed as ""no"" for active military when it should have been listed as ""unknown"" since no one seemed to have a clear answer from either of the owners.

So at the time, I feel that the people discussing this topic were basically left with the understanding that this would all come down to minor legalities and that they will either get a settlement for the value of the home, or most likely get the home back without the use of the SCRA.

I believe too that the opposition the banning religious attire, even clothing as absurd and offensive as the Burqa has less to do with ""political correctness"" and more to do with legitimate fears of what this means in terms of the principle of separation of church and state, as well as a concern that such as acts will do more to isolate women living under such oppression, than it would to liberate them in any way.

{Didn't see the comment he had put up fixing the ""texting"" to ""sexting"" Sorry! :) It was down below. }

I agree with this law.  It lessens the severity of what they are doing from child pornography distribution/possession to a misdemeanor or felony charge.

Although I agree that theft is linked with poverty, more often than not people are stealing to support pleasurable things like drugs, alcohol or possessions, rather than to pay for food (which is extremely cheap, particularly in the US). Furthermore, given the skills and tools required to steal locked bikes and then sell them on safely, it is even less likely that bike thieves do so out of necessity than those who commit other, easier, types of petty theft. 


Finding a citation for why people in Western society steal is actually surprisingly difficult, but as both sides of this argument are making a claim as to motivation, this is a flaw in both our arguments


Edit- Found some indirectish proof of this the article ""Why Do Employees Steal? Assessing Differences in Ethical and Unethical Employee Behavior Using Ethical Work Climates"" by James Weber showed that 95% of businesses experience employee theft, and employee theft accounted for 44% of retail losses in the US"". From the fact that even people with secure jobs are stealing, and in very large numbers, we can see that theft is very, very, often not the result of pure necessity.","1277945947"

* St. Louis is like australia for chicagoans. Just remember that if you get lost while in STL and have to choose between going north or south, choose south. Always err to the south.

* If you're using public transit and you get lost, wait for a bus and ask the driver if he's heading toward the train. 50% of the time he will be. If you can get to the train, you'll be able to find just about anything. 

* If you're not using public transportation and you want to go to forest park on a gorgeous holiday weekend, change your mind and use the train. People from west county go there on the weekends, and all of them drive massive SUVs. You will not find parking and will spend the entire day watching Finding Nemo through the back window of an expedition. 

* Find Cherokee street and have lunch. If you see antique stores, you're on the wrong end. Head west until you hear Tejano music. Get some tacos at La Vallesana and poke around the hipster doodad stores. You'll see a little store that seems to sell only cotton balls and white t-shirts. Things are not what they seem.

* On Saturday morning go to Tower Grove park and follow the trail of granola moms to the Farmers Market. There will be music and fresh crepes and amish men selling beets. There will be children laughing as they splash about in a fountain on a beautiful, warm Saturday morning. Pretty girls will walk by lugging yoga mats while a man who looks like Allen Ginsberg considers his carrots. You will sit on stone steps in the dappled shade while life careens and darts around you. There will be goat cheese.

* Find Fred's Six Feet Under. Bring ears and a personality.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Is there any scientific research or evidence that shows man did evolve from one completely distinct animal into a human?

Why ask a science question in /r/atheism rather than say /r/evolution?

If you were really serious about actually finding out something you might not know, surely you would ask in an appropriate group? Being an atheist does not require accepting evolution, let alone being able to explain it. 

Anyway, since you are here, if you are serious about understanding why scientists think that all life shares one origin rather than many, I'd suggest starting with talkorigins.org (e.g. [starting here](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html, or for the tl;dr version you could skip to the [conclusion](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/default.html#alternate_explanations)),  the index to all that information on common descent is [here](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/default.html) ) and then once you've read what's at that site (i.e. preferably all of it, but certainly more than just the common descent material - for example, take a read of http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/index.html). Then I'd suggest actually reading some modern biology.

Just to give you *one* example, at random times retroviruses get their genetic material copied into the DNA of living things, and if that DNA happens to reside in a sex cell, it may be passed on to descendants (sometimes causing problems, but usually just sitting there doing nothing). We all have large numbers of these relics. The remains of these *[endogenous retroviruses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus)* (and other intruders in our genes, such as [LINE](http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/06/increasing_piles_of_genetic_ju.php)s) show relationships between species - recently diverging species share many of these relics of ancient infections, while less closely related species share fewer. What does this show? Well, for example, it shows that *either* we recently shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees, or it has been deceptively arranged to *look exactly like that*. (This is also in [part 4](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html#retroviruses) of the link I pointed to part 1 of above.) Also, look at the video [here](http://scienceblogs.com/erv/2010/06/facts_of_evolution_retroviruse.php) 

For some free chapters of various books on evolution (some aimed at a younger audience), see [this post](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2010/06/evolution-book.html). 

To address what appears to be your underlying question - does what we observe utterly exclude a sufficiently capricious and deceptive deity just making it *look* like we have a common origin with all life on earth, and in particular, that we are apes?

Well the answer to that is (obviously) no, any more than one could refute, say a YEC claim that a similarly capricious and deceptive deity could have created a universe that merely looks billions of years old, by making the light that appears to come from stars that far away start off much closer to us a few thousand years ago (as well as faking the dozens of other observations that show the same ancient origins of the universe) - nor indeed can we completely refute that a similar deity didn't create the universe ""as is"" [just last Tuesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis). Nor can we completely refute that the entire universe is just one gigantic simulation made to appear exactly like it's real in every way. Nor can we prove beyond all possible doubt that we aren't just a really freaky and complicated dream you've been having. (Nor can we prove that the universe wasn't sneezed out three seconds ago by the great god Arkleseizure - but that's not a good reason to be an Arkleseizurist). The inability to exclude scenarios deliberately designed to be irrefutable does not make them believable. 

So yes, either some sneaky being-behind-the-curtain is absolutely **determined** to make everything *look exactly like* we share a recent common ancestor with modern apes and ultimately a common ancestry with all life, or those things actually happened. 

You need to ask yourself ""does it really make sense to posit bizarre scenarios rather than seriously consider the simpler alternative possibility that in fact that scientists have a reasonably simple explanation for the myriad things that they observe that doesn't fit with a separate human creation?""

Rather than try to make reality conform to your prejudices (I mean this in the literal sense of the word - judging before seeing the facts), why not allow your judgements to fit with reality?

Perthaps you should consider (to yourself) *why* you resist accepting the foundation for all modern biology. What is it you have to give up in order to accept it?

You had to be fit, healthy, non-smoker, VERY light drinker, non-drug user, light on the caffeine kind of person. So many of these folks were discliplined sort of thinkers. Cerebral, devout and atheist, people read a lot, the gamers were mathematical, like they were smart enough to know the move you would make in Risk or Spades. The movie watchers were all critics. We spent a lot of time arguing politics. Think about strangers in a cafeteria, lining up to have their blood drawn over and over for days. You build a temporary camaraderie, you discuss world affairs without fear of persecution for wild ideas. We watch the news together and yell at politicians. One guy would gather people in his room at night and sell you DVDs, and do some sort of ""lecture"" about the Illuminati. Then he would have a zine about the New World Order that he would try to sell you. Another guy would be on the phone the whole time, trying to line up the next big study. He'd have his calendar out, he'd be all business. I saw a couple fights, mostly over a game of Madden. One dude had a macbook, a little USB keyboard and a guitar, massive headphones, he was writing an album from his bedroom. I saw a man and a woman in a coed one, complete strangers, sneak away three times a day to get it on. One man cried so hard watching Amistad, his makeup started to run. Another called him a fag, a whole other guy schooled the homophobe that Gays have rights like Black folks. They were all Black. People get a little vulnerable and exposed in there, shit gets weird.

I thought about long term stuff. Besides my spicy aversion now, I'm not feeling anything too crazy. In my time, I've probably put myself at risk in other ways though, recreationally. That worries me long term more than the studies.

Different places were better than others. Sometimes the nurses and doctors were highly professional, they were thoughtful, compromising, tolerant of our stress and demands. Other times, you felt you cattle being herded, a piece of meat. Each place had a reputation on ""the circuit.""

&gt; Well, how can you learn if you don't read? ... How about ordering the CD-ROM with the first phase of the BQA course on it and going through it?

I appreciate that you have done this, but it makes little sense for me personally to devote so many hours.  I'm neither a farmer nor a journalist, so this information has little direct value to me.  I must trust you to be the expert on this subject.

Judging by most of your answers, it sounds like you have sound, ethical, and humane practices.  Sounds like you should and do take great pride in your work.

&gt; Producers have embraced BQA because it is the right thing to do

The BQA is an industry-based program.  The primary purpose of industry groups is to prevent legislation, and self-regulation is certainly part of this cause.  There is a clear business rationale for avoiding any catastrophe which might compel legislators to enact restrictions.

It seems like your personal motivation for participation is because you feel it's the right thing to do.  But I guarantee you there are others out there who do it primarily to cover their ass.

&gt; If I sell a product that is substandard... the public at large will reduce the amount of meat consumed... and therefore go out of business.

Yes.  This falls under the scope of self-regulation.

There are still a few major problems with self-regulation.  If *everyone* sells a product that is substandard, people will not stop eating beef.  As long as McDonald's sells cheap burgers, people will buy.  (Think of how many people buy cigarettes!)  The BQA could never go out of its way to institute reforms that would be unpopular with farmers--because it's run by the farmers themselves.

The other major problem with self-regulation is conflicts of interest.  Let's suppose for the moment that the allegations are correct: that antibiotic use is fostering superbacteria.  (Disclaimer: I'm not convinced they are!)  The superbacteria problem is unrelated to beef profits.  The true cost of antibiotic use is borne by those who contract superbacteria, not the farmers who purchase the antibiotics.  There's no financial incentive for farmers to self-regulate and curb antibiotic use.  

There are certainly many farmers out there like you, who have a higher ethical sense, who will use antibiotics only when absolutely necessary.  I'm guessing that most farmers you know are like this as well.

But I'm also guessing that there are others, probably in different areas of the country, who don't have your moral sense.  There are the bad actors [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhlhSQ5z4V4), who give a bad name to your good profession.  

If this legislation goes through, it will suck for people like you, because your veterinary costs would skyrocket.  I understand why you would be vocally upset about this.

Does anything I say sound sensible to you?  I hate to speak in these generalities, but I have no farming experience.","1277946079"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","Yup, this is exactly correct, it's also why I think Ebert is such a tool... if he can't understand that he's maligning a medium, there's no point in even having the discussion with him. What he says is the equivalent of saying ""Canvas and paints are bad and can never be art, I know this because I have seen some awful paintings hanging in my dentist's office, and they are not art.""

Edit: In fact, I would argue that part of misunderstanding the artistic value in games is in not yet fully understanding how to interpret the medium yet. The things that make a good film art ARE NOT the same elements that make a good painting art, or a book, or a bit of performance art. Each medium must be judged on it's own merits. Nobody maligns the Mona Lisa because it doesn't have much of a plot, for example. So why exactly are we judging games on the merits of film? And for that matter, why are we listening to a film expert when it comes to video games at all? ","1277946079"

I meant in a sort of ""where blue crosses over to red in the white light visual spectrum"" sort of sense, which is how I attempted to qualify that statement int he next sentence. The first sentence was the attention getter: Girl Talk is the end of music. The second sentence was the clarifier: it sits in the grey area between what can be called music as an artform and what is without value. 

With that out of the way, I like pulp. I really do. At my wedding, our two favorite songs were Digital Underground's Humpty Dance and Erasure's A Little Respect. These songs are without artistic merit, and I say that without an ounce of derision. They're just great fun. The sort of shit you'd want to listen to, I dunno, drunk and on the dance floor of a wedding. 

But no one is making the claim that Erasure or Humpty are the next big thing; that what they were doing is anything other than silly pop fun. If people were, I would feel the need to come out and tell people just how wrong they were, just as I am here. Granted, ""fuck girl talk"" is a bit over the top and more an attempt at a wry smile than anything, but my point is the same: people need to relax about Girl Talk.

The mean correlation of IQ scores between monozygotic twins was 0.86, between siblings, 0.47, between half-siblings, 0.31, and between cousins, 0.15. From such data the heritability of IQ was estimated at anywhere between 0.40 and 0.80 in the United States. The reason for this wide margin appeared to be that the heritability of IQ rises through childhood and adolescence, peaking at 0.68 and 0.78 in adults, leaving the overwhelming majority of IQ differences between individuals to be explained genetically.[15]

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Most gaming headsets out there are overpriced.  My recommendation is to buy an good set of headphones and a good clip-on mic separately, you'll probably get better value for your money.

For clip-on mics, last time I checked, Zalman was considered to be la creme de la creme.  Here's [a post I made awhile back on where to buy it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/c1ud5/what_kind_of_mic_should_i_get/c0popft)  (Also, check the rest of that submission's comments if you want to see more Zalman endorsements.)

For the headphones, I recommend Sennheiser.  The HD 201's are fairly inexpensive (I got mine for under $30) and far better in terms of quality than you'd get from your typical $50 headset. I find my HD 201's incredibly comfortable, as they fit around my ears nicely.  (The headset I was using previously didn't fit around my ears and it pressed on the sides of my ears, making it physically painful to wear it for hours at a time.)

The Zalman clip on + HD 201 combo should fit into your price range (the mic shouldn't cost more than $15 and the headphones will probably be less than $35, meaning your price total will fit under $50).  I use that setup and it's served me very well.","1277946139"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Quite a lot of bullshit answers you got here. You can find cheap espresso machines, but they're usually not very good. The better ones usually have more capacity for steaming and pulling shots, and almost always give more consistent shots.

As to why they're expensive, I can think of several reasons. First of all, the most important thing in an espresso machine is to keep the water within the right temperature range and stable. Secondly, the pressure at the extraction should also be consistent and within certain limits. This means the boiler has to be powerful and well regulated. Just the temperature regulator (pressurestat) can cost $90, and a good pump quickly adds $100 or more. The brew group can also be [quite complex](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-512109360793995066), and can cost more than $600.

Once you add in a quality boiler (or boilers), boiler element, quality piping, valves, electronics, and the casing itself, it quickly adds up. Not to mention that pretty much all espresso machines (at least decent ones) are hand made. It's not difficult to see why they are expensive.

A very good entry machine is the Rancilio Silvia, which can be had for about $650. The grinder is probably more important, though, and usually run at least $200. On the other hand, a good machine and grinder may very well last you 20 years. (Most/all of the parts for the more expensive machines are standard parts. You can also get parts for the grinders, allowing you to keep them going for a long long time.)

You could always get a moka pot. They're cheap, but they don't really make espresso. If you want to make cappuccino, latte, etc, you'd need a steamer/frother as well, which goes for about $100.

Hope that answered your question.","1277946174"

"hardware","t5_2qh18","I did this, but you don't need anything special hardware-wise, oh unless you plan on running a desktop OS on it (I do not recommend this!).

My first iteration was a 400mhz Apple G4 Powermac, got the power pc version of Ubuntu server running on it quite easily and just used a couple of large hard drives on a samba share. This worked well for a while, windows media center can see it easily, and the G4 served up video simultaneously to 3 or 4 computers with no hassle. Eventually the G4 died though.

My second and current iteration is slightly different. I went for the cheapest system I could get up, with a desktop free server edition of linux you will not need powerful hardware. Right now I have a 1.8ghz celeron duo on some POS motherboard with 6 sata ports (you can always add a sata card if you run out, but seriously I doubt you would), 1 gig of ram, and 3 x 1TB drives in software raid5 (total of 2TB which I can grow by 1TB increments). It takes very little work to get a software raid up using mdadm, samba is also quite easy to set up and there are multiple straight forward guides around to help you along. The key is to keep your OS and your raid seperate, you want to be able to remount that bundle of hard drives on any old hardware and rebuild it using mdadm. This way your drives are not coupled to any particular hardware. 

The overhead of software raid is a reality, but not one which should present a problem. There is no reason why your desktop free server system will run anything but the most essential background processes. Yes cheap hardware will die but thats the beauty of this setup, I spent very little money getting this baby up and running and I think its a versatile setup.

So my recipe is:
 
* Cheap system (cheapest system!) 
* Ubuntu server edition 
* Software raid (mdadm) 
* Separate storage drives from OS
* Samba server  ","1277946178"

If you spend too much time focused on pleasing one another, and not enough of developing your own independent lives, you'll find that you start to reflect an incredible amount of negative energy towards one another. You stick with it out of the memory of how things use to be, but as current reality and fond past memories diverge, you're left with the incredibly painful choice of leaving one another in hopes that you both can move on, or sticking together in a spiral where no one else wants to hang around the two of you any more, and you're stuck with one another as your only companionship for what will feel like a very long rest of your life.

This is so fucking true it's scary.

Boyfriend and I almost broke up because of it... Our lives were too entwined. I know that I was too needy/dependent. I'm a shy person, and I moved interstate to be with him.. I clung to him like a life preserver when I should have been more independent.

He broke up with me but then a few days later came back.. He wanted some space and to see if things could be worked out. We moved into separate places, had some space...

THANKFULLY a few months later we've both learned a lot about being more independent and we're in a much happier place. Our relationship is stable again and we'll be moving in together at the end of the year again. Fingers crossed everything goes well and we can maintain our independence.

I think it is psychological - in previous world cups, they seemed more interested in fouling and playing dirty, and in the current one they just fell apart after (admittedly) a horrifying referee decision (yes, shock and surprise, refs dictate the result, eh?).

I think they need more of a psychologist to calm them down and focus on actual PLAY and less on cheap fouls and temper tantrums.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","It's true Austin is great, but some people idealize it too much.  In that I do not include the people who are simply enthusiastic because they enjoy it.  It is what it is, and what you make of it, etc.

Some people here think that they are different by conforming to what they think it means to be here.  It's annoying.  I'm sure NYC natives notice the same thing with people who move there and then try to be New Yorkers.  It's just a place.  A fun place, but just being somewhere doesn't change anything about who a person is as an individual.  Experience does that.

A lot of people here are actually not as friendly as you'd think.  People say stupid things about the rest of the state either because they've never actually been there or the boredom of growing up in the middle of nowhere drove them to complaining out of habit, but, being from West Texas, on average the friendliest and most helpful total strangers in this state are not in the cities.  There isn't that much difference, though.  It's not usually the people who are all that different, but the nature of being in a city.  Spread throughout the entire state are the fine Texans who believe in upholding this state's tradition of being friendly and treating people right.  Since you are moving here, uphold the tradition because it is sorely needed to counteract the effects of the people who move here without actually trying to understand the state and its history and the real nature of where they are.  Austin isn't actually so insulated and different from the rest of the state.  That perceived difference is not really very deep at all.  How they conceive of Austin as being invincibly better than the rest of the state (and isolated from it) when *the state government itself* is here, is beyond me.  Their *idea* of Austin is what is isolated, different, and better.

This is just a different perspective for you.  May as well be realistic.  You will likely enjoy it here very much, though.  I could go on and on about the good stuff, but everyone else here has that pretty much covered.","1277946304"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Time to get nutty then!

No really, I think the more important thing is whether or not he is still thinking of her while he's with you, and less about the actual photographs, which are just things.  

Personally, I still have photos of my exes, but they are packed away in boxes, not something I look at, their just things, memories.  Hell, even my parents who have been divorced for 35 years, and really don't like each other have photos of each other, but again, packed away in some album or box and rarely seen.

Nowadays, those boxes and albums are digital hard drives, our phones, whatever.  Times have changed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I will make another analogy for you. 

You've never been to an amusement park before, and you fall in love with their kiddie roller coaster, fun for a second, but you realize soon that the thrill is gone. It doesn't take not knowing there are better roller coasters out there to get bored, you can only ride the same crappy roller coaster so many times.

When men start having sex, they are akin to children's roller coasters, with enough experience they become the superman ride from six-flags (or whatever). 

So all I am saying, is that without *any* premarital sex, the marital sex is bound to suck. I don't know of a single girl who is willing to suffer indefinitely through bogus sex with better sex prospected in the distant future through plenty of sweat and tears. Girls don't have that kind of patience. The only way that would work out is if the relationship is not based on sex whatsoever, and in that case you might as well be going out with your mom. 

&gt;If it is possible to get better at sex outside of wedlock why is it not equally possible to get better at sex inside of wedlock?

The process of learning to have better sex is not conducive to sexual relationships. It is possible, in fact you **must** get better or the relationship will be shaky. Also think of the demand to perform, there is more pressure because your relationship depends on it. 

But hey, maybe you are right, if all you know is crap sex then maybe you will be satisfied with that. Have you ever desired something you can't have?

&gt;However, I think it's disingenuous to equate that lack of premarital sex will doom someone to a bad sex life after the ""I Do""s have been said.

While you may *think* it is disingenuous, I assure you it is not so far-fetched. It isn't that lack of premarital sex will doom postmarital sex, it's that lack of sex will doom your ability to have good sex in general.

It's like driving a car. Kids **are not** good at driving cars, you need experience if you want to be a racecar driver. Even young adults who may be able to compete have been racing since they were little.","1277946370"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""Drawn To Life"" is filled with great advice about getting past the technical to the communicative heart of the matter. It's sort of hard to describe... As an actor you know the importance of an idea behind the performance. Animation is similar with a few important differences. Ed Hooks' (""Acting For Animators"") says that animators have to do exactly what actors are told not to do: demonstrate the thought or emotion. Anyway; Stanchfield knows what holds artists back and coaxes them over the threshold to create lively characters that have feelings and are doing things in a way that conveys their ""aliveness"" to the viewer in  a direct and visceral way.

Whether you're modeling, lighting. rigging, or animating it's all about story-telling!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The folks at McDonalds corporate are not dumb, and this pricing strategy is a means of profit maximization known as [price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination). By economic theory, if you can only charge one price on a given good, your outcome will be less optimal than if you could charge one price on a good for the majority of the market and then a lower price on the good for people who wouldn't buy it at the higher price, provided that the lower price is still above the marginal (per additional unit produced) cost of the good. 

The marginal cost is low compared to $1, so that's covered. The idea for the rest of it is that you publicize the $1.39 cheeseburger well (e.g., include it as a top menu item or as a part of a combo with a big pretty picture), and the majority of people will buy it. The idea of having a less well-publicized (i.e., harder to get to) $1 McDouble is in the hope that the majority of people who end up buying the McDouble would not have bought the cheeseburger at $1.39.

Exactly what this proportion needs to be is very greasy math and econometrics, but it suffices to say that even if you lose a fair number of people who are willing to pay $1.39 for a cheeseburger, you will still be better off than if you didn't offer the McDouble for $1 entirely.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Just in case dude doesn't post my reply, here it is (part of why I'm posting it here is to start a discussion about it by the by):

(Disclaimer: I am not a pirate, this is just my opinion on the issue.)

I basically disagree with most of what you've said, and all of your examples as well.

You really cannot compare file-sharing to real-world theft, it just does not work. Stealing is a crime not because we want to stop people from having things they don't deserve, but because it deprives the owner of something. In your screwdriver story, your friend wants to take your screwdriver, and this will deprive you of the use of it. You've lost something.

What you are arguing is the loss of **potential** income, income which does not and may not exist. This is a fallacious argument, and is the same argument used by the RIAA et al, which is constantly being discredited by actual experts.

Now, Eleanor is actually a good example in your favor: she can probably afford $4, and she absolutely needs a particular piece of music. Her pirating it means there is a high chance of a lost sale. However, for someone who doesn't desperately &lt;b&gt;need&lt;/b&gt; a particular piece, you have lost nothing. They could find another, free work to use, they could buy a work they like better, etc; there is no way to consider that a loss, only a potential loss, which is basically meaningless.

Here is where your point of view begins to break down:

""I did spend a lot of time at libraries..."" - JRB

If we are honest and stay true to your logic, you have deprived many people of money by reading their work for free. Every book you read at the library was a lost sale. If Eleanor found your piece at the library and used it for her current need, you would also have lost a sale. The only difference between pirating something and using a library is the status of ownership of the material - both acts deprive you equally of potential income.

You may try to rationalize this point away, for example by using the legal status of these activities, but these too are false premises. The mere existence of a law does not make an activity moral or just, or vice versa.

Now, if someone genuinely wants to own your work and not borrow it, that person is more likely to actually buy it, as a physical copy still has a certain quality to it that cannot be replicated digitally. A book for example, I can hold in my hands, I can smell the paper, and I gain an experience I cannot have digitally - and a printout still does not convey that same experience, as it is a mere duplicate. Even a digital copy, if legitimate, carries that feeling of being a part of something that true ownership grants. However, a person that has no real need for ownership of your work has no incentive to buy it.

This brings us to another issue, and the real truth behind these arguments: the control of information versus entitlement. Many people will resort to piracy because they cannot or would not buy a product. In these instances, you are losing absolutely nothing, while said persons gain access to the information contained in your work.

I say that as no harm is coming to you or anyone else, that these actions are moral. One could argue that these people do not **need** your work, and could live without them, but there is no honest logic in this. These people will grow and learn, and there is no reason to deny them that due to poverty or lack of interest, besides wishing to assert control over them.

So I ask you this: do you wish above all else to control your work, or are you open to the enrichment of society at the expense of non-existent money?","1277946391"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/atheism)

Atheism can be a lack of belief in Gods or it can be a belief in no Gods depending on weak vs. strong atheism.

&gt;I'm thinking it's more to do with the person than the belief (you look down own people for either not believing in Jesus or for believing in Jesus), but it seems to have become a kind of boys' club where you announce your membership with snobby pride.

You know how somebody is an atheist? They tell you.  You know what happens when they don't tell you?  You don't know.  That doesn't mean everybody out there is telling everyone that they're an atheist or that all atheists are arrogant.  They loudest ones are the ones that get noticed.

&gt;Atheism is a faith-based belief

Then what do you call someone without faith?

&gt;FYI I am best classified as a non-denominational Christian, but have fundamental differences in belief with modern Christianity.

For christians, I always like to point out one thing.  Your god is not originally from a monotheistic religion.  ""Yahweh"" as is his name in the original language of the bible is borrowed from an older Canaanite religion which included a number of Gods, include someone who was the father of Yahweh, a wife, a number of brothers etc.

Also, you'll find that corroboration of Jesus' existence is extremely poor, there are no contemporary accounts (outside of small portions of the bible) of Jesus' existence.  Most of them are well after the fact.","1277946424"

I find this out (having never met the girl) and end up stalking her to find out what her class schedule is.  I was able to find out her entire timetable through my research, so I went and stood outside one of her classrooms for her to come out.

So the Germans listed Americans killed then? British? French?

&gt;Not as different as you'd like to think: ever heard of the ""Aryan Nation""?

Most proud Americans are disgusted by White Supremacists, myself included. 

&gt;But I suppose that when George Bush used the deaths of Americans on 9/11 to justify two imperialist wars, that's A-OK, right? Now pass me another swig of that Fox News Cool-aid, boy.

I don't watch Fox News, unless it is to make fun of Glenn Beck's idiocy. I think you need to look at the definition of Imperialism. We are losing our financial asses on these countries, not raping them of natural resources. Again, bitch about George Bush and the government all you want, they fucked up, but that is not the militarys' fault, it is the voters for electing a dumbass as President. 

&gt;Boy, you sound like a Nazi apologist. That's the same line of reasoning Hitler's soldiers gave at Nuremburg: ""We were just following orders"".

Our soldiers are not being ordered to slaughter two million civilians.  I am sick of everybody comparing Iraq in Afghanistan to what happened in Nazi Germany. Ask someone who was in Auschwitz if that is a valid analogy. Your assertion that American soldiers are commiting war crimes akin to the Nazis makes me want to break your fucking face. 

&gt;You sound like Uncle Sam's bitch.

If being proud of being an American makes me Uncle Sam's bitch, so be it. I think our government is screwed up, mainly because the average American is an idiot, do to poor education we now have. However, there is no better military on planet earth, not just the equipment either. American soldiers have great moral, are brave fighters, and are not afraid to go toe to toe with any other fighting force on earth. ","1277946443"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","How does one dominate a ""gaming culture"" ?  I bet you think that men dominated ""smoking Culture"" before the benevolent tobacco companies came to women's rescue and got them in on it too.  Remember that, when only men smoked?  Women wanted nothing to do with gaming, er I mean smoking, then an advertising campaign was begun to get women buying their product.  The psychology was simple, claim that the reason women don't game, i mean smoke, is because men won't let them do it.

 look up 'The Century Of The Self ' on youtube.

And least you forget, women used to look down at geeks/nerds before, and they thought video games were stupid and immature.  Just like they thought smoking was a stupid male habit.  Now that Geekdom is mainstream and popular, they want to be on the bandwagon that they rejected before. In fact, they want to be catered to by the gaming world.   So they claim to be discriminated against so that everyone will bend over backward, and give them goodies.  And the game companies are definitely wanting to get higher sales, so they will advertise to women's ""discrimination "" vanity to get them to shop.  Just like Nike did to sell shoes to women.","1277946502"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The Riemann sphere intuition for the mapping theorem as you describe it is a little dishonest. There are a couple of problems here. First, the theorem states that all simply connected open regions of the plane that are not the plane itself are conformally equivalent, so for example the upper half-plane is - on the Riemann sphere this is half the sphere, so there is no neighborhood of the point at infinity to cut from (although the requirement that the region not be all of C does give us *some* neighborhood on the sphere that we can cut from). 
Secondly, while the sphere model is certainly a good way to understand how unbounded regions of the plane can be homeomorphic to bounded regions, the model doesn't really get at the heart of the Riemann mapping theorem, which is that there is a *holomorphic* map between any two of our sets. That's the amazing part of the theorem. I don't have a sense for how to visualize endomorphisms of the sphere that correspond to the holomorphic maps, but that to me seems like the crux of the matter. For example, under this model, one might mistakenly conclude that all annuli are conformally equivalent, which they are not unless the ratios of the radii are equal.","1277946534"

&gt; History has always shown that there are evil people who will use whatever tools are at hand to terrorize those who they feel are beneath them.

I'd say history has shown **regular people** will often use whatever tools they can to terrorize those who they feel are beneath them. After all, it's always been not just one or two people but whole societies that enforced the codes of oppression. 

Perhaps we're speaking of culture differently, since I don't consider it an insult to say that rape is part of Congonese culture now. Like I said, I don't blame the people for allowing it to continue unchallenged. And like you said, what I term culture is in fact the way of life that is imposed by the militias/organizations of violent men. I would, for example, call Afghan culture misogynistic even if many Afghans do not like the codes under which they live - the fact that there is no widespread rebellion against those misogynistic codes (again, I don't blame them, they have worse things to worry about) means that the misogyny goes unchallenged... i.e. *it has become part of their culture*. 

What you are referring to when you talk about culture is less the culture of the moment and more the ideals that particular groups of people aspire to. Sure, the Congonese don't *value* rape. I'm sure even the rapists wish things weren't this way. But ideals are not culture, they are only part of culture. What people actually are is a bigger part of culture than what their ideals are.

You are tipping because the cost of the food and labor you are purchasing is very low (comparitively to any other first-world country).  Seriously, the amount of food Americans expect for such low prices is astounding.

Servers and delivery persons are paid an extraordinarilly low wage to keep that cost down.  Not to mention they prepare it for you and bring it to you, sometimes over quite long distances.  If you don't want to pay someone to stock a kitchen, prepare you food on demand and then bring it to you (hopefully still hot!), its always cheaper to cook it yourself.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I haven’t thought about this much lately, but I think I might even prefer something like 10 years of copyright plus 10 years of public domain except required attribution, then public domain. I think there’s an extremely strong public interest (in the sense of involvement, not conscious attention) in art being free, and that most artists now are not dependent on royalties from more than 10 years ago.

Publication is usually not ridiculously hard to establish: if something was made *public*, people know about it. And death can actually be tricky: the law as it is now has to account for people who disappeared or published anonymously. (Edit: I guess what I’m thinking is that right now, we basically need a worldwide death-of-author database. Whereas we could just look at the date on the copyright page or equivalent (and charge anyone who lied there with fraud).)

The art market, as I understand it, cares a lot about people. If you made something wonderful 11 years ago that people are still reproducing, you can probably find new work. Of course you may have lost your touch, but that makes you no different than anyone in other industries with short careers, like modeling and sports. Basically, you should have saved – either money, or unpublished work.

I also favor relaxing copyright’s actual terms. I think it’s pretty weird that I can’t upload something to Vimeo that has a song playing semi-audibly in the other room: is the video really more of a harm than a benefit to the artist? Basically, copyright has gone too far in the direction of not letting people use the materials they see every day. Expanding the coverage and interpretation of fair use as it stands now would be a good start.

Again, I don’t want to be harsh to artists. But the system as it’s set up now seems to be optimized to take care of the rightsholders of massive pop hits, not the struggling creators who get brought up in these discussions.

(Even in the case of massive pop hits, I bet Beyoncé makes more from touring than from track sales, for example. People pay for new art and live art, which keeps artists in work even without royalties.)","1277946598"

 I don't have an Ancestry account so that's a bit of a dead end for me.  I did search once at my college (which does have an account) and didn't find much, but I only spent about 30 minutes doing so so no guarantees it was the best research ever. 

Anyhow, he settled in Louisiana and either:  a) immigrated to those ports or b) came down the Mississippi from New York (or some other northern immigration center).  What really throws a wrench into things is my last name has been Americanized, and no one in my family knows exactly what it was prior.  We've pretty good ideas, but spelling may be off.  Was hoping to find the 'real' last name on an immigration record some where.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I really guess we can't talk about this more, because you seem to think the very masculine box shape is unisex. That picture you showed is the same emblem that goes on a men's room door for a reason. And the male form you showed is still very boxy. A straight torso is the basic form of a *man*. It is not the basic form of a woman. Men and women are structurally built differently. (Ask an artist. Ask an anatomist. Ask an archaeologist, or a forensic scientist.)

If anything, the female form should be considered the norm, as we all start out female. (I'm mostly kidding.)

Also, ""unisex"" sizing is done on men's sizing for tee shirts. A men's medium is equivalent, minus the fitting, to a woman's large. The sizing irrefutably gives it away as men's cut, not unisex. You just call it unisex because women can socially get away with wearing it too.","1277946687"

BEST BAD KNOCKOFF of SUCCESSFUL MOVIE: the self-proclaimed *movie that's guaranteed to offend EVERYONE*, [The Sex o'Clock News](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wGgPkYnWbg) was entirely stolen from *Kentucky Fried Movie.*  It introduces Wayne Knight, of Seinfeld fame, who unwittingly misspells the word ""testicle"",

I'm not sure why we didn't realize the danger in that.

2. My old buddy lives out on a farm, in the middle of the prairies. After a few rounds of target shooting with .22 caliber rifles, we decided to light a campfire to relax. Sitting around that campfire, I noticed someone tossed something into the fire. I asked - 

""Hey what did you throw in there?""

He replies - ""Bullets."" 

""How many?"" I ask getting up to run.

""The box.""

I have never run so fast in my life, and hid hiding behind a tree until all the bullets exploded. 15 - 20 bullets sprayed out everywhere. You never know if a final few are still getting hot enough to fire - i dashed for the car a few minutes later.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","^^^This^^^

Teachers who're up to date with the web are pretty rare. I had one, and he was a flash designer. He really did know what he was doing (had done work for DKNY, Urban Outfitters, Skittles, etc), but he only did flash design professionally. In the end, I had some pretty good experiences in his classes regarding user interaction, and everything that truly makes a good web site / user experience.

However, that was it. There was a web development major, but my friends in that major all said everything was outdated, and you basically had to learn on your own. I swear to god, my senior year, it was like the graphic design teachers learned what CSS is and all of them thought it was some new amazing technology. One teacher was capable of teaching it (supposedly), I didn't get to take her class because I had taken it previously when it was solely flash; but listening to her speak for more than 2 minutes about the web made me think she had no idea what she was talking about.

Either way, I worked on my own so by the time I got out of school I at least knew xhtml, css, and had some experience implementing jquery and working around different CMSs. Most kids who graduated with me, are 100% restricted to designing for print, and some of them are convinced that flash = web design. While they could potentially build a small brochure site, that's not exactly going to land them a job in web design.

The general excuse from the school for being so clueless with the web seemed to be that it changes so often, it's hard to keep up with. Hearing that from people who learned and practiced designing by hand and with line-o-type for years makes me sort of understand; but the fact is, the industry has changed to the point where we're going to have to continue learning throughout our entire careers. School faculties need to catch up.","1277946746"

Most of the time, books don't even have them unless they are worth over 80 dollars or any kind of comic book. Even then, they are easy to take out. 

It sucks with books stores, because it's very, very hard to prevent book theft. All they can really do is keep their eyes open and hope that they catch the thief. 

Also, a suggest for OP. If you ever put the sensors in the books, put them on random pages near the binding rather than on the covers. That is probably the best way to prevent book theft. Unless the book thief is a serial thief, they will end up completely overlooking it.

Also, watch anybody with a bag...and I mean ANYBODY. When they come in, look at how full the bag is compared to when they are getting ready to leave. ","1277946761"
"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","At this time pedal in such a way that there is very little force downwards (the weight of your leg and gravity will take care of that), otherwise you wont get the free flowing cadence that someone like Lance has made famous.  

So when riding, focus on relaxing the lower part of your leg (from the knee down), imagine its asleep and you cant feel it. Place the focus exclusively on your knee during the upstroke and throw it (your knee) smoothly from the bottom of the stroke over the handlebars.  You will need to be in a slightly easier gear to do this but the upside is your cadence will go up.  Relax everything, breath deeply and rhythmically and you will start to fly with ease. 

I am currently in whats called a base training phase where I keep my heart rate low to build aerobic endurance, [here](http://connect.garmin.com/activity/38687766) is a short workout from yesterday and you can see my cadence is in the high 90s most of the time, my heart rate about 70% and my speed between 28 - 40 km/h about 17 - 26 MPH.

If you think it is absurd that is fine. It is still a fact, as much of a fact that any officer seeing another officer commit these offenses will do nothing to stop or correct it, in fact they will most likely help cover it up.


I am fine with errors, I am not fine with a police officer pushing me aside at my own door, enter my home searching my friends, and then two other officers spent 12 hours making sure I could not file a report. All because a neighbor saw someone in a bush near my house and the officers saw I was awake. This was in my backyard btw at the sliding glass door. Yeah two cops trespassed on my property, assaulted me, broke into my home, confined my friends for 2 hours and then left with no consequences. I as a citizen had no recourse unless I wanted to spend thousands of dollars.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As other mentionned, your question is pretty hard to answer on a post, even if it is pretty interesting. But having done a bit of research in discrete math &amp; algorithm design and being a math lover myself, I'll try to talk about why I find my area interesting.

Being a software developper, you should pretty much know what an algorithm is. Given a problem, an algorithm is a recipe/step-by-step set of instructions that, if followed exactly, solves your problem. Algorithms can be classified in a lot of categories: deterministic algorithms (given some input, you always get the same right answer), probabilistic algorithms (you get the right answer 'on average'), approximation algorithms (you get an answer that is within some (provable) factor of the optimal answer) and so on. The main measure (there are multiple others) for the performance of an algorithm is the time it takes to find an answer with respect to the size of the input you are giving it. For example, if your problem is to search through an unordered list of n items for a given item, then the trivial solution (look at every item) takes time n. This is what we call linear in n, but algorithms can run logarithmic in n (takes time log(n) ) (very fast), exponential in n (c^n for some c) (very slow) or polynomial in n (n^k for some k) (efficient).

So the fun part is to find THE best algorithm for your problem. For a particular problem, one may ask how fast can the best algorithm run. Well surprisingly, it turns out that some problems will never admit an efficient EXACT solution. I'll give an example of such problem, and then come to the main point of my discussion.

Consider a graph/network (we love these things in discrete math), which is basically a set of points/nodes/vertices that are connected by links/edges, and its size is usually the number of nodes (the maximum number of edges of a (simple) graph is n^2 - the maximum number of pairs you can make with n elements). The Internet is the best example : nodes are webpages and edges are hyperlinks between theses pages. We say that two nodes are neighbors if they are connected by an edge. A fundamental problem of discrete mathematics goes as follows: what is the minimum number k such that you can color the nodes of a graph with k colors such that not two neighboring nodes share the same color? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring). It turns out that this problem can be proven to be inherently hard - if we can find an efficient deterministic algorithm (we strongly believe we can't) to solve this problem, than there is an efficient (=fast) algorithm to solve many ""hard"" problems (ex.: proving a theorem, or solving a sudoku ! - probably not going to happen).  Such hard problems are said to be NP-complete. It also turn out that most real life (interesting) problems are also that kind of hard (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems). 

This sounds quite desperate. However, here is where the research starts. It is said that these NP-complete problems cannot have efficient DETERMINISTIC and EXACT algorithms. Nothing prevents us from producing randomized and approximate solutions. So with some clever analysis, input from other areas (read algebra, geometry, probability, ...) and other tricks, some algorithms are built to find solutions that are usually within a good factor of the optimal. Hell, some NP-complete problems (i.e. Knapsack Problem) even admit an arbitrarly precise efficient algorithm. How is this possible? Reading required!

I don't know of non-scholar books that covered this subject, but if you are motivated, here are the books I suggest:
- http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Second-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262032937
- http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Jon-Kleinberg/dp/0321295358/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1277946555&amp;sr=1-1
- http://www.amazon.com/Approximation-Algorithms-Vijay-V-Vazirani/dp/3642084699/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1277946570&amp;sr=1-1

I guess there wasn't at lot of fireworks, but the goal was really to show an area of math that is not often brought up in 'mainstream math discussions'. So feel free to ask questions, I'll try to answer them as far as my knowledge goes. 

P.S. I guess I've have put down the foundations for the discrete math/ algorithm design fortress, so every knowledgeable person should add his/her own comment!","1277946815"

I loved Coke, hated Pepsi.  There was a huge booth with tons of people lined up to try the blind taste test.  A large chalkboard behind them showed Pepsi with a distinct lead.  Every time someone selected Pepsi, everyone would yell, the person conducting the taste test would run back to the board and chalk one up for Pepsi, and return to give the tester a prize!

I'm also a bit of a know it all.  So, I watched ***how*** they were doing everything.  And, being a kid, I went back several times for more free drinks/prizes.

Each time I went, the Pepsi was *ice* cold - the Coke was luke-warm.  Didn't matter which line-up I went through.  The Coke was always warmer.

I watched to see if Pepsi was *really* winning the challenge.  Despite the trickery, from the people I watched, more than half seemed to be choosing Coke - only they weren't 'chalking one up' for Coke every time!  Only about half of the time would they actually mark down the choice.

I also noticed that they were giving out better prizes to the people who chose Pepsi!  So, each time I went back, I was sure to pick Pepsi.  Actually, the whole reason I did this was to prove to a friend who didn't believe me when I said that I could tell the difference between the two.  So, when we passed the booth, I said:  'OK, I'll pick Coke half a dozen times in a row if you don't believe that I can tell the difference - here's the taste test, let's go!'  Then, when I saw that you won better prizes for picking Pepsi, I proved it by doing that 6 times in a row instead...

PS.  On a side note, there is ONE occasion where Pepsi beats Coke:  Slurpees!  Don't ask me why...","1277946857"

So I am telling you here, delivery charges aren't always the case.  Unless they explicitly tell you that they are charging for delivery, that is not a necessarily safe assumption to make.  

It may be okay to you as a person who can afford to shaft another person due to some principle that you hold.  The industry is not going to change just because you believe a certain thing.

Watercolor technique is tricky in how you want to organize it. In my opinion your piece currently relies too heavily on the non-watercolor boundaries around the features ie. the contours you made in black do the bulk of the organization while the color adds the dimension and depth.

There is nothing bad about this technique fundamentally but it does not use the watercolors as a definitional medium and IMO to their best potential. I would encourage you to step back the outlining and let color densities draw the edges where you want them.","1277946864"

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan praised the Sarbanes–Oxley Act: ""I am surprised that the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, so rapidly developed and enacted, has functioned as well as it has...the act importantly reinforced the principle that shareholders own our corporations and that corporate managers should be working on behalf of shareholders to allocate business resources to their optimum use.”

SOX has been praised by a cross-section of financial industry experts, citing improved investor confidence and more accurate, reliable financial statements. The CEO and CFO are now required to unequivocally take ownership for their financial statements under Section 302, which was not the case prior to SOX. Further, auditor conflicts of interest have been addressed, by prohibiting auditors from also having lucrative consulting agreements with the firms they audit under Section 201. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox stated in 2007: ""Sarbanes–Oxley helped restore trust in U.S. markets by increasing accountability, speeding up reporting, and making audits more independent.""

The FEI 2007 study and research by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) also indicate SOX has improved investor confidence in financial reporting, a primary objective of the legislation. The IIA study also indicated improvements in board, audit committee, and senior management engagement in financial reporting and improvements in financial controls.

Financial restatements increased significantly in the wake of the SOX legislation and have since dramatically declined, as companies ""cleaned up"" their books. Glass, Lewis &amp; Co. LLC is a San Francisco-based firm that tracks the volume of do-overs by public companies. Its March 2006 report, ""Getting It Wrong the First Time,"" shows 1,295 restatements of financial earnings in 2005 for companies listed on U.S. securities markets, almost twice the number for 2004. ""That's about one restatement for every 12 public companies—up from one for every 23 in 2004,"" says the report

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Even with just the correlation right now, I think that possibility of a causal link between marijuana and schizophrenia should be considered and not just dismissed as I see marijuana proponents doing so often.

This is a completely reasonable statement for a scientist to make.  In our previous posts, I was bothered by the absolutist nature of the statements.  

&gt;I just think the correlation does not imply causation argument is often used as a weak counterargument to a causality that could be damaging to your cause[...]

I would say that it's an easy, simple argument to make, but not weak or invalid.

&gt;...especially when people offer no strong alternative to a causal relationship. ...I know that there has only been a correlation seen so far, but that's because causation is hard to prove (since it must be done through experiments), and especially in this case that would take many years to do. 

Yes, designing, funding, approving, (etc.) an experiment is more complicated than recording naturalistic observation, but I think this is not an unreasonable price to pay for empirical data.  

To clarify, I think it is entirely possible that marijuana consumption may increase schizophrenic symptom presentation.  However, I don't think it realistic, or of good scientific practice, to make decisive statements based on self-reported (n=1) data.  ","1277946882"

It could erase or amplify memories and could apparently change the rules of physics for that person. My mother dropped by to see how we were doing, and for some reason tried it out. When she got to a particular spot on her scalp, her face and hair disappeared; her head was a formless skin-colored knob.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I put together a bachelor party for my buddy and a bunch of us went out of town to a strip club. Well, one of the guys that came with us apparently had no sense of when to stop getting lapdances when he's drunk. One time during the night he was passed out on a chair while two girls were giving him a double lapdance. Then we couldn't find him but figured he would show up to the hotel room since it was right down the road. Morning came and he still hadn't shown up to the room. The only person who had his phone number lost his phone. Then, after finding his phone we called him. I asked where he was and he said ""looking for the hotel."" I asked what intersection he was at and googled it and he was 10 MILES AWAY! He had walked all night in the pouring rain thinking he'd reach the hotel. Anyways, he said he left the strip club when he couldn't pay for all the lapdances he had gotten. I finally picked him up and he wreaked of rain and alcohol. The first thing he said when he sat down in my car was ""hehe, that was crazy."" 

The thing is, that was only one of the many crazy things that happened during this bachelor party. We ended up losing two other guys the rest of the night, but the 10 mile walk story is the funnier one.","1277946931"

What he's failing to recognize is how much the experience of art is interactive anyway.  How much an audience brings to an experience.  I'm sure that's something he's written about before in regards to other art forms, but he uses it to disqualify games.

Game designers author experiences.  And it's true.  The players get to author the experience too.  A writer on Slate compared it to a play and actors.  Players are actors.  Actors experience the art work of a play and participate in it as well.  And, I think that's a helpful way to see the art that is at work in games.  

Would an actor not be experiencing art while performing a play?  Can only the audience watching that actor be experiencing the art?  That doesn't ring true to me.  ","1277946955"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","It felt forced on me. I don't want to have to read 1/3rd of Marvel's current issues to keep up. On top of that, I knew that there would be a lot of side-switching (which to me, seemed to be purely just to create mini-twists) - it was also one of those books that at it's heart is has a very political theme - and I just don't get into books like that. 

Killing Captain America didn't surprise me at all. At the end of every major story arc (for both DC and Marvel) they always kill or maim a few mid-card characters and at least one main-streamer only to completely resurrect all of them a few months later for the sake of sales. I'm not saying this wasnt done 20 years ago, but the publisher-wide crossovers were much less frequent. 

When I read Wolverine: Origin I knew Marvel was in a bad place with Joe Q in the driver's seat. That book was a complete let-down. 30 years of mystery and THATS what they came up with?! 

I'm sort of just ranting now, but I'd like to try to put all this behind me and pick up where I left off and get back into comics. I don't think there is any way I can catch up on what has happened to X-Men. It's been just one major intricate story-arc after another over there.

Firstly, I studied criminology in university so I have a little bit of background in this subject.  Most crimes are random, they aren't planned, they just happen in the heat of the moment.

Most people don't intentionally go around looking for bikes to steal, but rather those who have the urges, if they see a bike they can steal they probably will.  This is definitely not entrapment, that would be forcing the person to steal the bike, they steal it on their own free will.

Also, back near my old town, Surrey BC has bait cars.  They leave cars and if people steal them, the police get alerted, the cars will turn off and they get locked inside.  I also believe they have live video somewhere on the internet.  

So I am all for bait bikes too.  I know they tried it back in Ottawa a few weeks ago and the bike never sat unstolen for more than 10 minutes.  ","1277946986"

I only dated men except for a one-time encounter with my female roommate, which was one time only because she was only curious.

Got married, wasn't happy, thought about women a lot, and eventually we split up and I thought I was a lesbian at that point, so for 14 years I identified that way.  Unfortunately I was a total failure as a lesbian and couldn't get laid nearly enough and men started to look good again.

Now I'm in a committed relationship with a man.  We swing occasionally at clubs and I get to kiss and fool around with women.  He and I joke about getting ourselves a girlfriend, but we're smart enough to know that this is not a great idea, so I content myself with the occasional club adventure.

The Mongolians who were responsible for the most damage of the caliphate later turned Muslims on their own will but still remained savages.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; I haven't seen a SINGLE mention of false-rape-accusation come up. 

Your whole premise in this argument has been: **but what if a wife wakes up tomorrow and accuses her husband of raping her because she wasn't 100% in the mood tonight?** Otherwhise, why are you talking about stuff like:

&gt; I've had sex with my partner unenthusiastically before, but that does not mean that I was raped.

The words ""false rape accusation"" don't have to be uttered for the conversation to be clearly about them. Come on, this is reddit. 

And now we get to the nub of it. Despite your disclaimer that you don't think drinking or using drugs means ""rape me"", you still say that women OUGHT to be careful, women SHOULDN'T drink too much or use drugs too much. This implies you consider them culpable for whatever happens to them if they are foolish enough to do the things you think they shouldn't (otherwise I don't see why you put it that way). 

So I think we're about done having this conversation. I don't believe I'll be able to make you see that even if a woman was drunk, flirting and **naked**, she is even 1% responsible for a person raping her, and I would never advise her to change her behaviour on the basis of ""but that might get you raped"".

I am not sure where to start...

At the end you say that a decision to let a fetus die because it's emotionally difficult saddens you, but making it illegal would take away the free will that ""God""(capitol G..for christian) gave us. This after you just got done saying that your reasoning for being ""personally pro-choice"" had nothing to do with god. And in your summation line of your comment you contradict everything you established as to why you think aborting because of rape is ...maybe not wrong but in the least slightly less good. Look I get it, you don't take the bible too literally, you just pick and choose which parts you like (free will, ""god is love""...), and you are smart enough to know that your religion doesn't belong in politics, but you think that by saying that its based on a personal decision you can get away with ""and I really don't think other people should either"" which winds back to your idea of free-will where people have the ability (and in a legal context, the right) to go against gods wishes. And your objection to this being legislated is not via a violation of the constitution but of a violation of our god given free will? Fuck me..

bonus content-extra shit that I wasted time writing so here.

You begin by saying that you wouldn't abort because of rape and that you really don't think other people should. First off, have you ever been raped and impregnated? If the answer is no, I don't think you have a solid basis for making these kind of judgments or encouraging others to do what you think you might do in their very complicated situation (unless you've researched these thing thoroughly). I realize you're against legislating it, but it seems like you'd be ok with making it so frowned upon that people who claim to have decent morals would be afraid to do it out of social pressures. 

Being raped is a difficult enough thing to deal with, and adding in a constant reminder of it for 9 straight months could easily be way too much for someone to handle (beyond simply emotionally difficult). And it doesn't get any easier from that point on because then one would have to choose whether to raise their rapist's child, in which case they've got to be reminded of that horrible incident for the rest of their life, or give it up for adoption, which also is another ridiculously hard thing (I imagine) for a woman (or a couple) to decide to do to begin with. And adoption is not all puppies and candy canes, how many parents do you think are looking to adopt a child who's mother was raped by some scumbag bastard? So then its The foster care system which is far from perfect and many children struggle just to make it through it to their 18th birthday. There are already probably hundreds and hundreds of children who currently are in need of being adopted, and added more children is not going to help. And if you didn't give the child away, how would you go about telling them that their father raped the sh*t out of you and that's how their life began? That will surely make for a difficult family moment that is not to be taken lightly because of the implications it may or may not have on that child's metal well being. In addition to that, have you ever noticed that children have a lot of similar qualities and personality traits as their biological parents have? So while it is not an absolute certainty (or even any where near certain) that the child may inherent the tendency to be a sickfuck, the odds would be slightly working against their favor, regardless even the possibility of their kid resembling the person that raped them might be terrifying. That is great if some women think or know that they can handle it all and still give that child a decent or even exceptional upbringing. it is a beautiful, uplifting notion that there exists people with that amount strength and courage, but the point is, you can not expect or assume everyone else has that ability, and it certainly doesn't make the alternative decision less moral because some people have exceptional skills and can go through with it.

You make it sound like you are saying, ""you got a baby, be happy about it"". What if they didn't want children at all? ever? And I don't think the majority of women ( I have dude-parts, so I acutally have no basis for this statement) when they are ready to have a child, wish to allow just anyone's spermguys to reach their egg, they want to have the person that they love's child, no one is out there  praying for ""just anyone's child"".... Unless there are fertility issues of course but I am trying to say that some people have no intentions of ever having a child, and if they are raped, and choose to have an abortion at a reasonable time in their pregnancy, I don't know why you feel sorry for the fetus and not the mother who has just been raped. Y

And how are you defining ""healthy""? Because I find it hard to believe that someone who has just been raped and impregnated by a stranger could possibly be in a healthy mental state as a result. And your mind's well being most certainty effects your body and all the stress, anxiety, anger, and possibly depression that accompanies being taken advantage of in this most vile way surely is not most suitable environment for a fetus (and child later on) to develop in and around.
And you can't think of any reason not to give a living creature a chance at life? This depends on what you mean by healthy, if the child is diagnosed with a disease in which he'll never experience something that you would be considered any where near ""normal"" in their short painful existence and on top of that it was a rape baby, would that not be a enough reason for you? 

Although you might never go so far to say that god plans rape, if someone believe that god knows all, past, present, and future, there is no escaping this conclusion. Also if it is believed that god is in fact""all-knowing"" then there is no such thing as free-will, it would just be an illusion, its simple...you can't have free will if god knows everything that you will do in advance. So no, it's not ""stupid"", it is what has to be the case if you believe in a god that is a super omniscient being.

It is great that you recognize that religious beliefs need to be kept out of politics, but the truth of the matter is that your beliefs inform your actions and they will find a way into the way you interact with the world. If your a politician you will sneak it into a bill, if you are an athlete you will thank god for blessing you with the talent... and it gets harder to separate the two with the more authority over others you have because after all god placed me in this position of power.. Unless you are one of the handful of people (comparatively) who are able to clock in and out of their religion at will, which I would argue doesn't really make you a true believer in the first place. If someone's religion tells them that so and so is wrong, and if they are a true believer in that religion, is it morally wrong for them  to not try to make that a reality even if its against man's law? It is possible to draw a clear line in the sand between politics and religion, but the average church goer doesn't have the mental ability that you have to be able to hold that line when it counts.

so many words... I wasted an hour of my life.

I'd tried a few different types of herbal highs before and really didn't think it would do a thing to me, especially considering it was legally available in head shops in Ireland at the time. To set the scene, I'd just returned from a couple of years in Australia, having run out of visas and had to leave my fiancee behind, so I was a bit low anyway. I did it with an old friend who'd just been through a bad break up and had been drinking a lot, evidenced by dozens of beer bottles on his kitchen counter. I took a huge hit and felt like I physically fell away in quantised 'slices' into some alternate reality. My friend did his hit and felt it taking him, so tried to grab something to hold on to. What he tried to grab were the dozens of beer bottles which started raining down and smashing all over the kitchen floor. I had an 'oh shit' moment and tried to fight against the salvia to regain control of the situation, which is when it bit me badly. I ended up leaving and sitting in the quietest, darkest place I could find before calling my girl in Sydney and freaking her out by telling her what had happened :P My little brother did it and was convinced he was in a book and begged his friends not to close the cover. Another good friend of mine thought he was sitting in and old steam train at a station. Serious parallel reality shit.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I interview for IT jobs; not as much as him, but I do the ""techinal"" interview.

I see people all the time that have differant backgrounds.  Not a lawyer, but I see people who were former Chiefs, Artists, etc. and want to get into IT.

I ussually look down on that for a few reasons.  

**First**, competation.  Why hire someone that has been painting  for the last 10 year when I got a kid here that has been doing IT for the last 10 years?  So, lack of Experience.  I don't care if your 30, if you only have 1 year in IT; you rank the same as the kids just coming from college (and they have the benifit of a CS degree).   I don't mean to sound harsh, but that is the way it is.  Specially in this enviroment.

**Secondly**, bad taste from the dot bomb era.  During that time, it seemed like *everyone* wanted to get into IT (cause of the money), even if they didn't have the skills.  I've interviewed so many douche bag real estate agents and marketers that it wasn't even funny.  They are easy to read, you can see they are only in it for the money, switching to whatever job pays the most and trying to bullshit their way though it.  **not everyone** is like that, but majority of them seem that way.

Like I said, I do the techinal side of the interview, so can quickly tell if someone doesn't have the skills or knowlege we're looking for.  You can't bullshit your way though Math and C++ questions, no matter how much you've been prepped.

**Thrid** Skill set.  Being good with people is a nice skill to have, but if your apply for a number crunching programming job, I'm looking for someone that is ok working alone.  Msot of the time, I'm not looking for a manager, I'm looking for a coder.  In my expeirence, the best programmers I've worked with have ussually been slightly intorverted.  They enjoy coding, they can work though some code by themesleves without having to this weird clingy depdence on other team mates.  They enjoy thinking though a problem for themselves, not constantly having to talk about it.  Not to say I haven't worked with some good exortverted programmers, just saying they ussually aren't the norm.

Short answer: I want a *thinker*, not a smooth talker.  Lots of these real estate agents and such come off with that ""used car sellsman vibe"" and totally not what I'm looking for.  They might make good managers, but probably not good coders; espeically if they don't have the expeirence (see point two).


Not saying you fit into any of those.  Just saying, that is mostly my expeirence with people that are trying to switch into IT from another carrerr.","1277947068"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This guy has the right answer, and the correct technical details.

The best espressos are produced when the water passes through the coffee grounds with a temperature tolerance of only 1ºc or 2ºc. That much below the correct temperature and some of the flavours won't come out, that much above and some of them will be spoiled.

The question is whether you can taste the difference. Generally speaking a more expensive machine will give a technically better espresso - all the way right up to the espresso makers $4000+ which are only ever installed in cafes and restaurants. Those have really big boilers and thus particularly good temperature stability. Realistically, you can get results which are mostly indistinguishable with a very good home espresso machine, realistically many people don't notice the difference even with a cheap one.

The question is how much you care, and how much of a difference you notice; if you regularly have good expresso at a cafe or restaurant you might find the coffee from a $150 unsatisfying.

The grinder is indeed more important than the expresso maker. ","1277947086"

Yes, it can. The debt held in the intragovernmental holdings is for things like the social security trust fund. If the government changes the law, this evaporates. The government can't do that for the public debt component. It is not hard to understand.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to always go to a friend's lake house in NC where there was a gigantic fish fry with fresh-caught fish and homemade casseroles etc. It was the best food ever. We'd then go to a fairgrounds fireworks festival where we usually smoked and trolled people on walkie-talkies for fun. Then we'd get drunk and shoot fireworks off the dock all night :)  
  
Last year, my sister's boyfriend bought $2000 worth of fireworks and we shot them off nonstop for hours in a suburban neighborhood. People came out to watch, we had beers and Patron, and somehow the cops were never called (fireworks are illegal in the state of GA). Cleaning up the entire street the next day was not easy though.  
  
This year I'll be camping on Tybee Island. I hope everyone has fun this year!","1277947206"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I could see summer sausage getting old after a few days in a row, but used sparingly, it is delicious.

I had my own First Aid Kit (which I kept calling a med-kit apparently on account of far to many video games). I took some Ibuprofen as soon as I fell, and I think that contributed to the decrease in pain. About 2 or 3 hours into the journey down though, the Ibuprofen wore off, and I was back in fairly major pain. I asked the Search and Rescue people if they had anything I could take, but unfortunately they have regulations that explicitly forbid administering any medication to a subject (because if they gave me something and I had a reaction to it, it could still be 6 hours to get down). After a little while they told me that if one of my party mates was to find some pain meds in my first aid kit, and was to accidentally drop them into my mouth, they wouldn't see it happen, so the rest of the trip sucked less.

As for any mental difficulties, I am kinda sad that I'm not going to be hiking for the best part of the summer, and I was hoping to learn to dance this summer which isn't going to happen. Other than that, I've really been trying to focus on the positive aspects. Search and Rescue was amazing and helped me out of a bad situation. I learned a few important things about being safe in the wilderness, and I'm trying to pass that along to anyone who will listen. I'm going to have more time to practice on the bass and work on my website. After the surgery, I'll have a titanium plate on my leg, which is badass, and possibly a steel screw that I can attach magnets to. I know that it could have gone a lot worse, but really, the only thing to do now is to look to the future. ","1277947206"

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's actually why I didn't reply. There is an obvious language barrier with anyone who is an economist but isn't versed in Austrian theory. Some, like Caplan or Nozick have made excellent criticisms regarding some things many Austrians would say. Most economists don't criticize Austrians well because they simply don't have the tools to realize they in fact, are the ones blinded. I can speak with any economist on any subject, really. I'm no tenured professor, but I've been to class contrary to workacct's assertions I probably haven't. More than that, I wasn't always Austrian in my economic thinking. I understand various schools well enough to do things a lot of autodidacts can't. Sometimes, when I'm feeling spry and mischievously youthful again, I ""troll"" a little I guess. Just for self laughs, but hey, I may as well tell someone else who might get a laugh. 

[Before you go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/97sm8/paul_krugman_after_finding_out_an_economics_news/c0brh1e), I'll mention I'm not the ""[deleted]"" commenter, and let you in on a secret I was too classy to throw in Dr. PhD Verve's face. You'll notice I did not reply again to their last post. Just like I did to workacct. Allow me to explain why. First of all, in the most familiar of ways (at least to those of us who are economists, but end up gravitating into Austrian thought) I recognize overly-verbose agreement with me designed to look like a sticking point. When verve says Rothbard is right .. ""but"" or ""Yes, this holds true ceteris paribus."" or ""I think we are on the same page"", ""upvotes for you!"" while surrounded by text designed only to make me assume I am outclassed ... I recognize that for what it is.

Do you know **why** I recognize that for what it is? Because in a discussion with a Keynesian, about theory all economics is based on, *I am being disagreed with for the **sole** reason I am seen as an ""Austrian""*. I say this, because in that thread, and I never did tell that guy, because at this point you can see it is pointless ... The argument I used was from page 434 of my Macro textbook. [Written by Paul Krugman.](http://books.google.com/books?id=dpTBdNGGrtUC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=krugamn+macroecomics+434&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GiLPCxpoQy&amp;sig=76fHFUuMnxTIUS4dlMs3Dt1XOJQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QPaqSpmZN8WBtgeuhoisCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false).

And yeah, get a travel towel before you go, a microfibre one so it dries quickly, you don't want to put it away wet because it will stink. I forgot to get one before I left, and didn't want to spend lots of money on one when I was overseas, so I bought a microfibre tea towel from a 2 euro store. (Nothing makes you appreciate full size towels like drying yourself with a tea towel for 2 and a half months.)

I was told not to chance money at airports or at train stations because they are super expensive. Bring some pounds and some euros, enough to cover your costs for a couple of days. Don't put all of it in your wallet, hide some away in your bag.  Get a money belt if you want, but don't use it as your main way of carrying money, just put enough for a days outing in your wallet in your front pocket and the rest in the belt, you don't want to be lifting up your shirt to pull your money out each time. Don't wear the one that hang around your neck, because you don't want someone to grab it and pull it off. I went all around Europe without a money belt, and I had no issues at all, I just kept a tight grip on my handbag!

I took a couple of night trains, mostly around Eastern Europe, and they are not super fun, but it does give you extra time in your location. If you are going to get a night train, get a sleeper berth, it is much better than sleeping across a couple of seats.

Good service means you get your drinks in a timely manner, your water is refilled, you don't wait too long for your food, for your plates to be cleared, or the bill. And, yeah, they're friendly. However, at a more expensive restaurant, these things will always be done as a matter of course. Additionally, your waiter can explain the details of how each dish is prepared, where the ingredients came from, suggest a wine pairing for your entree if there is no sommelier, can help you decide how you want your meat cooked if it is a cut you are not familiar with, I could go on. These skills come with experience and a passion for food. You just don't get that level of expertise and service from the waitstaff at Applebee's, no matter how good the service.","1277947270"

Yes, you 'created' the shed, only insomuch as you also created the software you used to download the shed, or the browser you're using to find the plans for the shed. I think that you're overlooking the value of what it means to create a song in putting so much value in your ability to recreate the thing on your own, was basically the point I was trying to make. I'm in favor of disseminating music and art, because the overall point is for those things to serve as a form of communication that don't do their job if no one gets to hear them, or if only those who have the means are allowed to hear them. However, I don't like it when people muddy things to the point that we start to neglect the importance of the creator. I will agree that it's not technically theft, but I'm also not about to say it's entirely moral. In some ways I also feel like I'm stealing if I'm not in some way supporting the artist, or art in general. I think you can do that in a number of different ways. Like contributing to the medium.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The kicker to a long story of being overworked: On a Web server containing 250 live Web sites, I ran a command (containing a switch that was supposed to be removed for live servers) that essentially deleted all Web site data on the server.

The higher-ups also failed to mention to me that they had selected the server I was working on as one of five that would be omitted from backups while another mess-up involving the backup system was being worked on.

So basically, 250 Web sites went down until their owners could re-upload them since Web server configurations were maintained. Those who did not have a local copy of their site data lost it completely.

Let this be a lesson to never rely on a single point of backup, especially in the care of a third-party.

Also, Daredevil books from the 80s are an awesome read if you can get past all the inner dialogue. Spider-man has always been hit-or-miss, but a good start is the McFarlane run (first 13 issues I think) of Spider-man. Detective Comics is always a great read (or was last time I checked) and so is the main Batman book.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Universalism seems a bit absurd for the most part. What sort of things might these universals be? Where would they reside?

""4556 One of the generally assumed, but, it seems to me, mistaken, patterns of modern ontology is belief in the Principle of Localization. It answers the question, But where is it? If I assert the existence of relations or structures as universals, someone will inevitably ask me where these supposed things are. If I say that they are nowhere, I get a blank look of un-understanding. Consider the relation of ""being under"". The boy is standing under the bridge. If relations exist, the question becomes Where is that relation, where is ""under""?  Some have tried to say that it is located where the relata are. But that surely doesn't work. If I say that the moon hangs over the mountains, Is ""over"" there where the moon and the mountains are? I think not. Relations are not located. Nor is the moon-ness of the moon or the mountain-ness of the mountains. These things are all nowhere. And the blank look deepens.

What does it mean to be located? I think that in people's imagination it means to be ""in"" an underlying substance. Color is in the shirt. A smile is on a face. Thoughts are in the mind. An event is in time. A gesture of hopelessness is in space. His sweet taste is in my anticipation or slyly on the tongue or, drolly neuromorphically, it is in the brain - somewhere. Surely, it is thought, those things cannot be nowhere. And so the philosophy of internal relations arises in which relations are somehow in the relata, in their natures, in the mind or in the language we speak. Maybe in the great object of the world. It seems to me that none of that works. Relations, just as the universals that they are, are nowhere. But they do, most intensely, exist.

Philosophically, the Nowhere is one of the most beautiful places of all.""

Residents of Minnesota between the ages of 16 and 18 may take the GED tests if they qualify for 
an Age Waiver.  You must apply for an age waiver using the form provided by the Minnesota 
GED Office.  Approved forms must be presented at an Official Testing Center before you will be 
allowed to test. Age waiver applicants must not be enrolled in high school. 
 
There are six possible ways for an applicant to qualify for an age waiver.  An applicant needs to 
meet ONE of the following six conditions: 
 
1.  Applicant has been dropped from the school’s attendance rolls for at least one full 
calendar year. 
2.  Applicant’s high school class has graduated. 
3.  A prospective employer indicates on signed/dated letterhead that applicant must 
successfully complete the GED Battery to qualify for employment. 
4.  A prospective postsecondary institution or financial aid office indicates on signed/dated 
letterhead that applicant must successfully complete the GED Battery to qualify for 
acceptance or to begin the financial aid process. 
5.  The military indicates on signed/dated letterhead that applicant must successfully 
complete the GED Battery to qualify for acceptance. 
6.  An Adult Basic Education (ABE) program or other recognized educational, social 
service, or correctional agency indicates that successful completion of the GED Test 
Battery is a part of the applicant’s written individual learning plan, AND also provides 
documentation showing the applicant has taken at least three of the five Official GED 
Practice Tests with a standard score of at least 500 on each.  Official Practice Tests are 
available from all Minnesota ABE programs. ","1277947380"

I've done it twice - Denmark (a small town near Aarhus) when I was 16 and Sweden (Uppsala) when I was 20 (I actually just returned on Friday). Both of them were for a year and I would do it again if given the chance. I recommend both of those places, but for language-ease, I'd pick Swedish over Danish haha. If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask! Having done it twice, I think I can offer some good advice either relating to Scandinavia or study abroad in general. 

Oh, I forgot some main advice I've given to several of my friends who have also studied abroad:
The most important thing would be to not be afraid to go out and do things and meet people. Everyone else is new and trying to make friends (just like freshman year!) so don't worry about it. And this may be personal preference because very few exchange students share my feelings, but I think it's more important to embrace the culture you're living in than to travel loads. I saw so many exchange students heading out of the country nearly every weekend and I wonder how they can get a sense of the land they're living in. Yes, it's lovely to travel, but don't make your experience about that. You're there to learn and live in a new culture. Embrace it.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; You have to put the whole thing into context, though. Once you get into the 10-20 ms range, there are OS-level latencies that might have just as much of an impact as the GC. 

This is definitely true. The scheduler quantum itself in a non-RT OS can be enough to upset things if you have a hard requirement. But games and high frequency trading are soft -- optimizing the average case matters, and the pauses that the GC introduces of 20-30ms will be *in addition to* those added by the OS.

&gt; Plus, what latency-sensitive threads don't call into the OS? If you're drawing graphics you're calling into the graphics driver, if you're playing audio you're calling into the audio driver, etc.

But again, that's additional latency. A GC imposes 20-30ms of latency that can't be optimized by the app developer.","1277947428"

What I'm trying to say is that for marijuana to be effectively ""harmless"" does **not** require that it be 100% harmless, it merely requires that it be not more dangerous than other everyday things that are reasonably considered harmless.

1. Your basic logic mistake is that you're conflating that with the statement that ""it doesn't matter how harmful it is, since everything is at least a little bit potentially harmful; even if marijuana is extremely harmful, it's can still be called harmless"". But that's not at all what I said.

2. Your false equivalence is the minor risk of marijuana compared to the well-documented more significant health risks of smoking tobacco.  The basic problem with the ""Yeah well everything causes cancer now a days so it's no big thing"" argument is that there actually *is* a very big risk difference between your cancer risk when you smoke *extensively*, vs. your risk from most normal parts of ""everything"".

Now, in reality, a moderate or low amount of smoking of cigarettes doesn't actually significantly increase your risk of getting cancer.  Cigarette smoking has other well-documented bad health effects, though, such as exacerbating asthma, even if you smoke well below the high-cancer-risk level.

In any case, if it were true that marijuana were as harmful to your health as cigarettes, then the point I tried to make above just plain wouldn't apply.  So, no, you absolutely *did not get* the point I was trying to make.  Where we *actually* disagree is in our assessment of how harmful marijuana is.

&gt; Think about it. You're putting smoke in your lungs.

... and that may be where you're going wrong.  You're jumping to conclusions based on ill-founded intuition.  You don't actually know the mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes cancer, but you're assuming that you can intuit it.  Based on what I've read, you're wrong.

However, even if you were right about that, my point would still stand as a sound logical objection to part of what the OP wrote.","1277947484"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I feel much the same way as you do, and I'm an American.  I think that the widely shared belief that you can run a country forever on one document comes more or less from American Protestantism.  It's our national Bible: when we can't figure out what to do, that's where we look.  (for example, the Bush v. Gore election had little to do with the Constitution, but we didn't feel safe until we'd referred it to the SCOTUS).

Unfortunately, and as with the Bible, as it ages the Constitution accumulates differences with the modern world.  Some of these are manipulable through careful interpretation of the original document's often-vague language -- protections from the police, for example -- and some are a constant thorn in our side, as in the unending abortion debate (this being an issue that the writers of the constitution had absolutely no idea about and could not have even conceptualized the level of state power that would make such a thing illegal). 

Lastly, though, I think that a fundamental laziness has taken the American people -- the unwillingness to amend the Constitution.  After the 1960s and 1970s, there hasn't been a really credible nationwide movement to change the document, even though there are a hundred ways in which it could be altered, any of which might renew our democracy.  Campaign finance reform in particular *needs* a constitutional amendment.  But it seems like the will of the people is more or less tied to the status quo.

The only point on which I disagree with you is the 'made a mockery of it through their rulings'.  I don't agree with every Supreme Court decision, obviously, but I think the Constitution is naturally and gradually becoming a joke due to its old age -- the role of the Supreme Court has little to do with it.  If anything, they're the goo that sticks the withered scraps of paper to the ever-thrusting future.","1277947494"

Part of this I think is cultural, but they would do well to have some better training and more difficult challenges in training and qualification.  If Mexico had more experience playing better teams, getting totally thrashed, getting mistreated with bad calls from the referee or by increased physicality from the players (like if they played some larger teams, Netherlands etc., for example), they could perhaps get over the hump of playing with their hearts on their sleeves, which would lead to more consistency on their part.","1277947517"

I exercise to the point of mental exhaustion and physical ache.

I also don't worry about things I have no power over.  I just can't.  Let it go.  I have a great social circle and act a fool every once in a while.  I am very good at communicating and usually am able to express my feelings, which is a huge release.

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt; How exactly does the WHO represent the nuclear industry?

It doesn't, but the IAEA, which led the Chernobyl Forum, does.

&gt; The TORCH report, however, does seem to be politically motivated (""requested by the European Greens""). This report, which was written by only two scientists and commissioned by an anti-nuclear politician, does not trump the official UN report that is the result of hundreds of scientists.

If that's your measure of validity, then why refer to an anti-coal activist report when looking at the impacts of coal power?

&gt; 40 kBq is still not a very large amount.

A minimum of 40kBq was enough to cause 5000 premature deaths among a population of 6 million. When you consider that the area contaminated by between 40 and 4kBq was home to over 200 million people, you'd expect to see a few thousand more cases.

&gt; They report that 2 million people die each year from air pollution (the majority of which they say is caused by burning fossil fuels), which is much higher than my estimate above.

That's a global figure. It's in fact much *lower* than your estimate of 11.5 million, especially when you consider that the attribution to coal burning is only a fraction of the WHO's 2 million.

You still haven't addressed the issue of how to make a like for like comparison of the differences in harm from each industry to validate your claim that deaths from Chernobyl are 'statistical noise'. As the nuclear lobby pointed out, the best way to make the comparison is by premature deaths per MW of generation. One thing you haven't considered so far is the health impacts of mining the fuel and disposing of the waste. And yes, the possibility of future climate change should also be in the mix. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think it's as obviously one-sided as you're trying to make it out to be.

Note that I've not tried to argue that coal power is safe, or nuclear is dangerous. I'm just trying to get you to remove your blinkers and get some perspective. I agree with you that coal is generally more harmful than nuclear, at least in areas with competent safety regimes, but that only applies as long as things work as intended, and it's not to say that nuclear power is harm*less*. And an accident in a nuclear plant, should it ever happen, would be far more harmful than an accident in a coal plant.","1277947635"

In other words, a black from the United States has roughly the same IQ as a black back in Africa. A Southeast Asian in Asia has roughly the same IQ as a Southeast Asian raised in Canada.*

* Footnote: A slight proviso must be added: Admixture seems to have an effect on population groups. US blacks, for instance, have about a 10-point IQ advantage over African counterparts . . . due, circumstantially—and controversially—to admixture with non-African population groups. Where admixture rates drop, so does the IQ disparity. In other words, a pure-bred African in Brazil will score roughly what an African in Nigeria will. A pure-bred African in Kansas will score roughly what his counterpart will in Ghana.","1277947638"

"OpenChristian","t5_2rvuh","&gt;Because finding value in myths doesn't make you an adherent of the religion associated with the myth.

Well, this depends on a lot of things, doesn't it?  

What does it mean to ""find value"" in a myth?  The myth informs my actions and motivates my behavior.  It isn't just me saying: ""Ah! That's nice.""

What does it mean to be a Christian?  You'll rarely find agreement on these matters between distinct faiths, or even between different denominations within faiths.  The question of who is a Christian is very complex, and will depend on who you ask.  For example, an Evangelical would not consider a Catholic to be a Christian, since they have not been ""saved"".

What does it mean to adhere to a religion?  By what right do my beliefs, ritual observances, and theological narratives and symbols not qualify as religion?  

&gt;Have you ever considered Norse, Egyptian or Roman/Greek mythology?

My girlfriend has books of ancient mythology.  I've read some of the stories of the Greek and Egyptian pantheons, and they're entertaining, but they don't touch me the same way the Christ myth does.  To respond to the more general implied question, no, I haven't experienced every religion.  Nor have I tasted every ice cream flavor, but I know what my favorite is.  I haven't met every woman on Earth, but I know which I love above all others.  I don't need to experience all of the world's religions to know I've had and have a numinous experience with one of them.

&gt;You're (presumably) an atheist in regards to all of those religions

Technically, I'm an atheist in regards to Christianity, too.  I don't have a belief in God.  I guess I'm just not the ""right kind"" of atheist for you?

&gt;It's an unnecessary combination of words as ""atheist"" preempts ""Christian.""

Only with an unnecessarily narrow conception of Christian.  Who invested you with the power to decide who belongs to which religion?  I'd consider a Christian any person who, after careful consideration, genuinely identifies as such.  How is that wrong?","1277947694"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Well ... So if someone were to rape her then that would make her happy?

Or ...

If I were to get raped and get pregnant then she is willing to take me in pay for my pre-natal. Compensate me for my time. Take the child as her own (perhaps I should spend her money to take up crack so the baby could be a crack baby and therefore an additional trial that god wanted her to take on).

I guess if I were to sue her for getting me into the situation then god thinks she should pay me. What is her net worth?

How many rape result babies do you think she could support?

I'm recovering from cancer (god thought it was important that I lose my tits ... silly old god. LOL. Good times!). Will I get god hazard pay or extra credit?

Is there a point system? How many crack babies equals one full time rape pregnancy?

If I miscarry do i still get credit? I'm taking taxofin - it causes some nasty birth defects - it is extra credit for that trial?

Can someone get me a ""rule book""? I read the bible but that doesn't cover this. I need the latest abridged version.

Will she take kittens? I saw an itty bitty little tabby feral the other day and she was WAY young. I think god wants her to take kittens and puppies. God ... um ... TOLD me so.

EDIT: I am not even funning about someone raping her. God told me that's gross and she is too old to bear hate babies for god. God LOVES hate babies so if you rape and use protection then you are AGAINST god - also you should make sure your target is fertile.

I just puked in my mouth. I just can't even ... Can someone explain to me how this fucking insane crap is not short-sighted??? I mean it isn't a happy fucking situation that she wants to happen ... Oh fuck it. Why try to apply reason to insanity - that's just ... CRAZY!","1277947710"
"psychology","t5_2qhcz","You were careful to only mention Freud's more accepted theories, minus the misogyny, psychosexual development and the Oedipus complex. I am mostly questioning why these are still taught since - as I said - Freud's theories have historical value.

&gt;4) Because Freud knew humans are innately bisexual before it was cool

First of all I question whether this is widely accepted now. Secondly, it doesn't matter what he concluded - it matters why he concluded it. Since he's obviously wrong on many things, we can't praise him for possibly guessing correctly on other things.

My understanding of modern neuroscience is that the brain is not so easily divisible into ""id, ego and superego."" That instead they blur and this distinction is no longer necessary or useful. Feel free to point me in the direction of what you consider to be good sources for this, but I'm not going to believe this because you said so.

&gt;Why don't you actually read some of his work before coming to this presumptuous (and dare I say impetuous) conclusion?

It's not a good idea to deflect my point by claiming I don't know enough about it to argue it. You should first get an idea of what Freudian theories I object to - something you couldn't possibly have known until my reply just now.

Question for you: Is Freud wrong on some accounts? If yes, another question: Are his incorrect theories being taught in university classes?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","i currently work at a thai restaurant and delivered pizza in the past. at the the thai place, they have a company vehicle. at the pizza place, i used my own vehicle. the thai restaurant just recently tacked on a delivery charge of 1.50 which goes to gas for their own vehicle which is understandable but the tips have gone down, but what do you expect in a horrible economy? the pizza place, they gave around a $1 to $2 per box to get you back for gas and wear and tear on your car. 

from experience in the industry,  especially with delivery drivers, i have heard some nasty and disturbing stories from the drivers themselves. i dont even get food delivered anymore, i just go pick it up and tip the guys working inside, they work hard too.

 it used to bug me when people didnt tip on deliveries but i accepted it because it comes with the territory. i never messed with anyones food though, if they werent good tippers, depending on how busy it was, i just took their food last. 

but i didnt treat anyone differently, i just accepted that some people are cheap and some are generous when it comes to tipping.

now if i had to experience what you experienced, i would have called the restaurant where he works at and explained what is happening at that exact moment and be prepared for either alot of free food, but never get delivery again, or getting nothing and never eating there again.

whats also is messed up is that the owner asked me when i dont get a tip why dont i ask for one, i started laughing and told him im not going to beg for a tip and this is america buddy, we can choose to tip or not tip. it blew my mind that he would even advise that lol.

i have also served tables too and it blows my mind how some servers who have alot of experience in the industry dont expected getting shafted or tipped very little. sheesh, im just glad to have a job dude.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To my knowledge, and your experience could easily prove me wrong, the only reason a bullet travels any distance is because of the barrel it travels through. The explosion (gas) is contained behind the bullet and in order to escape, must push it out first. That is why it can fire a bullet at such great speed. 

Without a barrel, it only has a very very short distance before the gas can escape and dissipate.

I believe they went somewhere, but not at the same force or with the same velocity as if they were fired from the firearm they were meant for.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Whether I agree with the idea or not, I understand the premise of tipping. It's an incentive for service workers to bust their ass. Your income is largely dependent upon merit, unlike many other industries. Those who are most service-oriented will generally receive better tips, those who are lazy and have no work ethic may rapidly find that ""there's no money in this job!"" 

I'm curious if in countries without a tipping system the service you receive is any worse. Does the incentive system work as intended, or do waiters paid a flat rate bust just as much ass as those trying for a great tip?

My old group of friends and I used to meet every year at an upscale restaurant between Christmas and New Year's Eve. We splurged and caught up after not seeing each other for a year, but one of my buddies started a tradition there. The first time the waiter showed up at our table, he put $200 on the table in twenties and told the waiter that was their tip for our table. If they were any good. Each time they messed up, though, he'd take away one of those twenties. I thought for sure that'd piss off the waiter something fierce, but each and every year we got the best damned service we'd ever had. Beers were set down 1/3 full and a fresh one was set next to it, impeccable service all around. Six years of this before we all lost touch, a twenty was never taken away. 

All that said, this may just be coincidence, but the best waiters I've ever had have been gay men. I don't mean ""That dude might be gay,"" I mean ""*Heey* everyone, I'm *gaaaay*"" gay. I can literally name the four restaurants to this day that they worked at, the service was so freaking good.

Let's get some things straight. 

Who is most likely to use ""but she didn't say no"" as a defence against rape accusations? 

Is it the otherwise happily married husband or a sleazebag of the type we are discussing here, the kind that doesn't listen to women when they say no to a drink and deliberately try to get them drunk (how is this different from slipping them a roofie) *in order to get them drunk enough to not know what they are doing*? Let's not pretend we don't know this person's intentions here. Let's not pretend we're talking about stellar, shining examples of decent manhood here. 

So you tell me who's jumping to extremes. According to you we ought to be assuming only the absolute best intentions about these scumbags who are forcing drinks on an already drunk woman. And we cannot make them even one little bit responsible for whom they choose to have sex with - no, they're good to go unless told NO. 

I think they're not good to go unless enthusiastically told YES. Tell me why you disagree with that.

    10GB of storage? That's way more than enough!

    What more could you ask for from a free service?  
    I wouldn't ask for anything, cause that'd make me nervous!  
  
    Filevo is also really privacy aware  
    My email and IP address, they don't share!  
    Wiping IP logs day after day,  
    The FBI will never be able to send me away!  
  
    But what I really can't wait for is the torrent seedbox  
    It'll be automated seeding while I eat bagels with lox  
    All of my perfectly legal downloads will be sitting tight  
    So when I get home, I can download them at night!

Like a radar that would make a noise when you get close to a spy, it wouldnt pinpoint the spy exactly, just set off an alarm, the close you are to the spy, the louder the ringing.

I grew up in a primarily white working class neighborhood and we had a few housing projects (most of the people there were white).  My impression is that welfare, over the long haul, is kind of a bad thing, because it allows people to just accept the government ""handout"" in a demotivating way.  I don't have a great alternative but I think a program that offered more and better educational opportunities to disadvantaged people would be a lot better.

How did you feel about white people when you were growing up?  How has that changed (if it has) now that you're older?

What do you think can and should be done to improve the lives of poor black Americans?  

If you met two people, one who was black and came from an extremely wealthy background and one who was white and came from a background similar to yours, who do you think you'd relate to more easily?  I know, I know, it's a hypothetical situation, let's assume they're both friendly people.

I'm hanging around in Hollywood on Orange street just south of Hollywood Blvd by the parking garage just across from the Roosevelt hotel. Just then, a hot dog lady comes running around the corner with her partner pushing their tray loaded with hotdogs and grilled peppers. You know - its one of those carts on wheels with the burner underneath. They race into the garage and manage to lift the cart, still full of hotdogs, into a filthy dumpster and close the lid on it, then they run further in the garage.

Then I see whats up: a ""BID Patrol"" dude comes around tailing them. ""BID Patrol"" are the private security that are part of the Business Improvement District. They are a little more than your typical rent-a-cops: they have guns, and are sanctioned by the whole chamber of commerce to work through the whole area. In this case, they were obviously cracking down on unlicensed food vendors like the hotdog ladies. He seems to have lost her, though I see them peering out through the second level of the garage. He moves on and after a few minutes, they walk down, take the cart out of the dumptser, and go on their merry way.

You may also be able to pay local tuition rates at some universities in Europe (doesn't work in the UK, you have to be in residence for 3 years before you're eligible for local tuition rates).

"science","t5_mouw","I agree with the process, but I didn't agree at the time that it was the right approach to the problem. There are a couple of ways to view the problem. I was viewing it one way, resulting in a 1/2 probability, while many others were viewing it the same way you are, which results in 1/3. 

My argument was this: if we already know that one kid is a boy, then all we really are left to determine is the gender of the other kid, and it would be a 1/2 probability that it was a boy.

However, there is a different way to view the problem, demonstrated by the following matrix of options:

b : b

b : g

g : b

g : g

We know there aren't two girls, so we can eliminate that one. That leaves us with three options that include at least one boy. There is some disagreement about having two statements that are so similar (b:g and g:b). Some argue that those are the same result and should not be counted separately, which gets us back to 1/2.

It took me a bit but I can see why so many people are arguing for 1/3, but I can also understand why so many still go with 1/2.

I'm still not convinced that the day of birth is relevant even though I have seen the larger matrix that indicates that it is. It seems to be a red herring that causes us to go through additional permutations and calculations that perhaps are unnecessary.

I'm not going to bother doing this, but it would be interesting to see how the probabilities change if we use some other arbitrary data point instead of a Tuesday birth. What if one kid was born on a full moon? What if one was born on a leap year? What if one was a Taurus? What if one had brown hair?

I think that none of them matter, but as before, I'm more than willing to be shown to be wrong. And if I'm shown to be wrong, I will gladly admit it once I understand why. ","1277947954"

The US government is continuing to harp on the obesity thing here in America. I've always said it is a prelude to heavier, costlier taxes on foodstuffs, all forms of food. They bitched and bitched about the ills of alcohol and tobacco for years leading up to the huge tax increases. Now they're releasing study after study and story after story on the obesity epidemic, and they've already hinted at increasing taxes on soda and candy. The governments m.o. is the same, year in and year out. First they begin releasing stories to the press on studies that they have done and then the stories keep getting more and more dire until the stupid public is literally screaming for the government to do something. The public is so fucking stupid. ","1277947969"

So while there are certainly legitimate points of philosophical conflict there, I think what you're talking about is not a philosophical issue, just a sociological/anthropological one.

So when something is blurred in reality, you focus on it and it adjusts. When you look at a blurred picture, do you notice like a perspective change, like the picture is expanding? Is it just me? So i ask, does anyone know what the hell your brain does when you look at a blurred object that your eyes can't adjust to? In the context of a photo like this i mean, where something is the focus and the backround is blurred. Thanks. ","1277948025"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's considered harmful when asking any stranger. Many people just say that its harmful because that's what they were taught growing up. They really don't know anything about weed and what the side effects are. To many people who know about weed they think it's either harmful because it's a drug or harmless because it brings caution to one's self. I agree it should be legalized, but there should be restrictions. Weed has perception changes. But what many don't know is that it's a good change. It makes you more cautious and not so wild as for alcohol or other drugs. As far as cancer causes i'm not familiar with but i doubt since thousands use it and little are diagnosed with it. Unlike tobacco,where you can smoke it publicly, weed should have boundaries. First, no smoking in public because of the effects( you wouldn't want people all around you having no fucking idea where they are). Second, the age for drugs needs to be leveled up. Third, should be not using weed for extensive drug uses that bring harm. Other than that weed is alright. If i was in charge of it all, i would fight for banning tobacco and legalizing weed.

We used a Marzocco Linea for our shop, and even the replacement parts for the machine (which are also used in many of the high-end consumer machines) are very expensive. Even a simple O-ring or Gasket may cost $26 for a piece of round rubber, but it's because, as Crimson said, that many of these machines are highly specialized and need to be extremely accurate and durable, and are often hand-manufactured.

Another thing to note is that computers and other gadgets are produced on a very large scale compared to espresso machines. These gadgets are also often designed not to last more than half a decade; most computers you buy off the shelf may only do the jobs you need it to do for 6 or 7 years before it needs replacing.

Espresso machines are growing in popularity, but the niche for owning a personal machine is still very small, and many people don't demand as high quality as some of the machines produce. Therefore, the cost is very high.","1277948061"

I grow both in and out, and it really is not all that much room unless you decide to do a vertical grow.

Also, this would bring regulation to marijuana, which will mean only the really big boys will be able to grow commercial marijuana.  Guess what these guys do to cigarettes? they add chemicals on top of chemicals that create higher addiction rates and expose the user to even more dangerous poisons.

i like the concept, i would however you watch out for the following:

- horizon is not flat, seems to be slightly skewed to the right
- the exposure is quite high, you are losing a lot of detail on that tree in the shadows, you could be better off shooting in a lower exposure and adjusting contrast/brightness levels after
- the framing and structure of the piece can be improved, the building is  off centre, the other half of the tree is exposed but not in a good way, I would have shot half of that tree down the line, and tried to change my orientation to put the building 3/4 way in to the piece.
- shooting on days with more interesting sky can also add a lot more drama and interest to your pieces

McDonalds created the dollar menu in response to Wendy's dollar menu.  Wendy's has always offered there Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger and Jr. Deluxe Cheeseburger for a dollar. So in order to compete against that, McDonalds lowered the price of the double cheeseburger to a buck.  The price of a cheeseburger has not really changed in years, and for a while there, McDonalds was loosing money on the double cheesebuger.  So now (and look closely at the menu) you have the McDouble for a dollar (this has two beef patties and one slice of cheese) and the Double Cheeseburger (which has two beef patties and two slices of cheese) for $1.50 something.","1277948125"

http://www.haaretz.com/news/tony-blair-receives-israeli-prize-worth-1-million-1.270265

&gt;Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will be one of the three laureates of the Dan David Prize for 2009, awarded annually by Tel Aviv University.

&gt;Each of the laureates will receive a $1 million prize, 10 percent of which is contributed to 20 doctoral and post-doctoral scholarships.

&gt;Blair was selected to receive the prize in leadership for what the judges described as ""his exceptional leadership and steadfast determination in helping to engineer agreements and forge lasting solutions to areas in conflict."" 

Here's my take on it:
http://americangoy.blogspot.com/2009/04/tony-blair-paid-zionist-and-sarkozy.html


    Protected by the fake sinecure of Middle East envoy for the Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia), Blair operates largely from a small fortress in the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem, where he is an apologist for the US in the Middle East and Israel, a difficult task following the bloodbath in Gaza. To assist his mortgages, he recently received an Israeli “peace prize” worth $1m.



You see, Tony Blair, the neocon in the disguise of a Labour party apparatchik (""New Labour - it is not new, and it s not labour""), is doing what any good servant of the power that be does - he has a second career, a very, very well paid career, paid for by the people whose bidding he did while in office (for example, for bringing British soldiers' blood to further Israeli security goals).

He is a so called ""peace envoy"", supposedly trying to bring peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

He does most of his work from a luxury hotel - in fact, he never leaves the place (Why should he? It's not like he has a real job or anything).

And just to keep himself impartial, Tony Blair, has had no qualms accepting a 1 million dollar prize from Israel - while he tries to mediate between Israel and Palestine.

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; until both sides come down from an ""us vs them"" mentality

sorry, i have to rant on this point. I'll admit I've been skeptical about the integrity of the police for a long time. But whenever I came face to face with a cop I always approached with politeness and respect, to give them that initial benefit of doubt, even thought it was done cautiously.

However, the utter crap that we keep seeing as more and more videos pour in, topped with the crap icing that Blair keeps squirting out, is a mind boggling. Now combine that with the applause from the rest of the police force...that is, the cops who watched this crap (either in person or on TV or on the internet) and said ""that's good work boys"".

All of that screams out ""us vs them"". How can it not? How can any member of the police force entrap their fellow canadians, who are unarmed, who aren't doing anything wrong, and take them down...and beat them...and shoot them? And then pat themselves on the back saying the ends justified the means?

Where in all of that do we see steps taken to tear down the ""us vs them"" wall? I don't see it. Instead I see traitors like Blair building up that wall as high as he can.","1277948150"

The thing is, a healthy vagina is self-cleaning, and she should only have to do pretty basic washing up on the external parts to remove any accumulated lint, dried sweat and secretions, and yes sometimes dead skin... but some women aren't very diligent about that, especially if they only shower and don't bathe.","1277948151"

It's lightweight, easy to clean (just fill it with water and a scoop or two of oxyclean, wait a day), and shatterproof.  And while buckets are about the same for all practical reasons, I like being able to see my beer while it ferments.  And I feel like the shape makes it less prone to scratching than a bucket.  But then again, you can get a bucket with a spigot for much cheaper than a Better Bottle with a spigot, if you don't like racking.

The glass carboy is okay, but I'm very careful with it.  I hear all kinds of horror stories about stuff that can happen if they break and cut you.  Considering that they're more expensive, I will probably get another Better Bottle or a bucket if I want another fermenter.

Matt Serra did hit him on the temple (the real one, not the imaginary one behind the ear) several times during the last minute of the fight.  This doesn't mean GSP has a bad chin though, the temple is a vulnerable point on most everyone.  

The thing about ""chin"" is that there are more than one types of KO resistance.  KO's caused by the brain hitting the inside of the skull are resisted by stronger neck muscles (less head displacement when hit, weaker impact on brain), while KO's caused by compression of the temporal mandibular nerve bunch are resisted simply by having a less exposed nerve.  Serra never really hit him on the first three inches of the jaw with a power punch, where most nerve compression knockouts occur (the nerve bundle itself is farther up the jaw though, hitting that area moves the mandible in the opposite direction to pinch it), most of them were brain rattlers to the side of the head.

That fight only proved that GSP doesn't have *extraordinary* KO resistance of the first type.  In terms of general KO resistance it means that he's never going to be able to absorb punishment like Mark Hunt.  I think he learned that in the fight, and has become overly cautious because of it, but by no means does he have a ""bad chin"".","1277948205"

Compared to the rest of the developed world, food costs in America are insanely low.  We get a lot of food and we don't pay much for it.  Most Americans don't realize this and complain about tipping without realizing that anywhere else in the world they would pay that tip just to cover food costs alone.  To keep those food costs down, service employees are generally payed very low wages.

As for demand increasing, that's just simple supply and demand. Given that healthcare suddenly becomes more affordable, more of it will be purchased.

Quite frankly, I don't understand at all how having things like universal healthcare, and public options somehow reduces the deficit. If the government is trying to artificially lower the cost of healthcare by forcing insurance companies to provide insurance for everybody, then those insurance companies will be operating at a loss. Subsidies are typically how the government deals with that. Subsidies come from tax revenues, which are no longer used in paying off the deficit, but rather to bail out insurance companies.","1277948217"

I see you just made a comment about getting closer to your dealer than you really wanted to. Did the need for the drug made you less protective about your intimacy? I mean, did you just did it for the need of getting more substance or did you felt more open to have sexual relttionships with strangers?

$2 is cheap, but at least its a tip.  Yes, it could easily be 20% of the bill, but for what a delivery driver makes hourly and what they are doing to make your life easier, it isn't much at all.

Not really. But if you think about it strategically: Vermont has more access with Canada, which is good for tourism for both places. New Hampshire needed to be bottom-heavy in order to secure a small strip of coast (the smallest coastline of any sea-touching state). Vermont has also minimized its exposure to Massachusetts, thereby limiting its exposure to bad Massachusetts drivers. However because of this no place in Vermont can call itself part of the Boston Metro Area and therefore does not have as many opportunities as southern New Hampshire does, and the large border with mass also aids the economic interests of NH (read: people from mass coming to buy things from our state). Plus, our state [rock sculptures](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcbwalsh/3590101293/) are more stable.

Edit: The ninja cowl is actually a ski/snowboarding fleece one, not one of those thin ones.

There are also a few posts in the comments below the article where he comes off poorly as well.  Example: someone says there's a site where people make acoustic arrangements of his songs and posts them for free.  He said that it ""sucks"" and pisses him off.  It's not even his actual sheet music!

"politics","t5_2cneq","Uh oh, someone's been getting their talking points from Maddow and then not checking them  before repeating them on the internets.

Sorry, but unemployment compensation *does extend the average length of unemployment*. This is pretty simple logic. If I have x months of savings, then as I get closer and closer to month x of unemployment, I will broaden the scope of what jobs I am willing to take more and more, because I am approaching the point where I can no longer put food on the table. If unemployment extends my time from x to 2x by supplementing my savings, then this broadening of job search happens twice as slowly.

So, yes, UC is absolutely a disincentive to find work.

The counter-argument does not even dispute this. The counter-argument simply states that UC coffers are filled during the good times when consumer spending is high naturally, curbing the boom, and UC coffers are emptied during the bad times when consumer spending is low naturally, supplementing spending during the bust. Thus, it is a smoothing effect on the business cycle and theoretically could shorten the period of downturn and therefore the aggregate unemployment.","1277948302"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The POP games, Silent hills, and Resident evils are all same gameplay+same IP (the worst combination possible). For PoP and SH his problems stem from the fact that they are some of the worst examples of design-by-committee known to man, and... did he have any problems with RE as a series?

Actually, I don't care, I'm running with Resident Evil anyway. If you look at the first three games they were roughly the same, minus a few minor differences. The series always had it's fans, but from one game to the next it wasn't likely to gain any new ones. Then, all of a sudden, RE4 came out, and it was clearly a Resident Evil game, but it was also something completely different. I've never heard someone say they didn't like it. Unfortunately, as with most things that get super popular the people that make the most money wanted another one, so we got RE5, which, from what I hear, isn't a *bad* game, but a lot of people don't really like it, because it's the same as 4 (and before you try to correct me, you know what I mean, the core gameplay was mostly unchanged). This sort of thing happens all the time in the industry, and it sucks to watch.

Of course, most Nintendo games *don't* do this (even Zelda, but I'm not going into that because I get the feeling that you don't have much familiarity with the series as a whole). There were 3 main series 2d Metroids, then there were 3 main series FPS Metroids, and now there's a 2.5d Metroid coming out that's going to be different then either (and might be bad, can't tell yet). This is also huge because they *do* tell several interconnected stories. There were several 2D Marios, but excepting Mario 2jp each one was radically different then the last and each helped define (and invent) the 2d platformer genre. And Mario 2jp was terrible. Then Mario 64 came out and invented the 3d platforming genre, which was built on by Sunshine and Galaxy.

As for the side games, they are actually more *fun* with characters you know and love. I'm not saying there should be a Master Chief Kart, because that wouldn't work on account of the grimdark epic story. It works for Mario to be a kart racer, a doctor, an olympian, and a board game piece because of the lack of story *and that's how we like it*.

tl;dr: You are demonstrably wrong in every way, and I didn't even directly mention the fact that you seem to judge a game solely on story.
If you want to play the same game over and over again, there's going to be a new COD4:MW out every year until it stops making money for you to play. Again, and again, and again. As for me, I'll enjoy my varied, fun gameplay, stop trying to convince me I'm wrong.","1277948351"

Shortly after that, he found emails she'd written to her mother saying that ""Maybe if I leave him alone enough he'll go find someone else"". He started looking around and found emails she'd written to man she was seeing whenever she went out of town to visit her sister. She'd fallen in love with the other guy (who later dumped her saying ""Call me when the drama is over"", referring to her difficult divorce). So now she has no one, he's had to sell the house, etc...

Watch out.

Hmm, married six years...is the seven year itch coming up?

I can't understand why anyone would want to introduce a factor like this into their marriage, but to each his/her own. Personally, one reason I like being married is because I like the idea of it only being us forever. We've both had enough sex with previous partners before we were married.

We never had to look at eachother and it kept me sexually safe. 

I think HONESTY and understanding is key, because teenagers are teenagers and I thought I was on top of the world at 14. I would have gone back to unprotected sex without my mom's help. 

My sister was another story and wasn't trusted with condoms. My mom her put on the pill. While some people say this involvement encourages sex, NO. I would have STILL done it. My mom knew that as well and tried to make it as safe as possible for both my sister and myself.

I have seen VCs destroy companies by forcing assimilation (and spending) of too much capital in too short a period, but the entrepreneur is also culpable - after all, the CEO had to agree to it, but there are definite inequities at times.

Girls are just like guys, we all have the same emotions and wants and needs... this whole 'omfg girls are sluts if they give it up' in stark contrast to 'guys are awesome if they get it' mentality is so incredibly fucked up. The real deal is that you shouldn't wear your hear on your sleeve, if you're a guy and really into the girl and you have a 'one night stand' because she doesn't want a relationship it stings like all hell (or so has been my experience) in the same way as if a girl has one and he doesn't want a relationship.  From what I've seen if you're really actually into the other person you're best to wait a few days to see if they're into you too, girl or guy it doesn't matter at all, if you're not sure they want more (and you can't be if it's just one night) then wait until your sure...

It always seems insane, even if you understand the rule that if someone really likes you then they probably won't let it go too fast, when you have someone who you know pretty well and you're really into them and know they've had a couple of one night stands but for some reason they only fool around with you, or take all your time at a party but don't take hints however obvious that you want to do more... it's not necessarily that they don't like you, or that you're inferior compared to the other people they've gone all out in a night with, it's that they probably really like you and want to establish a relationship and not just have a fling with you.

I have no idea what the percentages of duchebags are per sex though, I've seen a couple of girls get burned a few weeks after they thought they where starting a relationship, and a ton more guys who thought the same thing but got the cold shoulder afterward, maybe it's because the guys where inadequate? maybe it's a consequence of shy reporting between genders? maybe it's just the composition of my social circles? all I know is people aren't always what they seem, if you want to have sex because they're hot, have sex, but if there's an additional want for an actual relationship then wait until you have a real relationship and then have sex.  And if someone cold shoulders you after building up a relationship to have sex, they're terrible people and your friends should quietly warn people that they're like that, they show interest over time just for the conquest...

TL;DR Both sexes are exactly the same, society has published stupid standards that don't apply as advertised, social interactions are not only complicated but unintuitive, and some people are just awful and should be shunned.

Dried_Apple, this works: [The Black Hole](http://www.amazon.com/Woodstream-Black-Hole-Rodent-Trap/dp/B0007O24US/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=home-garden&amp;qid=1277948200&amp;sr=8-1).

I should know, I just killed my fourth gopher in two months today. I too thought I had ""a gopher."" Yeah, no. Every time I kill one, it takes a week or two, but another one comes. Four now. All monsters. 

It has all now got me wondering, not ""how do I control them?"" - I got that shit down pat. These things usually have a dead gopher in them within 24 hours (though one took nearly a week). Now my question is: where does this end? How many have to die horribly before they either get the hint or their colony collapses? Is there any hope for an end, or am I just stuck fishing dead gophers out of the ground in perpetuity?

Anyway, hope this helps.

EDIT: I notice the other traps were mentioned, I went with the more expensive Black Hole because it provides a visual cue when it has been tripped. The spring pops up out of the ground and when you see it you're like ""whoa. got one."" The spring also serves as a handle to pull the trap out and you don't have to touch the little beasties to extract them. I'm sure the other traps work just as well, but I can vouch that the Black Hole makes owning these little bastards fairly convenient. You dig out around the mound you'll find the hole fairly easily, set the Black Hole so that its mouth naturally is an extension of the hole, cover with just enough dirt so that no light can get in and wait.","1277948443"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Yeah - and they still have day jobs. Granted, they are self-employed, but they do all the work that a record label normally does. I think most bands should operate this way, if they feel they have something to say. It's the only way you can keep control of what is going on.

The only problem I have is when the downloading culture *affects* bands *like* Fugazi. They are definitely frugal men who are just making sure things basically pay for themselves, and not looking to get rich quick - but what happens when people stop buying their CDs at all? They would have to fold the label, get day jobs, and do what they do on a much much smaller scale. That's the real danger here, is marginalizing artists, instead of supporting them. 

I'm not even in support of copyright protection, but there has to be in place a way for artists to pay for basic living costs if we ever expect to have the arts flourishing. Fugazi is a very unique case that has had a lot of impact not just musically, but culturally.","1277948453"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred pushups, but take it from this old gym rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

Push-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (chest, back, abdomen, legs, shoulders and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good gym, with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.","1277948468"

We are finding plenty to disrupt.

The first couple of projects are a content distribution system that implements (among other things) ""giving money to artists directly"", as often desired on Reddit, and an engineering concern. We also have some ideas in the fields of catering, transport, energy, property development, banking, publishing, web development, HVAC and hydroponics—of varying detail and capital-intensity, of course, but it's nice to have a good range of source ideas.

The capital will eventually come from selling shares by public subscription (hopefully some redditors will buy a few shares?) and, in the mean time, we are looking for angel or VC investment.","1277948502"

Your regulation argument/analogy is flimsy. The PC evolved because of ardent competition. You would have to compare to chip manufacturers. Why haven't you seen more entrants into the CPU/GPU production arena? The intellectual property costs, alone, would be staggering. Then you have to create a fab factory in the east?

There's just few enough options while still some semblance of competition to keep Moore's law moving forward. Intel would cut way back on R&amp;D if they could milk Pentium 4's. 

There's also Word 2010 and Windows 7 which require the hardware advances.

Let's not forget, those max MPG limits are there for good... what MPG checks and limits are written as max??? Are you describing consumer manipulation policies which had perverse incentives or regulations limiting the usefulness of cars? Agreed on the former, disagree on the latter.

The steep costs are NOT due to regulations. Seat belt design is cheap. Going from 0 cars to lots of cars profitably and competitively would cost a lot in terms of design, resources, training, staff, etc. The regulations are merely icing on the cake. Plenty of hand-made shops sell small quantities of niche market cars to rich wackos.

Ryan was in the first two months of my Americorps program. He was a really pleasant guy; claimed to be trying out for the local firefighters, outgoing with people, etc. He was a bit husky and didn't seem to eat very well or be keen on practicing regular exercise, but these things didn't strike me as anything near major warning signs.

So, Ryan is taking a lot of sick days. That's fine; we're allotted a good few for our term, and this is nothing out of the ordinary.

Ryan breaks his ankle, goes over his allotted sick and absent days, and begins racking up hours that he will need in order to complete his Americorps term of service.

Ryan's dad has a heart attack. Everyone hears about it; everyone consoles. Our staff is being extremely lenient with him, because that just fucking sucks for anyone. Ryan takes more than a solid week off work.

Ryan's dad dies. He comes to work a few days after I hear the news. (this means about a week after everyone else heard the news, because I just don't hear about things) He's red in the face, eyes welling up; he looks like his dad's dead and he's attempting to go back to work.


Our staff calls his home (because he grew up in the same town), purely to offer their condolences and reassure his mother that he'd not be disadvantaged because of this and that they'd help in any way they could.

Ryan's dad answers the phone.

Ryan's apparently been drinking cough syrup. Like, several bottles a day of cough syrup. Like, he drinks cough syrup and that's what he does, and has done, for FSM-knows-how-long.

Ryan FBDB, Ryan FatBoy Douchebag. He's still in my phone's contact list. 


Call me callous for not attempting to help someone who clearly takes advantage of people in astoundingly inappropriate ways, but I have people that I care about who occupy a good amount of my time already, and I'm not looking to take on any such fucked case as that.

Even if he does stick with the church, he'll probably be more open-minded about alternate perspectives.

I think it's disarming and it helps set people around me at ease, with the exception of some trans people who get their short hairs up in a bunch over it  (this makes me want to say it even more btw).

I take serious issue with the author's tone.  I'm not a big fan of righteous indignation unless there is ample cause for it.  I disagree with her assertion that people misgendering us is in some way a purposeful lack of respect.  It may be the case, but when it is you can usually pick up other signals that tell that you are deliberately being insulted.  I can count on one hand the number of times that has happened to me (with digits to spare).  Getting bent with people over it may solve the misgendering issue, but it will have another undesirable side effect.  You'll make people around you very uncomfortable *being* around you.

Example, recently one of my doctors who I'd recently come out to started calling me by my new name, but at the same time referred to me as ""he"".  I let her get away with it a few times and then asked *very nicely* if she could make an effort to stop.  I went out of my way to express to her what it did to me emotionally to hear it, and how embarrassing it was to have others hear it.  She apologized profusely and thanked me for pointing it out, and said that she was truly unaware that she was even doing it.

Had I started with the assumption that she was in some way deliberately attempting to invalidate me, the outcome might not have been so positive.  In general people are too uptight about things they needn't be so uptight about and no good ever comes of it.","1277948623"

So. While yes it is perfectly acceptable for cows to get treatment for various things from time to time... It's the six months on the feed lots I'm talking about.  They can be fed up to 90% corn to fatten them up quick, which destroys their normal pH. The produce way too much acid from all the starch.  ALso.. Corn today is NOT what it used to be. The nutritional content from industrial corn is pretty terrible. It's been genetically engineered to grow all freaky and huge by producing basically all starch and no Germ.

""formulated by a professional nutritionist""... sure sometimes… but animal feed manufacturers and some ranchers could care less about health and more about weight.. They would feed ground up dead livestock or euthanized dogs and cats or other awesomeness if it produced more weight gain.. Oh actually they have done just that. it's called Rendering.. and that's been around for a long time too. grinding up everything from human garbage to roadkill.

Obviously most are legit healthy operations. but the all corn diet is NOT healthy and  feeding them that DOES require additional antibiotics to keep them healthy… and in that case ""over-medication"" is justifiable $$ because the cows fatten up that much faster.","1277948706"

They also allow employees to bring dogs to work because the 2nd and 3rd employees after Bezos insisted on having their dog, so now its supposed to be a culture thing.

The desks are not as large as an actual door though, and too big to be some door cut in half. I would say mine is about ~5 ft x ~3.5ft but I'm not great at estimating.

In theory, it's simple to fix this -- just make the window float. It's still annoying though, and moreover in some applications having their window grown then shrunk back down again isn't a no-op and leaves some panes in the window improperly sized. Rhythmbox for example I recall didn't properly restore the width of the side pane when you grew then reshrunk its window.

Second, the economy in the region is dependent almost entirely on fishing, subsistence farming (which means the islands barely grow enough food to feed their own people), and handouts (foreign aid) from countries like Australia and the U.S.A.  Tourism has been pretty much of a bust, mostly because of the remoteness of the habitable islands -- the four main ones in the Federated States of Micronesia, an independent country, are Yap, Truk, Ponape, and Husaie -- and a resulting lack of decent hotels and other amenities.

My main point was that it was one million *in London* rather than the UK as a whole.

When I said that it didn't do a lot of good, I more meant that it didn't serve its primary purpose- preventing the war.  Blair still went against the wishes of the people, acting more like a president than a prime minister.  That's not to say it was totally pointless; it was a proud moment for the nation, in my opinion, but I wouldn't say it ended Blair's political career.  I would say the lack of WMDs and his use of ill-informed intelligence to sway the public and parliament was more responsible for that.

In Europe, for instance, a service charge is usually mandatory, and a small token may be given for exemplary service.  Even in the United States, most restaurants charge a mandatory service charge of 15-20% for groups of six or more, since large groups often stiff the waiter out of a good tip.

In this case I think everyone has done social networks well enough that there is no room for phone that only does social networking, not for wide commercial success anyway which is what they were going for.  Maybe someone will prove me wrong, but it won't be Microsoft.    

Think of all the devices from the past which used that philosophy that aren't around anymore because of the PC.  The PC did the stuff well enough, or in some cases better so no one saw value in the single use device, at least not enough value to sustain the cost of production.  Is someone going to come out with a word processing device which kills MS Word?  Is someone going to release a new wall calendar which causes Outlook and iCal users to change their workflow?  Not unless that thing is an LED display and syncing with their calendar of choice... and even then if you had something like the iPad that mounted to the wall which could also play music and give the weather, it would sell better.       

So yeah, it is a great design philosophy if done well... with the right kind of product.  For instance, those people who want a cell phone that is just a phone. (generally those are old people)

Wikipedia's entry on the prognosis of esophageal cancer:

&gt; In general, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is quite poor, because so many patients present with advanced disease: The overall five-year survival rate (5YSR) is less than 5%. Individualized prognosis depends largely on stage. Those with cancer restricted entirely to the esophageal mucosa have about an 80% 5YSR, but submucosal involvement brings this down to less than 50%. Extension into the muscularis propria (muscular layer of the esophageus) has meant a 20% 5YSR and extension to the structures adjacent to the esophagus results in a 7% 5YSR. Patients with distant metastases (who are not candidates for curative surgery) have a less than 3% 5YSR.","1277948973"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hello Mrs Escondida, as a 20-year-old, very sexually active male, who may or may not have been 'that douche', heres my advice to you;

Make sure you let your daughter know that sex is normal, and that its an great part of life. Let her know you support her but you want her to be safe. 

Get her on birth control. As was mentioned earlier, make sure she doesn't let guys know she is on it, to be safe. Though, I will say, many times girls on the pill, were the ones offering me unprotected sex.

Make sure she understands the seriousness of sexually transmitted infections, especially the scary stuff, like HIV.

Get her condoms. Don;t make it awkward, just get some for her to keep in her purse. You'll be surprised how many boys are NOT prepared. Make sure she is.

Once this is done, STOP BOTHERING HER. Don;t bring it up. Don;t talk about sex. You're only going to make things worse. When she goes out, say something like ""You're a smart girl and I love you"" instead of ""Be safe! or Don't do anything stupid"". Reinforce positive behaviour, don't insinuate shes going to do something bad. Trust me on this.

Thats all I have for you.
For your own peace of mind all I can offer you is this;
Your daughter is going to fuck boys, no matter what. You did, and she will, the cycle of life goes on. As long as you did your job to teach her to make smart choices, you have nothing else to worry about. 

We all go through this.
Good luck.","1277948982"

One example that leaps out at me involved an old girlfriend I had who was doing her doctoral work at MIT. She did types of math that I couldn't even remotely grasp. She built computational modeling frameworks that boggled my mind. One night she was struggling with her work in a statistics class. She was complaining about one particular problem that she said made no sense. It involved a graph of a type I'd never seen before that showed causal relationships between events. She explained the problem to me, and within about 15 seconds I *saw* that one of the dimensions was time, and that you were constrained to only moving forward, while she was trying to relate events along arbitrary vectors. I told her what the solution was given the constraint, and she didn't believe me. She didn't even believe that I could possibly understand it at all without formal training. She was surprised when she found out I'd been right.

Anyhoo. There were lots of things that she could do that I couldn't. However she couldn't write fiction like I could, she couldn't diagnose mechanical problems like I could, she couldn't parallel park like I could, and for whatever reason, she couldn't see something in a statistics problem that had leaped out at me.

There are different types of intelligences, even when considering strictly intellectual, analytical concerns. So yeah, a ""less intelligent"" person can be capable of seeing that someone else has abilities that they do not.","1277949011"

Overall, I don't think the effect of the panning is quite strong enough.  Maybe if you were further away, or had a wider shot, this angle may work in a star-trek, warp-speed sort of way, but from so close the eye isn't really given much time for the movement it wants.

I guess I could get a band together with the intention of playing this album, but that's not really that feasible with where I am in my life right now.

You're right, though. Just as a (moderately?) interesting aside, I've sold close to 400 albums through bandcamp, but the torrent has been downloaded more than 10,000 times. That's digital music on the internet, I'm not bitter...I'm glad that a lot of people have heard my music, but my life would be easier if the ratio was a bit better, as I happen to be out of work right now etc etc...

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I always tip, however the amount will vary.

I always get a shampoo after my haircut, because I prefer to get the majority of the newly loosened hairs off my head so they don't fall down my collar for the rest of the day. I also **love** to have my head massaged. It is one of only two places on my body where I actually appreciate contact from other humans, and since my wife didn't really seem to think that a head massage from her is similar to a back massage from me, it's a little monthly treat from me.

This means my haircut, is generally $20 after shampoo. I will usually tip $5 on top of that, however I have done as much as $15.

I will tip more based on the stylist not making constant blabber at me. I will make small talk, however I hate the verbal diarrhea that some stylists have. (As Michael Ian Black has said, just because you're touching my head doesn't mean we need to talk.) 

In college, there was a place in town (Lawrence, KS) that had some pretty good stylists, but had shampoo girls who were smoking hot. I would rather spend money there than any strip club. I make sure that I keep my eyes wide open while they're shampooing, keeping direct, unblinking eye contact so that they know we're making a connection. ","1277949062"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Could you expand on ""adopt an extremely high christology""?

Christologies, or the general theories of how Jesus as a person relates to the Godhead, vary pretty greatly within the New Testament. Matthew and Mark make Jesus out to be a special person, but certainly not God on earth, while Paul makes Jesus out to be a human being who was transformed by his resurrection into part of God's heavenly order. Hebrews is sort of between their two viewpoints, and then John comes in and says Jesus was pre-existent to creation and is the physical embodiment of the divine Logos. It seems to me that adopting the high end of these Christologies causes us to have to 1. abandon a lot of the Old Testament, and/or 2. Ignore or come to some really tricky interpretations of many parts of the New Testament. Neither of these seems very satisfactory to me in terms of creating a framework for a systemic theology.","1277949138"

"politics","t5_2cneq","My Uncle is staunchly Republican.  I have been studying him for a couple years now.  My conclusion:  

1.  Republicans live in a ""black &amp; white"" world.  That is to say, things are either right or wrong.  There is no middle-ground.  (And they are never wrong.)  They are, in effect, extremists.

2.  Republicans seem to often have a difficult time thinking long-term.  They are the ultimate ""instant gratification"" consumers.

3.  Republicans base many of their decisions on fear of the unknown.  (i.e., I don't know if this person will be cool with me tomorrow, so I better kill him today.)

4.  Republicans, by nature, resist change.  (For example, Republicans would rather nurture the notion that we live in a dog-eat-dog world than try to change it.)

5.  Republicans engage in doublethink at least once per discussion (and believe that the word ""hypocrisy"" is just a word used by liberals out of desperation).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublethink

I think that the above 5 points pretty-well sums-up a stereo-typical Republican living in 21st Century America.

A system where an organization can forcefully sell your house behind your back for a pittance sum? The only difference between the HOA and the Mafia is that the HOA isn't breaking the law, but the law is hardly just, no matter how few bills you pay, how dare someone just sell your house for you in such a manner without informing you (I don't care if they can't contact you, they shouldn't be selling your property, it's not theres) and also selling it for so little, then the mysterious buyer simply resells it for a massive profit.

Doesn't that sound the least bit fishy and unjust?

&gt;I clearly remember getting shot down by many many Redditors and being told that government needs to stay out of private contracts... great, stay the fuck out of this one too.

Fun fact: The government has made it legal for the HOA to be able to foreclose on peoples houses without a judicial process, the HOA lobbied for that right. So believe it or not but the government is in on this private contract, otherwise it would be illegal for someone to give you a contract which involves you potentially losing your home without due process.","1277949164"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The physical act of sex is controlled by two separate and diametrically opposed nervous systems. The sympathetic system (think fight or flight) controls the actual ejaculation. But the parasympathetic system (relax, rest, digest) controls erection. This can be remembered with the mnemonic ""**P**oint and **S**hoot"" (**P**arasympathetic and **S**ympathetic). Take-home message: being nervous about sex activates your sympathetic system and dampens your parasympathetic system, making it very difficult to achieve an erection. The solution is to relax. Of course, that's easier said than done. When you're trying to get it up, that can be a bit like trying not to think about polar bears. Instead of NOT thinking about how you aren't hard (which is damn near impossible), REPLACE those thoughts with thoughts about how hot the girls are, or concentrating on how good things feel.

Two more points: Your definition includes all games. Including scrabble, basketball, tiddly winks, etc. Are these art?

Second, I think the video games have _the potential_ to be art. I just don't think any have made it there yet. Portal might come close, but I still don't think so. 

Related to that idea, I don't think that anything created within an ""art"" medium should be considered art. In other words, I think many paintings are art, but not all of them. I think few movies are art, but certainly not most of them.

Frankly, I don't really want video games to aspire to art status. When I want art, I'll go to a book or music. When I want satisfying, well, gaming, I'll turn to video games.","1277949213"

Still, most Americans deny that it's important.  It's not *them* being affected.  It's somebody else dying, somebody else screaming in agony, somebody else falsely accused, somebody else caught in the net of paranoid zealotry that characterizes everyone as a potential threat.","1277949216"
"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm a small 'L' libertarian. I don't belong to the party because I'm more of an free market classical liberal. But the vast majority of Libertarians wouldn't want to outright abolish the public schools, that would be chaotic and unproductive. There needs to be a program put in place to increase competition and drive down costs with vouchers or dollar for dollar tax deductions for private schools, and home schooling. 

Same goes for health care, instead of mandating people purchase approved insurance, allow people to put aside their own money in a dollar for dollar tax deductible medical savings account. Then they could freely use their own money to pay for the care they need.

This would decrease the size of government, save private wealth, and increase freedom. I'm in favor of giving people the equitable private option, this includes everything from education, and money.

And for the record I think anyone would have a hard time arguing that public schools, overall, have been a major success and are actually improving proportionately to the budget increases they've seen.","1277949216"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Yes, and exactly the problem with most anti-piracy organizations.  I highly doubt when they generate their numbers (because it won't look as good) that they count people in who actually download first, then go pay after if the movie is any good.  Nor do I think they give a shit that people may download movies because they just can't afford otherwise (then they turn around, get a judgement against them, and bury them further in debt, or worse, have them jailed for contempt when they can't pay).

I think the warez scene is actually doing more good than harm.  It appears that many musicians see the harm that is being done by suing their fans on their behalf, and maybe Hollywood's bigscreen folks will start to change how they distribute and charge for their work.  I know, many of these guys work hard as hell to produce things such as them highly detailed Pixar movies, but rather than sue people for nothing more than being fans of something, they could work out a way to get their money from the movie while keeping people happy.

Same goes for that new company, sending out the letters and demanding an immediate payment.  They are doing nothing more than finding an issue in society that could be highly profitable by them, and using what they know to do so.  Rather, why not act honestly and request people caught downloading to pay the full price of what the movie is worth?

I can respect scene members, they are helping push for change and risking quite a lot.

Oh, and I do have one more question, that *maybe* you would have some sort of knowledge about.  As I understand it, you guys get the material first, other members work on figuring how to generate keys that will pass, etc.  I always wondered how exactly, after being raided they could say for sure you are guilty of distributing said material?

I always figured that once the files sit on a private server, after being distributed, that the group would change the files to have different traceable or identifiable evidence.  For example, trying to pin a group or members down with distributing Photoshop CS5, they have information about those files that should match up across all that have downloaded.  But if the group turns and changes those files, say now they have different sizes, signatures or whatever else, how can they say that this group distributed those files and they aren't just programs or whatever that have actually been purchased that now just sit on a server untouched?

This may seem like a dumb question, I haven't been into the scene before and don't know exactly what goes on there :D","1277949217"

But you've to be careful when purchasing warm tub from the web since it might sell poor high quality warm tub or offers no warranty difficulties or spare parts. When searching for inexpensive warm tubs in the web, make certain that the dealer that you visit is the part of BISHTA (British and Irish Spa and Warm Tub Association). This is really a warm tub association which gives top priority towards the satisfaction and warranty towards the clients.



At present, numerous warm tubs are provided using the luxury additional items for example television and sound system built in. These, of course, will charge you higher cost. But should you don't require the luxury additional accessories, you still can discover other inexpensive warm tubs. The inexpensive warm tubs don't mean that they've no great high quality, but simply because they don't have the luxury accessories with them.



One thing that makes a warm tub costly is really the time and cost of manufacturing the shell. Numerous of them are created of acrylic and fiberglass. But, you will find now inexpensive warm tubs created of other materials. Even though these warm tubs are less expensive, they still provided using the same high quality parts as the costly makers put in their warm tubs.



Inexpensive warm tubs can work well as they've great insulation. If they're well insulated, they are able to keep the warmth of the water. This will save your cash as they could be much more efficient in utilizing the electricity power to heat the water. A ideal time to obtain inexpensive warm tubs is during the sales.

The french equivalent to James Bond is “San-Antonio”. He’s a secret agent (sometimes) and has a penchant for women too, and his adventures often have science-fictionish overtones where a mad scientist threatens the planet.

Instead of a few dozen James Bonds, though, there are hundreds of San-Antonio title, and I have read many of them. 

A constant is that, no matter how outlandish the stories are, there is always a **logical** explanation. So you can guess what was my reaction when a story had a haunted house with a ghost. I was scared shitless (even though I had read Lovecraft as a kid and did not find it scary).

The explanation was, albeit hairy, very logical:

"environment","t5_2qh1n","&gt;Just how are you considering that depth?

I appreciate your question. This is complicated to get across as I am just starting to consider and understand this aspect of the extent of the oil spill impact. 

I am not trying to say the volume in this depth of the ocean is multiplied or equal by the surface area, but what I am understanding is that the entire surface and sub surface ecosystem is more complex and connected in a greater way than if an equal land surface was contaminated. For example a Sperm Whale may hunt squid at 2,000 feet below the surface, and the squid may be dependent on other creatures that live at a greater depth. I don't know the science and creatures involved, but they are not all at the surface region. 

&gt;The math can't assume that you have primary productivity occurring equally at all depths, as they pretty much reside near the surface where the light is.

Yes. But the biosphere on the bottom of the sea bed can be connected to the food chain all the way to the surface, even if at minute parts. If a oil spill happens on farm land the chemical damage is contained to mostly the surface ecosystem. Even if the oil were to seep 20 feet into the ground, on land there are rarely situations where this ecosystem below this level would impact the viability of the surface life. (exceptions are water table and run off of toxins). 

I am also not saying that a spill on land cannot be far reaching in its toxic reach, it just seems that the scale on surface and sub surface damage would be greater than just considering the surface area. We also have to consider the marshes, rivers and their estuaries as part of the affected damage zone that make the ecosystem of the Gulf possible.

You are right, the total area damaged may not be as big as I am picturing, but it is immense, and it is going to take a really long time to grasp how much of this food biosphere has been compromised.

It will be telling when the ocean food industry begins compiling their lost catches and harvests, and this really concerns me.

Buy bassinet, crib, clothes etc. Are you nursing? Stock up on nursing items. If bottle-feeding stock up there. See, it's easy!
Oh buying diapers on the way home from the hospital is no bueno. Buy those ahead of time.

My last and most important piece of advice is to make a birth plan and stick to it. Inform yourself (or partner) as much as possible and make out a plan on paper and tell the doctor before you're due. It is such a shame in this country that women are woefully undereducated about labor and birth! Most women have c-sections or unpleasant experiences. Don't let yourself be another one! Do you want the doctor to use a vacuum or forceps? No? Yes? I told the doctor I would kick him if he came near me with them. He didn't even try to use them. Make your rules and be stern. If you can't make decisions at the time of birth make sure your partner or doula or whoever knows the plan and has a spine.

Without a belief in God, the idea that the Gospels are divinely inspired collapses.  Therefore, the Gospel accounts are understood to be the written stories of human beings, with their own agendas and biases.  Through the lens of atheism, many elements of the Gospel accounts can then be taken as either metaphorical, allegorical, or added by the authors to promote their own cause.

Of course, Lewis's trilemma is an instance of the false dilemma fallacy, as many philosophers and Christian theologians have noted.  There are other possibilities than Lewis allows, such as the one I mention above.","1277949330"

"programming","t5_2fwo","We haven't been holding moores law for a few years now though (~4-7). I am *not* just talking about the clock speed, but the IPC. After about the Athlon 64/Pentium M era IPC improvements have been minimal, at *best* doubling since 2004 or so. So since 2004 we have increased IPC by 2x and clock speeds by about 2x, both of those are being *very* generous too as it's probably much closer to 1.5x.

If you count piling on more cores as doubling performance then sure you could say we have kept up, but the biggest reason we started doing that is *because* we can no longer double the performance of a processor. Adding more cores results in more power, sure, but unlike in the past it does not scale linearly and the more cores you add the more this holds true. We are already starting to reach a limit to the number of cores we can fit too.

Where I do disagree with MarshallBanana is that I think this is a temporary setback, we are not at all reaching the end of speed improvements, but we may be set back for awhile. Eventually something huge will come by. There are already many technologies in the works, but it's way too early to tell which, if any, are going to be viable at this point.","1277949344"

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt;It doesn't, but the IAEA, which led the Chernobyl Forum, does.

The IAEA is a United Nations suborganization, not an industry group.

&gt;If that's your measure of validity, then why refer to an anti-coal activist report when looking at the impacts of coal power?

Because it is consistent with the WHO report.

&gt;A minimum of 40kBq was enough to cause 5000 premature deaths among a population of 6 million.

Cite.

&gt;That's a global figure. It's in fact much lower than your estimate of 11.5 million, especially when you consider that the attribution to coal burning is only a fraction of the WHO's 2 million.

You didn't read what I wrote. I said the 11.5 million was a cumulative number over 24 years. The WHO's 2 million number was yearly, so it is 48 million over 24 years.

&gt;You still haven't addressed the issue of how to make a like for like comparison of the differences in harm from each industry to validate your claim that deaths from Chernobyl are 'statistical noise'.

Well, let's see. Even if Chernobyl killed the worst case scenario from the TORCH study (60k), over 24 years of no other accidents in nuclear and comparing that to the WHO's number over 24 years (48 million), the nuclear deaths were 0.125% of the air pollution deaths (which most are from burning fossil fuels, as the WHO said, and coal is by far the most harmful type of fossil fuel pollution due to sulfur emissions and other particulates). Since the 48 million is an estimate with probably at least with a +/- 5% error, the error in the 48 million is 2.4 million, so Chernobyl (in the absolute worst case scenario) is technically statistically noise compared to air pollution.

In the more likely case in which Chernobyl killed about 4,000 people, that is 0.0083% of the estimated 24 year death toll of air pollution. And I'm being very generous because fossil fuels killed people way before Chernobyl and will continue to kill people well into the future (in which no more Chernobyl-like incidents are likely).

&gt;One thing you haven't considered so far is the health impacts of mining the fuel and disposing of the waste

Please cite one example of nuclear waste from a power reactor killing someone.

As for mining, we don't need to do mining at all if we adopt a regime of reprocessing and breeder reactors.

According to the This [pile of depleted uranium in Kentucky](http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq18.cfm) can power the US for centuries...

""Use of depleted uranium in advanced reactor fuel cycles, most notably in a future generation of fast breeder reactors, was one of DOE's original reasons for continuing to store the material. In advanced reactor fuel cycles, the depleted uranium inventory could represent hundreds of years of electrical power at the current U.S. consumption rate.""

Source: http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq26.cfm

Using breeders and other advanced nuclear technology can also essentially eliminate the long term parts of nuclear waste...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste#Transmutation

&gt;And yes, the possibility of future climate change should also be in the mix. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think it's as obviously one-sided as you're trying to make it out to be.

Fossil fuels emit CO2 and nuclear does not. The people that claim nuclear emits CO2 during its lifecycle are assuming that the rest of the infrastructure is fossil fuel based, which does not have to be the case in the future.

&gt;I'm just trying to get you to remove your blinkers and get some perspective.

By blinkers, I'm assuming you mean blinders. And they are off. I've studied the issue from all sides and have made a conclusion based on the evidence. Coal and other fossil fuels are not going to last forever and are absolutely horrible for both humans and the environment (as well as a major cause of war in oil's case). Renewable energy is not energy dense enough or technologically ready (e.g. the need for grid energy storage) to replace fossil fuels. And nuclear, although it is complex, has absolutely massive amounts of energy available on Earth in the form of depleted uranium and thorium, and almost all of the issues associated have technological solutions (e.g. transmutation of waste, new reactor designs that run at ambient pressure to prevent steam explosions like Chernobyl, etc.). Overall, nuclear is by far the best choice for a high-energy, high-standard of living industrial society.","1277949371"

I had to pass the occasional truck by going into the oncoming lane, but for one of them I misjudged the distance between the next oncoming car and how long it would take me to pass the truck. As I was passing the truck, another big semi was bearing down on me going the other direction, and instead of doing what any sane person would do (brake and duck back behind the truck I was passing into my lane), I simply pressed harder on the gas pedal. Brilliant. If the oncoming semi driver hadn't been paying attention (he braked and swerved onto the rather small shoulder) I would've been toast. It was a near miss even with his evasion.

This is a short article describing how an imho, brilliant economist, fought the idea of the Bretton-Woods since its conception.

He explained in his [book](http://mises.org/store/From-Bretton-Woods-to-World-Inflation-P571.aspx) (oh, and he was a brilliant writer, btw) *He closely covered the Keynesian-inspired Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944, He wrote that the attempt to fix exchange rates and peg world currencies to the dollar which in turn was fixed to gold would not and could not last.*

*Hazlitt saw that this was not a real gold standard but a complete fake. It did not offer convertibility in a manner that would instill monetary discipline. It trusted governments to maintain a sound money policy with no means of guaranteeing that they would do so. He said, then, that this was not a viable system, and predicted its complete breakdown in time.*

*Instead, he urged that every country be responsible for the soundness of its own currency. Only that system would produce stability of over time.*

*He said that the result of trusting governments and tying their fates together would be inflation and the collapse of what remained of sound money.*","1277949424"

What is important is they have a good relationship and are both normal well adjusted people.

 My girlfriend has no negative issues with sex or relationships in any way because of it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a few rules about tipping.  They can be summed up as follows:

1)  Tip what you can afford.  10% is the lowest *base amount* for restaurant service and 5% is the lowest *base amount* for delivery.

2)  Feel free to add or subtract 1% each time something pisses you off or pleases you.  So, if the delivery was super quick, add 5%.  If the waitress flirts, explains the meal to you, fills your water glass, and engages you in desired conversation, another 5-10% is warranted. 

3)  Complaining about the amount of a tip *instantly* gets the tip revoked.  It is a gift.  If they don't like the size of the gift, this means that the gift was rejected, and I can rescind it.  However, if the person politely asks ""was there something I did wrong?  I noticed that you left a small tip"" I might explain why I left a small tip...

the difference is that the fast food restaurants buy it on the cheap as concentrated sugar water and dilute it for much greater profit over many servings. that's all i meant.

I cannot gush enough about how fantastic this thing is. It's like having mini-superpowers.

Allow me to anecdote you:

When I first got mine, I had to commute from New Jersey to Manhattan, which is like going from a smelly part of hell, through a hell tunnel, into a crowded part of hell.

I was waiting for a train. An Asian woman was talking loudly in another language. It was a grating, hateful sound early on a cold morning. There was an older couple near the woman and me. They looked annoyed, as if they didn't want to spend what remaining time they had left on this earth listening to this woman shred the air around her into little tiny bits of spittle and high pitched sound.

So I reached into my pocket and *click* the button. Electromagnetic magic raced around me, creating a protective shell of fuck your phone call. Her call was cut off. She was quiet.

The old man looked at his old wife and said to her ""But what happened to that wonderful sound?"" because he had learned sarcasm at some point in his life.

I was all like ""you're welcome, citizen"" in my head, because I didn't want to give away my secret identity.

This scenario, with the cast changed, repeated in various settings throughout the time I had to keep doing that commute. Invariably, when I forgot to charge the jammer, someone would remind me why I needed it.

&gt;1: Widening credit spreads: Hussman says this is already occurring.

&gt;2: Moderate or flat yield curve: “Virtually any decline” in the 10-year Treasury yield  will make this occur, Hussman says.

&gt;3: Falling stock prices: This, of course, has occurred in recent weeks.

&gt;4: Moderating ISM and employment growth: The measures Hussman uses for employment growth are moderating;  the ISM growth is not.

&gt;“For all intents and purposes, unless the credit spreads, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY), or the yield curve reverse, a further decline in the Purchasing Managers Index to 54 or below would be sufficient to confirm a ‘double-dip recession’,” writes Hussman. “Note that by itself, such a level might not be particularly troublesome.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","That's perhaps too short, in my opinion, for you, especially at the place you're at.

I'm not saying that every sex session has to last hours. However, I think that for right now, your regular 15-30 minute sessions should not focus too much on you cumming (they probably don't, unless they turn into hour-long ones like you said).

Here's what I'm trying to say: it might be beneficial for you and your partner to set aside half a day or so to just relax together and be sensual - for there to be a timeless element to you being together. That way, you both can try to get you to cum, but if it doesn't happen after some time you are under no pressure or frustration... cause you can stop, relax, talk, cuddle... and then get into it again later.

I often have trouble getting off. I feel that I've made great strides by setting up situations in which I don't have to hurry. I know this is not always possible (to take a half a day) but I think it's the best thing to at least try to devote a more substantial space of time, because you get to intersperse your sex with talking and general physical intimacy, and it feels more natural, relaxed, and less contrived.

Doesn't it suck sometimes to feel like the only reason you continue to do something is so that you can just... get off? Granted, this is a legitimate need we have... to relieve ourselves. But I think that if we give our bodies and souls the time-space to just feel out things, we can better understand how we work intuitively and have a better chance of moving forward and becoming more at peace and less at odds with our sexuality. We can say to our gonads, ""it's ok, I know you'll bloom when you're ready!"" and mean it :-)

That was long... but I hope it helps! Much love.","1277949601"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm from (and still live currently) Arizona for the last 13 years.

Oh yeah I've heard about a lot of smaller colleges that sort of combine to offer more programs.

My high school sort of had the best of both worlds.  There were students who I never knew/met in 3 years but pretty much all my teachers knew their students.  Our average class size was under 30 easy.  This was especially true in all the AP classes I took junior and senior year.  My favorite teachers to this day are my AP Chem, Physics and BC Calc teachers.

As far as the big college goes, I again sort of have the best of both.  I'm in the honors college and one of the ways to get honors credit is to do an honors contract where you agree with the prof. of a normal class to do an extra project of some kind.  This involves talking to the teachers at least a few times during the semester as you set up and show them your progress/ask for help etc.  Also I've had one professor 3 times and one 1.5 times (for different classes of course).  The actual honors courses are not worth it at all.  Smaller classes but usually way more work and not necessarily a better teacher.  Much more fun to do extra programming projects for honors credit.

For the rest of it I'm pretty anonymous.  I don't really participate in any groups or clubs.  I am a member of the LUG and Treasurer of the IEEE CS chapter but I haven't actually done anything with either of them in the last year.  I went to a couple IEEE CS activities for the pizza.  I just happened to get to know the grad student president of the chapter and he asked me to do it, convincing me that it wouldn't be that much work.

I like to have a flexible schedule with as few concrete commitments as possible and I'm not social anyway.  For those that do enjoy clubs/extra curricula activities, there are 100's (it seems) here.  No shortage of ways to ""get involved"" and meet new people as they say.  It's easy to form groups of friends from different circles (class, major, clubs, greek life etc.) if you want to.

In summary:

Pros:  Tons of major options, certificates, classes, almost infinite groups, activities, intramurals, events always going on somewhere etc.

Cons: You don't automatically know everyone (and vice versa).  There has to be something in common from the above list.  Large classes for some common 100 levels.

Honestly I've only had 2 classes over 100 (Physics 1 and 2).  It really depends on what you take.  My internet English 102 course might have had over 100 but I don't remember.  A few of my CS courses have been in the 40-80 range but when you factor in attendance and the rooms they were in they felt about the ideal size actually.  I avoided a lot of lower stuff because of the AP's and actually if they weren't retarded I wouldn't have had to take Physics 1 or English 102 because of AP's.

They book a good band either locally or from a neighbouring state, throw in some supports, have DJ's for inbetween and after, drink specials, and discounted entry.

The clever thing is they also hire promoters, my brother being one of them. If a customer says the promoter's name on the door, the promoter gets like 1$ cut and also 1$ towards the bar. 

It keeps promoters enthusiastic because they get money as well as free drinks provided they bring enough people.","1277949601"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The good old handle.  Don't feel bad on this one, they purposefully make it difficult, its part of the game. So to answer the question we have to work backward.  You measure in basis points (bps).  1 basis point = 1/10000 ( a hundredth of a percent ) .001.  Generally a handle is 100 basis points.  so a move from 5 to 10 is 5 handles or 500 basis points.

here is a good guide I found that starts at square one.  I would suggest reading it because ZH often cites the ES mini as a standard index (to correlate to).

http://www.21stcenturyfutures.com/page/tcf/aboutus/basics.html

Does it have anything to do with ST Dev.  No.  But you could use historical basis points moves to calculate st. dev. which then gives you volatitlity, or vix.

The flash crash, no one knows the answer to this.  But here is the basic understand I've got.  Many automated engines both look at the numbers and read the news.  A number of factors cause many engines to go sell side.  HFT's want to keep their books balanced (sell/buy)  this means they are hedged on both long and short exposure.  So these measures are trigged, a number of engines try to sell immediately(we are talking hundredths of a second) this means the price plummets.  These engines also won't sell for just anything.  At this point they don't know what to do.  So they literally just stop.  That immediate stop removed a significant amount of liquidity.  Liquidity is another major indicator.  Once that liquidity is removed it makes assets even more worthless.  Basically it is a death spiral.  That's my best guess.

When a gratuity is an expectation in a transaction it should be honored faithfully.  It's a voluntary system that works because big tippers usually balance cheapskates.

Breathing is habit forming. Eating is habit forming. Life is habit forming and the only reason we continue each day is our addiction to it.

&gt;The evidence on hand tends to show that marijuana smoking can cause cancer.

Smoking *anything* causes cancer. Weed does not cause cancer, smoke does. In fact, weed has been shown to actually fight some types of cancer (stomach I think, I am not providing a link so take my word for it or look it up). Vaporizing weed is much better for you.

&gt;As for the ""unmotivated slacker"" argument

If we have cannabinoid receptors in each of our brains, it must have been selected for reproduction, it must have been ""good"" in some sense, even the one that it 'makes you feel better'.

&gt;That being said, I again state, if tobacco and alcohol are legal, then so should weed with this evidence at hand.

The only reason weed is compared to these is that the injustice is staggering when these are so clearly harmful, and weed is not. I do not believe *any* mind altering substances should be scheduled for regulation in the way that they are. I believe it to be obtuse the way we compare them, where is there a good argument for prohibiting any action not governable by guilt and remorse? 

&gt;So, why is it still considered by so many to be ""a harmless little giggle""

Because it is, and a lot of people partake, harmlessly.

The only people harming anyone en mass are those who enforce prohibition, anything else is merely fallout of said prohibition.

How exactly do you think it causes harm? I know you want to say it causes cancer, but most studies I have seen are skewed by adjacent *cigarette* smoking amongst those studied.

While you may be arguing for legalization, I don't think you fully grasp why it should be legal. It is **not** because tobacco and alcohol are legal, it is because there is absolutely no positive effects of prohibiting such substances. Even crack.

"lolcats","t5_2qh10","Re painful feeding:  kittens instinctively ""knead"" the mother's teat when they're feeding, which helps stimulate milk flow, but their claws go in and out as they do it, so as ebneter said, gloves or a towel are the way to go.

As for weaning, keep giving him milk (or, better yet, kitten milk replacer (KMR), which you can buy at a vet's office -- easier to digest and with a full spectrum of nutrients), but start offering him wet cat food mixed with milk or KMR to make it very soft.  Just get a glob of it on the tip of your finger and hold it up to his mouth -- you can even smear a little on his lips to give him the idea.  Once he tastes it he'll figure out what he's supposed to do.  When he's ready he will start licking up the wet food more and more (although he may well spread a lot of it all over the place).  As time goes by he will come to prefer the wet food and you can start to cut out the milk/KMR so he's just eating the wet food alone.  


By the way, I really do strongly recommend the KMR over milk.  Milk is far from optimal as a food for cats and kittens.  We tend to think of it as a wholly good food, but it can be hard to digest for some animals and cow's milk is hardly balanced for a kitten's nutritional needs.  KMR, by contrast, is specifically tailored to their needs.  This is not a product placement, there are probably other brands of the stuff out there, just use something that's specifically for kittens rather than bovine milk.  Tazo will love it, trust me, and he will gain weight quickly and generally be healthier.  


He is very cute by the way.  Good luck.

Think about whether you are convinced that something is actually true and what convinced you and have some strength in your position.

The photo was taken near a zoo that the tourist bus had just left. The zoo had been closed early for the day due to the flooding (worse was expected).


The purple-suited guy is a zoo worker who was using gear to try to hastily reconfigure some of the fencing and gates at the zoo-- fencing and gates which temporarily were submerged due to being located at low spots in the zoo. It was a big and confusing mess because the surprise flood forced zoo personnel to try moving some large and dangerous (and expensive) animals in a hurry (hence the early closure and throwing out the tourists).

Unfortunately, this zoo worker found himself trying to escape a hungry polar bear which got loose, and is out of frame (the photographer quit snapping pics when he saw his own danger, hence no bear pic).

What happens is that running shoes are designed so that your heel hits the ground causing shin pain. With a shoe with no support, you're landing on the front of your feet which is a much more natural movement.

The Federation unilaterally decided to give the Maquis' homes over to the Cardassians without any say from the colonists.  Those colonists left the Federation and declared themselves a sovereign power yet they were still forcibly removed, left to the brutal administration of the Cardassians or had to go into hiding.  Eddington sees this, says ""This is wrong!"", and sacrifices his comfortable life to become a renegade living in misery and squalor involved in a hopeless cause.  He manages to find a method of reclaiming those places that the colonists lost but Sisko's bane is such that he would use biogenic weapons without Starfleet authorization to poison a planet for half a century, risking the lives of everyone living there, the lives of people who probably weren't even involved in Eddington's plans, and making them once more homeless refugees.","1277949802"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I just REALLY wish he can prove a point by playing one masterpiece of storytelling (RPGs, like Earthbound or Chrono Trigger, or even something like Portal and Mass Effect), one masterpiece of gameplay (Mario, Megaman, Metroid, and Zelda- and yes, I admit Zelda and Metroid has storytelling elements- just not to the extent as things like Final Fantasy does), and one mindless but fun game to play (think generic arcade games, or shoot to make the high score games- like Geometry Wars).

I can't pinpoint what separates a masterpiece from just another fun game... Metroid has less story elements than say Earthbound- but take Super Metroid's hatchling sacrifice... It's moments like that which simply define the game and raise the bar so high. The emotional connection built along with the game is amplified and... Reaffirmed..? I dunno- I'm at a lost of words for it.

He can't name a video game. And he's unwilling to play a game to provide some perspective on the other side. 

I think video games are art. They are very comparable to what goes into the making of movies- but they also involve so much more. Music, writing, but also design and visionary elements not found in movies, and also gameplay- which is the thing that makes the game fun to play with in the first place. Can gameplay be comparable to action-elements in films? If that's the case, I think video games one-upped movies completely in that.  I prefer to play a 30+ hour video game as opposed to watching a 1+ hour film. I don't know why- I just seem to get so much more out of playing a video game.

I REALLY think Ebert should try Earthbound. He might get the references and the cultural-relevance. But you can't find those easily anymore (sans ROM- which is too hard for a non-gamer to search and work out). The next best thing would be to take a video game that has aged well and is easy to play. My vote would be Chrono Trigger- the DS remake. Less than $180 bucks for just one comparison.

If he really wants to be fair about this, he should ask us for a poll of what we consider masterpieces of the video game genre, take the highest voted one, and give it a swing. Hell, I'm willing to read Huckleberry Finn to try and see what he saw in it.","1277949914"

I have major depression and have tried to kill myself a year ago. I laugh at it now. Jokes about suicide and depression, when executed well, are great. However, you need to draw the line between (essentially) taunting and joking.

Making a one liner joke about bulimia or ADD is not clever. It's just a regurgitation of a joke that is intended to hurt others. This is not joking around, this is being a stupid prick who enjoys taunting others. There are mature ways of joking about these subjects.


Comics like Rick Shapiro and Doug Stanhope can take a topic like heroin addiction or anti-semitism and spin it into a fairly insightful and hilarious bit. Idiotic family members who think they're funny and clever are not telling jokes, they're bullying someone with the demeanor of being funny.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I only use aperture priority for automatic exposure bracketing for HDR pictures.  It's pretty much useless to me otherwise.  It tends to expose wrong when there are heavy shadows mixed with heavy highlights and I would end up tweaking the exposure compensation anyways.  Also depending on metering mode you can spot meter on what you want exposed properly then recompose, but that recomposition can take away from sharpness at wide angles for example.  You could counter this by programming separate buttons, one for exposure lock then one for focus lock and do the exposure first, recompose and do the focus lock then take your picture.

So it's possible there's no causality there. (Granted, if one is capable of affecting what the other does, this doesn't happen.)

For the Bell's Inequality, it means that you can measure things in a way that shows the value you're measuring doesn't exist before you measure it. Like, you flip a coin and cover it when it lands. It is neither heads nor tails until you look at it. You know it's one or the other, but you can tell by looking at how some *other* coin flip came up that this coin flip is neither. Not just ""I don't know"", but really really not having a value yet.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Fair enough.  Here are two survival tips people might remember:

1. When you see someone is going to fight with you, alert the nearest authority figure.  In a bar, this is the bar tender or bouncer.  This will get them on your side if the shit hits the fan.  Don't worry about pride – this is about avoiding a fight at all costs

2. Blocking punches is easy.  Think basic physics – use vectors to your advantage.  A tiny amount of perpendicular pressure will take the strike off target.  One of the games Karate black belts play is ""endless blocking"", where you just swat every punch away.  If this is possible when two black belts are fighting, imagine how easy it is with an untrained fighter.  I believe Win Chun style Kung Fu is almost entirely premised on this kind of blocking technique (simple blocks that convert easily to strikes), and it is reputed to be a devastatingly efficient street fighting style.","1277950020"

Think:

Shakespeare - Verbal
Michael Jordan/Tiger Woods - Spatial
Kennedy/King Jr. - Interpersonal
Gandhi/ Dalai Lama - Intrapersonal
Euclides - Mathematics (couldn't think of one modern math man, sob)
Einstein/Darwin - Logical
Carl Rogers - Emotional

The factor (n-1)n(n+1) consists of three consecutive numbers, so at least one is divisible by 3. So it suffices to check that (n-6)(n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 8.

You are essentially claiming that for merly doing their job for which they are already paid they are entilted to get extra.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I guess I fit into the ""free floater project management types"" that anandv mentioned.  He is correct in that my job is less about the technical details, but more ""big picture stuff"".  My job is to make sure that the A/E firms and construction companies my company hires do what they are paid to do.  

I know it sounds like that should be easy, but trust me, it isn't.  Sometimes I feel like I'm a baby sitter or their parents and some of these guys are twice my age plus.  Without oversight, many of the contractors will try to screw you in any way possible.  People like me are employeed to look out for the company's best interest in terms of cost, schedule, and scope.  

On a day-to-day basis, I attend and hold meetings, talk to different people in the contract organizations, check on project status compared to forecast, and generally make sure everything is going smoothly.  Safety is also very important so I am constantly in the field making sure all the workers are using the correct PPE and tools for the job at hand.

Other than that, I have a number of reports that I need to generate on a monthly basis to inform my management of the project's status.  Some of these I create myself and others I delegate out, but they are ultimately my responsibility.

I have a background in mechanical engineering.  The reason they use engineers for this work is to make sure they have someone who can understand the basis of the project, the concepts of how everything needs to work, and to make sure that they contractors aren't trying to get over on you.  I almost never use anything like calculus or physics, but I do get into thermodynamics, fluid dynamics (air flow and what not), and heat transfer from time to time.

As far as computer programs go, I use CAD on occasion (though usually just to look at drawings, not design anything myself), I use excel extensively, MS project from time to time for project schedules, and power point when presentations are needed.

I like my job in that it is something new all the time and is a very dynamic work environment.  Also, I am in the Global Engineering group so I get paid to travel internationally for work.  I work for a multinational pharmaceutical company, but this job description could apply to almost any company that manufactures products.","1277950074"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Are you using VB.Net? Because I think the mostly only applies to VB.Net. I'm currently using VB10 which is basically like C#. I'm pretty new at it and learning lots still. 

I have found using collections has really been sort of mind-blowing for me. It's such a structured and easy way to organize data and it's so easy to access data. It also makes your code look a lot more elegant. 

With regards to the code:

Here I have the actual structure that I want to use. It has a string, an integer array, a double value and a double array all stored together in one of these structures.
    Public Structure Something
        Public Name As String
        Public SomeIntArray() As Integer
        Public SomeDouble As Double
        Public SomeDoubleArray() As Double
    End Structure

The class that inherits CollectionBase inherits the functionality of the collectionbase class. The ""Add"" and ""Clear"" functions allow you to add elements of the type Something (the structure) into a collection, and clear allows you to remove all of the elements in the collection quickly. The ""Item"" property allows you to access the information within a certain element in the collection to change it or just read it. So let's say that you want to access something from that ""s"" collection that has been initialized globally in another sub or function:

    'let's say you want the name of the 2nd element in the collection, you would go...
    dim tmpName as string = s.Item(2).Name

    'or let's say you want to copy the integer array into a temporary integer array...
    dim tmpIntArray() as integer = s.item(2).SomeIntArray

So basically the collection functions like an array but it's automatically resized if you add or remove something. I also find them quicker than multi-dimensional arrays if you don't have an idea of how many elements you want in your array. They also seem to take up less memory.

While these analogies give some insight into the Trinity, the most important thing to understand about the Trinity is that it is unknowable and not accessible to human reason and comprehension. Thus any analogy or explanation will be flawed at some level. Many Christians believe they should be able to rationally comprehend the Trinity, which is why I think people end up rejecting it.

This will prevent the bike shop from selling it, without getting in trouble.  Then immediately notify the shop in writing that they are possessing stolen property.  This way, they wont sell it unless they want to commit the crime of selling stolen property.

2.  Request, in writing, the return of your bike from the shop.  The bike shop will ask that you pay for the bike, whatever they paid for it.  Dont agree.  The shop takes a risk when they buy goods.  The bike shop's title in the bike is only as good as the title the thief had, which is zilch. Its a legal concept in commercial transactions.

3.  If the bike shop wont return the bike, file a lawsuit in small claims court.  You should pay a lawyer a few bucks to draft your complaint property.  The theory of your lawsuit should be *replevin*.

most other places: basically fine, although the following vowel REALLY grind my gears

* the way you go ARN-ge instead of ORN-ge (orange)
* the way you go KEE-ant instead of Cant (can't) or KEE-na-da instead of CA-na-da (the KEE doesn't quite capture it, but it just sounds horrible to my ears)

basically, the general american accent sounds very nasally and closed-mouthed to my ears. i find canadians to have a much broader accent, and it's much more pleasing to my ears.

Yes, it is a drug.  But, it is not cut or mixed with anything like your assorted powders, it is not addictive (maybe habit forming), and as long as you don't become a lazy-ass burn-out there is nothing bad about it.  You can smoke pot and still be a successful person and not some bad stereotype out of a Reefer-Madness propaganda flick.  Shit, I have been smoking pot for almost 15 years and I just got my doctorate.  Just tell your parents that you understand that it is something that is frowned upon by society, and that you aren't going to do anything stupid like drive around high, or bring pot anywhere you shouldn't.

"montreal","t5_2qnmr","My opinion is if you need to work on a language USE IT.  Every little bit of training you can get to properly pronounce the foreign phonemes will improve your mastery, every exposure to new idioms will help you understand other elements of the language.

The Québecois have a cultural preference to being spoken to in the French language.  With some people it is more important than others, and it's usually when they're having a bad day that it's really important.  So if you have French, use it.  Why not?

There really isn't a politeness issue with respect to the people you are ordering with.  Ordering isn't exactly advanced French.  They'll understand and maybe they'll understand more if they don't and they ask you what you said.

The situation where an anglophone patron and an anglophone server speaking French (or vice versa) only really happens when each speaks the second language well.  At which point, who cares?

I told him things very, very directly like, ""Okay you have to stop talking about that now."" or ""How it works is we take turns. You asked me a question, so that means this is my turn."" or ""People think it's rude when you start sentences that way"" or ""You should know that when you stand that close to me, I can't pay attention to what you're saying because I'm busy trying to decide whether to kick you in the knee or the throat.""

At the time I felt awful for speaking to him this way! I'm normally not like that at all, but there was just something about this guy that drove everyone nuts. We liked hearing his take on things and wanted him to hang around but OMG dude, *back up a little*. I'd forgotten all about it until ten years later... turns out that little bit of acceptance and instruction really helped him.

"reddit.com","t5_6","are you a socialist? man, socialism sucks. i lived in socialist holland for five years. as a foreigner, it wasn't so bad. for the first ten years, especially if you're in information technology, you can get that waiver so you only pay 33% in taxes but the locals get screwed with a 50% tax rate.

then, on top of that there's the vat, or value added tax, which is 19.5 % (in holland). so if you're a local, the government is taking 50+19.5=69.5 % of your money! thank you socialism. all this is done to pay for things like so-called free health care.

guess what? its not free. you still have to pay for insurance seperately. of course, you do have two options - one the public option and the other private health insurance. they send you a statement and the money is automatically deducted from you bank account. I forget how often they did that - monthly or quarterly. anyway, many people chose private insurance because if you go to the hospital you get a private room instead of being stuck in a ward with 14-15 other socialists.

now for the really bad news - humans are lazy. when you have what the dutch call the social net, or as i call it the social flypaper, people have no problem going on unemployment and leaching off the system.

then you have these other laws so that after an employee makes it through the six week trial its nearly impossible to fire someone. the dutch love to sit around and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes after that first six weeks.

socialism tends to go this way in my experience. it was like that in germany and croatia as well. to other places, i know this place off the red square in moscow you might like to visit. its the tomb of lenin.

if your facing the kremlin, its on the left hand side of the square. you go down some stairs and there he is - a short, flat dead communist in a vacuum sealed glass box. oh, do take your hat off or some big russian dude with an ak47 will point his gun at you and start swearing obscenities. have fun.","1277950214"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, since no one's done this yet, I'll offer my summary on: the regions of math! With critical basic definitions for the layperson, and a few basic examples. To those who actually know math, this summary is intended for the massive number of people who don't seem to understand what real mathematics is.

(sure to be imperfect mind you, I am still very much a padawan mathematician)

SET THEORY - the basis of modern mathematics is in set theory. The ideas are so entrenched that to a mathematician they are second nature, but in speaking with total lay people they are not always familiar. The basic idea Is that we can think about... collections of objects. Given a collection we know what objects are in it. Given an object we can tell what collections it belongs to. This is the underlying idea of modern (20th century and beyond) mathematics.
*set* - a well defined collection of objects, as described.

Practically speaking, the elements of a set are usually either other sets (possibly with additional structure, which I'll explain in a bit), or ""points"". A point is a point. A single entity with no additional structure that we frequently denote be a variable. Something we consider a point in one context may actually have some structure in others, of course: pi refers to a particular real number, a point; however, if we think of pi as it's decimal expansion, it represents a particular sequence of integers.

(LOGIC - Formal symbolic logic can be directly formulated in terms of sets (an easy way to think about this is taking a statement to represent the set of conditions under which the statement is true - set union becomes logical and, set intersection becomes logical or); the connection between computer science and math runs to the very core of each.)

Another critical idea, needed to build up any other area of mathematics:
*function* - also called a map or mapping (and there are many specific, named types of functions with other properties), a function associates each element in some set (called the domain) with an element from another set (the codomain). The elements of the domain and codomain can, of course, be anything (as anything can belong to a set), including other sets or more complex objects.

All of the rest of math can be formulated in terms of these two ideas. Doing so at a very high, abstract level is the discipline of CATEGORY THEORY.

The other areas of math pertain to sets with additional so-called ""structure"". Literally and specifically this amounts to looking at sets alongside with functions defined on them.

ALGEBRA - Usually concerned with sets that have functions that amount to operations on the set. Things like +,* etc. For example, ""+"" on the real numbers is a map from the set of ordered pairs of real numbers to the set of real numbers, taking each pair to what we define as it's ""sum"" (how the real numbers are defined is a fascinating matter in itself - the above function tells us they have a ""group"" structure, but the easiest way to understand things about them is actually in our next discipline...)

ANALYSIS - Generally concerns itself with spaces (a ""space"" is really just mathematical lingo for a set with additional structure, where structure is, as I said, imbued by the existence of certain functions) where we can create some notion of distance or size (which are both types of functions - size comes from a function from your space to the real numbers, and distance from one taking pairs of elements of your space to the real numbers). Most mathematical objects widely known have such - the integers, real numbers, complex numbers, various surfaces and other manifolds, etc. 

GEOMETRY - Use techniques of algebra and/or analysis (more widely analysis is used, that's DIFFERENTIAL geometry) to understand specifics of more complicated spaces.

TOPOLOGY - A more abstract approach to understanding the ""shape"" of spaces than geometry. By shape I mean a number of properties that, when looked at in the context of things we can visualize (i.e. compact objects of three or fewer dimensions) correspond to what we intuitively know as shape. Topology relies less on the existence of analytic structure on spaces than geometry (though becomes more interesting when said structure exists), and more directly on some underlying set stuff. Algebraic topology exists as a whole higher level of badass - Drunken_Physicist's very good summary of homology fits into this discipline.

Another general note on math is that across all these disciplines there is always an interest in maps that ""preserve"" spaces' structures in some sense. There are cool names for such maps - homomorphisms, isomorphisms, diffeomorphisms, homeomorphisms - and a number of other properties maps can have (continuity, differentiability, etc.) that means that information about the domain is preserved to some extent in the image of the function.

Well, that's my beginner's blurb on what math is.
The subjects most people think of as math - trigonometry, calculus, etc. - are what I would call mathematical methods - they can easily be learned without a really good understanding of what's going on.

""There is no point in beginning something without ambition. In so many aspects of my life I have held to that notion, and it has led to more than one fiery crash through the years. I still recall, with some bitterness, the response Cam (Ian C. Esslemont) and I received when flogging our co-written feature film and television scripts: 'Wonderful! Unique! Very funny, very dark... but here in Canada, well, we just can't budget for this stuff. Good luck.' In many ways, it was what followed by way of advice that proved the most crushing. 'Try something ... simpler. Something like everything else out there. Something less ... ambitious.'

We'd walk out of meetings frustrated, despondent, baffled. Did we really hear an invitation to mediocrity? Sure sounded like it.

Well, screw that.

One last word to all you nascent writers out there. Ambition is not a dirty word. Piss on compromise. Go for the throat. Write with balls, write with eggs. Sure, it's a harder journey but take it from me, it's well worth it.""

It's that long timespan that bothers me. A good story (in my opinion) has a narrow focus. Skipping to a character POV years later kinda bothers me. Admittedly, that's a personal taste issue, but there you go. 

Lock Lamora, on the other hand.... I've yet to read the sequel, but Lies of Lock Lamora shows that it's possible to have a good story that spans many years. It was constructed in a way that I found brilliant, frankly. Basically the book is *two* stories interwoven together in alternating chapters and interludes. One story tells of Locke as a child first learning the trade of being a priest/thief. The other is from his point of view as a man and arguably the most successful thief in Camorr, a large urban fantasy city. It's done in such a way that each transition is actually *relevant* (well, usually) to the previous point of view. 

A very fine book, IMO. ","1277950340"

Ask them why they are stretching the definition of the word ""religion"" so far as to make it meaningless in a cynical (and childish) attempt at a point?

If you want to get technical, you simply tell them that the question is an equivocation fallacy. Under no reasonable definition of ""religion"", does science and the scientific method apply. If they insist, ask them to define religion (and then faith). Then you point out that science isn't even a set of beliefs. It's a process.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Honestly?  Get him into Anime.  Hollywood has some real gems, but overall it's mired in the usual western cultural morass; even when it does have a secular humanist message, it usually gets stuck in quasi-messianic, faith-oriented weirdness.  Japanese culture doesn't really deal with the idea of a single central all-powerful God except as an imported product, so it tends to either never come up, or they'll have the monotheists portrayed as bad guys.  Any non-western media would probably do the trick, but Anime has a substantial following in the west and so it's much easier to find than most other such stuff.

Notably, Studio Gibli makes some good films, but they might be off-putting as seeming like they're ""for kids,"" if your friend isn't used to the anime/manga aesthetic (although I'm guessing you're young enough that Pokemon probably featured at some point, so that may not be an issue).  If so, maybe try starting with something like Gurren Lagann, which is both very macho and easily accessible (though not, IMO, terribly impressive otherwise).  Or you could try something a bit heavier like Evangelion if you think he'd be up for it (that one features a heavy dose of biblical parallel, though, so it might potentially piss him off; proceed with caution).  Akira might be a good starter, too, or something like Ghost in the Shell.  Fortunately, these are all fairly mainstream anime in the US (mentioned for that reason), so it shouldn't be too hard to find them if you do decide to go this route.  Heck, even something like Bleach, maybe?

I should mention that none of these are in any real sense ""anti""-theistic (except maybe Evangelion), so it may not be exactly what you're looking for.

Edit to add: if you're in an older demographic than I'm guessing (ie too old for Pokemon), Gibli is probably an attractive option, but the rest might seem a bit juvenile.  You'll have to judge for yourself.","1277950352"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In the context that you often hear it repeated, ""marijuana is harmless"" is very much a relative statement. Usually it's said when somebody says it should remain illegal and believes that alcohol is less dangerous to individuals or society than marijuana.

The fact is, people really shouldn't use it before a certain stage in development; evidence has shown that it may have a significant negative impact on cognitive development if it is used prior to the age range of ~20 years of age. The same, however, is true of alcohol, and most people want to believe that that isn't true either. 

The reason people argue so vehemently that marijuana is harmless is the society-wide impact that it theoretically would not have. Alcohol abusers tend to kill people in car accidents, and that just doesn't seem to happen with marijuana; I can't cite the research off the top of my head, but driving under the influence of marijuana doesn't so much affect the ability to operate a vehicle safely as it impairs the ability to navigate and find your way around. Again, driving while stoned is probably not a good idea, but neither is driving drunk, and the punishment for drunk driving is less harsh than simple marijuana possession in most states.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; For such a person it would be acting contrary to nature to have sexual relations with a person of the opposite sex.

This is actually a common complaint: That if a person is born homosexual, it's perfectly natural for them to engage in homosexual sex, and therefore it cannot be sin.

However, that idea is easily refuted. All men are born with a ""sin nature"", meaning it is natural for us to sin. Lust, greed, pride, arrogance.. these are all natural, yet sin nonetheless. Even the sin of unbelief in God is a natural one, as we are all born without express knowledge of God. And certainly Paul was clear of the sinfulness of extra-marital sex within heterosexual relationships, which is also perfectly natural.

&gt; The law of Moses allowed for divorce (Deut. 24:1-4); Jesus categorically forbids it (Mark 10:1-12; Matt. 19:9 softens his severity). Yet many Christians, in clear violation of a command of Jesus, have been divorced. Why, then, do some of these very people consider themselves eligible for baptism, church membership, communion, and ordination, but not homosexuals? What makes the one so much greater a sin than the other, especially considering the fact that Jesus never even mentioned homosexuality but explicitly condemned divorce? Yet we ordain divorcees. Why not homosexuals?

I believe the ordination question to be based on the ongoing lifestyle of the person. First off, not all divorcees have sinned in that act. Some have left because their spouse was unfaithful (as Jesus allowed), and some have been left by their spouse against their will. But for those who have been willing participants in sinful divorce, forgiveness and repentance is available as it is for any other sin.

For the homosexual to be eligible for ordination, in my view, it would require repentance from the act of homosexual sex and abstaining from it in the future, even while still remaining attracted to the same sex. A ""practicing"" homosexual is living an ongoing lifestyle of sin, and that disqualifies him from leading a church. But this is not exclusive to homosexuality.

If a pastor is found to be having an affair, he should (and often is) removed from his position. I know of one pastor who was removed from his church, theoretically repented of his sin and healed from his misdeeds, and eventually went on to pastor another church who knew of his former mistakes. Unfortunately he had another affair, and was removed again from his new position. The point is that there was forgiveness for past mistakes, but new ones made while leading a church have tough consequences.

Divorce and homosexual sex are both sins that a person can repent of and have forgiven. Of course, the homosexual must abstain from fulfilling his passion just as an unmarried heterosexual must. It is certainly unfair and unfortunate that the homosexual has no acceptable way to fulfill his natural desires, and I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. I can't speak for God regarding why people are born this way or why some are made to be this way through childhood abuse. But then, that is the age-old question of why God allows bad things to happen.

My final point about this essay is this: Many Old Testament commands were made that the people at the time may not have understood the reasoning for, and yet God in his wisdom knew what was good and bad for people and commanded them accordingly. I have no doubt that there were people who questioned his laws back then just as we do now, but I also know that God is the ultimate authority on all of creation, and that his ways are higher than our ways. I am not so arrogant as to think that my modern, educated mind is smarter or wiser than God's. In comparison to him, I am nothing, and yet he loves me despite all my flaws. The least I can do is defer to his wisdom on all matters even (and especially) when they conflict with my own sinful, faulty, inferior thoughts.","1277950388"

Sure, I've never complained about the low density on the old iphone. I can see the pixels though. I would be happy if that was gone and I could no longer see pixels. It's that simple.

Handset makers haven't settled on resolution because it's ""perfectly fine"", resolution has been increasing as the technology gets more sophisticated. 300dpi passes a milestone in that most people won't see the pixels anymore. THAT is ""perfectly fine"".

Your argument over memory and storage is irrelevant for a device this size. iphone 4 outperforms 3gs despite the increased resolution. When it comes to transferring data... computers have been using higher resolution for years and the iphone has access to the same network infrastructure. Everything else is in place to handle increased resolution. Nothing will come crashing down because you have to store a few pictures at 960x640 resolution instead of 480x320.","1277950421"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I'd still have you do what I thought was related to the issue.  If you are a CCNA you should know VERY well what starting out with a certain assumption leads you to.  Usually an hour and a half of troubleshooting you did not need to do.

You could very well be correct, but its the 80 / 20 rule basically.  If I can do 3 things, and fix most issues in less than 10 minutes, then those are 10 minutes well spent confirming that those were done and doing them again.

This is a lesson I had to learn the HARD way.  Not just the customer either, I refused to take for granted previous troubleshooting that had been done on the issue, because so frequently it was VERY wrong.

I cannot even number the times where someone said ""Oh thank god, you are the 8th person we've spoken to and no one else could fix this!"" and it ended up being as simple as removing a filter or resetting the WEP key.


EDIT:

When I worked at Comcast, the rule was our fault we pay your fault you pay.  In other words, if a technican gets sent out to your house because your modem is plugged into the lan port on your router, you just paid $50 for that, and it could have been fixed over the phone (you in general not esper2142).

Anyone that did not want to do troubleshooting and put up too much of a fight this is how the conversation would go:

Me:  Ok, we will send a technician out.  Just to let you know, if it ends up being something on your end like a loose wire or something we could have solved over the phone, a $50 service charge will apply.

Them:  What!?  Its not something on my end.  I won't be charged right?

Me:  If it is something on our end like a problem at the pole, you will not be charged.

Them:  So there is no charge right?

Me:  If it is something we could have fixed over the phone, yes there is a charge.

Them:  It cant be on my end though!

Me:  If it cant be on your end, then you have nothing to worry about.

People basically tried to trap me into saying there would be no charge, even though I very clearly dictated that there WOULD be a charge, if it ended up being something simple.","1277950456"

So it's even worse than the Iraq analogy because at least Bush was voted into office (some may argue the legitimacy, but it wasn't an appointment). And Iraq was voted on by the Senate:

Unless I'm taking your statement wrong and the ""it"" in your statement is the Arizona bill. But I think the AZ senate voted on that too: http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/64361 .

So in either case, unless ""you"" is a person on the senate (AZ or US), then ""you"" couldn't have voted on either the Iraq war resolution, or the AZ immigration law. Which was my point.

That's the problem. If the episodes were enjoyable, viewership wouldn't be down. The show has sterilised.

I think the Tardis is the perfect metaphor for the show - An old, obsolete, quirky, unreliable, yet lovable Tardis now has a clean, shiny and *sterile* appearance (interior and exterior). The stories have all been sterilised and dumbed down, even if it means Daleks no longer want to kill themselves if their DNA is altered, or Silurians are re-invented with a throw-away ""must be a different evolutionary strain"" line.","1277950521"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; In my view a constitution should merely set out the different branches of government and protect the basic human rights from being infringed upon

That is all it does.

Articles 1, 2, and 3 set up the three branches.

Article 4 deals with states: making/removing them and interstate crime.

Article 5 spells out the amendment process.

Article 6 reassures that the government wasn't going to ditch their debts by forming a new government and states that officals have to swear oaths to protect the constitution.

Article 7 Ratification, a bunch of signatures.

Bill of rights, protects basic rights.

Amendment 11, Judicial Limits.

Amendment 12, fixes the election process.

Amendment 13, 14, and 15 extend rights to black people.

Amendment 16, income taxes

Amendment 17, Senators elected by popular vote.

Amendment 18/21, prohibiton and ending prohibition

Amendment 19, extends rights to women

Amendment 19, Terms starting.

Amendment 22, President term limits

Amendment 23, gives DC voting power

Amendment 24, Poll taxes banned (used to keep black people from voting)

Amendment 25, sets up system in case of presidential death.

Amendment 26, lowers voting age so people who can be drafted can vote.

Amendment 27, prevent congress from giving themselves raises within the same term.

Of all those only Amendment 18 doesn't deal with rights or the government's powers/system, and that was repelled by Amendment 21.

Then, set up a camp with livable conditions for a few months.  then get a tons of artists, mainly ice sculptors, and build a GIGANTIC castle out of snow and ice.  Original plan was to recreate Hogwarts (and actually involved super gluing legos together in the Sahara), but this seems easier.  Also, I would design it in such a way that the Northern Lights would make the entire castle look DOPE AS FUCK.  And also, have the equinoxes and all sorts of shit make it looks special too.  It's pretty much going to be the most rad thing ever.  And then, when it's done, I'll live there for a bit, then just leave.  I won't tell anyone, and hopefully it'll be centuries before it's found.  It'll out do the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Mayan temples, all that shit.

Also:

* Lead an expedition through the amazon
* Lead a crew on a sailboat around the world (none of that pussy motor shit)
* Hike the entire Appalachian Trail in one go
* Do a barrel roll in an airplane

* Become super well-cultured (basically visit a ton of places)

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I have to ask you, why you are not medicated for your bipolar disorder?  You mention ""family"" but that's very vague.  Is it because your family is against medicine?  Is that because of religious reasons?  Is it because they can't afford medical care?  Your health is *your* concern after all, and there's help available that your family does not have to be informed about.  Your parents/family are entitled to their beliefs, but if you believe that the best way to live a good life includes getting all kinds of professional care, you are entitled to that.  Herbal medicine is also an option, if it is strictly pharmaceuticals are the issue.  

If you are not medicated do you get some kind of medical care for your illness, like support groups and therapy?  There are a few reasons I'm asking.  The first is that bipolar disorder can be very dangerous if not treated at all.  Depressions/manias typically get worse over time and not better, and can have psychotic episodes mixed in.  In that kind of situation you are at high risk of hurting yourself and/or others.  It is not to say this will happen in your case but you are *at risk* and that risk carries the weight of yours and others' very lives.  There are ways to forgo medication and use therapy and support groups  to cope with symptoms and lead an overall balanced life.  

Bipolar disorder can be hell on any kind of relationship if untreated (even including your family).  I also have bipolar disorder, and notice a huge difference between my balanced life (which I enjoy now), to the life (if you could call it that) I lived while symptomatic.  Even when you do achieve balance you will have times when you feel a really strong emotion and second guess yourself asking ""Am I overreacting or is this how a ""normal"" person would react?"". 

In this instance I think you have every reason to be upset.  Be sure to communicate that it is not just that the situation made you angry (him discussing your sex life after telling you it is off-limits conversation material) but that you were hurt by what he said and who he said it to.  He's the one who should be giving you BJ encouragement/tips by telling you what he thinks feels good.  I've given my share of BJs and every guy likes it different.  I communicate with them and experiment, I've always encouraged my partners not to be shy and tell me what feels good, not so good, and amazing.  He was obviously not communicating with you, or maybe trying to through a third party.  That kind of communication is between you and him, getting anyone else involved makes things complicated, inappropriate, and somewhat passive aggressive.  As long as you communicate your feelings clearly and calmly, if he's worth a damn he'll listen.","1277950538"

The people who vote. Just like atheists will get annoyed if you post christian stuff on /r/atheism, I think you're finding Christians will get annoyed if you post non-Christian stuff on /r/christianity.

I think you're vastly underestimating what consensus exists amongst Christians. It is far from the case that ""No two churches agree on what orthodoxy is."". I think pretty much everyone agrees on the authority of scripture and Christ's divinity (the Nicene and Apostle's creeds, for instance). The most famous apologetic around is probably C.S.Lewis's ""Mere Christianity"". In the preface he said:

&gt; So far as I can judge from reviews and from the numerous letters written to me, the book, however faulty in other respects, did at least succeed in presenting an agreed, or common, or central, or 'mere' Christianity. In that way it may possibly be of some help in silencing the view that, if we omit the disputed points, we shall have left only a vague and bloodless H.C.F. The H.C.F. turns out to be something not only positive but pungent; *divided from all non-Christian beliefs by a chasm to which the worst divisions inside Christendom are not really comparable at all*. If I have not directly helped the cause of reunion, I have perhaps made it clear why we ought to be reunited. Certainly I have met with little of the fabled odium theologicum from convinced members of communions different from my own. Hostility has come more from borderline people whether within the Church of England or without it; men not exactly obedient to any communion. This I find curiously consoling. It is at her centre, where her truest children dwell, that each communion is really closest to every other in spirit, if not in doctrine. And this suggests that at the centre of each there is a something, or a Someone, who against all divergencies of belief, all differences of temperament, all memories of mutual persecution, speaks with the same voice.

"politics","t5_2cneq","So let's break down where your interpretation has gotten us.

1. Half of the amendment exists merely to state its purpose, a practice that does not exist in the code of any other amendment, the constitution, or any other law ever written in the United States.

2. This half of the amendment which is purely explanatory and has no effect on how we are to understand the second half of the amendment uses the phrase ""well regulated,"" but in a constitutional document does not mean you to understand regulation as something the government should do despite the fact that regulation in legal code always refers to an action of the government.

3. Instead of stating simply that the militia is necessary (which by your own interpretation is already a superfluous part of the amendment), they add in the phrase ""well regulated"" which is similarly unnecessary. What added meaning is provided by saying ""well regulated"" militia (by which you interpret to mean ""self-regulated"") that is not already provided by saying merely ""militia"" without any modifiers of ""well regulated."" Additionally, in the event that self-regulation is not going well, the entire purpose of the amendment has also been subverted. Although I guess to you it does not matter if it is not being well self-regulated because the first half of the entire amendment is moot and not relevant to the interpretation. Assuming we did say that the drafters did not intend to make 50% of an amendment totally and utterly irrelevant, a practice brand new and never before seen in law-making, even if we were to interpretation to be self-regulated, at the point where the self-regulation was not going well, the conditonal second half of the amendment would not need to be respected. Insofar as that is true, it requires secondary policy to determine when a militia is being well self-regulated, which would by 10th amendment go to state laws.

This amendment under your interpretation stands out as a unique legal expression, one never seen before or after in the history of this country or law (for reason 1 alone, but then also for reason 2 and reason 3). Buuuuuuut, its meaning is plain and completely unambigious, and centuries of lawyers and justices educated in law were dumb to not see something so clear.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","This.  I think it’s crucial that students and the general public understand that Freud’s theories have flaws and that the process for generating theories in psychology today is much more scientific.  That doesn’t always happen.  Freud did influence the field of psychology (among other fields) and got people thinking about concepts that were not thought about too much before (importance of childhood development, the unconscious mind, etc), but most of his theories were based on his personal observations of his patients, a very unscientific and unreliable method for generating theories. 

There are a number of reasons I believe Freud’s theories are now a detriment to the field of psychology and give it a bad reputation to those who aren’t familiar with anything other than Freudian thought.  

Strike 1: When Freud encountered female patients who were sexually abused by their fathers, he shrugged it off as being due the Electra complex and claimed that it was just the girl’s natural sexual feelings for her father.  Nothing was done about these acts.

Strike 2: Freud believed that mothers were solely responsible for causing schizophrenia, which is not supported by modern science and is unfair to good mothers who have schizophrenic children. 

Strike 3: Freud claimed that children could not be depressed, because their superego is not formed yet.  Again, evidence indicates otherwise.   

To an outsider who believes that modern psychology is based on Freud’s theories, the field appears horribly pseudoscientific.  And that’s a problem because in reality, most psychologists strive to endorse theories that have their basis in empirical evidence.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I can't give too many details because it might identify someone, but here's the stripped-down version: 

It happened indoors. The guy was, apparently, in the basement getting drunk, while the rest of the group was upstairs watching tv. Then suddenly he's upstairs waving a rifle around shouting about how he's gonna shoot my mom (who was present), then kill himself.

My sister and I just exchanged one glance, and jumped at him. After that it's kind of a blur, we both acted on instinct.

I have no idea how I physically managed to get him down, but his level of intoxication must have helped. Somehow I ended up on top of him with my elbow jammed into his throat. She ran over and practically broke his arm by sitting, literally, on his arm and shoulder, and shoved the (dropped) gun out of his reach, someone else, I don't remember who, grabbed it and took it away.

I'm a little worried about saying what happened afterward, because I don't know if my sis wants ANYTHING potentially identifiable on the internet. She's kinda paranoid.","1277950718"

&gt;The symptoms of CAH vary depending upon the form of CAH and the gender of the patient. Symptoms can include:
&gt;Due to inadequate mineralocorticoids:
&gt;vomiting due to salt-wasting leading to dehydration and death
&gt;Due to excess mineralocorticoids:
&gt;hypertension (11beta[OH] deficiency)
&gt;Due to excess androgens:
&gt;ambiguous genitalia, in some females, such that it can be initially difficult to determine sex
&gt;early pubic hair and rapid growth in childhood
&gt;precocious puberty or failure of puberty to occur (sexual infantilism: absent or delayed puberty)
&gt;excessive facial hair, virilization, and/or menstrual irregularity in adolescence
&gt;infertility due to anovulation

So it's not like there aren't non-gender-related issues, and I'm not saying we shouldn't research things to prefer CAH or those dangerous side effects.

Ironically Germany throws billions at Greece to prevent a collapse of the Euro and Germans are ""afraid"" of a weak Euro. Despite the weak Euro being the best stimulus for the German economy.

Yes German companies didn't increase wages because they employed more people. During the boom years German politicians focused on decreasing the unemployment rate. It is important to notice that Germany has very strict job protection laws and it is very hard for a company to get rid off employees. Therefore it doesn't mean that the production costs didn't increase (low wages times a larger number of employees result in higher production costs) and because it is hard to get rid of employees it doesn't mean that German companies can just push the production costs (unlike e.g. companies in the US were there aren't similar job protection laws).

What you are OK with, though, is that a predominantly male trait (being physically larger) that makes the cost of life to go up for men, costs more, while you're not OK with discriminating against traits that are predominantly female and you're allowing cognitive dissonance allow you to be a hypocrite on the matter.

Personally, I'm OK with both forms of these discrimination, so there's no hypocrisy on my end.  People should pay for their own healthcare and food, and not have to supplement others.  What I'm not OK is that one type of discrimination exists (car insurance for example) against men, while another is not allowed against women (health insurance for example).  I actually agree that this food stamp thing that the OP brought up is/might be stupid, I just disagree with you that it's because largeness isn't related to genitalia.  It's obviously a trait that is predominantly male, therefore this could be perceived as a male ""issue"".  Just like many women's issues.  Child rearing isn't related to genitalia, yet maternal leave from work is considered a woman's issue, right?  Isn't that along the same lines as largeness?  I'd even argue that largeness (not being fat.  Just large) is less of a choice than raising a child.  Therefore if one should be discriminated against less, it should be largeness.  Which is not what we have (at least in the US) when it comes to parental leave.  ","1277950750"

Well, he went on Chantix (to quit smoking) and went suicidal. He also kept imagining people dying in terrible ways. He told the psychiatrists everything. I mean, I tell my doctor everything so they can help me to the best of their ability. His thinking was the same. 

Well, they concluded that he was psychotic and even though he admitted himself, he could only leave when they decided. Like I said, the hospital (outpatient type of center) was a week long program. He was there for three weeks; the longest patient they ever had.

I learned to never allow my child to be checked into a facility like that. I'll take them to a private psychiatrist (if they need/want it), but will not be admitting them to a facility. Basically, once he was off the medication, he got better. But he had to stay way longer than necessary and got worst (after initially getting better) because of being cooped up. And I don't even want to think about how much it cost.

His situation wasn't even a fourth as bad as yours and it was still terrible. I don't really have an questions for you. I just want to say I feel for you and hope you get all your anger issues sorted out. 

TL;DR: Cousin admitted himself, told the complete truth, was diagnosed as bipolar and psychotic and not allowed to leave even though he admitted himself and the fact that it was all due to him taking Chantix. Shitty experience I will never let a child of mine go through.","1277950751"

Over the years I have become very tired with your services.  Until recently I paid $50 a month for cable.  And do you know what I was paying for?  It surely wasn't ""creativity and innovation"" like you are trying to tell people.  I don't consider Pawn Stars, The Bachelor, or Toddlers in Tiaras to be either ""creative"" or ""innovative.""  And who are these so called ""ordinary working people"" you are supposedly trying to protect?  The big movie stars with they multi million dollar pay cheques?  Or are you just worried you won't get the new model of Porsche this year.

Stop treating your customers like you can just walk all over them.  I will gladly pay for the 1% television I want to watch as along as I don't have to pay for the 99% of drivel that you mass produce purely to sucker people out of their hard earned pay cheque.

And if you do find someone with these programming chops which exceedeth your own, you give them like 1.5% pre-dilution.  

So you want to keep almost all the equity for yourselves even though someone else is going to be the key player that actually MAKES your product work.

That's just a shitty deal.  If you guys were better programmers than I was, and I needed you to finish MY product, would you come work for me for 1-3%?  Of course not, you'd start your own company, and that's exactly what you did.

So you have to ask yourself, ""what would get ME to work at someone else's company when I have the expertise they are desperately looking for but can't seem to find?""

You're probably looking at making someone else a full equal cofounder along with yourselves.  This shouldn't be scary as long as you get the vesting right.  Otherwise you're looking at having 100% of a company that goes nowhere.

Though the cut is one of the tastiest bits on a cow, I don't have a clue why it would pair better with a SABL than any other cut.  I'd think preparation would be far more important.

The trick is the MD3000i is supposed to integrate with VSS on Windows. So Windows polls the enlisted applications to get into a snapshot-consistent state, then requests a hardware snapshot, then the hardware snapshot is used for the backup data. The alternative is that you have a software snapshot which on a clustered filesystem can be far messier.

Anyway, that's how it's *supposed* to work. I think the issue is that their integration component did some low level calls that it shouldn't have, and it appears to crash the VSS subsystem when it's installed.

You have no fucking idea how annoying it is when people believe what they read without actually watching the match. You also have no fucking idea how many disgusting, vulgar comments I read on soccer sites and on youtube. I'm sick of it. The Korea/Portugal match should not be controversial AT ALL and people still say shit like Korea shouldn't have won that match. It absolutely makes no sense to me. Italians dive all the fucking time and it is evident in 2010, 2006, and in 2002. When you're a referee and you see a player suddenly fall down in a penalty box, and other Italians are asking for a penalty, what are you supposed to do? Totti elbowed Kim Nam Il in the face which is punishable for a red card. However, he got away with a yellow and his ""dive"" or slip got him the second yellow. I understand the referee's decision there. The offsides call the Italians got could've EASILY been mistaken as offsides. If you watch football, there were WAY worse calls then that. Italians cry too much. I remember Man United vs Chelsea last year, Drogba got the 2nd goal to put them 2-0 which was clearly offsides. Man United fans stayed classy and didn't bitch about it. Italian fans don't know how to do that all and to this day cry about their match against Korea. Rewatch the match and tell me I'm wrong. I understand why Spain feels disgust at losing to Korea because of the 2 goals that went in but when there's a Top 10 World Cup controversy list and #3 or whatever is Korea beating Portugal/Italy/Spain, I feel like fucking a goat. The only controversial match should've been the match against Spain. ","1277950808"

I think I saw an article about how some of the odd people will go as far as making, or taking visual clues from writing works, to create a continent in which it all takes place.

Go somewhere further South.  People tend to be friendlier, things are generally cheaper (excepting Provence), and people will be much less likely to want to practice their English.

A similar model should be implemented for drugs. You need to work your way up to the harder stuff, proving your abilities as you go. The difference is right now that a random idiot can go from zero to hoovering a shitload of meth and ruin his fucking life because he's too stupid to realize what is happening to him.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","The trick in high school is to make it seem like its not something you do alot. You achieve good grades and are very busy. Make it seem like something you do on the side and it doesn't affect the rest of your life. Assure your parents you never do it in any unsafe locations (cars, parks, etc) but try to avoid telling them exactly where you do it because they might forbid you from going to those places.

Be polite the entire time. If they yell, answer softly. This will not come off as submissive, instead, they will look back and hopefully feel like they overreacted by yelling at you. 

Mention calmly that its just marijuana, also mention that you know to *never* do heavier drugs, that you are intelligent and were raised well, and that most kids try it, and that you are sure they tried it at your age.

This is the method I used and refined when I got caught in high school and my situation was just like yours (albeit my parents don't smoke and are slightly more conservative). I got caught a few times by parents, and even by the police after my first time getting caught. Lashing out against them doesn't work. They'll blame the drugs. Logic for me didn't work initially, because emotion tends to trump logic in the brain, and my mom was *very* worried about me when she found out about it. But after a little while, my parents stopped arguing that marijuana itself was bad but the fact that I would break the law was the real problem. 

For 17 your post comes off as more intelligent than half of the adults on reddit. Your parents are probably proud they raised a good son and are worried that you'll be fucked by the long dick of drug war, which is why they are grounding you now.","1277950829"

Everything else is window dressing and implementation details. I'd love to see amendments to restrict government power outright in certain cases (lobbying, domestic spying, use of military force in non-defensive wars, nonsensical restrictions on personal freedoms etc.), but the document has an amendment process to see those changes through and I have great hope that when things get bad enough, those processes will work as intended. I know most Americans have turned away from their civic duties and let things get pretty bad over here, but like Churchill said we'll eventually get it right after exhausting all other possibilities. Ultimately the only people who can protect our collective rights are we ourselves.

The point I was trying to make, and failed miserably, is that ""contract law"" does not require people to perform according to the contract if the terms are very one sided or unfair.

Banning them would not only cost a shit ton of money and loss in jobs and angry citizens.


When it comes to to weed. I would not want it to be legalized for casual use. Medicinal, hell yes. I do however think that the laws concerning incarceration based on carrying such drugs need a massive reconstruction. It's total shit.

But hey, maybe if they decriminalize drugs like Portugal they will see similar amazing effects and stop wasting money for crap maybe things would be better.","1277950953"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;It was originally crafted over 200 years ago, times have changed and just as not every article within it should be considered sacrosanct, some rights not guaranteed within it should

Yes, times have changed and the constitution itself has changed through this wondrous process we call ""amending it."" 

&gt;Yet if anyone suggests that the right to bear arms no longer makes sense he'll be crucified for attacking the constitution.

If they are advocating for ignoring the constitution, then yes, fuck them. If they are advocating for amending the constitution, then I would agree or disagree with them (depending on the suggested amendment) and explain why.  

&gt;I realize Americans have a strong sense of pride and patriotism but we have come along way since the Founding Fathers crafted the document, we have settled on some fundamental human rights some of which they hadn't even considered.

And it has been repeatedly amended.  It still needs change in my opinion, but this change must be accomplished constitutionally. 

&gt;I just don't think it is appropriate to weigh up every law on the background of the constitution anymore especially as the SCOTUS judges have, in many cases, made a mockery of it through their rulings.

I take it you are not an American. If you are an American, I am saddened by hearing this. The Constitution of the United States of America is the supreme law of the land. Our federal government's legitimacy comes from the constitution. If we ignore the constitution in governing, then we will have mob rule and no legitimate government. 

&gt;I'm not saying all of you do this and I'm also not saying that the Constitution isn't fundamental in protecting individuals rights. What I am saying is that times change, some articles in the constitution no longer make sense and some fundamental rights that should be contained within it aren't.

The Constitution has very little to do with rights. In fact, the Bill of Rights are just amendments, and many opposed adding them because people like you think that the Constitution a) is about the people's rights and b) these rights are given to us by our government and/or constitution. They are not. They are our rights. I have the right to bear arms. I have the right to free speech and freedom of religion. These are my rights. I was born with them and I will die with them.","1277950989"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","This stems from two different conceptions of art: art as *anything* creative, by this standard the best videogames and worst videogames are art, as are the best and worst movies, because artists worked on them.  Therefore Paris Hilton's my new BFF is just as much art as Shadow of the Colossus.  This is the conception of art Jerry is referring to in penny arcade.

The other conception of Art is the capital letter A Art. It is the view that only the best cultural relics can become art.  That _Twilight_ is not art, but _The Great Gatsby_ is.  This is the view that Ebert takes, and argues pretty persuasively (often).  By this interpretation of Art one could pretty easily argue that Mario 64 has no artistic merit.  It's very entertaining, but it doesn't prompt dark nights of the soul any more than The Amazing Race reruns.  This line of thinking is the one generally culturally accepted (although challenged by post-modern critics), and it allows Ebert to say that _Alvin and the Chimpmunks the movie_ is not art, even though kids may find it entertaining; while _Up_ is art.

The great debate within Ebert's view of art is ""what makes art into Art"" (note the capitals). This is where people can argue with Ebert on the level of his own assumptions (unlike Jerry from penny arcade who is arguing from a completely different set of assumptions).  If videogames can be art, why?  What do they do that no other medium does, and how does this experience translate into art?  What does this game make me feel, that no movie or book could make me feel?

Once you play on this standard I think the question of what games are art tends to shift.  For instance I don't think Braid or Heavy Rain would count as art, despite being great games.  Telling a good story does not make a game an automatic work of art.  It doesn't even make a book an automatic work of art.  Braid imitates a novel, whereas Heavy Rain imitates a movie (with some control stuff that helps immersion, but still not all the way there).  Neither really use the medium of video gaming to do something truly exceptional.

When I think of ""the most artistic game ever"" I think of _Portal_.  Portal would not function effectively as a movie, a series of short videos, a musical piece, or a book.  It only works because of the actions the player has to undertake in order to advance the story.  Its format of having many different levels, and then breaking free from the progression of levels, is the story of video-games themselves.  The way the character is revealed not by description or by directly showing you a picture of the character, but rather by looking at yourself through the core game mechanic. Plus it does very impressive things with the use of gender that are specific to video games as a genre.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","edit: Arg, ignore the following, which is long hand for this: for non-negative n, the RHS is just the first two terms in the binomial expansion of the LHS, so the inequality is clear.

Oh, I just thought of a better way for non-negative n. Write it as (1+1/2) ... (1+1/2) &gt;= 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/2 where there are n factors on the LHS and n 1/2s on the RHS. When you expand the LHS, you get one term of the expansion by chusing either a 1 or a 1/2 from every factor and multiplying all n of the choices together. In particular, if you chuse a 1 from every factor you get a 1 on the RHS. If you chuse a 1 from every factor expect one, and chuse a 1/2 from the last one, you get a term 1/2. Since there are n factors on the LHS, there are n ways you get a 1/2 like this so there are n 1/2s on the LHS. So already before getting all the terms you have 1+1/2+...+1/2 on the LHS. So since all the terms in the expansion are positive, the LHS is at least as large as the RHS.","1277951013"

You can launch the netbook-launcher inside the GNOME desktop and just do it that way, but it's not a solid solution.

**Doctor Manhattan**: Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing. And yet, in each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive; meeting; siring this precise son; that exact daughter... Until your mother loves a man she has every reason to hate, and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you, that emerged. To distill so specific a form from that chaos of improbability, like turning air to gold... that is the crowning unlikelihood. The thermodynamic miracle.

**Laurie Juspeczyk**: But... if me, my birth, if that's a thermodynamic miracle... I mean, you could say that about anybody in the world!

**Dr. Manhattan**: Yes. Anybody in the world... But the world is so full of people, so crowded with these miracles that they become commonplace and we forget... I forget. We gaze continually at the world and it grows dull in our perceptions. Yet seen from another's vantage point, as if new, it may still take our breath away. Come... dry your eyes.

I can't speak to the content of the courses that you took, but if you think there's an inappropriate emphasis, ask the instructor why the content is being covered and whether a particular theory is given scientific credence today.

Beyond what's above, knowing the history can also help people structure their knowledge about the present. There's a modern theory of self-control called ""ego-depletion theory"" that's formally unrelated to Freud, but happens to use one of his terms. Knowing Freud's work and definitions makes understanding the theory easier, though. The theory says that people draw on a resource to inhibit impulsive responses (or exert self-control generally). When that resource is depleted, people get worse at inhibition &amp; self-control. The theory makes no assumption of the existence of an ego, but that term is a convenient way of understanding the theory's mechanics: Freud's ""ego"" was the gatekeeper (or inhibiter) for the conflicting impulses of the id and the super-ego. If the ego is tired and can't act, uninhibited responding results.

Granted, the same theory could be expressed without any reference to Freudian concepts, but because the field knows those concepts, it's convenient to use them (without making any claim to the terms' veracity). Just as it's convenient to use ""feet"" as a unit of length, even though nobody regards as conceptually important the unit's anatomical origin.","1277951103"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","1. Hide your sniper dot.  This is a ""Don't walk here"" sign to the enemy.  Get good at twitching onto the target.
2. Learn your twitch-distance.  This means, learn the average amount of distance you need in order to accurately twitch onto target from the hidden-dot point.  Experiment.  Find what works.  Then practice, practice, practice, practice, and practice some more.  Fortunately, this should be fun - it's a game, after all.
3. Learn where to stand by playing other classes and watching other Snipers.  You'll figure it out.
4. Patience.  EVERYONE sucks playing Sniper at first - it's one of the hardest classes to get really good at because the measure of success or failure on a given shot is just whether you can mouse and click accurately.  This means a high ""skill ceiling"" - and a horrendous learning curve.  Experiment with mouse sensitivity settings until you find something that works for you.
5. Really, patience.  It takes a lot of practice.  I have the benefit of playing twitch-based shooting games for more than 15 years - I have developed the skill-set I need to do it not-badly.  You won't need that long hopefully, but getting REALLY skilled at it is going to take months.
6. Once you start being able to shoot accurately, here is your target priority, in order: Medics, Medics, Medics, Medics, and Medics.  You'll learn to gauge when Medics are *not* your top priority in the process of getting better, but generally speaking, having an even semicompetent Medic on the enemy team up and healing means their push is going to be twice as effective as it would otherwise be.  The ONLY exception to this rule is when you are being threatened by another Sniper who is good enough to hit you.  Can't do your job if you get headshotted, right?  You should get good enough at counter-sniping that you can quickly dispatch and enemy Sniper and then get back to your real job, which is killing the other team's Medics/the people they are healing.
7. Once you get Jarate, I strongly recommend using it all the time and getting used to having it, and NOT having a secondary weapon like the SMG.  The Razorback is kind of worthless unless you are a hardcore lone-wolf Sniper.  Jarate on the other hand is one of the most useful, versatile items in the entire game.  It marks Spies, so a Jarate'd Spy dying is REALLY dead; it extinguishes burning teammates; it causes area-of-effect mini-crits on the enemy.  Especially when you tag a whole bunch of people and they all blunder into a Pyro or Heavy, you and your teammate just owned the entire enemy team.","1277951124"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;Again, how could it exist if it wasn't allowed to exist?

From Babbage to Colossus: 90-some years. Free market? Nowhere to be seen.

When the war was over, the UK abandoned all its computer program. Free market? Again, nowhere. It was a different story in the US, where the government maintained interest, but it was also in the US where the market started paying attention to computers.

From somewhere around ENIAC to ARPA Net (21 years) the ""free market"" had time to invent networking. I'm sure you'll say that was impossible because the government was funding computers, but that's really not the case everywhere.

So, *one more time*, where was the free market? Even once networks started cropping up it seems to me that it wasn't that the government *forced* all these subsidies on the various corporations--they waited until they got subsidized to bother.

It surely didn't step in to help create computers prior to World War 2 (*possibly* excluding in Germany, with the Zuse machines). And again, it was the government and not the free market that started the internet ball rolling.

It seems to me that, in this instance, it's the government providing all the innovation and the ""free market"" that is doing nothing of interest. Doesn't that make the ""free market"" kind of useless? It's something that doesn't do anything if it does exist, and if it doesn't exist it's pointless because the whole thing is a hypothetical.

&gt;The way I see it both are part of the same thing. 

This is surely, unarguably, the case. Both are ideas. They are composed of and created by people.

&gt;Government is the result of such a legitimization as it is set up as a monopoly on violence, the only method and only organization deemed just to use violence for certain ends.

Better, of course, would be to have none--but then you end up with anarchism. Good luck convincing people that's a good idea.

&gt;Something being invented on government payroll simply doesn't change the fact that it was funded through coercion.

Has it ever occurred to you that, possibly, the ""coercion"" is almost completely irrelevant to the usefulness of the end product? You're focusing on one single aspect as though it was the alpha and omega of the question, yet it doesn't actually matter in reality.

&gt;What else would you have it be?

 I own a computer repair shop. Sometimes you really do need to format and run a clean install of the OS and all software. Some of the most pernicious viruses will write themselves into a hidden partition or System Restore and come back in a few days or weeks. or the MBR is so corrupted a recovery Console will not suffice.

 There is more to it than just reformatting and installing the OS. These days few computers come with a hard copy of Windows. On laptops, many drivers are missing after an initial wipe and install. tracking them down can be a major pain. Even on desk tops, drivers are often missing. Sadly, the most common driver absent is the ethernet or modem drivers. You cant update squat without internet access. Then there's updates, installing decent anti-virus and anti-malware apps, Java, Quicktime, Acrobat, FlashPlayer, etc... you need CD/DVD burning apps, to configure the OS and browsers for greater security, to tweak the Start up menu for which programs need to start up at boot and to take out the ones which only slow down boot up and running Windows.

 I do not format unless I honestly think it's in the customer's best interests. I never charge by the hour unless I am on a on site location and when I format and run a clean install, the customer gets all data backed up and all needed apps installed and updated. I don't believe in a half ass job and leaving the customer with 2 days of additional work.

Frankly... yes.  Why is it our job to save another people *from their own government* at great cost to us? 

&gt; As Tony Blair said a few months back (paraphrased): ""Even if we had had no information on WMDs, I would have taken us to war to get rid of Saddam.""

You might as well quote a talking parrot. 

&gt; Now... why Saddam why Saddam... Why Afghanistan.... Gee I wonder why. Why Iraq? Why the middle east? Why not a nation in the middle of Africa?

Saddam?  Oil and strategic positioning in the middle east.. yes that one was bullshit.  Afghanistan?  Because that's where 9/11 originated, and the Taliban needed to be driven out anyway (appeals were made to do it a decade before 9/11 but were dismissed).  Africa?  The cost for bennefit there is still too great, and we'd have to invade half of Africa.  Africa is really, really really big. 

Remember... every dollar you spend, every person you send, etc all adds up and it bleeds our own government and economy.  By helping everyone, you would essentially bleed yourself to death, and frankly many of these places don't have the education or understanding to even *want* us there.

How am I casting myself as a victim? Our relative good conditions should never stop us from demanding more. That's how we got to be so comfortable in the first place, by not settling for less and demanding more. That and removing those pesky natives from 'our' land.

&gt; So defending our borders, particularly the north, is useless now? So you expect this delicate peace to last forever? 

Who should we be defending our borders against exactly? Our only neighbor could **crush** us militarily. If anything, we should be shooting for a swiss military model combined with some minimal classic military model for peace keeping missions and coastal protection. The insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan prove that even the US' military might has trouble controlling the ground after an invasion. That's the kind of counter incentive we should equip ourselves with, our puny military is no match against the US.

We're not talking about whether or not safety regulations are needed. If they are needed in any industry, the automotive industry is certainly a good candidate for it. What we're simply talking about is what is driving technological advancement in two particular industries.

&gt;There's just few enough options while still some semblance of competition to keep Moore's law moving forward. Intel would cut way back on R&amp;D if they could milk Pentium 4's.

But they can't, because sufficient competition exists. It doesn't matter if the amount of competition is ""just enough,"" it's more than not enough. That's all I'm saying. Such an environment doesn't exist in the automotive industry.

&gt;There's also Word 2010 and Windows 7 which require the hardware advances.

That's just competition in related technologies resulting in better and better products. That these further advanced products require greater hardware needs is no argument against what I'm saying.

&gt;Let's not forget, those max MPG limits are there for good... what MPG checks and limits are written as max??? Are you describing consumer manipulation policies which had perverse incentives or regulations limiting the usefulness of cars? Agreed on the former, disagree on the latter.

Both. Let me you ask you: what are you disagreeing on when it comes to regulations limiting the usefulness of automobiles? That such regulations exist? Or that they're a bad thing? I want to make sure I understand you here.

&gt;The steep costs are NOT due to regulations. Seat belt design is cheap. Going from 0 cars to lots of cars profitably and competitively would cost a lot in terms of design, resources, training, staff, etc. The regulations are merely icing on the cake. Plenty of hand-made shops sell small quantities of niche market cars to rich wackos.

&gt;The steep costs are NOT due to regulations. Seat belt design is cheap. Going from 0 cars to lots of cars profitably and competitively would cost a lot in terms of design, resources, training, staff, etc. The regulations are merely icing on the cake.

There's a reason why economists and business journals typically oppose increased automotive regulations: they know that the increased regulation will drive up costs, lowering demand. Now what you're saying is absolutely true! It would cost a lot to go from zero cars to ""lots of cars"" profitably; but this doesn't happen anymore, because of the morass of regulations (and associated increases in start-up costs) preventing healthy competition.

&gt;Plenty of hand-made shops sell small quantities of niche market cars to rich wackos.

And these are of no threat to the giant automotive corporations. I'd much rather see new automotive companies and their financial backers bringing something new to the table. But, again, this is made all the more difficult by government interference.","1277951252"

At this stage you need to assure her that you also believe in the validity of her claims.  If you dismiss the premise that it is a medical condition she will shut you out.

Remember her belief is so strong that she is asking for unreasonable life changing conditions be met.  So strong that she as a mother choose to seperate from her children.  You need to take small steps over a long period of time.

You should persue a medical investigation.  Start with the family doctor and follow up with the specalists.  If she was exposed to toxins as a child it is possible she has a hyper immune response.

Next convince her to learn coping mechanisms.  This is your in for her to see a psychologist.  If she has an actual hyper response she can still learn tricks for her mental toolbox to allow her to cope.

"programming","t5_2fwo","The mix of checked and unchecked exceptions in Java is not the best design, but it doesn't justify giving up and denying the user knowledge of and control over the effects a program may have.  Indeed, the two big problems with Java's checked exceptions are (a) it's not a complete guarantee--there are still unchecked exceptions, and (b) adding in one method call somewhere might require you to change a lot of method signatures.

Fortunately, there's a simple alternative: stratified effects.  If you want to perform effect ""Log"" in a context which doesn't allow effect Log, instead wrap it in a statement which transforms it into a hide(Log) effect.  The hide(-) effect constructor has a special semantics: it doesn't match an effect wildcard.  What I mean by that is if you declare a computation like so:
    T allow(E1, E2), disallow(*)
this means a computation rendering a value of type T, possibly performing effects E1 and E2, but not performing any other effects... except for hidden effects.  If we want, we could disallow first-level hidden effects as well, like so:
    T allow(E1, E2), disallow(*, hide(*))
but this would still allow a second-level hidden effect, like hide(hide(X)).

The compiler can then perform type inference, checking that the effect constraints are satisfied.  For example, if you have a computation with signature ""T disallow(*)"", we might verify that it doesn't attempt to perform effect Log, but also propagate the information that it may perform effect hide(Log), which is compatible with the signature (since first-level hidden effects were not explicitly denied).

Finally, at the top level, the user chooses how many levels of hiding are allowed and what effects are allowed when running a program.

For example, you might run your program in debug mode allowing first-level--or even all--hidden effects.  But I might not trust your program that much, so I would want to verify that its only hidden effects are hide(Log).  Or I might find you do perform some additional hidden effects, like checking the current time or my IP address (presumably for logging purposes), and I might want to run those operations in a simulated environment.  Now, strictly speaking, this latter use case on its own could be done entirely dynamically, just like unchecked exceptions.  But if we're going to have effect annotations at all (which is where this whole discussion started), then a program which performs effects, even hidden effects, composed with a context which catches and simulates *all* of those effects without performing any other effects should be typed as effect-free.

Metal Slug is an example of masterful game design - but until you actually play it lots and learn the intricacies of it (like any great work) it'll just look like a cute 2D man blowing up enemy soldiers.

"Equality","t5_2qtp5","&gt;The problem with such a parent is that he is planning to live his entire existence with his child on the shame-pride axis, where everything his child does is rated according to whether it makes her father proud or ashamed. You want a child who never makes you anything but proud? Please. Don't bother taking on parenthood if you can't handle the fact that sometimes your child's identity  won't be what you would have chosen. And if you want to prevent a child from ever suffering? Well, then don't have a child. No one is born into the world never to suffer.

&gt;Is having a child with a less-than-idealized identity or anatomy sometimes really hard? Yup. And when you sign up for parenting, that's part of what you're signing up for. You can't seriously expect your whole parenting experience to consist of softball trophies and bumper stickers that brag about your Honor Roll child. It is not your child's job in life to make you proud. It is your job to make your children proud of you as their parent.","1277951398"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You list things as fact, that aren't.  Studies have conclusively proved nothing.  For every study that says ""pot is bad"", there's others that show it has medicinal value.  Like anything however, it can have a downside.  You can drink so much water, that you deplete your blood of nutrients, and die, so anything out of moderation, and there can be detrimental effects.  I read every article I come across on this subject, and most are purely yellow journalism, with the intention of keeping people in the dark about this plants potential.  

To attack your key points, any smoking reduces oxygen flow to the womb, so yes, pot and cigarettes would probably have the same effect on reducing body weight of an infant, so no expectant mother should smoke while pregnant.  Many medications are legal, with a prescription, that have on the label, don't even let a pregnant woman touch this pill, or have a flipper-baby.  You don't see all those medications pulled off the shelves.  

You mention reaction time and judgement being affected by cannabis, the latest article I read refuted your argument, basically a college tested students driving ability stoned versus not stoned, and found the stoners drive safer, more slower and more careful.  

Regarding habit forming, I definitely have experienced a dependancy on the herb, but it's more psychological than physical, and withdrawal lasts about 3 days, or being cranky, as opposed to cigarettes, where a month might not be enough time, to prevent a relapse.  I smoke both so can speak from experience.  I'm trying to quit cigarettes now, and they are the greater threat to my health, but even I see moderation  is the goal to all things, and perhaps learning to bake pot brownies, might save my lungs.  

Regarding your argument that cannabis causes cancer, all studies have proven no link between the two, and only mention it, because cigarettes cause cancer.  If one type of smoke does it, the other must as well?  Actually, all studies, have shown a reduction in cancer rates in pot smokers, so now, they are actually looking for anti-cancer properties in medicinal marijuana, suspecting there's an active ingredient in pot, because pot smokers show none of the rates of cancer, as cigarette smokers, and actually a reduced rate when compared against the rest of the population. 

Pot does cause emphysema, which is a dangerous lung condition, but this argument is moot, when you consider that pot can be also ingested, or eaten, in both food form. It's active ingredients can be extracted using oil or alcohol, so you could have a bottle of essence of cannabis, like the vanilla extract in your spice rack, and bake cookies, using this, or a salad dressing, and get the medicinal effects that way, while avoiding smoking it altogether, and therefore any risk of emphysema, or potentially cancer. Although, as I've said, major pharmaceutical companies are spending millions right now, trying to make an anti-cancer drug from pot.  Burn anything, even a grilled hotdog, and you've created cancer-causing substances.

I would actually agree with you on one fact.  That pot can make you unmotivational, but that really depends on the person.  What I've found is pot's effect for some people, that it makes them content for a little while.  This makes them couch-locked.  For the people it makes paranoid, don't smoke it.  I've found it affects everyone differently.  If you've tried it twice, and it makes you paranoid, it's not yer poison.  The fact that pot, can make you content, can be a bad thing.  You don't have to change, yourself, your life, your views on things.  This is it's worst side effect, besides the price.  Did you know, it's legal to grow your own personal tobacco, but not pot?  

Another bad side-effect, is it makes you less able to handle life's little stresses, when you ain't got a bowl at the ready.  I read an article, that disputed the latest arguments that pot causes schizophrenia, but this article did say, that pot initially helped schizophrenics with their symptoms, and after the effects of the pot passed, their symptoms worsened.  I'd say, it makes you a little mentally dependant on that state of calm it provides.  So, too much, can be too much, like anything, use moderation.  I'm starting to realize myself, that exercise, is nature's way of keeping all things in the body regulated, and running like a good watch.  It still doesn't make me want to vilify pot, for my own mistakes.  

You can't overdose on pot, as you'll just fall asleep, so there's no deaths per year for pot.  Christ, even garden hoses kill more people per year.  Truthfully, it's illegal, because it's makes some people think.  It feeds the artistic side of some people, and God knows, the world doesn't need people who are emotionally mature.  Let's all be children with guns.  Cigs and alcohol are legal, not because ""We the People"" demand it, but because they provide a steady supply of corpses to the morgues and money to the state.  

I once read an article by a doctor, that was pro-drugs, and by the end of it, I'm all for the legalization of all drugs, without a prescription.  If you want to fuck yourself, it's up to you.  Educate yourself on your health, don't drop it in the doctor's lap.  He's got malpractice insurance, so his ass is covered, if he fucks your life.  Why should medicine, and it's access be determined by your paycheck?  Let the little blind kid, keep stumbing around, fuck em, he can't pay.  Oh wait, can't do that to the disabled, but are ya poor, oh ok then.  Please stop spreading misinformation.  Thank you.  

I'm sorry if I'm coming off as an attack on you, but you have to understand the information war, that has been waged on this plant, and it still is.  I have to weigh every word I read, to determine the truth.  Fucking yellow journalism.  Everybody's got their slant on things.  People are tired of hearing the same old lies, so you're going to get hammered, for repeating them.  Look at it this way, can't judge a man, unless you walk in his shoes, imagine whatever thing you like to eat, or drink the most, being made illegal.  You can lose your house, you car, your job, your bank account seized, even before the trial begins, and later your freedom, your friends, any access to financial aid, or unemployment, possibly all social services, that we all don't want to use, but it's nice to have a safety net, all for eating bacon.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","This website can help you compare some different options: http://snapsort.com/.

One important thing to keep in mind while you're buying your first kit is that you might also want some accessories like as a tripod, filters, flash, a shutter release cable, lens hoods and a bag. You also need the obvious SD cards, although you probably have some from your point and shoots.

A major piece of advice I would give you is to budget a good portion of your money to buy a lens, since the lens is a major component of your image quality. I would definitely recommend a 50mm 1.8 regardless of which brand you go with, since it can be had for ~100$ and gives you lots of creative control with the wide aperture. You can also look into different lens types depending on what you like to shoot. 

If you shoot landscapes or architecture, you want a wide angle. If you like to shoot sports or wildlife, you'll want a telephoto lens. If you do portraits, you'll want a fast, short to mid range telephoto lens. A good general purpose lens to have (even if you're not sure what you like to shoot) is the kit lens that comes with the camera (typically an 18-55 or similar). You can always expand later, but if you specifically shoot one of the options above, I'd recommend looking into a lens in that range.

As for bodies, you can save some money if you go for a XS or XSi, but if you want video you'll have to go with the T2i, or the older T1i.

You might enjoy looking at the www.photography-on-the.net forums for more information.

FWIW I have a Canon Rebel XSi (so yes, I am biased towards Canon) with the 18-55 IS kit lens, a 50mm 1.8 and a Tokina 11-16 2.8, and I enjoy it.

DISCLOSURE: I shoot Canon, so if you're looking at Nikon or any other brand, follow the wonderful advice from others.","1277951524"

And then when they finally got their guy in office, his administration went even FURTHER with wiretapping and state secrets privileges (just to name two) than the previous one, while escalating the wars, pitching trillions to big banks, and failing on every one of his major promises (but if you're tracking the *number* of promises, then ""getting a Portuguese water dog"" and ""not closing Guantanamo"" both are worth 1 point and cancel each other out).

So I'd say RATM got it right.  Big corps. lobby BOTH SIDES so it doesn't matter who gets into office.  He'll always turn out to be ""their guy"".

As long as those rights do exist, why not respect them?  Why not act within the law of our democratic society and respect legitimate legal interests of artists, however ill-conceived? 

A violation of a statutory right without the consent and with the protest of the holder of that right is a harm.   ","1277951606"

Because esophageal cancer usually is not diagnosed until the disease has spread, the death rate is high. Fewer than 5% of people survive more than 5 years. Many die within a year of noticing the first symptoms. Because nearly all cases of esophageal cancer are fatal, the doctor's main objective is to control symptoms, especially pain and the inability to swallow, which can be very frightening to the person and loved ones (see Death and Dying: Difficulty Swallowing).

2) YES, it is a direct quote... from the meeting minutes taken from record. Just as the news caster *specifically* verbally told you it was. What your point here is, I don't exactly know. Angle specifically acknowledged that was her position, so there is not possible point of contention here. He cited meeting minutes which accurately portrayed Angle's position.

She went on to claim (in the full video that i posted) that the separation of church and state was *only* to protect the church, and not the state. this is wholly incorrect.

3) she can claim having been taken out of context, and she attempts to explain it fully [3:45 in to vid 3](http://www.lasvegassun.com/videos/face-face/). yet she is allowed to fail horribly, and her explanation actually hurts her cause immensely, with a horrible interpretation that a single speech by lincoln is supposed ""proof"" that the constitution is to provide religion safe refuge from the government, but not the other way around as well. are we to now judge the constitution's intent based on cherry picked speeches by cherry picked founders? because that is *precisely* what angle is doing here.

4) That federal funds are not given to private christian schools at the exclusion of all other possible schools of faith (including muslim, jewish, and flying spaghetti monster) goes far beyond your ""non-legal concept"" of separation of church and state, and rests fairly soundly within the constitutionally established guidelines of the Establishment Clause and a Free Exercise Clause, and the Supreme Court's definition of ""excessive entanglement"" between government and religion.

Rippers usually pay for the original releases (sure, there are other ways to obtain them too) which they rip, tag and spread. Which is also time consuming

*This is because ultimately, Keynesian fiscal stimulus is not even about  the goods and services produced by the additional spending (infrastructure, welfare, etc). You see, the fiscal stimulus might as well be literally filling holes, since according to Keynes's ridiculous understanding of how an economy works, it doesn't matter what  the government spends money on; even digging up holes just to refill them would qualify as beneficial stimulus. You might think that this must not be literally true. ""Keynes may have been wrong on some things,"" you may protest, ""but no economist as prominent as him would believe something so foolish!"" Read the man's words for [yourself](http://books.google.com/books?id=LlwH4tXQWYUC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=%22If+the+Treasury+were+to+fill+old+bottles%22+general+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=snQGLMqljx&amp;sig=icyrbgFVKocM-xlKrIfND-RP1XU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mgVdSpKsFoKysgPuvbm3Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3):*

&gt;*If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course, by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. It would, indeed, be more sensible to build houses and the like; but if there are political and practical difficulties in the way of this, the above would be better than nothing.*

*The above passage is not some off-hand note written to a colleague in a fit of academic speculation. It is part of Keynes's chief contribution to economics, upon which his reputation rests: The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. I don't care how prominent, credentialed, or ""accomplished"" an economist is. If he says that burying cash in the ground can be a boon to society, then he should be immediately dismissed from public and academic discourse.*

*The simple fact that Krugman regards such a fellow as an exemplar of economic scholarship would be highly telling by itself. ""Okay,"" you might think, ""Keynes was a bit extreme. But Krugman himself wouldn't go so far as to believe something like that.""*

*Wrong again. In April, Krugman actually bemoaned the fact that Obama's stimulus projects were under budget.*

&gt;*President Obama [hails the fact](http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE53C3LT20090413) that stimulus projects are coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. Yay — but boo.*

&gt;*Ahead of schedule is good. Under budget — well, ordinarily that's a good thing. But the point of the stimulus is to increase spending!*

*That's right: Krugman would, all other things being equal, prefer government stimulus spending to be inefficient. He then goes on to quote the very same ridiculous passage from Keynes's General Theory, which I quoted above, but favorably. And the title of the piece in which he made this complaint? [""Time for Bottles in Coal Mines.""](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/14/time-for-bottles-in-coal-mines/)*

*I told you he's hard core.*

*This brings me to a side point I'd like to make. One might think that in writing in such, let's say ""direct,"" language, I'm needlessly vilifying both Keynes and Krugman. I certainly wouldn't write this way about just anyone who I happened to disagree with. But, as should now be evident, Keynesians are special. Their economic doctrines are so fallacious, and their policies are so destructive that, for the sake of truth and humanity, one cannot be too forthright in denouncing them.*","1277951695"

Their craft is based on persuasion and convincing and boy, have I been fleeced in the past. 

Would you consider yourself a professional sales person and what do you think of other sales people in other sectors, say real estate, voluntary charity people, infomercial gurus, politicians and lawyers? Can you always sense where they are promoting their product and where they are pushing a lie? 

Also, how well do you take rejection. Some people work the numbers game and are immune to the effects of rejection. Spammers IRL. How adept are you of the art and how do you know when to stop pushing a product to retain some of your dignity and some respect for your client?

I worked in a medium sized business after I stopped doing ISP support and had my hands on everything.  I coded a few small tools with Visual Studio, automated several things for other departments via Excel, learned a lot about basic troubleshooting as relates to Active Directory, and even still I could not find a job that was not a bottom feeder helpdesk job.

Right now I'm doing web development / sys admin work with a startup.  I got the job because I know a guy there.  Sure they could have hired someone more competent, but it would have been quite a bit more expensive too.

Frankly I don't see myself leaving this job for another one even after I have more skills just because this job has too many benefits and the guy that I work for is actually an extremely nice guy.  Its definitely odd not to have a phb for a manager.","1277951703"

So ""men's issues"" are the ones getting attention and results by default.

There's still debate over abortion, and something as important as affordable medical care for everyone got passed over because of the practice.

He convinces two other characters to go through with a rape and murder, resulting in the rape and mutilation of Lavinia and the murder of her betrothed. He then frames two other men for the murder, who are then killed by the emperor. Aaron convinces Titus to chop off his own hand to appease the emperor and spare the falsely accused men, when Titus doesn't know that they've already been executed.

Aaron also fostered a bastard child with the emperor's wife, Tamora. The nurse that discovered this is prompted killed by Aaron to keep it a secret. When Titus buries him up to his chest to make him pay for his crimes Aaron says,

I watched this for a minute, astounded... and then said something along the lines of ""Look, I can understand if this is a regular habit you two have when you go to dinner, but when I break bread with other people, half of the point of the meal is to share a conversation.

The way he tries to pass himself off as a 'serious' scientist yet all the while trying to show how Noah's Ark was real, the way he purloined and mangled the real scientific work of many of his harshest critics to try and support his argument.

The problem is though, the demographic for the massives are not really ravers. When I went, about 40% of the people I encountered were there just to try and score drugs.

They want to retain and cater to low-income customers who will study and buy off of the dollar menu, but they also want to absorb the consumer surplus from higher earning consumers who won't take much time to compare menu items and just order something iconic and memorable.

So they will put lower priced items with new names on the dollar menu, and price iconic and memorable items (such as hamburger, cheeseburger, Big Mac, etc.) higher.

What the items contain and how much value they represent (as opposed to how much they cost) is of secondary importance. They're probably still making a profit on the McDouble.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had just gotten divorced and, wanting to get out of the city and away from my rapidly disintegrating life, went to visit my sister in Wisconsin.  We ended up at the local fireworks display.

I was sitting on the curb by myself people watching when I noticed a group of kids.  All of the kids were around 14 or 15 and one in particular caught my attention.  He was dressed in skinny jeans and T-shirt and had bright pink hair.  From his voice and mannerisms, he was gay.

As I sat on the curb, I marveled at his confidence.  I go through my life doing everything I can to fit in and here was a kid doing his own thing and still surviving.

As I said, my life had, at least on the surface fallen apart.  I was miserable and feeling sorry for myself.  Really sorry for myself.  As I sat and watched this kid, it suddenly occurred to myself that I was the luckiest son of a bitch on the planet and that I needed to get my shit together and be honest with myself.

That night, the 4th of July, as I sat watching fireworks and a group of teenagers, for the first time, I fully admitted to myself that I was gay.  It was the best feeling in the world.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I've been to two Tea Party rallies, and saw/heard no racist invective. Which isn't to say that there isn't any racism, of course, but certainly not enough to paint the entire movement with the same brush.

When you consider that at it's peak, the Tea Party had 60-65% approval ratings, that means presumably there were more than a few liberal/Democratic/Obama supporters in the mix. If you insist on characterizing The Tea Party as racists, you should be ready to point that finger back towards your own side of the fence.

Which you probably should, anyway. I'm from MA, a liberal state, and I've always hung around in cafes, rock bars and pretty bohemian, pretty liberal circles. I know exactly the sort of reaction I get when I tell somebody I just got back from a Latino party. I know what the flamingly liberal, uber-activist, WTO-protesting girl I used to date had to say one night after I ran into her drunk self, shortly after a black guy knocked her up and left her. I won't repeat it here, but it made Mel Gibson's drunken rant sound pretty wholesome, and it's similar to what I've heard supposedly tolerant liberals shout when they get cut off in traffic by a minority.

Sorry, but much of the howling about racism from some leftists is a matter of them, um... Doth Protesting Too Much.

The desire to characterize The entire Tea Party as racists was desperate, and proof that liberals had, and still have no idea how to respond to it. And it was really the only card they could play. It's not like their typically anti-corporate selves could justify the bailouts, or make up for the fact they elected -and *refuse* to protest- a guy who continues to bomb the fuck out of brown people, and a VP who  authored The Patriot Act.

So they did what they usually do-sit on the sidelines, ineffectially howling about racism and hate speech.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I'm Korean and I'm aware that the 2002 team basically cheated the other teams. I don't follow football that closely, but did they ever figure out why the referees made such terrible calls? Is there proof that Korea bribed the refs? Or did FIFA just want Korea to advance to increase Asian popularity?

It seems every time I hear about the South Korean football team I hear about how they cheat and are dirty players. But unless there is hard evidence that Korea bribed the officials, I put the blame on the referees and not on the Korean team who saw an advantage and took it. If the referees enforced their authority then the players wouldn't play so aggressively. I remember hearing one of the referees making the controversial calls was notorious for his bad calls and even allowed a game's stoppage time to go on for 13 minutes when he called for 2, leading to a game breaking goal.

But then this all falls apart if there is evidence of bribery or cheating...

Looking at the match highlights against Portugal (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szfPdMOITSM) I don't seem to see any biased calls against the very skilled Portugal team. The first red card is perfectly justified and the yellow card (2nd yellow for Pinto) has little room for argument. But the cheating controversy comes in against Spain and Italy - it would be great if someone could shed light on these two games for me, because I was quite young back then and don't remember the games that well.

Excuse me for any obvious dumb points I bring up, for I just recently started watching soccer. Just a question: There have been several terribly calls in the 2010 world cup, like England's ""goal"", Kaka being sent off, etc. Isn't it just possible the FIFA referees are just doing a terrible job?","1277951891"

As for your deadlift weight, I'll just quote the [wiki](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:The_Program#What_weight_should_I_start_with_during_the_first_week.3F):
&gt; The way the ""first day"" is explained in Starting Strength, the trainee warms up with the bar, then adds a bit of weight and does a set of 5. The bar speed will be identical from set to set. Continue to add weight and do sets of 5 until the speed of the barbell begins to slow.. Keep the weight there and perform 2 more sets with this weight. That is your first ""3 sets of 5"" workout for that exercise.

&gt; Yes, this is low. It allows for a certain fudge factor that is present when dealing with a novice's ability to evaluate his own technical performance.

&gt; Generally, if a newb says ""I benched 135 x 5 for the first time, my technique was great!"", what he really means is that ""I benched 135 x 5, but I probably should've only used about 120 or 125""

&gt; Be on the safe side, start lighter than you think you need to, and go from there. This also helps develop a base of conditioning with slightly less weight than absolute max, which helps reduce initial DOMS.

&gt; Let me say that once again.

&gt; *Start off using weight that is LOWER than you think you can handle, and progress upward. It is better to use weight that is too light than weight that is too heavy.*","1277951901"

3. The kind of place you are looking for seems closer to Boulder or Golden, ESPECIALLY since you mentioned mountains. Boulder can be rather expensive, but the surrounding communities are surprisingly cheap. Also, US36 connects the Boulder corridor to Denver, so again: RTD and good highways are your friends.

For about 60 years, comics have reflected America’s view back onto itself.  Captain America helped US servicemen forget the horrors of WWII and escape into a world where a superhuman defender of the American Way routinely defeated the powerful übermen of the Nazi menace.

""Well!"" piped up the wise, wise, wise grandfather. ""After keeping silent this whole time, I feel it is my duty to interrupt. It makes all the difference in the world on why the information was chosen to be introduced. Imagine a room full of statisticians at a party. The host of the party has invited 100 mothers, each with 2 children. 25 of them have BB, 25 have BG, 25 have GB, and 25 have GG. The host decides to play 2 games with his guests.
_____________________________________________________________

Game 1:

The host gathers all the mothers. He says, 'When I release you into the room of statisticians, each of you go up to someone if you have a boy and say 'I have two children, at least one of whom is a boy'. The mothers obey. Each statistician guesses a probability of 1/3, which is correct because out of the 75 mothers with a boy, only 25 had two boys.
_____________________________________________________________

Game 2: 

The host gathers all the mothers. He says, 'When I release you into the room of statisticians, each of you go up to someone and say, 'I have two children, at least one of whom is a (fill in the blank with the sex of one of your children)'. The mothers obey. This time, only 50 mothers say they have a boy, while 50 say they have a girl. out of the 50 who say they have a boy, 25 have BB and 25 have a boy and girl. Each statistician who hears 'I have two children, at least one of whom is a boy' guesses that there is a 1/3 chance that the other sibling is a boy. But in reality (and this can be easily solved, i'll let you do it), exactly half of those mothers had both children as boys. So the statisticians were wrong, because they made false assumptions about the rules of the game. They thought they were playing Game 1, instead of Game 2. 
______________________________________________________________


We could go even further and imagine a 3rd Game where all the mothers who have at least 1 girl say 'I have two children, at least one of whom is a girl.' Now only 25 of the mothers (the ones with BB) will say 'I have two children, at least one of whom is a boy'. Each statistician who hears it guesses a probability of 1/3 that the other is a boy, but since only the 25 who had BB said it, the probability of someone saying it and having two boys is 100%.


Remember, the WHY is everything. The WHY is the ""rules of the game"". If some random person approaches you on the street and lets you know they have 2 kids, one of whom is a boy, It is most rational to assume they are playing Game 2, not Game 1. If you would like to force Game 1, it is necessary for you to approach a random person with 2 kids and ask if at least one of them is a boy. Assuming they answer you truthfully, you are playing Game 1 because all the people with BG and GB are in the same pool as the people with BB. This is what I would call 'Selecting for a boy'.""


The grandfather then yawned, and slowly fell asleep with a small stream of drool slowly dribbling down the side of his mouth.




____________________________________________



EDIT: But all joking aside, I do see your point about it being impossible to choose completely randomly which child to report about, and it is certainly possible that the BB's just happened to report their status to you less often. However, with probability, we have to make the best assumption possible that is also reasonable, and I think it's most reasonable to assume Game 2 is being played (it is certainly more reasonable than Game 1!) in the case that a random stranger gives you facts about their children.","1277951943"

I consider Californian accentless English. I realize that's not true and that everyone does in fact have an accent, but to me (and to most of the U.S., I'd say) California is accentless because we've been inundated with it on television for 50 years. In fact, I'd say American English is slowly homogenizing. Watch a TV show made in America. Chances are the main character speaks with a ""California-ized"" accent for mass consumption. They may have a hint of another region in their voice, but for the most part voices are more bland on TV so that everyone can understand/appreciate it. Frankly, I wish I had a different accent so my voice sounded more interesting.

Which of those factors is most important to you?  If you're only looking for a laptop that runs office, power isn't the most important, but maybe battery life and size is.  Then you could go for a Core 2 with amazing battery life rather an a i3 or i5 laptop.  If you don't mind carrying around something big, a larger screen would help for movies.  If you want something that is very small and mobile, you will probably have to get by with a Core 2 rather than an i3/i5.

I realized this before when a friend of mine who works for a game company explained to me about game piracy. From then on I bought only original games whenever I can. But a lot of original things are not even available around me (I kind of live in a middle of nowhere). Original music, films and games are hard to be found except some really famous ones which I don't want. Sure, I can always buy them from the internet but there are time delays for shipping and risk of losing the item in shipment. Piracy is so much worse in small countries because of this.

Sure, there are some sites who sell these things digitally where you can pay &amp; download them but there are still inconveniences. I really like the Steam system because it's simple, accepts PayPal and the download is fast. There should be more services like it for movies, music, etc.

The most annoying thing is the ridicule.

IQ tests are good for testing groups of people from similar cultural and genetic backgrounds.  The more variation you introduce from person to person, the more likely the results will become less reliable.  IQ is not something you can quantitatively measure on its own.  It's a value that is looked at in respect to the scores of peers. 

There are any number of reasons why an adopted child may perform unlike his or her peer group in his or her new home.  Was the biological mother a drug user or undernourished?  Was early development affected due to lack of interaction while awaiting adoption?  Adoptive parents are often more highly educated, in a higher income bracket,  and older than parents with only natural born children.  This can affect the thinking process of an adoptive child as well.

There are too many variations to make any definitive statements about IQ across cultures.  At best, you can make a rough estimate, but even the staunchest tester will tell you there are bias problems in standardized tests.  This can, and does, skew the results.

As far as that goes, it has nothing to do with the evolution of human IQ.  It has everything to do with how the tests are written and how they are administered. ","1277952062"

"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","How shocking, a thread of redditors balking at the idea that the internet could have *any* deleterious effect on our brains. From the comments here I can only assume most only skimmed the article. And unfortunately I'm not saying that for comic effect.

No, boojit, there's nothing peculiar or novel about the unhealthiness of doing any one thing at the exclusion of others. Too bad no one is making that claim or else that would be a dynamite rebuttal. The mechanism is not new or peculiar, as Carr even points out, it's just more universal and more immersive and more all-encompassing than ever before in the form of our wired, internet culture. And no, Derrekito, no one is advocating hypochondria. In fact, just what you say, ""I think we should be concerned with everything we are exposed to"" is precisely what Carr's contention is. That's it!

The issue at hand is, How worthwhile is the discussion regarding the internet's effect on our brains? If you think it's frivolous, as Pinker seems to, you should do better than merely scoff for several paragraphs. If you think it's meaningless because ""it's what's happening and there's nothing we can do about it,"" then you should just say so and be well aware of what your argument implies about human helplessness.

More precisely, that people can take ""This is an important discussion that we need to have because there are some troubling indicators about the way our wired culture is impacting our brains and cognitive skills"" and twist that into ""RAWR! Internet bad! We should all live in fear! RAWR! The internet is monster that will eat us all! AAAHH!!!"" really reveals, I think, how *personally* invested many of us are in our wired, internet-based lives that we are offended at the *mere notion* of discussing and questioning such an influence.

And as a personal note, I love reddit and I'm a big fan of the internet. But I'm also a longtime meditator. One thing you realize early on in meditation is that the mind really can only focus on one thing at a time, but it skips around so much that it creates the illusion of ""multitasking."" You also see that the more it skips around the more diffuse your attention is and the weaker your energy, concentration, and ability to deeply investigate... well pretty much anything. As a species, we have always been addicted to distraction, it's not novel in the slightest, but we may be becoming unwitting masters of it. In my opinion, anyone who spends any amount of time on the internet and doesn't recognize its overall impact on their brains is someone who doesn't know their mind all that well to begin with... which is most people.","1277952124"

Robert Moses, a famous New York architect, had designed these bridges in the thirties and in doing so had made certain that the New Yorkers had no other possibilities of reaching the beaches but on just these highways. Winner noticed that these bridges are built very low, and that only automobiles could pass under them. Public buses, on the other hand, cannot pass. Having grown suspicious, Winner took a closer interest in Moses and his bridges. The situation was soon cleared up: Moses had intentionally had his bridges built so low to keep typical users of public transport, at that time the poorer strata of the population and especially blacks, away from the beaches and to reserve these for the white middle classes. Decades after Moses’ death, the resentments of a singular person are  then incorporated in his bridges as an ongoing social injustice ...

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I came to the belief that all psychoactive materials result in a different state of being. You can compress all of the differences down to 'good' or 'bad', 'harmful' or 'harmless', but in the end you are losing massive amounts of information.

I will try to say what I think without losing as much information

In terms of 'harmful' for the body I think that it degrades the short term health of lungs sigificantly, however I believe that it does not cause cancer at a high rate. I believe that overall smoking marijuana is bad for the body, but so is walking in any location where lots of gas is burnt (any large US city).

In terms of 'harmful' for the mind, I think that part of what hallucinogens do is work more in developing ideas then implementing them. I believe that they can 'free your mind' to a certain small degree, in that they slightly anchor it from reality, you just have to be careful to re-anchor it correctly. This can be use very useful as I believe that no one understand everything, you can always get closer to the truth, but you could easily stray father if you are not careful with drugs or any powerful noun in that case (person, concept, object etc). I really enjoy the ideas I get while I am stoned, but understand that they not be 100% right, as any idea would be, they just look especially golden when I am high. I believe that it is frequently much harder to execute an idea while high, doing long boring tasks can be hellish when you know you can go off and do something fun.","1277952167"

The fear was that the Confederates would set up artillery on Little Round Top and fire down on the entire Union line, but the hill was actually not very favorable for artillery to shoot at targets along Cemetary Ridge (the union line). My tour guide argued that the defense of Culp's Hill (on the opposite side of the battlefield) by Greene was more important because, if lost, Culp's Hill would have actually been a good position for artillery as well as entirely collapsing the union's fishhook fomation. Alternatively, had Little Round Top been lost, the next regiment along the line (the 83rd Pennsylvania) would have just bent their formation and held the line just as well.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;Ostracization and withdrawal of protection by the community should be enough to dissuade most people, if it were one of the parents take the child away immediately (forcefully if necessary).

This is a great point. but it should also be emphasized that ""child molestation/rape"" (or, insert any other serious crime) have not been stopped by the State/Federal governments, and I haven't seen any arguments, compelling or otherwise, that indicate that the current state of affairs is anything near adequate.  Something like 80-90% of rape victims never report the violation to authorities.  That says something about either the system, or its (in)ability to track down and prosecute these fuckers, or both.

So, it's not like we live in this perfect world and by introducing teh dread anarchy, the practice of ""rape"" or whatever which has been totally stamped out by the State is going to once-again rear its ugly head and now we'll have to deal with it - but the very question kind of presupposes that the system we have is pretty good (if not optimal) **and** that an anarchist/polycentric/etc. system would be inferior.

This is not a ""worry"". It's common fucking sense, somehow you have it and it won't go away. If even sex can't make it evaporate, then I regret to inform you that you will always be so-cursed.

&gt; We are extremely safe.

No, you aren't. You're a teenage dufus. You have no idea how to be safe. And even if you do, 4 billion years worth of pent-up biology is yearning to be free, and it's good at what it does.

&gt; ut, always in my head is the idea that she can get pregnant,

That's because she can. There are documented cases of blowjobs where the woman didn't lick her lips, a stray drop went the wrong way, and 9 months later they named it some dumbass 80s name. 

&gt; Needless to say, it's messing with me and my girlfriend's enjoyment 

Here's something to think about: while sex is fun, maybe you should stop thinking of it as goddamned recreation, you fucktard. That would help. While I have no illusions that it's possible for any healthy person to abstain, and while I sure as hell don't want an ijit like you marrying... if you had even half a brain maybe you'd consider that there are other things that present no great risk of pregnancy. You don't have to stuff your tiny little dick in her twat. This is reddit, someone can draw you a picture if necessary.

Looking back at this statement, 

&gt;  Even if 10% of this area is destroyed by this oil spill, this even is worse than having 60,000 square miles of farm land destroyed because

This totally depends on what your metric is you're using to quantify “destruction”, which is not trivial by any means (net loss of calories/joules, biomass, # of organisms, loss of organisms humans eat, time it takes to return to normal, etc?).  I would personally measure it by a loss of productivity (primary productivity alone would be easiest to measure accurately, not that it's easy to begin with though).  I'm willing to bet that the productivity of a farmland is much more dense than what's produced in the open ocean, so they aren't fair to compare against one another 1:1, even if we didn't have to worry about depth.  For a more obvious example: I would disagree with anybody claiming that contaminating 1 square km of death valley is equivalent to contaminating 1 square km of rain forest, right?  The biomass distribution in the open gulf is (at least I'm guessing) much lower than the density of what you find in farmlands.  Again, it's totally up to however you choose to measure it.  I still stand by the general point that measuring destruction purely in geographic terms (as opposed to biological/ecological metrics) can be misleading.","1277952233"

* The ""sniffers"" put on trading volume allowing large trading houses to enter/exit positions in nanoseconds and make profits at the individual trader's expense
* The lack of any decent options to get return that keeps up with inflation other than the stock market

That last bullet is how the currency inflation fits into the web of wealth transfer.  Savers are penalized by their savings literally evaporating.

This law states that everyone can buy 1Mbits connection to their permanent residence with reasonable price. This mandates operators to build networks for areas which do not now have this capability yet. Operators are in this map by area.

pdf map: http://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/5mnR4nbbr/kartta_yp-yritykset.pdf

Outside urban areas operators are in monopoly situation almost always, but the owner of the network has to rent it to other operators with regulated prices.

Both are regulated by Ficora ( http://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/index.html ) which is somewhat our version of FCC.

In urban areas connections are a lot faster. Like for me 30/30Mbits for 10€/month.

This is done because of future competitive edge and most of services like student support/loans, schools, banking, tax returns etc. are online 

Our water and electricity networks work sameway.

I'm sleepy and English is my second language :P

EDIT:
As some people have said most people don't get connection that cheap. They have been putting optical fiber about a year in fast pace in to the ground in densely populated areas. Outside these areas connections usually max out at 24/1 ADSL2+ which is something like 40-50€.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","&gt;To say that all drugs should just be legal is fucking inane and demonstrates no thought or experience with the issue, I'm sorry.

I don't see how you can say that when you just said this:

&gt;A similar model should be implemented for drugs. You need to work your way up to the harder stuff, proving your abilities as you go. The difference is right now that a random idiot can go from zero to hoovering a shitload of meth and ruin his fucking life because he's too stupid to realize what is happening to him.

That model is the best idea I've heard to date about responsible drug use, and it will never happen with drugs being illegal. Imagine if drugs were regulated and you had to be licensed (like all dangerous activities eg: scuba diving, sky diving, extreme rock climbing) to do them. Right now a large percentage of the population has an abysmal drug education because there is no point in teaching someone how to do something illegal safely. Making an activity illegal just makes it more dangerous for the people who are going to do it anyway because there will be a serious lack of education and tools to allow the person to do it safely.

I've never used any ""hard"" drugs, I stick to psychedelics. I'm sure you are going to try to use that as a reason to discredit me; I don't have experience in hard drugs so I don't know what I'm talking about. I think it's completely the opposite. I've taken it upon myself to educate myself about drugs, and after learning about them I realized psychedelics are fine, and hard drugs will fuck you up. As a result, I've never touched them, and I don't plan to. I know people who don't know the difference between LSD and crystal meth. They are the ones who are ""hoovering a shitload of meth and ruining their fucking lives because they're too stupid to realize what is happening to them.""","1277952327"

I learned from a yoga teacher that the cervix often holds intense emotions; in fact the cervix is considered the root of kundalini energy. So it's not uncommon for women to cry when experiencing cervical stimulation or g-spot stimulation. Perhaps the way your two shapes come together stimulate her in this way more than other men.

The emotion/body connection is actually a common teaching in kundalini / subtle energy circles, so there is plenty to read if you want to learn more. e.g. here is a quote from David Deida's Enlightened Sex Manual: ""a woman's cervical area often stores the residue of old sexual and emotional trauma and stress."" He also writes about the g-spot: ""during g-spot massage, you may find yourself suddenly angry, frightened, or grieving for no apparent reason.""

So rest assured this is normal. And if you are willing to pursue it, you are actually already one step further down the path than most people are... most people stop when those first tears arise, thus further shutting down those sensitivities. So you two are lucky, as it were.","1277952336"

Harmless seems a misnomer in that context. Plus, I think using the word safe gets you further in the discuss because you can apply principles of safe practice to drug use to refute claims that it is intrinsically harmful.

It's important to make a distinction between the two because I can proclaim to doing something wildly unsafe, but have a positive experience doing it, and then use FriendlyCarl's logic to say everyone should do it or that this wildly unsafe activity is harmless based upon my positive experience.

They went into the teacher's lounge and put tons of packing peanuts in the fridge and glue powder on the edges of the ceiling fan blades. They also taped the sink sprayer down and aimed it to the center of the room. Obviously it can't ever work this well in real life, but here's what happened. The teachers came back from the trip and turned on the lights and fan. Another teacher turned on the sink, spraying the whole room down just as the glue powder started flying all over the room. In a moment of panic, another teacher swings open the fridge door, releasing thousands of packing peanuts onto the stickiest things in the room -- the teachers! The packing-peanut-covered-monsters ran furiously down the hall trying to catch the perpetrators, who were laughing hysterically at the success of their endeavor. ","1277952350"

"history","t5_2qh53","There's obviously quite a bit of compression in BoB.  There are instances where actions or statements of multiple soldiers (bit players, for lack of a better term) are merged into one super character.  ""Dukeman"" is one of these.  I think that was a necessary move on the part of the producers to make a show that was logical for someone to watch.  There is also quite a bit of event compression too where certain things are moved around a little and events that occurred in two separate battles are portrayed as having occurred in one (Foy/Noville/Rachamps) and sometimes even in a different order to make the story clear for the viewer.

Some history nerds argue that the compression/re-arranging of events makes it fiction, I'm not one of those.  Now, there are also moments of outright fiction created solely for dramatic effect but as they don't have any real substantive bearing on the actual major events covered in the show I tend to let them pass where others might use them to criticize.  I think it's the fine line someone has to walk when creating a film version of a real event.  Life doesn't always fit into a neat plot-progressing linear construct so sometimes liberties have to be taken and combining events/people just makes sense for clarity and budget.  It's still one of the best dramatic re-enactments of the ETO that's ever been done.","1277952354"

Could you laugh at it then? I've also tried killing myself about 2 years back. Even now, I look at tree branches and my mind does a mental check on how strong it would be for hanging. I can also see now how stupid and selfish etc. I was being thinking like that, but back then at that time I could not. 

&gt;Comics like Rick Shapiro and Doug Stanhope can take a topic like heroin addiction or anti-semitism and spin it into a fairly insightful and hilarious bit. Idiotic family members who think they're funny and clever are not telling jokes, they're bullying someone with the demeanor of being funny.

I agree with you there. Clever jokes done well can provide insight into a problem. But how often do people do this with that intent? 
Also, if the person has made it clear that they're not comfortable with such jokes (as is the case with the OP), continually telling these jokes around them now clearly becomes something not for their benifit but ""bullying someone with the demeanor of being funny"".

&gt;I think many people need to stop being so god damned sensitive towards jokes and self-deprecation.

I do too. You have no idea how many times while I'm x-raying someone (smoker, obese, anorexic etc) I'd like to take them by their shoulders, give them a good shake and yell ""Stop it!"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It [seems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_groups_of_spheres#Computational_methods) it is a decidable problem:

&gt;The method of killing homotopy groups"", due to Cartan and Serre (1952a, 1952b) involves repeatedly using the Hurewicz theorem to compute the first non-trivial homotopy group and then killing (eliminating) it with a fibration involving an Eilenberg-MacLane space. In principle this gives an effective algorithm for computing all homotopy groups of any finite simply connected simplicial complex, but in practice it is too cumbersome to use for computing anything other than the first few nontrivial homotopy groups as the simplicial complex becomes much more complicated every time one kills a homotopy group.

But it most likely has *very* high complexity. And using a nondeterministic Turing machine probably doesn't help either - at least I don't know of a way to check if a given group is the k-th homotopy group of S^n without proving it.

"books","t5_2qh4i","I don't believe in digital content, especially that in which I am really just renting like books from Amazon or Music from iTunes.  I have a belief that purchases of goods/services are a transfer of labor from creator to buyer.  The value of that labor remains according to what the market deems correct and how it diminishes overtime with relaxed need and higher supply.

Most digital content is no longer a true or complete transfer of labor.  What you are buying is essentially worthless in the market.  So the laborers retain all value and you get none, but you still are paying nearly the same price for it.  

It doesn't compute for me.  If I buy a product, it should be a set transfer of labor, in which when I buy it, I now own the labor behind the product that I now own.  I should be able to sell that labor/product based on market prices at will.  Not being able to do so, shows how I am paying for a product of absolutely no value.  As an example look at University text books which are starting to come digital.  Students pay nearly the full price, or slightly less, but only have the book for 10 or so months and do not have the ability to resell it.  Making the publishers really rich and the students even poorer.

In the long run, consumers will be getting royally screwed, paying for products they own.  Overall all media will become drastically more expensive for everybody.

I don't support such practices, and refrain from buying digital content until when I do I own the product and the labor behind it.  Id buy a digital edition if it came with the print edition as well, or if I could resell the digital edition.  But never before.  ","1277952480"

I know personal experience =/= data but it's hard for me to believe that these incidents were completely unrelated to the catholic church itself.  The abuse of children was an institutionalised problem, and for *decades* church officials shuffled pedophiles from diocese to diocese, where they were free to abuse again, rather than prosecute them.

This, right here, is why I can't ever justify ""saving money"" on a knock off style vaporizer. For me the process of vaporizer should NEVER BE more harmful then the act of smoking. For example: when you buy a Vape Daddy (another box style knock off) the only thing they give you is a piece of paper that says ""Please turn on your vape full blast for 10 minutes to burn off any excess glue"". Really? Do the people that make those vapes even use them?

Also; having a digital display readout on a passive air makes zero sense unless it was a suspended thermocouple that reads the temperature of the air *as it moves past your herbs*. The heated element is *far* hotter than the actual temperature gauge reads out and I've found can be off by as much as 150 degrees F one way or the other.

I don't mean to be rude towards your purchase, but I wish there was more information out there on vaporizers and how they are built. The box style vaporizers were originally designed by Vapor Brothers and VB is the only one, out of any of the box styles, that requires 3rd party lab tests to make sure that 100% of your vaping experience is safe and that no toxins, solders or fumes from plastic are emitted.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Yet if anyone suggests that the right to bear arms no longer makes sense he'll be crucified for attacking the constitution.

I don't find that to be the case at all. When someone proposes a law that goes against the second amendment, generally people will be there to declare it unconstitutional, which means illegal. If someone proposes that the second amendment be repealed or whatever, then we'll have a policy argument on the merits.

&gt; It was originally crafted over 200 years ago, times have changed and just as not every article within it should be considered sacrosanct, some rights not guaranteed within it should.

While the Constitution and many parts of it are over 200 years old, in practice caselaw has changed it dramatically. The courts have carved out what the Fourth Amendment means in the age of automobiles and telephones, and are in the process of interpreting what the Fourth Amendment means in the age of email, text messages, and the mostly borderless internet. Same with the rest of the Constitution - that's why there are still many people devoting entire careers to Constitutional law.

There were no ""good old days"" for Constitutional rights. Privacy rights aren't explicitly spelled out in the Constitution, but the courts have pretty much made it the law of the land.

I'm not saying the Constitution is perfect. It's not. If it were up to me, we'd seriously reform the Senate to either make it a much weaker body or to make a more reasonable effort to make it more representative by either ending 2 per state or splitting up some of the larger states. I'd do away with the electoral college. I'd make election day on Saturdays AND Sundays, a 2-day affair on a non-workday, and I'd put election day much closer to the swearing in of politicians so that we minimize the amount of time that lame duck politicians are in office. I'd also implement a method of removing the President or judges at a lower standard than ""high crimes and misdemeanors."" So no, I don't think the Constitution is anywhere close to perfect. But I also think your criticisms are off base because you don't seem to take case law as ""real"" law. ","1277952581"

This is not oppression. By men merely having more of something than women, that alone is insufficient to cite oppression. If the reason for this difference is *because of* gender, then you can claim oppression. 

&gt;it is easier for them to receive promotions [for men]. 

Because women don't ask for them. So the problem is their timidness, not discrimination.
Also, ""Bitch shaming"" is a *pathetic* excuse for them not asking.

The wage gap has conclusively been proven to be a product of choices women make, it has nothing to do with gender discrimination. So the wage-gap is a myth. Institutionalised oppression of men isn't. ","1277952700"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","His arguments are all based on metaphors that break at exactly the most crucial points.  But that's because he's fallen for the idea that ""intellectual property"" is equivalent to ""real property"".

He compares his sheet music (or really, digital copies of his sheet music) to a screwdriver.  Really, what he has given his friend is a *perfectly functioning* **copy** of his screwdriver, that is in every way that matters an **equivalent**.  He doesn't really ""need it back later today"", and he has no need to be pissy at his friend for failing to return it, because he **still has the original**.  His friend has done nothing to deprive him of the original.  After having *freely given* his friend a copy of the screwdriver, he suddenly believes he should be compensated for it, because some arbitrary amount of time has passed, even though he hasn't suffered any loss of the intact version he still has. This is because ""intellectual"" property is not equivalent to real property.  There's no way to ""return"" it.  You can delete/destroy a copy, but ""returning"" it would mean the the original owner would now have **two** of them.

Next, his sheet music becomes ""first edition copies of the works of Thornton Wilder"".  The valuable thing about First Editions is that they are **physical items**.  Mere copies of first editions don't have the same value.  Second Editions don't have the same value.  The value of First Editions comes from their scarcity; from their limited availability.  They are *tangible* objects and are valuable because of their identification as *historical artifacts*.  Again, he gets pissy.  This time because his friend asks him to ""make me a copy"".  Forget that, his friend will *make his own* copies.  Especially if the bookstore only offers them in paperback, instead of in whatever the eBook format of the moment is.  

The sad thing is that he is depending on a livelihood that is based entirely on an historical circumstance that is rapidly disappearing. People pay for things that are difficult or scarce.  Making usable copies **used** to be difficult.  The ease of copying makes a lot of things considerably less scarce.

    * Appendicitis, which is an infection or inflammation of the appendix
    * Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
    * Asthma or bronchospasms (airway spasms)
    * Blood clots in the legs or lungs
    * Seizures
    * Guillain-Barré syndrome.

This is from: http://hpv.emedtv.com/hpv-vaccine/hpv-vaccine-side-effects-p2.html 



The risk of these side effects, however, has to be taken in context:  it's estimated that up to 70 of US women have been infected by genital warts at some point (50% of all sexually active adults), and the highest rate of infection is with the 18-28 age group.  Being sexually active in college in the US right now, even when using a condom, comes with a very high risk of becoming infected.  

http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm#common

The dangers of becoming infected with HPV seems riskier to me than the dangers of the vaccine.  After a close family member was...forced against her will and became infected with HPV, there were concerns not only of sterility but of secondary effects for her future children.  Luckily, that second concern doesn't seem to have ended up being an issue for her daughters.

The HPV vaccine doesn't protect against all types of HPV. But it does protect against the types which cause the vast majority of cervical cancers.

Really, I got more confident the more I draw, still do and probably will for a long time. Consistency largely comes along with that, but I'm always referencing other pages of a story to maintain continuity. Honestly, it's something that's still a struggle sometimes.

Most of what I reference is locations. I keep a folder on my desktop that I drop things in when I need them, and I'm gradually building up a library. You can wing it a lot more in a futuristic setting, of course, but sometimes to nail an architectural style you need to gather a lot more. For example, in an upcoming issue we spend a lot of time in the Emerald City, and to prepare for that I gathered a lot of material from the World's Columbian Expedition. Aside from locations, I look up items or costumes that I might not be familiar with. For that sort of thing, though, I'll do some sketches from photos and then just reference the sketches. I think that probably also helps maintain consistency of style and helps you avoid using reference as a crutch.

For tackling complex compositions I work out the big elements first, separate the space into planes, and fill it in from there. It's less overwhelming that way.","1277952814"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;So let's break down where your interpretation has gotten us.

My interpretation? No. This whole conversation has been about *your* interpretation. The only reason we've stemmed down this path is because I allowed you some assumptions so we'd reach an illogical conclusion [which we already have].

&gt;but in a constitutional document does not mean you to understand regulation as something the government should do despite the fact that regulation in legal code always refers to an action of the government.

From wiki:

&gt;The term ""well regulated"" in the Second Amendment has two possible interpretations.
1: That the term ""regulated"" means ""disciplined"" or ""trained"". In Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court proposed that ""[t]he adjective 'well-regulated' implies nothing more than the imposition of proper discipline and training.""


Ta-da!

&gt;What added meaning is provided by saying ""well regulated"" militia (by which you interpret to mean ""self-regulated"")

A militia can organize itself, so yes.

&gt;Additionally, in the event that self-regulation is not going well, the entire purpose of the amendment has also been subverted.

Whether the purpose is subverted or not has no bearing on whether the right to keep and bear arms still exists.

&gt;Although I guess to you it does not matter if it is not being well self-regulated because the first half of the entire amendment is moot and not relevant to the interpretation.

Ah, you're catching on.


&gt;the conditonal second half of the amendment would not need to be respected.

The conditional second half? I'm pretty sure you just said (paraphrasing me) that the second half is *unconditional* to the first half. IE Even though the intent is a ""well-regulated militia"", the right to keep and bear arms is not dependent upon this being true.

&gt;Insofar as that is true, it requires secondary policy to determine when a militia is being well self-regulated

Why would you need to determine is a militia is being well-regulated? It's none of the government's business how a group of private individuals organizes itself. 

&gt;Buuuuuuut, its meaning is plain and completely unambigious, and centuries of lawyers and justices educated in law were dumb to not see something so clear.

Dumb? No. Purposefully misunderstanding to serve certain ideological goals? Most definitely. 

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

No conditionals there. 



EDIT:

In regards to your first point:

&gt;Another interpretation holds the Second Amendment contains an opening prefatory or amplifying clause followed by an operative clause. The opening phrase is meant as a non-exclusive example—one of many reasons for the amendment. This interpretation is consistent with the position that the Second Amendment protects a modified individual right. In Heller, the Supreme Court endorsed this description of the Second Amendment. Although the Second Amendment is the only Constitutional amendment with a prefatory clause, such constructions were widely used elsewhere.


Such constructions were widely used elsewhere. Guess you were wrong.

&gt;A third interpretation views the first clause as simply explanatory; neither a qualifying nor amplifying clause. So while militia service is the stated justification for protecting the right to keep and bear arms, it is not a pre-condition on that right.Adherents to this interpretation observe that the latter clause of the amendment still guarantees the right to ""the people,"" and, therefore, is not limited to members of a select militia. This style of syntax was common for the time and similar language exists in the Copyright Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

This is a cashier job.  Other employees (cooks) prepare your food.  You, the customer, pick up the order and take it away.

At a sit-down restaurant, your table is cleaned and prepped, often you are seated and an initial drink order is taken.  Then, a server spends the rest of the time you are in the restaurant communicating between you and the kitchen, bringing food and drinks *to your table*, making sure you have the correct condiments, refilling drinks, fixing problems and generally making sure that you don't have to do anything by yourself but eat.  This server makes less than minimum wage and depends almost entirely on tips for their pay.

Sometimes there isn't much for the server to do, sometimes there is a lot the server does to make your meal more enjoyable.  This is where the variance in tip comes in.  A McDonalds employee does the same company mandated procedure *every single time*.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;I didn't mention anything about impressing anyone, but it's interesting that you bring that up.

I am sorry if I misunderstood you. I thought by ""try-hard"", you meant ""Trying hard to impress people"". What *did* you mean by that btw?

&gt;I think that sometimes it's a form of self-expression, but more often it's a form of self-expression on the part of the artist (yes, I realize that some people design their own). Picking out a tattoo that someone else conceived doesn't seem to be a very high form of self expression, in my opinion.

There are many forms of self-expression. Some people choose do do it with their art, some with their fashion choices. Some people try to make a statement by the car they drive.

Not everyone is a good enough graphic artist to design their own tattoos (I did design mine).

Of course, there are thousands of horrible, tacky tattoos, (there are also some really good ones) and not everyone puts enough thought into their decision, which is really foolish.

But there are as many different types of people who have tattoos as there are people who don't have them. There are many different reasons that people get them.

I would wager that you probably know a few people who have tattoos and you are unaware that they have them. Possibly people you admire and respect.

I admit it, its hard for me not to judge people based on their looks as well. For me its when I see someone in an expensive suit with a fresh haircut that looks exactly like 3 billion other people in the world, my mind immediately jumps to superficial assumptions about the person. I have to make a conscious effort to hold back my gut reaction and reserve my judgement for when I have some evidence of the persons character.","1277952993"

Naturally this argument applies just the same to ego. The ego-depletion-theory sounds interesting, but it is misleading.

Gamers still tend to think of themselves as a homogenous whole, or at least have a strong sense of group-belonging, much more so than other consumers of entertainment or art products, like music or movies.

Just a tactic from Nancy Reagan as far as I'm concerned.  When my parents made me feel bad about myself when I was 17 and not doing everything they thought I should, I reminded them that it could be much worse-never was violent, never went to jail, wasn't doing hardcore, wasn't getting anyone pregnant, pretty damn successful in the scheme of things.  Your post makes me think that you're a pretty cool teen and that the ethics they raised you with are well grounded.  You gotta realize, too, they're probably shitting their pants, not sure what to do about it, since they use as well.  Don't worry too much, the anticipation is usually worse than the event.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're a troll then. You made an argument

&gt; Lots of people have said, ""no one has ever died from cannabis,"" but has never shown evidence

I've yet to find somebody who has smoked cannabis and failed to live solely from its consumption. Given that there's a pretty large amount of people that have taken the drug it's pretty safe to say it's harmless, yet you 
*insist* on the idea that it's possible. 

If you were to inject an organism with enough of *anything* it would eventually damage the creature's homeostasis, so yes you're right, you could kill anything with anything so it's not technically true.

Realistically speaking, though, you haven't brought up a single instance where somebody has died exclusively from cannabis consumption and have therefore not proved the validity of your claim. 

**The common scenario is that you smoke weed, and do not die. **
If your logic was based on pragmatism (which it is not) you would look for a counter-example. However, you ask for proof that there is no counter-example (an impossible, illogical task). So the likeliest two scenarios (the most common) would be that you are either a troll, or an idiot. So these people antagonizing you aren't doing it because you're ""going against the grain"" or ""presenting an unpopular idea"", it's because you're asking them to do something unreasonable if they disagree with you. This is trolling. You might as well tell them to jump off a bridge if they disagree with you. ","1277953040"

If I believed that it was okay to rape your children, would your attitude shift at all regarding *that* belief? Would you perhaps want me to rethink that belief and perhaps even change it? Would the fact that people *act on their beliefs* have anything to do with how you might react to learning of such beliefs?

Obviously something as generic as belief in god does not carry with it the offensive weight as the belief that it's okay to rape children, but that's somewhat beside the point. The point is that your statement is ridiculous. It is right to want to eradicate the beliefs of others if those beliefs are harmful to society. An antitheist views irrational religious belief as harmful to society.

&gt;Why do I have to get over that?

Because religious beliefs should stand up to criticism, ridicule, and scrutiny just like any other belief. If your beliefs cannot stand up to criticism, then you should rethink them.","1277953050"

it is why reddit got so popular and why the posting rate is going down and popularitiy is dropping so rapdily.
i suspect conde Naste will have successfully killed it as any true outlet for uncensored citizen posting within the year.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","$15/hour???  Come on now.  It costs more money than that per hour to get someone to clean your house.  Literally, I've been finding that you're going to pay a minimum of $20/hour for that service, and I doubt you'll find anyone that believes cleaning ought to be valued more highly than web development.

Given that you are at a hobbyist level and this is your first client, naturally your rate cannot be what an experienced freelancer would charge.  However, it can't be something absurd like $15/hour either.  I think a reasonable rate, from the limited amount of information you've given about your skills, would be something like $30/hour.

Also, don't feel that just because you didn't know what to charge, and she was the one that set out the price, means you cannot come back with a price that is double.  All you have to do is be honest.  Tell her you asked some knowledgeable people what a reasonable market rate was for the services you will be providing, and this is what they told you was fair (I'm a partner in a design/development agency, and others here are similarly experienced, so ""knowledgeable"" is the truth).

Also note that freelance work is normally billed out at a much higher rate than what you would be paid per hour (whether you are paid in wages or salary) if you did this as a job.  The reason is simple: in a job, you get paid for every hour, whether you are doing billable work or not; you get job security; you know you will receive payment for 35 or 40 hours per week every week; you may receive benefits; etc.  None of that applies to freelance work, thus, you will often see freelance rates anywhere from three to five times what someone would make in wages in that industry.

Final tip: require a minimum charge of at least .5 hours.  If you bill out at $30/hour and she gets you to do something that ""only takes ten minutes"", bill her $15 for the 30 minutes it took you to read her email, get your text editor fired up, focus on what you had to do, get the changes done, upload the files, email her back, etc.","1277953052"

Realize, however, that rights are society-given. There only real necessities to live are bread and water - you don't need electricity, medicine, etc. etc.

Everything past that point is a luxury. Most luxuries increase lifespan. We could make a lot of roundabout arguments about which commodity does or does not increase lifespan - but I would think that the most fair assessment would be anything that helps preserve mental stability and increases the value everyone gets out of society (such as the quick, fast and universal internet access) increases life span and quality of life.

No one is born, without society deeming it so, to -anything- (except, I guess, life). You are just not differentiating between societal values. In my opinion (and this is just my opinion), a capitalist system measures its societal value based on how high their highest person is - and a communist system measures its societal value based on how high their lowest person is.

Socialism, which Finland is, is somewhere in the middle - a little bit of both. But, however, they are perfectly within their means to give universal internet access as a right. Rights are given and taken away by the government.","1277953101"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of the biggest themes in the movie was the role of chance in all outcomes (the recurring coin flips very much allude to this).  The fact that the camera lingered on the fork in the freeway when he took the turn to Del Rio (where the transponder began beeping) was definitely another variation of this motif...  What if he had gone the other way?  Then he wouldn't have been found, and we wouldn't have a plot.  He just happened to take the right turn in the road and passed that exact motel at that exact time.  Sometimes these things happen.  Given the barren land and sparce population of Southwest Texas and the narrow choice of locales and roads, it's not too much of a stretch to think that he would drive by that motel (I grew up very near there, and can attest to this).  It's not like he was looking for him in Los Angeles, after all.

Personally, I thought this role of chance/chaos was beautifully orchestrated in this film, and Chigur's and Llewelyn's attempts at defeating the forces of chaos by hiding their respective trails (e.g. trying to hide their trails with tentpoles, by getting rid of socks) and using ingenuity to overcome chance (e.g. Llewelyn's obvious Army training, Chigur's amazing knowledge of medicine and weaponry) was amazing.  Chigur just did it better than Llewelyn.

As in anything Cormac McCarthy-related, the violence was hypnotically brutal.  I appreciate the realistic violence in this movie more than the cartoon violence of garbage like your average action movie.  Bullets strike people here and it hurts (and often kills).

And Tommy Lee Jones' character...  Wow, what an absolutely wonderful performance.  There aren't too many characters that you can actually feel the sadness in their words.  I'm still waiting for that day that I realize that the world has left me behind and passed me by, where I no longer understand the morals and attitudes of people.  ""No Country For Old Men"".

However, at the time of drafting, I doubt they meant slaves or Indians because each were specifically called out in the body of the Const. in differential terms: ""...Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.""  This portion was repealed by the 14th.

My guess is that they deliberately chose 'people' to ensure that the Federal government couldn't monkey around with citizenship qualifications to limit the ability to own fire arms.

"NonAustrianEconomics","t5_2qp81","I will second the advice about maths, although I would personally say take as much god damn maths as you can. I finish my combined economics and science degree here in Australia at the end of this year with majors in computer science, economics and pure mathematics.

On top of the normal calculus sequence most real science students do (single/multi variable calc, de's and linear algebra) you will find real/complex analysis, further analysis (metric spaces, hilbert spaces etc. etc.) and abstract algebra will be extremely useful if you want to move onto postgraduate theory. One might also want to learn linear and dynamic programming, markov chains, probability, stats, caclulus of variations, optimal control theory etc. etc.

You really can't know enough mathematics for economics, as it is a social science, and science is all about modelling the universe around us right, we just tend to stick to the interactions between people. My main interests are in game theory (I'm actually working on a fairly large game theory library at the moment in c++ that will eventually be released open source) and microeconomics, which probably do tend to require harder maths, but the people working at the top in macroeconomics, international economics etc. are generally all really good mathematicians as well. I work as a research assistant at my university for a professor that came here from Cambridge (she's actually back over there for a month at the moment) although most of her work is applied dealing with financial crises etc. so I generally do a lot of programming for her in Guass or whatever.

I, like SantyClause, am reaching for MIT for PhD, although I'm doing an honours year in maths next year and possibly a 2 year masters of studies with research at another uni in Australia first (will probably just do research with ai for that, something different).","1277953199"

According to your lights, teens shouldn't be allowed to do anything without your prior permission: eating junk food; watching TV and movies; going out with friends -- after all, they cannot ""meaningfully"" give their consent. This is plainly nonsense.

The fact is, a 14 year old lad has hormones sloshing out of his ears. Given the opportunity, he most certainly can give meaningful, heartfelt consent for a tumble with teacher. As long as he cannot be held liable for child support, he faces no consequences (other than STD, of course.)

For instance, it often tells me I should build a settler or worker which might be true in the sense that I should do it soon but not right that turn.  If you are about to increase the population you should wait and then start building worker/settler (your population does not increase while you are producing worker/settler).

Also a good tip on research:

- Get mining then bronze working first
- Then get basic worker stuff like roads, pottery (mainly you want pottery)
- Then go for Writing
- Then get Alphabet.

With Alphabet you can trade and you will probably get it first if you follow that pattern.  So now all those early techs will come flowing in from the other civs since they will want Alphabet.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","You have a character to control in this one.  As in you move him around the map to do things, instead of just entering buildings.  This also eliminates the action points  In other words, if you buy walking cane, your character moves faster on the map, instead of granting you more AP.  
  
Also, you can control up to three characters. So, instead of just you, you can control your spouse's and child's character as well.  This becomes important in that you can immediately buy the type of buildings that they're masters of, as opposed to waiting to inherit them once they die.  Also, they can perform all the functions that your main character can(I.E. bribery, plant bloom of discord, flirtation, vote).  It's essentially like taking a Europa 1400 character and multiplying by three.
  
One other big difference is that every turn results in a vote for a political office.  This is very different, as in Europa 1400, you had to wait until someone called for a dismissal for chance to get in.
  
There are other differences, but the core gameplay is still there.  I would say that if you like Europa 1400, you'll like The Guild II.  There are also a ton of mods out there to make The Guild II play very much like Europa 1400.
  
TL;DR:  If you liked Europa 1400, you'll like The Guild II.

Godel's incompleteness theorem, probably the one to which your philosophy major friend was referring, holds only that no internally consistent set of axioms can ever be exhaustive or complete. To understand how this could be the case, think about it this way. Imagine the axioms of logic (for example) as a set of five rules called A, B, C, D, and E. If the laws of logic are true, then there is some additional rule, F: ""the laws of logic are true."" And if F is true, then there is some additional rule G: ""F is true."" And if G is true, then there is some additional rule H: ""G is true."" And so on.

In essence, Godel's theorem states that all sets of axioms rely on some additional axiom for their acceptability. This proposition is not controversial; Godel's accomplishment was systematizing it in a rigorous mathematical proof.

If you think violence leads to peace..we're going to have to disagree.  Your argument against that is basically that I used a phrase that other people have used... Anyway, I'll concede this is a pretty philosophical question, and we're not going to come to an agreement here or anywhere.

But if you want an explanation for my comments, the thing is, I can't take anyone seriously that thinks revolution through violence is a good idea.  The world is far too complicated to simply point and say ""Those are the bad guys, kill them""

It just sounds like you think there's some central group of people controlling everything and making terrible decisions to screw the citizens of the country.  I gotta tell you, I don't think any group or individual is that clever.  If you really want to know what I think is going on, it's a lot of miscommunication and a lack of understanding of the history of the country and the world, a lack of understanding of the current situation, and a lack of interest.  If that sounds vague, it's because IT'S A COMPLICATED SITUATION WE ARE IN.  You can't just go around saying ""LETS KILL ALL THE BAD PEOPLE""  RABBLE RABBLE YEAHHHH

And that's why I think you're insane (not really, just think you're angry like everyone and you said this silly thing)

What really frightens me is that in 20 years or so, it may be possible to fight an Iraq-style war without having a single American boot on the ground. What happens when there is no (intranational) political cost to declaring wars beyond cost, which the government already doesn't care about?

If things ever got Orwellian here and there was an uprising, it would be possible to win it at this point in time if the will was strong enough. But if you have drones with essentially unlimited endurance everywhere in the sky, the could provide constant surveillance of the ground and that would be 90% of what would be required to track down insurgents.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Hello, ad grad here. IDriveAVan is totally right on everything, but I wanted to add a bit depending on what exactly you were asking:

It goes both ways. Ad campaigns will often play on social norms and values, such as manly men drive trucks, especially if it is what is considered their ""target audience"", as discussed earlier.

But sometimes you want to expand your market and target new groups and redefine how we think of these norms. One great example is [Campbell's Chunky soup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8syv6GupEXw)- 10 years ago, who would have thought that you could successfully market canned soup towards men? That drinking soup could be seen as ""manly?""

Also take a look at the [Dove superbowl 2010 commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO_2gypR7wQ). They kind of try to redefine what it means to be a ""man."" I think the commercial itself isn't that great of an ad, but how they twist what it means to be a man is pretty interesting, and it's an interesting strategy regardless of the quality of the ad.

Also think about how the wii has been repositioning ""who plays videogames"", and how since they've expanded the market everyone else is trying to catch up. Videogames are actually a pretty great example of marketing towards different audiences and how competition works.","1277953346"

That's how you do it. The analogy I've heard is like you have strings attached to your knees which are being pulled like a marionette on the upstroke - the goal is to unweight your legs on the upstroke, not generate power. 

I think desmo is explaining as much, it just comes off as if he is saying you should generate power through your whole pedal circle (more specifically, the upstroke) - this is not true.

This is why you typically need a proprietary charger for a Li-ion battery.

Here at Reddit, you're going to find a multitude of people discussing many different things, to put it as simply as possible. It's a rather big community, which thus opens it up to having it's share of faults. Honestly, the last thing I want to be is an average Redditor - shoehorning bland memes into yet another armchair-activist riddled thread about marijuana legalization or police brutality. It kind of kills me a little with every post to think I that I may be perpetuating the now desperate-looking image of the anti-Digg, anti-Apple, anti-Republican hivemind machine that many Redditors have warmly embraced. 

I love the articles posted on Reddit - I love the idea of Reddit itself. Hell, I've written term papers on the site. But I see where you are coming from, high4life. You have to realize though, that these types - the nauseating, ""hyper-intellectual"", self-righteous internet culture Nazi's you see in almost every thread are but a small portion of the community. Not everyone is out there is planning on posting the next big thing with a shit-eating grin on their face as they climb above the peons to the loftiest heights of the karma ladder. There are many, many people of worth on this site that think the same as you do. Not all of us want to fellate the whole crowd just to see little orangered envelopes next to our names. But... some people do. And for that, nobody is going to apologize.

Perhaps with this post, I only prove myself to be one amongst a crowd of those who think they are better than everyone else. But, I know at the end of the day there's that little red ""x"" at the top of my screen that kills all who oppose me and my opinion. When all is said and done, there is nothing that any Redditor can post that will make me feel like any less of a man, and it should be the same for you. Don't ever feel lesser than anybody here.

Buying cards with money is a terrible idea, because you have to hope the other side of the trade is handled legitimately. Buy tickets, then buy cards for those tickets.

Note that the better bots have a concept of ""store credit"", which is either good or bad depending on whether you plan on buying/selling a LOT of stuff with that particular bot (or family of bots) or not. If you aren't, the store credit is free money to them, and you should avoid it.","1277953363"

Take this to the next level. Take your passion(s) and put it on display and make it into decoration. Not only will you be able to find the stuff you need but it's also free. All you'll need is to be a little creative. 
Instead of putting away the stuff you use often, why not put it on the wall as decorations?

An example of what I did on the walls in my room: A dragon boat paddle, a pfd, a few frisbees, 4 clocks (showing time zones of family in different countries), a guitar, mounted lights and wired surround sound. With a little creativity you can definitely turn function into form - just be sure to spread it out logically. The key to bringing it all together is lighting. Soft lighting is the key. Also, if you're into toys, a really cool thing you can do is set up your room to be all wireless. At one point, I could control the lights (4 different ones, with dimmers) as well as the TV that was hooked up to surround sound. I could also switch the source of the surround sound from TV or the computer and could stream movies downloaded from the internet to the TV.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I got a nice lightweight headset at the local radioshack for like $22-$23. I used them for years (like 5yrs maybe, even with frequent backpack LAN-party travel). And I didn't replace them for breaking down, just that the earmuff covers started to wear out and peel. They have great comfort due to being so lightweight (can play for hours no problems there) and the sound is quite good (no complaints here for either input and output).

I wear glasses and don't like the big earmuff style due to the way they press the top of my ears against my glasses, and I don't like earbuds either. These small earmuff style is perfect for me. These is the only headset I've bought twice and even still the first pair was super long lasting.

Found a link (looks like $20 now): http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2036282&amp;CAWELAID=107593975

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A few things: 

* I don't think it's the shrooms. 

* Smoking pot twice a day might dull things, though doing it moderately (as in, not baked out of your mind) a few times a week really shouldn't cause any problems. 

* Anxiety &amp; self-doubt, overanalysis, etc, this *does* sound like at least a lot of the problem. I can commiserate, it's really easy to fall into a self-criticizing tear-down cycle. IMO, your perception of the problem is probably far exaggerated over the reality of it. (As in, I highly doubt you sound flat-out retarded in conversation). Though that's not to say you couldn't benefit from going 'deep' with stuff (we all could). 

* The start of the next semester would be a good time to keep all of this in mind when making whatever new friends you make.

* Until then, maybe spend time reading in depth articles, and importantly, shutting out all other interference (easier said than done). Something that's just long enough that it stretches your attention span, but isn't so long that there's no hope of finishing it in one sitting. 

tl;dr: Don't worry about the past shrooms use, or the pot (long as its in moderation, no problem IMO), your concerns are probably overinflated due to anxiety/self-criticism (it's not as bad as you think it is). *What to do:*  make at least one new friend in the fall who would be better for 'deep conversation', and read in-depth articles, without multi-tasking interference, and slow enough to really understand every sentence as you go along.

Gateway drugs by definition are drugs that lead to other heavier drugs. However, statistics show that most people who smoke pot don't move on to heavier drugs. When they called it a gateway drug, they were basing it off the fact that most addicts tried pot before their heavier drugs, which skews the results so that the data is only about addicts making an easy correlation with pot and heavy drugs. But they tend to try pot first usually because its easier to get and more socially acceptable. It in no way caused them to get addicted to heavier drugs, thats a choice people make themselves.

People also statistically try caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco before pot. Does that make all three of them gateway drugs?

Out of the three biggest potheads I knew in college - one's an architect, one's an energy trader, and one's an engineer.

But why count on my word... how about we go to actual scientific literature... from: Long-term effects of exposure to cannabis, Iversen L. University of Oxford, Department of Pharmacology:

&gt;The long-term use of cannabis, particularly at high intake levels, is associated with several adverse psychosocial features, including lower educational achievement and, in some instances, psychiatric illness. **There is little evidence, however, that long-term cannabis use causes permanent cognitive impairment, nor is there is any clear cause and effect relationship to explain the psychosocial associations.** There are some physical health risks, particularly the possibility of damage to the airways in cannabis smokers. Overall, by comparison with other drugs used mainly for 'recreational' purposes, cannabis could be rated to be a relatively safe drug.

So yes, of course people who have no ambition and no success in life turn to drugs as a form of escapism.  But, there is *no* scientifically causality involved, just a correlation that people who can't get joy elsewhere turn to substance abuse.  That has nothing to do with whether or not a responsible adult can use psychoactive substances safely and without negatively affecting the rest of their lives.","1277953436"

Let me give you a run down of what I think:

* Great sound quality. The ranges of bass and treble surprised me when I first used them. Also, they're circumaural, meaning if someone if behind you shooting, you can hear the difference in the head set. For gaming, circumaural is the best.

* Good build quality. I've had these for about a year now and they've gone through a lot of my bs. No cracked plastic, no problem with the mic or speakers.

* The mic projects your voice very clearly and cancels out background noise. The headset itself is rather noise-canceling too.

* Comfort. Not the best I've had for comfort, but no where near the worst either. At first, they may start hurting after 2 hours of game play. Now that I'm used to these, they're comfortable for about 5 hours. If you have glasses, mine don't really get in the way with this set. So it should be good for you too.

Overall, these are great headphones and I don't regret buying them, even though they aren't the best for comfort.","1277953455"

My buddy Ari (name not change to protect the innocent, sorry Ari) gets drunk and starts complaining  he wants to go to the Rhino. No one will go, but he keeps whining, so I agree to go. The cab pulls up, and there was a line out the door, the cab driver tells he knows a place just as good and less crowded, so we're like fine, what the hell. We get in th club and it's still pretty packed, so we decide to split up and try to find some seats. I get a text from Ari to meet him upstairs, and he has the sweetest chairs in the place. On the balcony overlooking th main stage, and 10 feet from the bar.

Now on the way there, he tells me whatever we do, do NOT let him go to the VIP room. We politely turn down a few offers for lap dances, but at one point, I look over and sure enough, there's a girl on Ari's lap. So it only takes 15 seconds for one to end up on mine. On song in, and I feel a tug at my hand. It's Ari's stripper, and she informs me we're going VIP.

Ari and I end up on couches across from each other. My girls gives me three rather uninspired songs and leaves. Ari's stripper, named Delicious, meanwhile has removed Ari's belt and is whipping me in the ball sack with it. Her name is called to go to the stage, so she tells us to wait there, let's the bouncer know, and promises to come back, We weren't really expecting her to, but lo and behold she does. She proceeds to hang out with us for the rest of the night, and never asks for money. I offered her a drink, which she accetped, but that's it.

SHe starts telling us she gets off at 4, and then is going to some party. According to her, the only problem is ""you have to bring your own drugs."" It's getting to be about 2:30, Ari looks at me and says ""you want to get out of here."" I give him a look like ""you can't be serious, she's been telling us about this party non-stop for an hour and a half and not asking us to pay her. we're getting invited."" but drunk ass ari decided he'd rather play black jack and makes me take him back to the hotel.

tl;dr: stripper named Delicious hangs with my friend and I for a good portion of our time at the club without asking for money and talking non stop about a party she's going to when she gets off, friend decides he wants to go back and play blackjack instead.","1277953476"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I don't know about the truth of this particular account.  


I do know that the police arrested hundreds of people who were not breaking the law, many of whom were not even demonstrating.  People who were shopping for groceries, people walking their dogs, mothers out with their kids, were all arrested, just to give a few examples, and sometimes arrested with unnecessary force.  Many of the officers (not all, but many) behaved like thugs, mocking people and using foul and abusive language instead of behaving like the professionals they are supposed to be.  


I also know that the provincial government secretly passed a law expanding the range of people who could be arrested without reasonable and probable cause and then *told no one about the change so that everyone thought the law was the same as it used to be.*  Even lawyers didn't know about the change, so they couldn't give people accurate legal advice.  We only found out about the change when people started being arrested under the altered law, having had no way to avoid being arrested because they didn't know what the changed law required of them.  


I also know that once the change in the law became known, it was widely misunderstood to mean that anyone coming within 5 meters of the security zone (even though they remained *outside* the security fence) could be searched and compelled to identify themselves, and if they failed (for instance didn't have ID on them), resisted (which normally the law would allow them to do if they were not yet under arrest), or tried to turn back (which is generally allowed in these situations, such as where people are being searched at the entrance to a courthouse and decide they'd rather not go in), could be arrested without any further cause.  The law actually said no such thing, but the police maintained the illusion, specifically quoting the 5-metre rule to justify arrests that were, in fact, illegal, and that they knew were illegal.  Meanwhile the provincial government, which had passed the law in the first place and which oversees all the police in Ontario, knew the police were lying and neither instructed them to stop nor corrected the record in public so that people would know what the law really said and what their legal rights actually were.


(By the way, arresting people without legal grounds is a criminal offence.  Actually, a minimum of two:  assault and unlawful confinement.  It makes no difference if the person doing the illegal arresting is a police officer, it is criminal all the same.  Keep that in mind -- along with the part where they lied about the law -- when these people claim they were just trying to uphold the law and protect people from crime.)


There are a lot of other allegations being thrown around, like the ones in this post.  Maybe they're true or maybe they're not, but by illegally arresting people and lying about the law, the police and provincial government have made those allegations believable, and have only themselves to blame if some of them are not true but are believed anyway.","1277953483"

Yikes. That is fairly tragic. In all but maybe a Psych 101 class, Freud should be an interesting/provocative *jumping-off point* for deeper discussions about psychology and behavior, not a set of theories taught as fact.

If it makes you feel any better, I know lots of psychologists, and while some truly believe in some psychoanalytic ideas (e.g., the unconscious and defense mechanisms, and not in a neuroscientific sort of way), none of us think of Freud's ideas as 'factual', any more than today's medical doctors think of Galen's four humors as being a valid theory of disease.

Democrats couldn't give a rats ass about the Tea Party or the Unemployed right now. There is virtually ZERO overlap between Potential Tea Party voters and Democrat Voters... all of the Tea Party voters come from the Republican voter base.

What the Democrats did was make a bill that sounds good to the public but is stuffed full of pork. Why you ask? Because they are trying to fracture off the portion of the moderates that are undecided between Republicans and Democrats. Some moderates care more about unemployment then a bunch of pork. 

So instead of passing a bill that would get bi partisan support for unemployment only Democrats crafted a bill fill of pork so that they would force the Republicans to decide what they want to do.

The Republicans have two and only two choices about what to do when a pork filled bill with unemployment extensions comes. If they support it they are viewed as the same as the Democrats and they lose both types of moderates because hey the Democrats passed unemployment extensions and the Republicans voted for a Bill with a bunch of pork. Or they can go against it and forfeit the moderates that care about unemployment more then the pork but maintain the moderates that care about the pork.

This bill was crafted by the Democrats to give them an edge with moderates because the Democrats are losing Moderate votes like crazy because the economy is still doing crappy after the Democrats promised that if you let them give a trillion dollars to the banks(yes Republicans voted for it too but it still is seen as a Democrat thing to do because they were in power and it happened long enough ago that most voters will blame the Democrats for it).","1277953658"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","While visiting a South-American country for a week, made a group of friends with whom I got tipsy, then spraypainted houses in a neighboring residential neighborhood I was completely unfamiliar with, many miles away from where I was staying. After we spraypainted a guy's window, he called the cops. The cops saw us and flashed their lights and sirens. We split, running in all directions through the night. I've never run so hard for so long. You might expect adrenalin to make it easier to sprint for longer, but this wasn't so much the case for me. 

I remember leaning against the cool shadowed side of a building, trying to breathe quietly through burning lungs. The fear of being caught didn't reside until the lights from the cop cars stopped shining diffusely through the humid night air, and the sirens faded away to nothing. Luckily I managed to run alongside one of the guys from the group, and he knew his way back to a friend's house. Otherwise I would have been screwed; I didn't know any of their cell numbers, and I had no number to call to find my way back; no place to stay. 

None of us were caught.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Depends on the school, but most will offer ""top up"" courses, especially for people in closely related fields (physics to engineering, as an example).  It also depends on what kind of engineering you are looking to go into - nuclear engineering might not want anything that you can't just take as part of your masters coursework, or as a summer class before starting up.  Biomedical engineering, on the other hand, might want to add 2 years or more of relevant coursework if you have never taken so much as freshman level biology.

That being said, physics is likely a very strong starting position, as you will likely have had at least 2 years of calculus and differential equations, and extensive mechanics courses.

But the easiest, and most cop-outingist answer is: depends on the program.

I owned a pair of the original jbuds, and now jbuds v2. I must say, if you don't take care of them (get a pouch for them if you carry your headphones in your pocket), then they will break on you in 3-4 months. My first ones lasted for over a year, and broke. Then i got the v2, and they broke afte r3 months, but that was to be expected after I just threw them into my pockets without any case. When they broke, i just emailed jlab and asked for replacements, which they kindly offered in exchange that I write a review for them (haven't done yet but will do soon &gt;.&gt;). All of it was hassle free, and i got a new pair of headphones in about a week, and also they gave me a discount of 20% on their cases.

http://www.jlabaudio.com/product_info.php?products_id=28

They have their v3 of their headphones out, but I kept reading reviews that said they didn't have enough bass in their sound, so i stuck with the v2, and i must say they are good enough for me. I do run into issues sometimes where the headphones won't stay in my ears, but that's to be expected for headphones that aren't actually molded for your ears. It's either they fit or not.

"Spokane","t5_2r9l2","I just stumbled into the /r/spokane subreddit, and happened to catch this post about you moving here from Eugene.

Spokane is an interesting place to be sure.  I read that you like board games, well there is a great place called Uncle's Games (next to Auntie's Books) where you can find any game you desire, including the fabulous Munchkin series.  Aunties is generally where renowned authors come to speak; Chuck Pahlniuk came here I think 18 months ago.

For drinks ther are a ton of dives and plenty of them are filled with douchbags looking to right, but if you don't mind dropping a little more cash there are some great places.  Northern Lights brewery (in the University disctrict) has a great atmosphere and great food too, and prices are reasonable.  They also have the only distillery in all of Washington AFAIK, and they make good vodka and gin.

There is Catacombs, which used to be the coal and furnace room for the Montvale hotel.  You descend into the little area and it feels almost like something from bavaria.  The prices are a little high but the drinks are stiff and well made, and the food is pretty good as well.

For billiards, with board games, local art, and drinks, there is Far West billiards right near Catacombs.  The only advice I give to you about that is if you use plastic to pay, check your statement, the once double billed me but it was no sweat to get it straightened out.

For eats we have an *amazing* barbecue place called Chicken and More; slow service but absolutely outstanding food.  Really authentic.  If barbecue *is* your thing, avoid Longhorn Barbecue up near the airforce base or out in the Valley, they are terrible and expensive.

There are some great restaurants here for vegetarians like Mizuna's and if you are into fondu there is The Melting Pot ($$$$$) right next to P.F. Chang's downtown.  Those are also right across from the downtown shopping district and mall, and inside that mall is a nice little Bistro that is good for martinis or food called Twigz.  Little pricey, but nice atmosphere.

For arts and entertainment, there are a few concert houses downtown but music tends to be more metal than anything mellow.  There is a jazz club called Ella's Supper Club that does dinner with jazz and old movies, and there is often live music of many types in the lounges of the nicer hotels downtown (Montvale, Davenport, etc.).  You'll find em.

There is a little place called Isabella's that has live music sometimes too if that's your thing, and also the Martin Woldson Theatre at the Fox where they do jazz, opera, symphony, and pretty much anything.

There's lots to do here, don't let anyone fool you.  Winters can be really hard, or they can be really mild.  Last winter was nothing but rain and actually reminded me of Portland's winters, but the year before was a record setter for snow fall and it as intense.

Let me know if you need to know anything else.  I've lived here most of my life off and on and keep up with things pretty well.","1277953786"

So if a technique that might appear a little more humane such as waterboaring does infact push someone beyond his level of endurance as affectively as for example eletrocution, or beatings, then waterboarding is just as inhumane. Stating otherwise would be the same as suggesting people have sex for the purpose of maintaining virginity, its a complete and physically impossible contradiction.

This whole issue also goes to show just how pathetic and hypocritical the developed world really is, we went on for years about humanity and human rights and shit like that, and we incoorperative it deeply in our culture such as movies etc with the whole images that we are the ""good guys"" and ""this is what seperates us from them"", and we use that as a way to make ourself appear better than others by saying they dont have thoose values, because it suits us right then.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;You are essentially claiming that for merly doing their job for which they are already paid they are entilted to get extra.

From what I have been told by literally every food server I have ever known, is that after being taxed for tips, combined with a low hourly wage, their take home paycheck is near zero.  These people are payed by tips.  Possibly it is the wording thats tripping you up, you are paying their salary by ""tipping"".  Their ""tips"" are all the money they make.  Same deal with stippers and to a lesser extent, bartenders.

This is almost exclusively a food service phenomena.  It's just the way the system works, and I'm not even applying my logic to it.  I assume that people in America understand this, but this thread has taught me that the semantics have a lot of people confused.

I also assume that many people don't tip because they are cheap or just outright mean.  Possibly they just don't understand that when someone serves you food, you are paying their salary.

I'm not saying its the best system, but thats the way it works here and it has for a long time.  I understand that you don't agree, but there's no way this system will change.  Undertipping only punishes the lowest level of employee and does nothing to change the system.

I apologize for my earlier assumptions, I assumed you were being deliberately cruel, though I can tell you are very angry about something.

edit:  I feel I should add, that compared to anywhere else in the world I have been; restaurant costs in America are extreemly low.  This is in large part because of the very low wages paid to the staff.  You are making up for this artificially low food/labor cost by basically paying the wait staff.  The trade-off is that you get to determine how well they are compensated for the level of service you receive.","1277953803"

Almost no languages have a ""cut and paste"" include except for C.

And in C an include is not a library -- it may specify an interface to a library.

In C, an include file does ""cut and paste"" to give you specification, not implementation -- you will need to also link to the library.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","The uncertainty principle is actually really elegant, and the derivation almost simple if you know a little bit of calculus (you don't have to do calculus, you just have to know what a derivative is).  The whole thing is algebra.

You know of the commutative principle, that A*B=B*A.  Well, it turns out it's not always true for quantum mechanics.  It is not true when the uncertainty principle applies, and the amount of uncertainty is 1/2 times the amount that they do not commute!  It's really simple and brilliant.

I don't think it's a break from the Greeks in any way, I think that Archimedes would be proud of such a mathematical achievement.  But, even if it were, the modern sciences are founded upon a sort of realist position anyway.  I don't think that quantum physics is a significant break from the realist position at all.

Quantum Physics, certainly, does not mean that we can't make statements (even universal statements) about quantum objects.  It merely limits the scope of statements we can make.  However, above the classical limit (the classical limit is the limit of which we can describe particles using classical mechanics, when quantum objects interact with the classical limit, we observe quantum behavior), we can't make certain statements about all sorts of objects.  We have limits up here too, areas that we can't make statements about.  For instance we can't classify any object as 5-dimensional, as none exist in our 3 dimensional space.  And, certainly, we still have Godel's incompleteness theorem limiting the space of statements we can make about the world as well.

I think that modern physics has this sort of problem only when you don't understand the mathematical basis of it.","1277953832"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","This is a new manifestation of a fairly old DNS vulnerability. In 1999, EDNS hit the streets (so to speak) which allowed for the fragmentation of DNS data. Now, data that used to be forced into a 512 byte udp packet had no limitation.

One of the results of this was DNS tunneling, where *other* data would just kinda piggy back into the unused part of the packet (since standard DNS data takes us so little space). This is similar to ICMP tunneling, except it's a LOT harder to limit DNS traffic on a network since it is so vital to the internet. And the DNS tunneling proved to be **fast**. Early testers were able to retain RDP sessions tunneled over DNS. 

It's really a huge security hole, but does require ownership of both ends, or for one of the ends to be otherwise vulnerable to get the scripts on the host. But it does allow for hackers to get behind all firewalls on a network and then have unfettered access to other network resources. 

There are security methods to counter this sort of attack, but they are majorly underused within ISPs and not realistic to push down to customers since it requires limiting usable recursive servers and responses to a query (unrealistic politically and logistically).

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Yes, I recall my con law professor criticizing Scalia's original intent doctrine with arguments along the lines you are making.  After all, the founders did recognize the counting of slaves in percentage terms.  

In order to rectify this interpretation one might have to part with the 'original intent' doctrine.  I am guessing that Scalia might just say the 14th did that already.  To which I would reply, ""so you agree with the Dred Scott decision?""  He will likely say something sarcastic at this point that makes the rounds on the blogs.  

But this is all speculation.  The guy is really sharp and I would do whatever I could to avoid a  public argument with him because, quite frankly, I would come out the loser.  I sure do wish I could have taken Con law from him.  

Regardless, I am not a Constitutional law scholar, but IMHO, the Dred Scott decision and its aftermath is a very strong argument for a 'living constitution.'  By strict textual and 'originalism' analysis the opinion was 'correct.'  But reading it from hindsight, it was clearly wrong... just wrong.  Justice was not served.  So, I think it is important for judges to keep an eye out for oppression of the minority by the majority and should avoid enabling such oppression.","1277953903"

If you make $2.13/hr (I don't know why this number is stuck...) and you wait 5 tables in that hour, (assuming a dinner table for 2 at Applebees with no appetizer and no dessert) you make 3.75 per table on a 15% tip.

I have no option to walk into the back and let someone else take over. Simply by the physical danger I am in every night I deserve more than you.
