"food","t5_2qh55","-**Ribeye** is my favorite and easiest to cook.
-**Porterhouse** to me is meh, it's just a strip sirloin and filet mignon on different sides.  More difficult to cook, filet has no beef flavor.
-**Flatiron** is one of my more favorite cuts as its cheaper than most other cuts and has intense marbling but tends to not be as tender.
-**Skirt** is alright if you are poor but most of the time its cut to be super thing and looks like flaps not ideal for steak cooking but for carne asada yes.
-**Hangar steak** hard to find but it is firm yet a little bit tender and full of beef flavor, one of my new favorites.
-**New York Strip**: one of my lesser liked cuts as its tough and very little marbling, if buying only buy prime cuts.
-**Sirloin steak**: its tendy with a nice beef flavor I think of it as a between a ribeye and strip steak in terms of tenderness and beef flavor.
tri tip: depending on price I will pick up prime grade if I can get it for the price of choice ribeye.

So my top 3 are:
**1. Ribeye
2. Flatiron
3. Hangar**
I know the last two can be hard to find so sirloin is a nice 4th option as well.","1325376015"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I agree.  It is important to make the setup and use of VOIP as simple as possible to maximize its adoption within the game and that can be challenging.

However, I'd say that games like MMOs, such as WoW, lend themselves towards the use text chat and private VOIP servers.  Back when I played WoW, I rarely wanted to talk to a random player and if I did, the gameplay provided me with ample time to type out complex messages.  With members of a guild, that was different; voice became an integral part of socializing and coordinating raids, etc.

For team FPS games, I often want to tell a random player something and the fast-paced gameplay makes it impossible to type out complex messages (unless I'm staring at the spawn screen).  Being able to bark out a warning or order to another player, even if it's unidirectional because the other player hasn't bothered to set up VOIP, is beneficial to gameplay, in my opinion.","1325376032"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I don't think ideology is really the problem. It's more structural, the realities and necessities of power. Ideology serves only as rationale, justification, rhetorical cover as people who seek power, or seek to hold on to it, implement policies that are of benefit to the rich, influential, the powerful - those who can help the attain power or hold on to it - but that achieve results that are exactly the opposite of what their purported ideology aimed for.

Liberals and progressives hate libertarianism because Republicans specialize in using it as rhetorical cover, while implementing corporatist BS. Yet the problem isn't with Libertarianism per se - the same can be done with Socialism. See e.g. USSR and Maoist China. This is the lesson of Animal Farm. Those who are convinced capitalism/free market ideology are the problem should do well to understand, Socialism too is prone to being hijacked and coopted, and used to do great evil.

So maybe the thing to do is not fight at the ideology level, but try to improve people's understanding of the political system. It flabbergasts me that so many otherwise intelligent progressives are absolutely convinced that if they cast a vote for Ron Paul, they'll magically morph into heartless greedy libertarians, or the American Ruling Class will somehow turn more libertarian in economic ideology, or something.

They remind me of Christian fundie nutters who are convinced that if we stop mass-murdering Arabs, or funding Israel, next thing you know we'll be under occupation by Islamic Caliphate troops who will impose Sharia on us.

I'm huge about minding your own business. But policemen are just doing a job, trying to provide for their families. If you don't like what they are enforcing as a whole, take it up with the government. They are the ones who create laws. ","1325376046"
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","[This NYT article](http://loyalopposition.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/beyond-eeny-meeny-miny-moe-sorting-out-the-g-o-p-field/?hp) helped me a lot:


**Michele Bachmann** is the obvious choice for a true Tea Party believer, who wants a candidate to carry the banner of far right contempt for and alienation from Washington. Other candidates try on the Tea Party tri-corn, but it doesn‚Äôt fit. Ms. Bachmann is the real deal ‚Äì and for that reason, I think she has no chance of winning.

**Rick Santorum** is the candidate for a Republican who places a high premium on strongly conservative social positions sincerely held. Mr. Santorum doesn‚Äôt just talk about these issues, he‚Äôs voted on them repeatedly. He is inflexibly opposed to a woman‚Äôs right to make decisions about her reproductive life. He is clearly religious but doesn‚Äôt exploit it like like Gov. Rick Perry, who wears his Christianity on his sleeve and across his shirts, like a Nike swoosh. And if you really care about abortion, as in banning it, Mr. Santorum is your guy.

**Rick Perry** is an alternative for voters who are driven by their Christian faith, and don‚Äôt mind that he‚Äôs going to embarrass them by using their common religion in a comic-opera way. People who miss George W. Bush and want to make that mistake all over again could do a lot worse than Mr. Perry. That also goes for death penalty advocates. Mr. Perry is not reliably rightwing on immigration, but I can‚Äôt imagine that he would actually pursue his beliefs on the subject if he got into office. Kind of like Mr. Bush.

**Jon Huntsman** is the obvious choice for more moderate Republicans who like a candidate who can articulate his positions, has experience in international affairs (remember when Republicans actually cared about that?), has governing experience (as governor of Utah) and knows his way around the executive branch. You just have to get over the fact that he seems certain to lose, big.

**Ron Paul** is a no-brainer if you want the candidate who has the most clearly held views and is not afraid to break with orthodoxy (like admitting he‚Äôs to the left of President Obama on Iran). You have to be a libertarian, which to me is a really eccentric idea for a governing philosophy. I get what happens on Day 1: You bring the federal government down to Somali proportions. What do you do on Day 2? Step over the homeless and the hungry on your way to a Cato Institute meeting?

**Newt Gingrich** is the front runner if you believe the polls. Personally, I can‚Äôt believe even the fringe Republicans who dominate the Iowa caucuses would nominate him. But if you want a bomb-throwing neo-conservative who hates the very idea of a government that helps those who need help, then Mr. Gingrich is the right choice. He is anti-abortion, anti-gay, anti-gun control, anti-judge, anti-almost anything you can name. The catch is that he may well be unelectable beyond the narrow confines of the Republican primary system. His positions, starting with his utter contempt for an independent judiciary, are far too radical. (By the way, his take on Jefferson and the courts last night was not quite historically accurate.) It‚Äôs hard to imagine a broad range of Americans tolerating his buffoonish posing as a historian statesman, when really he‚Äôs a history influence peddler, or his tendency to compare himself to Reagan, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. But, if you‚Äôre a true science-fiction fanatic who wouldn‚Äôt mind a government shutdown or a few constitutional crises, vote for Mr. Gingrich.


**Mitt Romney**. It‚Äôs hard to characterize the kind of Republican voter who should choose Mr. Romney, because we have no clue what he actually believes. If you‚Äôre opposed to health care reform, and are troubled by the fact that he was a pioneer in that area, you can be comforted by the fact that whatever he believes, he will probably govern from the quasi-conservative positions he‚Äôs been taking lately. He seems like the most electable of the group right now, mostly because he‚Äôs the least terrifying to people who are not committed right-wingers. He could, theoretically, pose the greatest threat to Mr. Obama.","1325376046"

There's a lot of good stuff there that's perfectly fine, I've never bought anything that was 'bad'. But then, I don't buy there exclusively either because in some cases it's more expensive than going to our local grocery store because you can't really get what you need, just a bunch of wildcard items. It's great for personal care products, too. I go there on a whim sometimes. :D","1325376048"
"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm fine with the way it is now.
Children can pray in public school, if it's done silently and not teacher-led. That's the way it should be, in my opinion.

It's the only fair way to do it in a secular nation full of people of different religions as well as atheists. 

If you're OK with teacher-led prayer in public schools, is that only because you assume it's going to be Christian? Or would you be bothered if it was a teacher-led Muslim prayer? Or Hindu prayer? Or Wiccan?

Granted, in private schools, children can pray out loud and have it be teacher-led. So, if you want your kid to be able to experience teacher-led prayer, send them to private school...

As it stands now, no one is barring kids from praying silently in class, to themselves. I think that's the way it should be.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","well i think you only need to look at examples of poor countries becoming socialist. Lets take Cuba first. It was a dirt poor banana island in the 50s. Today the population has a life expactancy longer than America. There's loads of things wrong with it but i think that it is pretty open and shut that they all stem from the US' terrorist war and blockade of the island.

In Venezuela poverty has halved in ten years, illiteracy has been wiped out, there are 50% more people voting in elections than before, malnourishment has been banished forever etc. 

There's a common idea that what was called 'socialism' in Eastern Europe failed. Well, it was a pale imitation of socialism but that's a whole other argument. I grew up in one of those countries and i can tell you that under socialism we went from the 3rd world to the 2nd world. Since 1989 the vast majority of the people have gone right back to the 3rd world again. Sure, GDP might look better but that is simply because we monetized everything, such as the right to not die or the right to go to school. 

At the heart of your question is what constitutes being 'poor'. I really don't think there are any poor countries left- maybe 200-300 years ago there were. Let me explain; I imagine Africa and Asia were your ideas of 'poor places'. But this idea really doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. Bangladesh was the richest society in the world before it was conquered by the British. Robert Clive couldn't believe the wealth which adorned the cities, gold dripping from wall to wall. Democratic Republic of the Congo has about the lowest standards of living in the world. And yet it may have more natural resources than any other. It is teeming with minerals and metals. Where's the money going? Into Dutch oil companies, Scandanavian electronic corporations and US rubber companies. In fact, the countries which 'should' be poorest, those with the least amount of resources, are the richest (western europe). There are no poor countries, only poor people. 

What I'm saying is if big corporations were kicked out, these countries would be richer than the US and the UK were in the 20s and 30s. There are really only rich or mega-rich countries now, but, because of capitalism, the majority of the world still lives in poverty. So, in answer, the people would be much better off under socialism.","1325376064"

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","With these suggested foregrip changes, guns with high horizontal recoil will be unusable in close quarters (this includes g36c, g53, A-91, qbz-95b, f2000, famas, aek-971, kh2002) no matter what you attach into them other than a crap bipod. And attaching a bipod to carbines listed above is just retarded since it takes 7 bullets to kill on longer ranges (something that I'd never understand). Even if you tried to attach a heavy barrel next to foregrip to these carbines, you'll just have to resort to your pistol in CQB as an engineer which shouldn't be happening.

Alan Kertz will kill any run&amp;gun play there is on close quarters with these changes and everybody will have to use low horizontal recoil weapons if they want to do so like m416, m16, m4 with either a suppressor or laser without foregrip. 

Suggested changes will basically make everyone start using the same weapons without foregrips or bipod then he'll come back here and bitch about everyone using the same 3-4 weapons as Assault and Engineer and not attaching a bipod or foregrip. He'll probably keep continuing by nerfing those since they'll all be overused by then.

Making foregrip reduce horizontal recoil by 0.1 deg on all weapons gotta be the worst idea this guy ever suggested. My bet is that it'll be in the next patch since he's basically screwing the game over and over again every patch.","1325376068"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hi, I really appreciated your post, you obviously are very knowledgeable about your field(obviously, if you've got a PhD, you've put a lot of work into it, so I just want you to know it's clear you're a very intelligent and, while I haven't personally contracted your services, I am going to make the assumption that you are very thorough). I have a few questions, I do have a few mental health issues, but they aren't rare at all, and the diagnosis has been confirmed by numerous mental health professionals(multiple psychiatrists, all of whom evaluated me over a 60minute period, a psychologist, a social worker with a doctorate in social work, and some regular social workers, as well as a pediatric neurologist when I was 17(I'm 19 now, going to be 20 on Jan 21st, and this neurologist is one who is quite well known in the medical community). Basically, I've just got run of the mill depression, panic disorder, as well as sleep disturbances due to a very rare genetic condition I have called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which causes me extreme chronic pain, I have seen palliative care physicians, neurologists, physiatrists(not the same as a psychiatrist), and pain management physicians(anesthesiologists or physiatrists who have completed an extensive fellowship post residency in pain medicine), neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and of course a few internists, all of whom have confirmed the diagnosis. The level of pain I experience is what causes my depression for the most part(though, I have developed thought patterns as a result of my pain which can trigger a depressive episode, I am working with my psychologist to learn coping skills and the like). 

Basically, the pain I have prevents me from doing several of my favorite things, things that you wouldn't even think would be influenced by pain, like simply going over to friends houses to sit around and play video games, walking up stairs, going to the store, but the most serious issue is the effect this disorder has had on my academic performance. It isn't that I lack intelligence or motivation(though at times my motivation is low), but my ability to attend classes is at times non-existent. For example, my last year of high school(I graduated in 2010) I missed at least two days every week, I still graduated in the top 25% of my class, and graduated with honors, but since high school my pain has become much more severe and has spread to areas I wouldn't have ever expected it to spread to(Ehlers-Danlos is a connective tissue disease that results in frequent joint dislocations, tendon/ligament injuries, etc), the most serious pain I have now is abdominal pain and incredibly severe back pain(I have a syrinx in my spinal cord, you'd understand what it is if you look it up, if you don't already, it is usually caused by a chiari malformation, which I don't really have).

The thing I've written this all for is to give you some understanding of the challenges I face in everyday life. But, I have big dreams, I'd actually like to be either a neuropsychologist or a neuroscientist, those fields of study are just endlessly interesting to me, and I love studying them. But, due in part to my depression, and pain, I often have very severe anxiety over one area of my academic abilities. You see, when I was in 1st grade, I was diagnosed with a mathematics learning disability(the testing was done by a school psychologist and took around 5-6 hours, I had to redo this testing every couple of years, all of the testing took 5-6 hours and also tested other areas of my intelligence to see if I had any learning disabilities there). During school, I was in a special ed class to help with my math(but in a regular math class, the special ed class gave me access to teachers who could help me understand it, and communicate to my math teachers my issues and make changes so that I could succeed, I'm sure you understand the special education system). However, I've never really gotten any solid evidence provided to me about my disorder itself, nor have I learned much about it, I don't even know the name of the disorder. I'm curious if a neuropsychological evaluation could possibly help me to get more information about exactly what is the source of the disability, I mean, I know there is no magic pill to help with learning disabilities, but I'm just wondering if a neuropsych could help me in anyway at all, if I could do some testing to just learn maybe WHY I have the disability(as in, what IS my disability, I can understand medical and psychological information with ease, I've considered going into medicine even). The reason I want to learn as much about my disability as possible is because I realize that my inability to really do math will be extremely deleterious to my ability to succeed in any graduate program for neuropsychology, psychology, or medical school due to the amount of complex statistics classes which often contain elements of calculus, as well it will most likely prevent me from even completing premedical requirements since there is a great deal of math required, including calculus. Therefore, I often feel defeated before I've really begun to get into serious classes that would pave the way for a future as a clinician, medical doctor, or academic, and that sense of defeat causes me a lot of anxiety and depression. 


TL;DR- Is there even the slightest chance that a neuropsych evaluation could help me understand my disability so that perhaps I could go about learning methods to overcome my weaknesses.

NOTE: I realize that the internet is not the most appropriate place to ask these questions, but I've never really met a neuropsychologist to ask them personally, and I'd hate to waste both their time and my time with something that has no chance of helping in anyway whatsoever. I am not asking for medical or psychological advice, as I know that since you cannot evaluate me personally, it'd be a legal liability on your part. 

If you feel more comfortable answering this question in a private message, or have more specific questions to ask me, please feel free to send them in a private message. I am extremely grateful for any attention you give to this post.

Regards,

Tore a small piece out of the middle of the thumb nail, leaving jagged shards of nail in the wound.  Extremely painful, but so small I thought I could just shrug it off.  I tried shaking my hand - big mistake.  Then I tried running cold water over it - another mistake.  Then I tried ignoring it.  Next thing I knew I was on the floor and my friends were picking me up.  I had gone completely unconscious, face first, down to the cement floor, but fortunately my face was saved because I was close enough to the wall to hit my forehead into that first.  Left a good sized hole in the drywall, and cut my forehead a bit, but that was really nothing, compared to the pain in my thumb.

Depends on how you define the terms ""smart"" and ""smarter"".

"swtor","t5_2qxih","How do you get PvE gear?

Only PvE gear I've got during a week of lvl50 are ""epic"" item mods for daily tokens on Ilum (you can earn around 20 tokens daily, hilts/barrels/armor mods cost 8 tokens apiece). Gear is similar to lowest level PvP sets you can find on fleet pvp vendor (centurion?) Daily PvE quests on Ilum require hours of time if solo - NPCs are tougher than on other planets.

How do you get PVP gear? (And highend PVP gear)

2 daily PvP quests (win 3 warzones + flip 5 points on Ilum) provide 1 champion bag each. 2 weekly quests (win 9 warzones + flip 15 points on Ilum) gives 3 bags each. Drop rate from the bags is around 1:3 / 1:4 (some people reporting 32 bags without single item drop) - so in my opinion it doesn't worth time to farm 800 warzone commendations to get a bag with semi-useless 3 tokens.

Where are the daily quest hubs?

I've found dailies on Ilum and Belsavis (there are lvl50 parts of map on 41-43 Belsavis, you will be sent to there by a quest giver on Imperial fleet). I suspect there are dailies on Corellia but I didn't finished ""secondary"" quest line there yet.","1325376094"

"politics","t5_2cneq","The text not in bold are Ron Paul's own words unedited.

Ron Paul - Bill of rights http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul259.html

*If anything, the Supreme Court should have refused to hear the Kelo case on the grounds that the 5th amendment does not apply to states. If constitutional purists hope to maintain credibility, we must reject the phony incorporation doctrine in all cases ‚Äî not only when it serves our interests. The issue in the Kelo case is the legality of the eminent domain action under Connecticut law, not federal law. Congress can and should act to prevent the federal government from seizing private property, but the fight against local eminent domain actions must take place at the local level. The people of New London, Connecticut could start by removing from office the local officials who created the problem in the first place.*



**Ron Paul lying about the Constitution**

The Founding Fathers envisioned a robustly Christian yet religiously tolerant America, with churches serving as vital institutions that would eclipse the state in importance. Throughout our nation's history, **churches have done what no government can ever do, namely teach morality and civility. Moral and civil individuals are largely governed by their own sense of right and wrong, and hence have little need for external government. This is the real reason the collectivist Left hates religion: Churches as institutions compete with the state for the people's allegiance, and many devout people put their faith in God before their faith in the state. Knowing this, the secularists wage an ongoing war against religion, chipping away bit by bit at our nation's Christian heritage. Christmas itself may soon be a casualty of that war.

""The notion of a rigid separation between church and state has no basis in either the text of the Constitution or the writings of our Founding Fathers. On the contrary, our Founders' political views were strongly informed by their religious beliefs. Certainly the drafters of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, both replete with references to God, would be aghast at the federal government's hostility to religion.""

**Ron Paul on sexual harassment**

""Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity,"" Paul wrote. ""Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts? Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended, **but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem? Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable.""

**Ron Paul - We the people act**

The We the People Act forbids federal courts, including the Supreme Court, from adjudicating cases concerning State laws and polices relating to religious liberties or ""privacy,""* including cases involving sexual practices, sexual orientation or reproduction. The We the People Act also protects the traditional definition of marriage from judicial activism by ensuring the Supreme Court cannot abuse the equal protection clause to redefine marriage. In order to hold Federal judges accountable for abusing their powers, the act also provides that a judge who violates the act's limitations on judicial power shall either be impeached by Congress or removed by the President, according to rules established by the Congress.

Their excuse is that they are trying to ""save"" jobs. If they really were looking out for every American they would be trying to get as much information as possible from the people that would have the most / best information on the subject.

It is entirely possible that they are doing exactly that and it isn't so much that they are ""in bed with corporate interests"", but that what we are seeing is the side effect of entrusting them with an impossible task.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;When men can become impregnated, carry a baby to term, and give birth - we may have reproductive equality. Until then, biological differences make true equality absolutely impossible.

All I'm asking is you this to stay consistent. I'm fine with men having no reproductive rights **under this one circumstance:** which is, if the child is her's because it's in her body, then it's her's after birth as well. If a father feels like ditching the kid, it's now his right because it didn't come from his body, and until men can give birth, they don't need to take responsibility for kids. 

Again, I'm only advocating this to keep it logically consistent. If the man has no right to tell a woman what to do with her body, then she has no right to hold him accountable for what happened in her body.

If we're all in control of our bodies and only our bodies, then women can't force men to take care of their children. If you don't agree with this, then tell me how you're being logically consistent. That is, how can you apply the logic to women, but not to men. ","1325376122"

Yes, it's wet.  If you're not comfortable in that, don't ride.  If you are, then you're golden.  Yes there are hills.  There are routes so that you can avoid the worst of the hills for either lights or rain.  If all else fails, there's a great bus system in place.  I'm still pretty much a fair weather rider, but I've been out a bunch of times since I got my endorsement last month.  Even several times this week.  I got rained on once, but I have waterproof gear, so I didn't care, other than being my first time in the rain.

The other drivers around here seem to be ok with cyclists.  At least I haven't noticed a problem yet.  But even when driving I like Seattle drivers.  However, we moved from NC three years ago where you need to develop a sixth sense against the idiocy of driving there.  So *anywhere* seems tame and normal after that for 10 years.  People use turn signals here to indicate a turn.  Other drivers see that and respect it.  There are far fewer tailgaters here.  The pace is generally much much slower, about the speed limit rather than 20 mph above it.  The roads are noisier, though.  

There are quite a few Seattleites over on /r/motorcycles.  So you can pose your question there and get a much more rider centric view on it.  I haven't ridden anywhere else, but I like riding here.  So much to see and do, fun roads and straight roads, highways and country roads.  My husband likes to drive up to the mountains, turn around and come home.  ","1325376146"

And now those lies are being recycled and fed anew to gullible Americans, With ""Iran"" in place of ""Iraq"".

Gareth Porter offers a comprehensive debunking of the recent show-trial verdict.  See [""Crackpot Anti-Islam Activists, ‚ÄòSerial Fabricators,‚Äô and the Tale of Iran and 9/11""](http://original.antiwar.com/porter/2011/12/30/the-tale-of-iran-and-911/), *Truthout*, 31 Dec 2011.  Incredibly, the witnesses were not cross-examined!  Porter also summarizes Iran's record of cooperation with the U.S. in the apprehension of Al Qaeda.  Let's recall that Iran itself is a victim of terrorism -- most of it the work of MeK.

. .

We should not be complacent, but there are at least a few signs that our vehement opposition to another U.S.-initiated war may be having an effect.  Recently, the neo-con high-priests at the American Enterprise Institute admitted that Iran is *not* a nuclear threat.  In Israel the former head of the Mossad, Meir Dagan, has called the planned attack on Iran [""the stupidest thing I've ever heard""](http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/former-mossad-chief-israel-air-strike-on-iran-stupidest-thing-i-have-ever-heard-1.360367).  And now the current head of the Mossad, Tamir Pardo, is saying that [Iran does *not* pose an existential threat to Israel](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/12/30/mossad-chief-iranian-nuclear-weapon-wouldnt-be-existential-threat/).

If it has any medical merit, it is simply a species of Tylenol given, a financial decision made with humans as stock, as money, because it's cheaper.  

Eugenics by this same guiding logic is a sensible plan, too.

Human life is incalculable, the $60K would be better spent opening another bed someplace, diverting resources from an ill-defined and questionable measure to a visibly working one.

The problem of addiction is mental and spiritual:  if you are in a hole, stop digging.  

The suffering is a result of human choice, weakness, arrogance, greed, folly.  Crackheads - and watch this now because it is the key missing concept - *know* that they are crackheads.  

Really.  True story.  This foppish and weak half-measure designed by bleeding hearts so-called is evidence of an unconscionable failure to think matters through and acknowledge simple facts.

Sophistry, milk-sop sentimentality and reactivity, and politics - in a word, human nature - are to blame for the problems of addiction.  Fracture that central concept any way you wish, you still have a piece of the same pie.

Please downvote me further, or if you can, expose the falsity of what I say.

Puerile ingrates are the result of same.  These people need help, and this measure will merely help to extend their suffering.

Enter any store in the neighbourhood; these pipes and their related paraphernalia are sold, in some cases openly.  A wee rose in a glass tube, other 'glassware'.

It is only slightly different to sell one of these to a person than it is to give them one:  the net result to the crack user is exactly the same.

Think about that and rebut it, because it is the direction that the idea is thrusting in; diverting users less and not more from their road to destruction, into deepened and not lessened misery, as they walk the common road to death multifarious.","1325376162"

When I was quite young, I had farmer neighbors up the road who kept a handful of rabbits in hutches. Once, they took them out of the hutches one by one and let me hold and pet them. Fortunately I was too young then to comprehend their eventual fate, or I might have led a lapine insurrection.

When I was about twelve, I went to the county fair and saw a booth where they had rabbits for sale, including this huge specimen for $50, probably a Flemish Giant or Chinchilla, in retrospect, though specific details of appearance escape me. Anyway, I positively begged my mother to let me buy it with my accumulated allowance, but she refused... wisely comprehending that I was more eager to possess the rabbit than to care for it.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","False. Fat stores far more calories per unit volume than carbohydrates. Carbohydrate molecules are, by definition, already half oxidized (oxidation is the process which releases energy for the body to use, so being half oxidized means there's less stored for future use). That's why our bodies use glycogen (a carbohydrate) for short-term storage (primarily for the overnight fast as we sleep), but fat for long-term storage. Our bodies would have to be much larger to contain enough carbohydrates to store the same amount of energy as our fat stores.

I'm not an expert either ‚Äì I only have an undergraduate degree so far. But biology is a science, and scientific facts are determined by careful study and experimentation, not by speculation about uncontrolled personal experience.

I bought it for $19.99 the day before the Holiday Sale began, and still think it's one of my better purchases, and one of the better zombie games I've played.  WAY better in my opinion than either Dead Rising.  The melee combat is incredibly visceral and while on one hand zombies are easy to kill, on the other hand every one of them is a potential threat.  I also really like how the game plays out quest-wise (admittedly I'm only a few hours in, and only just reached the next major game area), because it's not all ""Here take this automatic weapon we found lying around, and kill 50,000 zombies"".   It's got more of a genuine outbreak survival feel.  Go find food.  Find water.  Find a bigger safe house, because we have 10 survivors in a tiny hotel room and tensions are running high.  Shit like that.

The game isn't perfect.  Guns so far have been rare, but they kind of handle like shit.  Melee weapons are incredibly flimsy, even things that should last forever like lead pipes and crowbars.  However, they're lying around EVERYWHERE, so even if your weapon breaks you can just pick one up lying at your feet.  Also, while I like the idea of leveling and gaining new skills from experience, I find it odd that the zombies level with you.  How?   How are zombies gaining in experience?  They're dead.  

Still, absolutely worth $20.   I love the hell out of it even singleplayer, but I have to admit it's a ton of fun multiplayer as well.  ","1325376189"

It's annoying because religious debates have gone on for thousands of years and the some of the greatest minds to ever live have been both religious or atheists. The arguments are definitely not over, and when someone treats it as such, that is annoying.

When I say ""on your toes"" it should be at almost all times.  When you are on top especially.  When you are on top you want that guy to carry all of your weight at all times.  If you are on your knees he is not going to be carrying your weight.
When you are trying to do the pancake or cow catcher you need to get the guy moving.  You have to get the front head lock and keep ripping or pulling the guy down and to your toes as you sprawl .  When he fights that he will pull his head and body up, and that is when you throw the pancake.  As you wrestle better and better competition you will be less likely to hit this move though.

The right to leave, disband or revoke rules of a society should exist, because the right to make rules by majority should exist.

yes, it is hard on relationships and friendships.  I am basically a social retard.  I have had one best friend my whole life, and she tore my heart out of my chest and ate it for dinner.  Not exactly looking to fill that position anytime soon.  I have problems letting people in, but i have bigger problems meeting people in the first place.   I was married, which is how i ended up in california and nebraska, and then when i got divorced i had to move in with my mom who had moved to s.carolina.  I don't plan on staying here no.  I'm thinking of moving to the Chicago area, though i'm not sure.  I have friends that i met at a convention that live up there and it would be great to move somewhere i know people.   Either way, i don't have anything keeping me here.   

Thank the gods for Reddit.

Where's your mom from?  While i agree that some things are... i dunno what the word is... more abundant here, i just don't think quality of life will sustain much longer.  And frankly, i don't like having to break my back at a job i hate for a meager living.  Not retail at least.  If i had my own farm, okay, i could see it.  But there is zero satisfaction in going home at the end of a long day of selling cheap sweat shop made shit.  I might can fool myself sometimes like today, but it was because i actually did something at work and not because i handled customers.  (re-organized some shit that needed it badly)  I dunno.  I am frustrated.  I want a simpler life is all, and you can't achieve that here.  Or it is very difficult and usually requires waiting till retirement.

Granted from wikipedia, but the article is accurate, well-sourced and conservative. I selected it for succinctness and readability. But if you don't want objective third-party claims and only ""facts"" off the top of my head...

Assuming that humans don't stop the rate of pollution to levels that the environment can readily absorb:

Anthropogenic change to the environment is outpacing normal environmental changes and some extinction-event changes. The rate of change is so great that it is speculated that many macroscopic will not be able to adapt to these changes and it will take time for other species adapt and fill any voids in the within ecosystems. The human species has situated itself within many of the major ecosystems, including coastal and continental shelf marine shelf life. Those particular systems are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is one of the best evidences for anthropogenic driven environmental impacts due to the rate of change and the correlations we can make to human activity.

Extinction level events normally take a lot time and many factors come into play. The current rate of ocean acidification is fast and is likely to be one of the first factors to affect humans in their death march.

This first factor is likely to kill off 90% of shellfish by the end of the century. This mass extinction, already in progress, will result in the removal of a major component of marine niches. In turn the those marine niches will fail and stress the connected niches. Many humans, inland and coastal, depend on those niches for subsistence and economic activities. Those populations will have to adapt new niches or die. This stresses otherwise indirectly affected niches making them susceptible to anthropogenically charged environmental changes, such as top-soil removal, soil and water salinization, desertification and acid rain, thus resulting in more hastened demises of niches and further crunches to the human population.

These events are happening now. There are increasing tracts of land that were once bountiful in our lifetimes but are now devoid of significant life, coastal areas denuded of most fauna and animals are only drawn there for our waste.

Honestly I don't want to go on talking about this anymore. You may believe I am exaggerating the situation and I'm not psychic and can't see the future but there are people dying now in failed niches and the number of non-productive areas in the world is increasing, not decreasing. We are near the tipping-point and unless people in power take off their blinds or actually start caring about their great grand children, humans will find themselves in an undesirable situation ","1325376265"

He had not been answering family members calls for 2 or 3 days, so I swung by his house after work to check on him.  Knocked on the door, rang the door bell, heard his dog bark but no answer.

I had no key to his house so I got out a credit card and jimmied the door open that way.

His dog seemed frightened.  I go through the kitchen into the living room to see him hunched over his couch.

He was an alcoholic, so I figured he had got wasted and passed out.  I looked through the kitchen one more time to see how many beers he had drank or bottles of whiskey.  No alcohol at all.

I go over to wake him up and touch him on the back of the neck.  Cold, stiff, pale, lifeless.  That's when I noticed some blood stains on the couch, a gun to his right and a bullet hole in the top of his head.

I was pretty fucked up about it for a year.  I still have nightmares about it from time to time but not like the first year it happened.  I cry every February 17th; the day I found him.  I have his dog now.  Sometimes it almost pains me to look at the dog because it can lead to memories of what happened that day and the condition I found the dog and my uncle in.","1325376274"

I'd be willing to concede that we differing opinions on ""facts"", but you'd have to acknowledge that some of yours also have more than one interpretation. It's true that John was having difficulties with acid around the time of Pepper and that when Brian died, he felt lost and hurt again, and that he was doubting things, in depression, and lacking incentive. But there is no record of Paul ""guilting"" him staying in The Beatles nor is there any statements made during that time that he wanted to leave. He only said that _after_ the Beatles had broken up and he was in a negative space about them. When George left during the Get Back sessions, he was very vocal in keeping the group going and was secretly recorded in personal conversations with Paul and Yoko about keeping the band together.

Yoko visited Paul and asked him to talk to John about coming back when her own personal relationship on the side was over. Yoko obsessively called John almost on a daily basis, according to both John and May Pang during their separation. So John didn't come crawling back by any means.

I have a problem with no one in the scene. Yes, Yoko is on record as saying that John wanted her there and so forth, but that history is also at odds with other accounts. The best that we can say is that she allowed John to disrupt things.","1325376282"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","If you have any Swords of War and Peace, I would try to add those and take out the True Conviction.  It will still gain you life and kill your opponent faster, but it doesn't force you to overcommit into a Day of Judgment or Slagstorm.  With Sword, every creature is a threat, whereas with True Conviction, you still need about 3 creatures in play for it to be effective.  
Hero of Bladehold is a one-man army, and it's cheaper than Angelic Overseer/Geist Honored Monk.  All of them are great to play after a Day of Judgment, but the Hero lets you do it for one mana less.  (It also grows stronger each turn it attacks, which is not true of the Overseer or the Monk.)
If your metagame has lots of control decks, I would also suggest playing Midnight Haunting.  Being able to play a threat on their end step, then untap and play another makes it impossible for them to counter everything.  They just don't have enough mana in the early game.
Gideon's Avenger just feels like a worse Champion of the Parish.  He could probably be cut to make room for some of these cards.  I would not mind seeing him replaced with Fiend Hunters.  
If you can get them, adding 4 Razorverge Thicket and 2 more Gavony Township would be very powerful.
So would a single Mikaeus, the Lunarch.  He'd serve as the 5th Gavony Township.  (The land really is THAT powerful.)
I'd also move the Grand Abolisher to the main.  He seems relevant against more decks than Elite Inquisitor, although both seem fine.  First strike seems really good against a field of Illusions and other aggressive decks.
A single Angelic Destiny would also let you apply more pressure without overextending into Day of Judgment.  Not too many, though; it's a lot of mana, and it's easy to get blown out by a removal spell in response.
In any event, that's all I've got!  If you get the Razorverge Thickets, try adding a Garruk Relentless or two.  Planeswalkers are (almost always) good.","1325376298"
"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt;What guarantee do I have that the woman I will marry would be right for me?  

I think the problem stems from two different notions of marriage. 

I assume you were raised in the West, so your notion of marriage is very different from a more conservative and traditional idea of marriage. 

You are looking for a life partner it sounds. In a traditional marriage, you typically marry one of the people your parents choose. That's where the conflict arises.

If you held to a traditional notion of marriage, then you just let your parents know you want to get married, then you pick one of the several women offered and see if she and her family accepts. The concept of 'right for me' doesn't exist in that set up, it's more of 'right for both families'.

Great signal, but still losing a significant numbers of packets.  That's a bit wonky.  Anyway, now you know a bit more about where the problem lies.

Try forcing the bit rate to a lower value.  It's possible that, for some reason, it's constantly re-negotiating a rate because it's on auto, trying the best speed, failing and falling back.  Try ""iwconfig wlan0 rate 27M auto"" to give it an upper limit, which often helps on congested airspaces.  Some WiFi card drivers deal a lot better than others with congestion.  If that's the case, maybe you could switch your router's frequency to a less used channel (have a look with wpa_gui, scan).

Python gives you the ability to control your `sys.path`, thus it gives you the ability to import the version of a package you desire, either manually or automatically with a version resolving loader.

It does not preclude you from writing a util module such as

    import loader
    loader.load_module('simplejson as json &gt;= 1.4.5')

I was in my mid-20's and had recently been diagnosed with endometriosis. It was a big deal to me, so my mom immediately starting thinking that maybe she had it, too. (This is a common habit of hers and still continues to this day.) We were standing in line for something when a teenaged girl in front of us complains to her mom that she had cramps and wanted to go back to the car. My mom's bat hearing kicks in, hears this, then loudly announces that her daughter (me) has endometriosis, too (the girl didn't say that) and that her daughter gets really bad cramps. Erg.

* Knowing you have someone to come home to helps keep your priorities in order

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I don't like the attempts to vindicate atheism by saying ""nah, just communism."" Whether or not the government controls the economy is largely irrelevant to whether it enforces a given religious viewpoint by force. It would be possible to have a theocratic communist state, or a capitalist or corporatist state advancing atheism through force. What matters here is that Stalin, inheriting the political legacy of Marx, used state violence to advance atheism because he believed (or at the very least pretended to believe) atheism to be correct and preferable as a religious viewpoint. My response to the OP, again, is that **we should concede that it is possible to commit atrocities out of a belief in the merits of atheism, but argue that religion - in so far as it posits the existence of a judgemental deity and an eternal soul - makes it *easier* to justify atrocities by 'raising the stakes'.** That is to say, it is easier to justify the massacre of thousands on the basis that fewer souls will be tormented for eternity than to justify the same on the basis of concrete policy rationale. The argument that Stalin wasn't really concerned with atheism, but rather with personal power or 'communism as opposed to atheism' is what strikes me as dishonest and evasive, not the argument that atheism is less detrimental in general.

Regarding the fallacy of division, I am *not* saying that Stalin did all the bad stuff he did for the sake of spreading atheism. No, he did not wake up and say, ""hey, let's starve some Ukrainians today... FOR ATHEISM!!!"" But the **specific persecution of religious institutions and individuals was carried out to advance state atheism.**","1325376329"

have also successfully convinced the Health infrastructure body in my state to deviate from their long standing reinforced concrete floor plate requirements in hospitals in favour of a cheaper, lighter post tensioned floorplate which deals with footfall induced vibrations much more cheaply by hiding full height steel posts in partictions to shell some of the vibration out to other floors (in RC construction this might generally require more mass in the floorplate or some sort of expensive damping system or a drastic rethink of the slab or beam spans).

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","It's not a raster.  I think they typically use an MCP (microchannel plate) to amplify the signal, and I don't know what kind of CCD.  The counts are measured in 2D, all at once.

The way it works is you shoot some electrons at an area of the sample.  The electrons are reflected or diffracted by the sample surface (and the reflectivity depends on different surface features).  You take these electrons and use electron optics to form a magnified image at the detector (CCD or MCP).  The intensity of electrons at the detector (or brightness of the image) is proportional to the reflectivity of the sample.  So you're basically imaging the reflectivity of the sample at different positions.

The reflectivity also varies as a function of the incident electron energy (typically zero to a couple of tens of eV).  When you image the sample, you try to use an electron energy where different features contrast the most.  You can also do spectroscopy by measuring the reflectivity as a function of kinetic energy.","1325376345"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","&gt;You do realize that animals eat plants, right? And if we didnt eat those animals we could consume the food and water they would have eaten? And that animals eat a fuck ton of food just to supply us with a relatively small amount of meat?

Actually this is a pretty common misconception.  Animals can turn very low nutritional food/waste/food we can't digest into protein.  Pigs especially have an incredibly effective return considering they can be fed primarily waste food.

I'm not really sure where this misconception began.  If we could just eat the food the animals ate and receive the same return, why do you think humans domesticated animals or hunted in the first place?

I mean it's kind of like saying ""you realize plants only use the sun and nutrients in the ground to make food?!  We don't need to be eating plants!  We can eat the sun and ground nutrients directly!"" (we can't)

&gt;Do you also realize that half of all antibiotics go to animals? And that animals shit constantly, and fart, both of which are problematic?

Not sure why this is a problem.  Most of the worlds pesticides go to plants?  Also, shit and fart wise I assume you're talking about emissions.  These emissions are actually being taxed now and are minimal compared to the emissions caused by shipping ANY product.  Also the shit is often recycled into fuel or fertilizer.

&gt;You should also probably google ""what it's like in a factory farm."" your meat comes from disgusting places and horrendously abused, mistreated, genetically-modified animals. I just hope you're aware of that before you try to make justifications for meat eating in general.

None of these factors affect how healthy the food is for you and statistically conditions are getting better and the food is healthier (in terms of disease caused by unclean conditions).  There's no evidence to suggest genetically modified food is worse for you but there is evidence to support that it is better for you (e.g. plants modified to be resistant to bacteria).

I am very aware of these factors and, yes, it does make me sad that animals have to die so a lot of people can eat, but I don't think me being uncomfortable of a process that has been happening for centuries is reason enough to stop the process.

I would like to see conditions get better and I would like to see a healthy balance of meat and plants, but I think it's completely unreasonable to halt the process completely considering how beneficial it is as a whole.

Just because you have the luxury to be concerned about how cruelty free your food is doesn't mean everyone does.  Without these sources of food many people would starve.

Edit: And yes I have been in terrible factory farms and I used to be just like you, 100% against them.  It wasn't until I heard a story about someone like this going to another (poorer) country and asking if their salmon was cruelty free.  The people laughed.  They don't have time to be concerned about how cruelty free their food is and don't have the luxury to eat just plants because most of them are more concerned about starving to death.  They would do anything to have the level of production we have.

They don't see our factory farms as cruel, they seem them as amazing sources of food gained efficiently through advanced technology.  We have the audacity to take that for granted.","1325376352"

Vancouver is already a drug mecca. Liberalized local laws draw people, who follow the path of least resistance and  most services.

Many areas similarly ""solve"" homeless issues by just running them out, offering bus tickets to anywhere else.   Areas with more services get over-run.

It is good to try and do something, but in the context of it being illegal with hard core police tactics elsewhere, this will just force Vancouver to carry more of the fallout.","1325376359"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","I agree with most of what you're saying epsecially with your concluding statement: ""In short, it is illegeal specifically..."" I checked out the rulebook and it confirms what you said:

48.1 Illegal Check to the Head ‚Äì A hit resulting in contact with an opponent's head where the head is targeted and the principal point of contact is not permitted. However, in determining whether such a hit should have been permitted, the circumstances of the hit, including whether the opponent put himself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit **or the head contact on an otherwise legal body check was avoidable, can be considered.**

While you're right that Raffi definitely had many other options, it is easier said than done. When you're on the ice, things are moving a lot faster -- it's part of the reason I was (eventually) willing to give Lucic the benefit of the doubt on the Miller hit. In my opinion, Raffi made an instinctive play and clipped Ferrence in the head by accident. I said it somewhere in this thread that penalties should (also) be based on your actions, not your intentions; however, I disagree that it was an intentional cheap shot and was merely an unfortunate (illegal) hit.

Also, I agree that McQuaid should have responded. Your statment below about how waiting to throw a big hit on Torres is pointless. After all, if he waits and Torres does something potentially dangerous again, it'll be too late to send a message especially if one of your players is injured due to it. I worded it poorly in my initial post, but I just disliked how people were cheering on this fight based solely on their dislike of Raffi Torres and how they were labelling the hit as ""Dirty"" when I didn't feel it was dirty.

"Baking","t5_2qx1h","First off, congrats on having a passion at such a young age. People struggle their whole lives finding something they enjoy doing, and can stay happy doing every day. When I was your age I thought I wanted to be a lighting or sound designer for theaters and concerts. At 18 my interests changed and I ended up going to college for environmental studies.

While theater, the environment, and dozens of other things pique my interest, working with food seemed to be the one thing I never got sick of. Cooking, baking, thinking up recipes, feeding my friends and seeing their grins as they ate what I had created; nothing made me feel more at ease then baking, and nothing brought me more pleasure then watching someone take a bite into my creation and see a wave of extacy wash over them. 

After fucking around for a year and a half at a university way too large for someone as easily distracted as myself, I dropped out, and went home for the holidays.  I was 20 at the time, and life was terrifying. All my friends were still in College and I had no direction. Since I was renting a house in Colorado for school, my parents were supportive enough to let me go back and see where life would take me until my lease was up.  

I flew back on Jan 5th of 2010 and did some research. I found out there was a small culinary school in town asked for information on enrollment. By Jan 7th (and $14,000 poorer) I was enrolled in a 16 week full immersion pastry course on classic french pastries, techniques, and artisan breads. Since I am a creative type and lose focus quickly, this type of education was ideal. Virtually no classroom time, about 30hrs a week spent in the kitchen. There was no introduction course or busy work. We jumped RIGHT into it, from day one. 

Pastry school has been one of the highlights of my life, and the most beneficial education I have received. Even though I don't have a degree, I was able to land a job at the best bakery in town. Work was easy but intense, long hours with lots of production. The bakery was American baked goods, cookies, cupcakes, brownies, cakes etc. I loved to be baking, but there was a lack of freedom and creativity with that job. 

After a few months at that bakery I was hired to manage another bakery in town. I was able to create my own recipes at this bakery and had the luxury to get creative and show off my craft.   

Currently I am back home for the holidays and have staged (worked for free) at one of the top restaurants in Chicago under an amazing, young and upcoming pastry chef. That experience taught me a few things. Fine dining is a very fast paced, long houred (this job was 16hrs a day, non-stop, on your feet. ZERO breaks, in a hot small kitchen pumping out some of the finest foods in the Windy City) occupation that requires total devotion. You lose your social life with a job like that, but gain experience and recognition. 

When I return to Colorado I will continue to look for baking jobs, since it is what I love to do. When I was in pastry school I learned which areas of pastry were more for me. You can make a career as a chocolatier, tempering chocolate into truffles and such. You can be a bread baker or cake decorator, an abstract artist or focus on meticulous design and perfection. There are so many paths and directions within the pastry world to suit your personality and skill set. 

 If baking is your passion, I recommend you start doing the following sooner then later. 

-Many high schools/community centers offer cooking classes for teens. These can lead you to state wide competitions and gaining great experience at a young age. I wish I had known about this when I was your age. Do a little googling on teen culinary competions and figure out how to get involved. While your friends run track and play in the band, you should be out there baking up a storm. 
-It's a little early at 15, but you may want to start looking at culinary schools of all sorts. There are schools like Johnson and Wales, real universities with actual degrees, that are 2-4 years but you need to take classes unrelated to baking/cooking. There are schools that focus solely on cooking/baking like Culinary Institute of America. And then there are schools that are short term, full immersion courses like I did. In Colorado there's the Aguste Escoffier School of Culinary Art and Cook Street 180. Both of which you learn a LOT in a short period of time, but don't receive an actual degree like you would from a university. 

Many people go to college for 4 years and then pursue their path in pastry. In these hard times, I would say skip the degree, and get as much experience in now. Find out if this is something you REALLY could see yourself doing everyday, and if it is, learn as much as you can now. Travel to Europe and find a culinary exchange program. Go into a local bakery and ask if you can just watch them for a day. Worst case they say no, and move on to the next bakery. Don't be afraid to work for free. Experience is what you want when your young and you will be able to take off when your my age. 

Hope this helps, and I wish you luck!

"skyrim","t5_2s837","For whatever reason, magic attacks don't scale from a damage perspective. As you get to higher and higher levels, and start fighting really strong enemies, you're basically stuck with dealing the base damage that spells start off at.

Other combat skill trees have perks that jack up your damage (one handed, two handed, etc.) and you can constantly improve your weapons, further increasing your ability to deal damage. Mages can't do that, there is no in game mechanic to increase magical base damage.

Initially the top end destruction spells do away with enemies fairly easily, but as you level up so do your enemies. Normally your melee weapons are being improved as you level up. The blacksmith increases the weapon's stats and your perks multiply your base damage. There is no equivalent for mage's, so when the average health of your enemies goes from 100 up to 200+, your only option is to cast a higher *quantity* of spells rather than improving the *quality* of damage those spells do.

Unfortunately casting lots of advanced spells takes an immense amount of magicka. The only really effective way of increasing your magicka pool to a level that allows you to kill, say a high level dragon, is to enchant gear with the decrease magicka cost enchantment and the increase magicka regen enchantment. Eventually you get to the point where all you do is dual cast fire/lightingbolts/spell of choice while backing away from your enemies.

It is still an easy enough build, but the actual gameplay gets silly after a while. It really feels like your spamming, as opposed to feeling like your gaining skill as you smith better armor and get better at combat skills.

Just my opinion, I have a high elf mage character. He's fun to use, but I get sick of it after a bit. At then end of the day though, I get sick of my stealth character too.

My two cents, just play whichever combat type you think is fun, and focus more on picking a role within the game. Go be a rebel and focus on that, instead of focusing on maximizing your stats. Its way more rewarding to just play the game, rather than worry about how you can get an extra few DPS.

Your entire argument hinges on this key point, one which has come up before and yet somehow his stupid, uneducated, imbecilic base somehow understood entirely (they pulled the exact same shit when trying to pass the budget, and Obama was willing to risk shutdown in a face-off against clear political horseshit).

Without doing any googling, what I remember about the mini-shuttle is that is was a testbed for the SR-71 follow-on, sometimes known as the 'Aurora', and not intended as a production craft. I've been out of the loop for sometime so I have no real idea about what is going on with such programs.

Any time there is a period of relative peace and military budgets get cut, the first thing they do is trim back recon programs. When there is massive military spending during war time, the recon budgets tend to focus on tactical rather than strategic assets. An example of this is the SR-71 getting mothballed except for two testbed aircraft retained by NASA. It was less than a year before the military requested the aircraft back (which NASA refused), so they ended up spending a massive amount of money refurbishing planes, some of which were being prepared for static displays. That stuff is fact, my speculation is that this was about the time the Aurora project got kicked into high gear. Satellites are great for strategic recon, but you cannot replace actually having an asset you can rapidly deploy for specific tactical missions.","1325376426"

"Urbandead","t5_2qmal","As someone who toured with the Mall Tour and has played a zombie since 2007... no.  Just no.  You claim that we ‚Äútook over nearly the entire map.‚Äù  This isn't true in the slightest.  We went from mall to mall, taking each one and a few surrounding safehouses, then going to the next without any stops in between.  If you wanted a safe place to sleep, you could go, oh, I don't know, *anywhere else on the map!*  Seriously, if you just went 5-10 blocks away, we wouldn't have touched you.  There's also that huge portion of the map that's green.  When the Mall Tour was going, the only red suburbs were the Bonk,Dunell Hills, and Havercroft--the homes of the two largest hordes...and you guys.  Also, considering that you've been around since 2005, I'd expect you to know what the game is like when zombies really dominate.

If you want an example of a good defense, look at Bale Mall.  We were seriously considering ending the Mall Tour there because it was so difficult--just look at [this](http://barhah.com/viewtopic.php?f=213&amp;t=17801&amp;sid=94e1fa79cc4a2edb113e90c039b69585) thread on Barhah.com.  We would breach the barricades and get a few kills, but for a full week, the survivors would beat us back out and cade up again.  You also talk about zombie victories as if they're a new thing.  They're not.  Hell, the only major survivor victories I can think of are Giddings and Caiger I and II.  They shouldn't be particularly surprising in a freakin' zombie apocalypse.

You say that zombies are OP, but the only reason zombies have any success is coordination.  I've never seen a survivor strike team that focuses on clearing out buildings and securing them, but the major hordes each have at least one strike team.  You're also forgetting the single biggest part of the AP balance.  Barricades are a 5:1 AP advantage for survivors.  This makes it a lot easier to play as a lone survivor‚Äîyou can easily get a building up to EHB or find someone else's safehouse within 50 AP.  It's a lot harder for a lone feral zombie to open up a building or find one that's already open, and it's practically impossible to open up an EHB building alone, especially for a low-level.

Urban Dead has historically had a survivor advantage, aside from when the megahordes (Shacknews, LUE, and the Dead) show up.  This is because the majority of new players join with the exact mentality that you have--they want go kill some zombies.  You can see this on [the stats page](http://www.urbandead.com/stats.html)--the greatest proportion of level 1 players are military, and 65% of standing players are survivors.

Your attitude is like so many others who come to Urban Dead bringing the mentality of other zombie games and movies, where they can be one of the last heroic survivors beating back the endless hordes.   You come thinking that the best way to counter the zombies is to kill them, because that's what you've learned from Resident Evil and House of the Dead.  **That is not Urban Dead.**  Urban Dead is a game where the goal for survivors is to actually *try to survive*.  This isn't a game so simple as going around killing; it's about teamwork, communication, and strategy.  That the zombies are players too is what really makes Urban Dead unique-- playing a zombie is just as much a part of the game as playing a survivor.

If you want to revive Urban Dead, you need something beyond balance changes.  You need people who want to actually play Urban Dead.  Short of attracting new players, the best solution is to make alts and play a different facet of the game.  Try playing a zombie, a PKer, a combat reviver, or a dual nature character.  Playing on ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù will really help you see how the game works.  It's not all about giving the heroic sirvivor what he wants; you'll see that it's not all peachy for everyone else either, but it's still fun for everyone.  It's the same game for any character you play, but with different goals and incentives, and no matter what, it's fun.  If you don't find it fun, then perhaps Urban Dead isn't the game for you.","1325376428"

Assigning a monetary value isn't necessary. Shunning a registrar based on their political positions is valid and a part of economics.  Another example would be buying a product due to unaccounted negative externalities of other products, like buying organic produce because you believe it's bad to create dead zones due to fertilizer runoff from industrial agriculture.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","Although not on the 360, I do play on the PS3, and I sometimes forget the struggles that regularly occur for PC players. Between prevalent hackers, and therefore frequent accusations of hacking even when one is simply playing well, it's nice to simply *never* need to worry about that. It doesn't even cross my mind when playing.

I recall playing TFC and TF2, amongst other things, on the PC, and getting incredibly good at the sniper. Friends would actually call me a ""sentry with a scope"". That being said, there was exactly one server I could play on, since everyone there, including the admins, had known me for a long time. They had taken the time to spec me when I was sniping and saw I was, in fact, not hacking at all, but rather just an experienced sniper. I was able to play there without concern.

However, if I ever switched to a different server - perhaps my ""regular"" one was full, or empty, or simply down, often I would find myself getting kicked or even banned. It was incredibly frustrating. Sure, I'd roll other classes, but when the other team, depending on the map, is rolling with half a dozen snipers, sometimes you just gotta scratch that itch.

In combination with the lack of driver issues, framerate concerns, overcrowed maps (seeing a 64 player server on Metro is...just a complete clusterfuck), cheaters and hackers, quick-to-judge admins, concerns about upgrading, DRM and Origin, I find my enjoyment on the PS3 platform significantly elevated.","1325376446"

FLASHBACK:

6	INT	NEW UNI HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY - CARMEN IBANEZ

is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself  because
Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.

		RASCZAK (O.S.)
	The end of another school year, and for
	me no doubt another failure...
	Rico, pay attention !

The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly
displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.

		JOHNNY
	Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.

But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.

		RASCZAK
	Here in History and Moral Philosophy
	we've explored the decline of
	Democracy when social scientists brought
	the world to the brink of chaos, and how the
	veterans took control and imposed a stability
	that has lasted for generations since...
	You know these facts but have I taught you
	anything of value ? You.
	Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?

Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump
.
		LANNY
	It's a reward... what the Federation gives you
	for doing Federal Service.

Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.

		RASCZAK
	No. Something given has no value !
	Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ?
	I guess they ought to revoke my
	teaching credential...

Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:
Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.

		RASCZAK
	When you vote, you're exercising political
	authority. You're using force. And force, my
	friends, is violence, the supreme authority
	from which all other authority derives.

CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.

		CARL
	Gee, we always thought you were the
	supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.

Laughter. Rasczak grins.

		RASCZAK
	In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's
	exerted by ten or ten billion, political
	authority is violence by degree. The
	people we call citizens have earned
	the right to wield it.

DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.

		DIZZY
	My mother always says that violence
	never solves anything.

		RASCZAK
	Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of
	Hiroshima would have to say about that.
	You.

Rasczak points at Carmen.

		CARMEN
	They probably wouldn't say anything.
	Hiroshima was destroyed.

Johnny presses ¬¥""SEND"" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
across the way on Carmen's screen.

		RASCZAK
	Correct. Naked force has settled more
	issues in history than any other factor.
	The contrary opinion 'violence never
	solves anything' is wishful thinking
	at its worst.

While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.

		RASCZAK
	People who forget that always pay...
	They pay with their lives and their
	freedom.

Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
snaps Johnny to.

		RASCZAK
	You. Tell me the moral difference,
	if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?

		JOHNNY
	The difference lies in the field of civic
	virtue. A citizen accepts personal
	responsibility for the safety of the body politic,
	of which he is a member, defending it,
	if need be, with his life.
	The civilian does not.

		RASCZAK
	The exact words of the text. But do
	you understand it ?
	Do you believe it ?

		JOHNNY
	Uh, I don't know.

		RASCZAK
	Of course you don't. I doubt if any
	of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
	if it bit you in the ass.

A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.

		RASCZAK
	Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

Nobody said politics was easy. He's supposed to be a good speaker, he's supposed to have a good team advising him. Squeezing out from difficult situations is something every politician has to learn to do. Like I said, he didn't have to do it alone. Why not organize his political base, so people who actually liked and voted for him knew what was going on,  straight from the source? Do it over and over until the message sinks in.

Having lived here 12 years I have never once heard an alumnus nor current student ever refer to VT in either of those terms more than once, because people often point and laugh at them. So, what's with the downvotes? I'm honestly curious. Are there really people out there who call this school ""VahTech"" and go here? Do you think that people in Georgia call it ""GahTech""? Feck no: it's Tech there as well. I stand by my statement: VT, Tech, and if you aren't actually standing in the state when discussing the school Virginia Tech is acceptable. The rest of it is bullshit made up by ESPN. It sounds dumb when they say it; it sounds dumb when you say it.

To me, the real advantage of Wing Chun is getting your hands on the other person and controlling the chaos. No flying fists for windmill punches, just technique and control. I would say that anyone with 2-3 years of Wing Chun training is going to have a sizable advantage in a random street fight over any non-trained individuals.

Compared to other fighting arts, like systema and Krav Maga (however it's spelled), I imagine it's pretty much up to the practitioner. Someone way skilled in a discipline will be better than someone less skilled in a different one. I think it breaks down to what works for you.

Why are you afraid to take classes without seeing it used first? You can always quit if you don't like it. In the meantime, you'll meet cool people, have a good time, and get some good workouts in. Give it a shot. Especially if you're in the Seattle area.","1325376482"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Can't believe I missed the discussion of my favorite carry.

The most common mistake I see is that people tend to use blink while initiating from stealth in the laning phase, which disrupts their attack animation canceling (right phrase?) and decreases  the time the enemy spends inside the cloud. You shouldn't use the cloud directly on people so that they spend longer time inside or forced to move farther away from safety.

Recently I've found myself getting less wraith bands going straight for diffusal after PMS and treads. I also prioritise backstab over blink strike. Before level 6 you often need to use blink strike to start a fight. Before level 7 blink strike has a long cooldown and it's unlikely that you will be able/need to use it more than once, especially since it's easy to get into melee range and start with cloud once invisible. At level 7 max backstab provides about 60-70 extra damage per attack (before buff).

SA's ultimate is pretty cool but end game it does little more than provide new players a false sense of security. Because of this I go BKB after diffusal blade if the enemy team has too many disables.

Please let me know why most people seem to think that Blink strike is preferable early, while both tier 1 towers are up, limiting the mobility.","1325376491"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Faith does have it's positive advantages for a lot of people and societies - as it applies to religions/gods/ultimate rule maker-appraiser.  In my experience processed faith in a deity(ies) is usually expressed in two parts - the religious dogma and the resultant moral and ethical code attached to that dogma.  Most of the religions that I have some knowledge of profess similar morals of the 'be good to each other' kind (though often these morals are only applied to a limited sub-set of humanity).  This moral code uses a carrot and stick approach for enforcement - the ""holy"" ultimate rule maker-appraiser will reward/punish you for your acts in life and beyond.  The promise/threat approach to the work involved in being moral invokes a chemical response in the brain (dopamine release) which helps sustain the work/effort for a future payoff (or avoid a punishment).  Faith, then, can be seen as a motivator for moral and ethical behavior - similar to a personal trainer for physical training; you could do it yourself on your own, but a physical trainer (with a paycheck that depends on a schedule and discipline) is likely to be more effective.  You can be a moral and ethical person without Faith (or religious dogma), but the ""learning"" of Faith/dogma forced upon most at an early age requires more work to evaluate and, where applicable, overcome.  

""Faith"" then can have a positive effect on the person, their family, friends and society - an effect that is worthy of respect.  Unfortunately, since most religions are designed to be self-propagating and strive to grow (e.g., gain more power, wealth, numbers - whatever counts as their 'currency'), the need to subvert others to their ""Faith"" is a prime theme of religion.  It is the strife for the accomplishment of this need to maintain/grow that turns so very many religions into large stinking piles of hypocritical bovine feces and negates the many of the gains which could be realized by it's basic non-expansion-driven moral code.

If a person/group has ""Faith"" without evidence and with the absence of reasonable logical thought, they are not necessarily idiots, just unlearned.  Think of ""Faith"" as cliff notes for life to get around working towards real knowledge.

Where I have issues with people of ""Faith"" is when they attempt to profess their Faith is the only true Faith and use the corruption of the basic moral tenants of their dogma as a self-serving means to propagate their Faith.  Every time I hear a self-serving Faith-jockey, I feel like an attempt at rape (mental) is being made.

I do, and will continue to, respect those that have Faith, that believe and practice a good, consistent and logical moral code applied to all equally with the following caveats:  

1.  Do not shrill nor attempt to convert me to your dogma.  Let it stand to be accepted or wither on it's own merits.
2.  Continue seeking education about, well, everything.  Continue to evolve as a person, with family and with local and global society.
3.  Consider that practicing moral and ethical behavior for it's own sake is worthwhile and view any benefit you believe that you will gain from your ""Faith"" as a bonus that you modestly keep to yourself.

That's because anything that's considered ""spiritual"" generally tends to be expressed in unfalsifiable terms - that is, you have to just ""believe"" or ""have faith"", and there's never any actual evidence presented.

You can't do actual science on something that can't even be tested.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","One of my favorite books ever is Hans Urs von Balthasar's [*Love Alone Is Credible*](http://www.amazon.com/Love-Alone-Credible-Hans-Balthasar/dp/0898708818/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325374513&amp;sr=8-1).  The chapter entitled ""The Third Way of Love"" is a wonderful overview of a lot of the things I've been describing in this thread.  Balthasar is one of the major theological figures of the 20th century.  

**Apophaticism**

* The great grandaddy of the apophatic dimension of Christian theology is unquestionably Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite.  You can find his entire collected works in the [*Classics of Western Spirituality* series](http://www.amazon.com/Pseudo-Dionysius-Complete-Classics-Spirituality/dp/0809128381/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325375041&amp;sr=1-1).  He's a complicated thinker and mystic, but his *Mystical Theology* is about 6 pages.  Its the kind of thing that you would read and reread, digesting slowly and prayerfully.
* One of the two most influential and important Christian theologians ever, Thomas Aquinas was heavily influenced by Pseudo-Dionysius.  Aquinas insisted that our language about God was mostly *analogical* and not simply literal.  A good treatment of Aquinas's whole theology is [*Knowing the Love of Christ*](http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Love-Christ-Introduction-Theology/dp/0268033021/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325376015&amp;sr=1-1).  Pages 11-12 contain an excellent overview of Aquinas' mystical-philosophical account of our knowledge of God. 
* The other most important theologian of the Christian tradition, Augustine, wrote a pretty awesome but pretty thick autobiography called [*The Confessions*](http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Revised-Works-Saint-Augustine/dp/1565481542/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325376357&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0).  One way of looking at *The Confessions* is as Augustine's wrestling with his history of being intimately known by the ultimately unknowable God.  A frequent paraphrase of one of Augustine's quotes about God is, ""If you have understood it, it isn't God.""  
* Perhaps the most accessible introduction to negative theology or apophaticism is in Elizabeth Johnson's book [*Quest for the Living God*](http://www.amazon.com/Quest-Living-God-Frontiers-Theology/dp/0826417701).  There's also an [interview with NPR](http://ncrnews.org/ncrpodcasts/fox_ejohnson.pdf) where she talks about it.   (I hesitated to put this on here because the book has been the target of some controversy recently as the US Catholic Bishops have criticized it.  If you are interested in that debate [this website](http://datinggod.org/2011/06/07/elizabeth-johnson-csjs-response-to-committee/) has a pretty good overview of the whole debate.)

**Faith**

* A lot of the above books address faith, but Avery Dulles has written a pretty handy overview of how faith has been understood by different theologians throughout the tradition: [*The Assurance of Things Hoped For*](http://www.amazon.com/Assurance-Things-Hoped-Theology-Christian/dp/0195109732/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325376409&amp;sr=1-2).  It's not the kind of book I would sit down and read from front to back.  It's more useful as kind of a historical reference work, I think.

Anyways, I hope that's helpful!  Happy New Year's!

Edit: Formatting issues and I added the Elizabeth Johnson book.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I really like where this discussion is going. What I am trying to get at is that I do not think the Spielberg sat around watching these old movies in order to steal camera angles and shot setups from them. 

Remember that there are only really a handful of camera angles and ways to frame a shot in popular film. All of the shots used in this sequence are pretty conventional. The more you study film, the more you will find that there is really nothing new. In other words, I think that if you told ten different filmmaker that they must shoot an intro to a movie that starts with a trek through the jungle while the credits roll, in the style of the old adventure serials, you will get ten similar results.

To put it yet another way, I think that, given enough time, you can take *any* short sequence from *any* film, and make a mash-up just like this using 30 different films that came before it. All it would take is a lot of time and patience. This does not say anything about the creativity (or lack thereof) of the filmmaker. This is a result of a set of standard aesthetic practices that have been refined over the last 100 years of film making, and a result of the sheer number of films that have been made.

Edit: One more thing I would like to mention: Notice the aspect ratio change on the left footage. Raiders of the Lost Ark was originally presented in 2.20:1, not what looks like something closer to ~1.33:1 (which was more common in early movies). Meaning, even the footage from Raiders has been altered to more closely resemble the footage on the right.","1325376531"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I've read Paul's actual plan for what he would do as president here: http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul647.html

Basically, due to the constraints he's under and the fact that removing the welfare state in one go would cause incomprehensible suffering, he starts by smashing the military industrial complex, bringing the troops home, and ending corporate welfare.

These savings go towards paying down the debt and shoring up social security and medicare.

He does plan on taking out some programs I like early on, but according to this plan at least, he really starts out with the kind of shock to the system I'd love to see. After a few years of libertarian economics, I think voters would trip over themselves running towards the left. The MiC gone, much of the bureaucracy shattered, corporate welfare a thing of the past, social democrats can rebuild a smarter system of public goods (free healthcare, free education, scandinavian model ftw)

On the other hand, in order to win the election I fear he'd have to rearrange these priorities: the only way to beat the obama machine might have to involve raising money from the right's typical sponsors, and with existing allies in congress and such they'd START by dismantling the welfare state and give up on ending handouts to major corporations or ending the empire.","1325376568"

I will not sign any document that could be used in such a way, and I ask you, as citizens, to call your congressmen and ask them why they think your rights should be stripped away.""

Obama requested some of the most inflammatory sections of the bill and THAT is why he signed the bill. The man has fulfilled few if any election promises. Sure, choose to believe him now. Put up with what you believe to be the lesser of two evils. Try to believe that he actually won't attempt to use this bill to arrest and detain indefinitely US citizens.

Recorded straight to audacity and exported as a wav file. Nothing else was done to it. It's an original song I wrote with my band. Probably our more varied tune in terms of tempo and volume and changes, so I thought it'd be a good song to try. I made a few mistakes, but we can probably ignore those.

I don't think it's inherently racist to liken a black person to a monkey, as long as the reason for doing so is not the person's race.  Because of a history of prejudice towards blacks, this can be a tricky subject.  But I do think the only way to put racism behind us is to stop dwelling on it.","1325376604"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Here's a story:

In Algebra 1 I had serious issues with a teacher who failed me because I didn't show work.  Every homework would get zero credit because I didn't show work.  The teacher's reason?  I could have stolen the answers from somebody.  ""Fair enough,"" I said.  Instead of doing my homework at home, I did the homework in class instead of listening to his lectures.  I turned in my homework by the end of class BEFORE anybody else and before most had even started.  For a while the teacher seemed alright with this, on homework at least.  Tests came and I ended up with zeros again.  ""Why?"" I would ask.  I would check my answers with those my classmates got, and I had gotten the answers right.  So what was the problem?  The teacher never gave me a real answer.  We even had a parent teacher conference over it.  The teacher told my dad, he's a very gifted kid in math.  He even thought up a problem on the spot for me to solve and I solved it completely in my head.  To them this was amazing, but I'm sure you guys agree, Algebra 1 is trivial.  My argument was basically, why should I show work for such basic math?  Should I write out every 2+2 as well?  How much is too much?  Also, if I get the answers right, what's the problem?  Well, the teacher never gave me an answer besides ""Do it because I say so"", so I never did it.  
So I failed Algebra 1 while passing the state algebra test and getting 99th percentile in those stupid state tests.

Now I'm in college taking Calculus 3, and still not showing work for algebra problems.  Sure I'll show some work if the problem gets crazy, but you'll never see me showing work for a simple solve for x or crap.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;how can the person giving you the test, give you fair grading? 

This is kind of a bad anology. God is not test us, but allowing us to use our free will as we want. The bible says the majority will miss use it, only a minority will actually look for God and find out his will and do it. 

Now with that said the Paul eluded in the bible that when we are not under God's laws directly (because we may not know it) we still have an internal law that guides us to some extent. Now in the case of a sociopath if they are driving down the road and decide to swerve and hit someone on the side of the road and drive off. Can you say for sure they dont know better? I cannot, because in their childhood or up brining they had to at least be rewarded once for doing good, and punished for doing bad. They should have some semblance of the concept and understanding of what they are doing.

But Even if they do not God would recognize they have a major brain defect, he could very well give them a chance and be resurrected.  John 5:28,29 and Acts 24:15 says the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected. God decides whom of the unrighteous needs another chance. At that time they will be resurrected and taught the right ways to live. If at that point they choose to be bad and do bad , well that will be the end of the road.

&gt;So lets take your view on the after life here, hopefully i got it right. You say the sinners die/loose their concient, as opposed to thoes who are blessed with eternal life. 

The bible is clear from the start. God original purpose was for man to  live on the earth forever. Ps 37:9-11, 29 says the wicked will be removed and the righteous will be preserved and will reside FOREVER upon the earth. Rev 21:3,4 says death will be done away with, Isiah 25:8 confirms death will be swallowed up.

&gt;This means you still have a good and bad ending to your life here on earth

No that is incorrect EVERLASTING life is God's gift. Death is the opposite of life.

&gt;so how would god justify his judgment on someone who do not comprehend the core of his teachings?

Please have a read of rev 20:1-7. This talks about things After armageddon, with Satan and his demons removed so they cannot influence people to do bad. People are resurrected, brought back to perfection in mind and body, there will be no more sin in us. We will have perfect thought and fully be taught to think and understand God's will in everything we do.

"food","t5_2qh55","Has to do with why chicken can't be eating raw in the first place.  In Japan some yakitori joints will serve chicken sashimi because almost all of their domestic Jidori breeds are naturally raised, completely free range raised without antibiotics.  In the United States we have giant chicken factory farms which cramp tons of chickens in tiny spaces and are prone to diseases.  Many chickens don't get slaughtered healthy and it's such a risk to attempt eating medium rare in this country.

Now the reason ducks and geese can be eaten med-rare is because they are almost exclusively raised outdoors because they are very easy to raise I've been told by a rancher that ducks come of slaughter age faster and they require so little maintenance since they eat anything in the wild and are prone to cold weather like chickens.  Same probably goes for geese as well so they are naturally resistant to natural bacteria in North America while I believe chickens are not native to North America but the chicken problem has more to do with the raising methods of American food corporations like Tyson as Japan tends to be cold as well during Winter.  

I'm not saying you are 100% guaranteed to be safe eating medium rare duck and vice versa about the risk of getting sick from eating raw chicken but the fact that nobody ever questions eating a medium rare game meat like elk, venison, wild boar, and semi-game meats like lamb and buffalo it goes to show that naturally raised animals are the way to go.

I hope that answers your question. I know I may seem like a organic-Nazi but far from it, I love food and quality is the most important thing to me and from personal experience factory farm meats are rarely satisfactory for me.","1325376615"

However, randoming can be very bad for your team as a whole because it can result in sub-par team compositions. My advice to you is to just wait until your team picks a few heroes and choose one you think will be helpful. You'll still learn plenty of different heroes because every game is different, but you'll also practice strategy in picking good counters to other teams comps and finding good synergy within your own team.

You don't need to pidgeon-hole yourself to one hero until you learn it, but actively picking heroes you think will help your team I think is more beneficial than randoming, just try to stay away from the same hero every game so you can continue learning the basics of them all.","1325376625"

Buy bread to last you three days. After three days buy another bread to last you three more days (or buy it now and put it in the freezer). Buy cheap stuff to put on the bread. This could be meat, cheese, peanut butter etc. Have breakfast and lunch with this. Total estimated costs $6 for the breads, $10 for all toppings = $16.

You now have about $20 left to make 6 dinners. Not a lot, but potatoes, rice and spaghetti should get you somewhere. Shop for cheap veggies as well: filling and good for you.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Sounds like you're a mechanically a sound player, you can CS and teamfight. 

The reason why someone can have those stats yet still be losing more than half of his/her games is because of missed opportunities. Most players don't recognize when the game is tipped in their favor  (IE someone on the enemy team got caught and died) and fail to make moves on towers and neutral monsters when the enemy team either cannot respond or would be at significant disadvantage in doing so. Bad players, when in the 5-4 advantage, will opt to continue farming, wander aimlessly looking for farm, or B + shop at substantial health.

Here's some example logic in which a team has 5-4 advantage and should opt to take dragon/baron or push towers, in that order. *DISCLAIMER:* This is very general. The information to take into account is more detailed than what is listed here; but, this should give you a framework that will very often net positive results assuming your team responds to pings at dragon or baron. The exceptions to this line of logic occur most often when your team has been feeding and enemies cannot be dealt with even 5v4.

------------
* **-IF-** The number of people dead on their team &gt; number of people dead on your team **-THEN-** group &amp; move immediately to a dagron. 

* **-IF-** enemy doesn't respond by also immediately moving to a dagron **-THEN-** begin fighting dagron.

* **-IF-** enemy moves in during your dagron killings -AND- team is still in good health **-THEN-** engage enemy for an easy teamfight win and extended time in the advantage. **-OTHERWISE-** back out and let them try to take it.","1325376651"

- Light diffuses and loses much clarity, making a reconstruction after a certain distance impossible.
- Light loses intensity at a 1/r^2 rate, and that intensity loss would be doubled, so the intensity we perceive would be 1/(4r^2).
- There are no known celestial bodies that are not diffuse reflectors.  basically, large ""mirror"" surfaces are not found anywhere in the universe as we know it.  And if they were, they'd have to be aligned precisely to reflect directly back at us, which is more or less completely improbable.

~~Also, consider a small mirror far away from you.  When you look at yourself, you would only see a small part of yourself -- a part that is smaller than the size of the mirror itself from that distance.~~

~~If there were any large mirror surfaces, they'd be the size of stars in the sky at most, and we'd only be able to see (less than) little points on the earth from each one -- if they were perfectly mirroring, in the perfect direction, and had light focused perfectly from Earth.~~","1325376653"

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Attraction is pretty simple and pretty binary: it either is or isn't. There's no such thing as the friend-zone. Friend-zone is some sort of euphemism to make us feel better about girls not being attracted to us. We build up a myth about there being some inflection point at which this girl was evenly balanced between seeing us as romantically viable and nonviable. The truth is that almost everyone who gets friend-zoned had no chance to start.

So if this is true and she's not attracted to you, then why would she hang out with you, talk to you about her boy, her life, or her issues? My guess is that she's doing those things because she's human, and humans like to talk to each other about things going on in their lives.

Really.

""But why don't other girls do this with me?""

Because they've learned to be guarded with guys lest their friendliness be mistaken for attraction. Or maybe this girl is just really open. Or maybe she actually just genuinely likes you as a human being!

You're not her emotional boyfriend; *she's* your emotional girlfriend. You cutting her off might hurt her, but she'll survive and she'll date and otherwise get over it. For you, it will definitely hurt because you have the most to lose. That's why she's your emotional girlfriend.

You're stuck in an awkward point in your dating timeline. It's going to suck getting through this, but you need to focus on things you can control. The only thing you can control here is you. Focus on yourself and getting as healthy as possible. Invest everything you have into yourself. Go to the gym, read self-help books, meet new people, find a therapist, pick up that hobby you've been putting off, go travel, have fun with your friends, learn how to be at ease with yourself, but stretch yourself as much as you can. You'll learn more about yourself, you'll learn how much you're capable of, and you'll learn what you like and what you're good at and what sort of people you don't like. It's the knowledge of these things that gives us confidence to take bold steps in our relationships, and that confidence in turn radiates attractiveness to others.

Focus on yourself. Invest everything you have into yourself. Good luck.","1325376655"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I think you nailed it when you wrote, ""far too often the wrong questions are asked."" As I think back to how I wrote exams, I very specifically chose problems that required the techniques I was teaching in order to get the correct answers. Ideally, the specifics of the problem would suggest the correct technique to use without it being stated explicitly. From a slightly different perspective, a teacher teaches techniques for solving the problems that are on the exams. If a student doesn't learn them, or believes that they have a better/easier technique, then they risk not getting the correct answers.

I would really only specifically state the method to use when I taught two methods that could both be used to solve the problem. And in those cases, there was usually another question that asked to solve the same problem or a similar problem using the other method.

Somewhat related, I remember giving my students a choice between exams with ""show your work"" problems and multiple choice questions. At first, they were very excited about multiple choice. But when I explained that the ""distractors"" would be answers arrived at when making common mistakes and that there was no partial credit, ""show your work"" exams became a bit more appealing.","1325376665"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm still working through this monolithic statement, but it seemed prudent to take a break to mention that had the White House ""We the People"" petitions received this kind of serious attention to detail in their responses then this administration would be on strong footing right now. That being said, this statement is something to appreciate, and I'd like to take a moment to thank the Obama administration for preparing it with the kind of statesman's professionalism, attention to detail, and reverence to the People that we have come to miss in recent times.

Of particular interest to me is the administration's (public) interpretation where the detention of American Citizens is concerned. This is an occasion to be brief and direct. I have one concern not addressed thus far: That there remains no due process codified such that thus far in any case where existing law is violated by the practice of detention authorities vested in the executive branch and military, legal recourse remains impossible to affect. As it stands, we are assured that these powers will not be used against American Citizens, but so long as no countermeasure to such abuses are defined, our liberties hang by the precarious thread of no more guarantee than a politician's word.

I fear that unless a reaffirmation of our nation's core principles is enacted to officially safeguard our liberties by outlining due process as described above, then it is only a matter of time until inconvenient political speech is labelled a form of terrorism.  When that happens, it will mark the start of our nation's total collapse, as what one politician deems inconvenient another will deem necessary to the effect of a total breakdown in our form of government.  Our liberties are more than just that; they are the keystone that supports the structural integrity of our way of life, including our entire economy and government.

The good news is that, for now, the public interpretation of the 2011 NDAA safeguards our rights, so we need only ensure one thing to protect ourselves against any secret interpretations: that our friends and loved ones are aware of pending threats to our liberties so that when the day comes that the next steps are taken to detain political opponents, those close to us may act in our interest should we inexplicably disappear at any time politically convenient to any politician of questionable moral character where our nation's founding values are concerned.

Such parts were developed several years, if not decades, ago and as such have a proven long life and are function stably in stressful conditions.

I'll quote part of it here:

&gt;**Section 1031** attempts to expressly codify the detention authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the ‚ÄúAUMF‚Äù).  The authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention authority, are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals.  **Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary** and poses some risk.  After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of 2 legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country.  While the current language minimizes many of those risks, future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people.

So the White House thought they already had these powers and just didn't want them to actually be defined by law...","1325376702"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Because of the powers of execution granted to the President, the Obama Administration is in charge of how they wish to execute the bill. This signing statement is the order of execution he sends down to the related agencies, administrations, and the armed forces. In saying this, he is bypassing the congress:

&gt; I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law.

If had Vetoed the law, then the Congress would have overridden his veto (there was near unanimous support for it), and removed the President's chance to issue a signing statement.

However, signing statements are fragile and very open to change. The next president's administration will not be bound by this statement. An important thing to think about at the poll in November.","1325376703"

I like how he refers to ""an electric LSD trip."" My feeling is that a lot of times, with great guitar players, the vastness of what they're doing is not easy to realize. You hear the flurry of notes but you don't always quite ""get it"" at first. Sometimes you can only experience the oneness of tone, rhythmic pattern, melody choice, deepest emotions, and grandeur when you're in some way altered from the normal consciousness. (This may occur by listening to the music while running, dancing, smoking weed, etc. -- or simply by having it come at you at the Right Moment, where a serendipitous chemical reaction occurs between the music and your mood so that you hear it in a grander way.)

The levels are shorter, the battles are simpler, the loot is not balanced so it's easy to become ridiculously powerful. The graphics are cartoony and friendly instead of dread-inspiring. The monster variety... might be similar actually. But there are fewer unique areas. The skill trees and synergies are not as deep. Not saying it's a bad game, especially for the price, but D2 is a 12 year old game that is still going, that's incredible legs for any game, and it's due to the immense depth and variety afforded by the skills and items.

Torchlight is a flash in the pan by comparison, and that's not a diss to those who enjoy it. Fun is where you find it.","1325376709"

"femmit","t5_2t857","I personally think that singling out and praising general audience movies who get it right (like Zombieland) would do more good than lambasting chick flicks.  Male Hollywood already knows that chick flicks are soul-sucking monstrosities that should be taken out back and shot.

Luckily, the younger generation seems to be tired of chick flicks (at least conventional ones like Sex in the City; the Twilight craze is still new and I'm still not sure how to interpret it, The Hairpin brought up some valid points that I think are worth pondering http://thehairpin.com/2011/11/our-bella-ourselves).  

Also worrying is that women who are the main focus of the movies, the heroine who saves the world (sadly, it's usually a fantasy or Sci-Fi flick) rarely has friends and helpers who are other females; and when they do, it's a dreamy inaccesible figure who isn't so much a woman as a plot device (I'm looking at *you*, White Queen in the latest Alice in Wonderland remake).

I'm wondering just how much female interaction will be in The Hunger Games?  I know that Katniss volunteers to replace her younger sister because it's virtually a death sentence, but then she hooks up with a boy.  Does she ever befriend the other girls caught in the game?  Will they spend time elaborating on the sisters' relationship?

I think that we **are** slowly rebounding from an era when women were mere eye candy or exotic villains, but it's going to take time for Hollywood, that most vapid of cities, to catch up to what's happening in the rest of the world insofar as nuanced and diverse female characters go.","1325376710"

The thing the federal government happened to be wanting to control was slavery.  If the federal government had wanted to control the sale, ownership, and taxation of horses, would the war have been about horses? 

Saying that the Civil War was about slavery would be as incorrect as saying that the Revolutionary War was about tea tax or saying that the protests in Egypt was over the internet.  It was an important factor, but it was not the reason.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm not sure of the exact timeline, but I know I was already showing signs of development around 8. I had my period two months before I turned 11, and I was at least a B- or C-cup by the beginning of sixth grade. I also had a nearly perfect hourglass figure by 12: 38-32-40. I had strong muscular legs, and I literally had the perfect body for a girl five years older than me. 

So, when I was in fifth grade, my older cousin Rich was graduating from high school in my district. He was a popular football player from an unusually successful iteration of our school's football team. He had a lot of friends.

As my mom and I walked toward the building for his graduation, there were graduating seniors all over the place chatting with relatives and friends. I was 11 years old, and I was wearing a pink baby t-shirt with a heart in rhinestones and a modest navy blue skort with pink flowers. It was a few inches above my knee. My hair was short and layered. I was wearing minimal makeup. While the particular fabrics and items I was wearing were dressed up, the cut of them was not unusual for me at all. If anything, I typically wore shorter shorts.

A boy from Rich's class came over and started talking to us. He seemed really interested in me, but most of the high schoolers at my district liked me more than my classmates because I could relate to them better. I was a very articulate kid, gregarious in spite of deep shyness, and a lot of the older girls kind of took me under their wing when we were on sports buses (my mom was a bus driver) or games. An older boy talking to me was noteworthy, but I didn't really heed it. It was just nice to have someone talk to me in an interested way, regardless of sex. 

I don't remember how it happened exactly because at the time, I didn't heed it. I think it was Rich who ran out, his cap tilted on his head, and whispered something to his friend. They said they had to go line up and skittered off. Or maybe it was my mom who distracted me by pointing out someone else and said it. I'm not sure.

But later she told me they had to tell Rich's friend I was only 11.

They also have, at least in the US, a completely different set of requirements and training they go through than the other psych PhDs. They have to take tests and such. Whereas other psych programs are much more focused on research, so there will be more emphasis on that in the acceptance procedures. Different areas will focus on different things. I can't imaging a perceptual psych (what I am) having a quantitative GRE as low as the numbers on that website! Those average GPAs are also way over anything I would expect from fellow students in my area. Most people in my area tend to come from physics, engineering, computer science...so it's somewhat expected they would have lower GPAs than if they majored in english or psych as undergrads.

UBC has a great program! I remember looking at it seriously, but they required a psych subject test, which I was not about to study for just for an application (I was neuroscience and electrical engineering as an undergrad, and had no interest in general psych), and I wasn't sure about leaving the US. If you're applying there, all the best luck to you!","1325376742"

Then you get in to space and aliens and other dimensions and shit with the silver surfer, thor, dr strange and those high level guys that deal with universe ending villians like galactus and entire alien races and shit. The home town hero guys seemed to be a bit easier to follow since they were the main focus, the outer space guys seemed to have a lot more crossover appearances so you had bigger story arcs, but you needed to keep up with more comics.

One of our house guests got up shortly after and accepted my bed offer. We were going at it when she had a rape flashback. Stopped immediately, of course. We cuddled a bit while she told me the backstory. Walked her to her room after a while.

Unrelated epilogue; I learned later my GF had accepted a marriage proposal from some other guy and was hoping I'd hook up with yet a different houseguest. I was OK with all that, but I wasn't OK with her wanting to continue having sex with me after she was engaged.","1325376769"

Can people **please** stop saying things like ""Game X is just a Skinner box!"", as if it presents any meaningful information? A Skinner box is a piece of equipment which allows us to control the variables and contingencies that act upon organism in the world. In other words, a Skinner box is a representation of the real world. 

There's nothing special about the contingencies used in the Skinner box, they are simply recreations of what happens in the real world when we learn. To say that ""Game X is a Skinner box"" is to say ""The gamer learns how to play the game"". To put it more simply: everything is a Skinner box in this sense, as every single thing we do in life requires some form of learning. 

The biggest problem is when people try to extend the idea of ""Game X is a Skinner box"" to trying to say something about why it's addictive or how the developers are ""tricking"" you into playing without ""real"" enjoyment. This makes no sense. There is nothing specific about a Skinner box which sets up ""addictive"" contingencies - this is a common conflation of the lab equipment with the variable-reinforcement schedule. And again, practically everything in the real world operates through a variable-reinforcement schedule as life isn't known for being strictly ordered.

**tl;dr:** Yes, games are like Skinner boxes. So are human interactions, raising a child, learning a language, driving a car, solving a complex algebraic equation, building a rocket, etc. It is trivially true, so stop fucking saying it.

For the GOP, I honestly like Gingrich the most. Not that I agree with Gingrich's views, and I wouldn't vote for him in the general election, but I respect him and like his personality. He's clearly the smartest guy in the room and actually tries to grapple with ideas, even if those ideas may be wrong. He has flair and is a great speaker. One of his favorite books is Isaac Asimov's *The Foundation Trilogy* and he warns about the dangers of EMP weapons. I mean, come on. He's crazy and fun.

Edit: I should say Jon Huntsman is arguably the best candidate, and from a strictly utilitarian view, I'd support him over the other Republicans. But given that he's going nowhere, I'm going to pull for Gingrich in the primaries for my own perverted and weird reasons.","1325376786"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The leveling is persistent, but the funds you earn in-game aren't. Most gameplay is done through multiplayer. You *can* play single player, but you'd be missing much of the experience if you did. And so far, I can't think of any gripes about the game. It's brilliantly well-done for an indie multiplayer game. I also forgot to mention that there is a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic when it comes to classes and the special types of zombies. For example, Berserker classes (specialty is melee) don't want to get too close to a Scrake or Flesh Pound (both have high health and attack power), these enemies would probably be best dealt with by a Support Specialist (shotguns) or Commando (automatic weapons), so you can strategize your team's class setup.","1325376797"

The prisoner told me that as he was sweeping, an officer came and told the woman: 'Tell me where your husband is - very bad things can happen.' She said 'Look, my husband takes great pride in the honour of his woman. If he knew I was here, he would have turned himself in.' The officer took out his pistol and held the daughter up by the braids of the hair and put a bullet into her head. The woman didn't know what was happening. Then he put a bullet into the boy's head. The woman was going crazy. He took the youngest boy by the legs and smashed the baby's brain on a wall. You can imagine the woman. The officer told the young prisoner to bring the rubbish trolley and put the three children in it, on top of the garbage, and ordered the woman to sit on the bodies. He took the trolley out and left it.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","When one goes to get officially dx'd there is an interview [if possible] of the parents and siblings etc. What they tell the doctors cannot be faked [unless they want to help dx you]. Then there are the tests and observations over a period of time by the doctors/staff. Combine these and the interview of the person who claims to have it, then you have several barriers to facetious disorders and conditions. 

Then on an anecdotal level, why would I go through hell in every year in school except college? Why and how could I fake clumsiness/sensory sensitivity probs when I was a child [before the disorder was recognized]? I had misunderstandings every hour[that I was around people--I was great with animals and loved nature] of every day despite my attempts at memorizing what to say when people talk to me [and other awkward attempts at being ""good""]? Why would the doctors tell my parents that I was ALmost autistic [after-all Asperger's is a milder form of autism] when I was having those problems at elementary schools? I had ALL of the characteristics a girl with Asperger's at that age would display, not something I could plan or make up like many of the people with facetious disorders do. Kids at **kindergarten** age do not have this facetious/Munchhausen's dz or at least they ***do not plan-out a life-long condition***, they may pretend they have a boo boo but that's it. [My mother did not want this and does not show any Munchhausen's-type symptoms or characteristic personality quirks like strong desire for attention].  

Just like the many other types of deniers, I think YOU have a reason to dislike these ideas associated with the mind. Therefore you deny it all and camp with the anti-psychiatry tribe. You are lucky to have the internet to get more confirmations of your belief as well as Scientology [whose founder had it out for them too]. 

Me, I had no idea about Asperger's while I was forced to be dx'd. I thot I had anxiety disorder and/or depression and OCD [with out the compulsions to wash hands for eg.] . My mother was devastated that they had treated the way they did when I was a kid; my father is an engineer with similar characteristics [and seems nonplussed about it]. Neither of them had a desire nor idea at my age that I had Asperger's or an ASD. I do NOT see Asperger's as an excuse to be rude nor a justification for my past behavior [merely a partial explanation]. I believe like, Temple Grandin, that the ASD should not control a person; 
that one should learn manners, have continual education and reviews of how to get along in the world with people. 
I frequently feel like I should be considered intellectually disabled [in the past I would be called **mentally retarded** in some aspects] because of the grief I have caused and continue to cause unintentionally --most of it is misunderstandings on either side of the equation.  It is not an easy life, especially if you are undiagnosed.","1325376825"

""Substantially supported"" and ""Associated forces"" and ""belligerent act"" seem a little vague to you?  If not, you know less then nothing about how law works.  This is no accident.  Additionally, and importantly, this clause makes no mention of an exemption for US citizens.  

Indeed, Sec 1022 specifically mentions this:

1) UNITED STATES CITIZENS.‚ÄîThe requirement to detain
a person in military custody under this section does not extend
to citizens of the United States.

Notice it says the REQUIREMENT, not the AUTHORITY.  This clearly allows the indefinite military detention of US citizens.  To believe otherwise is simply a denial of reality.","1325376828"

&gt;182- The experts considered it worth noting that the phrase ""porque tu eres negro"" struck both
&gt;of them as slightly unusual. In this instance, a direct racial slur would more likely have
&gt;been something like ""porque eres un negro de mierda"" [because you are a shitty black].

I could see him maybe say ""No me hablas, negro"" (don't talk to me, negro) after Evra is telling him he will kick or punch him. And given the context of Evra telling Suarez he will hit him, ""Dale negro"" (something like ""Do it, negro"") seems like something someone might say. Still not pretty, but when the accusation against Suarez is based off of holes in his statement and a reliance on the accuracy of Evra's testimony, these seem like important things to take into consideration.","1325376833"

I work in the IT industry which means about 16 hours a day I sit on my butt and do nothing for the past 4 years. I was admitted into the hospital about 4 months ago with trouble breathing and chest pains. It turned out to be a blood clot but it still about killed me. At the time i was measured to me 6 foot 3 inches tall and weighting in at 507 pounds. I believe I have gotten up to about 550 pounds since then. I am terrified that I am not going to be able to see my son grow up. I saw the guys Iama yesterday where he lost so much weight and I am trying to let it inspire me.

For the TL;DR crowd, this couple adopted this child, Veronica, and have been with her since birth - the adoptive father even got to cut her umbilical cord. Two years later the biological father filed for paternity and custody, and since he is 1% Cherokee Indian, the Cherokee Nation had picked up the case. After a long legal battle, Veronica was taken from her family in a 30 minute exchange at a local mall just a few hours ago.

Please take the time to sign the petition in the OP, if you are so moved.  We realize that it may not be much, but the family is desperate to do what they can to keep their daughter with them. Thank you for your time.

That is not debated doctrine among Bible-believing Christians. Because of this, humanity needed someone who was perfect to take the wrath they deserved.

Enter Jesus.

Jesus is God. Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life. When He died, He willingly took on the wrath of all who turned to Him for repentance throughout all of time after that. (I'm wording this as a Calvinist. Others may debate how I worded that.)

To wrap up an overly wordy post, Jesus is the only way to forgiveness, and is the only way to meet the requirements for Heaven. If someone who didn't love Jesus was in Heaven, that would be equivalent to a fish living on dry land. It just doesn't work.","1325376854"

"OperationPullRyan","t5_2ta09","**Statement by the President on H.R. 1540:**

Today I have signed into law H.R. 1540, the ‚ÄúNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.‚Äù I have signed the Act chiefly because it authorizes funding for the defense of the United States and its interests abroad, crucial services for service members and their families, and vital national security programs that must be renewed. In hundreds of separate sections totaling over 500 pages, the Act also contains critical Administration initiatives to control the spiraling health care costs of the Department of Defense (DoD), to develop counterterrorism initiatives abroad, to build the security capacity of key partners, to modernize the force, and to boost the efficiency and effectiveness of military operations worldwide.

The fact that I support this bill as a whole does not mean I agree with everything in it. In particular, I have signed this bill despite having serious reservations with certain provisions that regulate the detention, interrogation, and prosecution of suspected terrorists. Over the last several years, my Administration has developed an effective, sustainable framework for the detention, interrogation and trial of suspected terrorists that allows us to maximize both our ability to collect intelligence and to incapacitate dangerous individuals in rapidly developing situations, and the results we have achieved are undeniable. Our success against al-Qa‚Äôida and its affiliates and adherents has derived in significant measure from providing our counterterrorism professionals with the clarity and flexibility they need to adapt to changing circumstances and to utilize whichever authorities best protect the American people, and our accomplishments have respected the values that make our country an example for the world.

Against that record of success, some in Congress continue to insist upon restricting the options available to our counterterrorism professionals and interfering with the very operations that have kept us safe. My Administration has consistently opposed such measures. Ultimately, I decided to sign this bill not only because of the critically important services it provides for our forces and their families and the national security programs it authorizes, but also because the Congress revised provisions that otherwise would have jeopardized the safety, security, and liberty of the American people. Moving forward, my Administration will interpret and implement the provisions described below in a manner that best preserves the flexibility on which our safety depends and upholds the values on which this country was founded.

Section 1021 affirms the executive branch‚Äôs authority to detain persons covered by the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note). This section breaks no new ground and is unnecessary. The authority it describes was included in the 2001 AUMF, as recognized by the Supreme Court and confirmed through lower court decisions since then. Two critical limitations in section 1021 confirm that it solely codifies established authorities. First, under section 1021(d), the bill does not ‚Äúlimit or expand the authority of the President or the scope of the Authorization for Use of Military Force.‚Äù Second, under section 1021(e), the bill may not be construed to affect any ‚Äúexisting law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.‚Äù My Administration strongly supported the inclusion of these limitations in order to make clear beyond doubt that the legislation does nothing more than confirm authorities that the Federal courts have recognized as lawful under the 2001 AUMF. Moreover, I want to clarify that my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law.

Section 1022 seeks to require military custody for a narrow category of non-citizen detainees who are ‚Äúcaptured in the course of hostilities authorized by the Authorization for Use of Military Force.‚Äù This section is ill-conceived and will do nothing to improve the security of the United States. The executive branch already has the authority to detain in military custody those members of al-Qa‚Äôida who are captured in the course of hostilities authorized by the AUMF, and as Commander in Chief I have directed the military to do so where appropriate. I reject any approach that would mandate military custody where law enforcement provides the best method of incapacitating a terrorist threat. While section 1022 is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty, I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations.

I have concluded that section 1022 provides the minimally acceptable amount of flexibility to protect national security. Specifically, I have signed this bill on the understanding that section 1022 provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it, and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement, including the option of waiving appropriate categories of cases when doing so is in the national security interests of the United States. As my Administration has made clear, the only responsible way to combat the threat al-Qa‚Äôida poses is to remain relentlessly practical, guided by the factual and legal complexities of each case and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each system. Otherwise, investigations could be compromised, our authorities to hold dangerous individuals could be jeopardized, and intelligence could be lost. I will not tolerate that result, and under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention. I will therefore interpret and implement section 1022 in the manner that best preserves the same flexible approach that has served us so well for the past 3 years and that protects the ability of law enforcement professionals to obtain the evidence and cooperation they need to protect the Nation.

I'm kind of surprised that you got rubbed really wrong about my blog post where I followed down that line of thinking, but it was actually me thinking through my own reaction at the time. I hope I didn't come across like I was bitching about my friends as if we were sitting together at a cafe like I can't get over it. The situation was cause for thought for me and I thought it was cause for thought for others allowing an interesting discussion to open up.

I'm unsure about your advice to:
&gt; Instead of telling your friends to completely stop, you could have just as easily used what your friends were doing to give value to the entire restaurant. You could have gotten your friends to actually played a song and you could have started singing and gathering more people.

Perhaps I need to clarify, but the example I use in my article is happening in a sushi restaurant. It irritated me that my friends were acting out in a classy establishment. I'm unsure of your age and don't know if you think it's ok to get loud in any circumstance, but in any case, it had nothing to do with me being validated as a person, in fact, part of being an internally validated person is being able to stick up for your core values.

I make the yogurt using a huge pot with a lizard tank heater in a styrofoam box. It takes an hour to get started.

"OperationPullRyan","t5_2ta09","My Administration will design the implementation procedures authorized by section 1022(c) to provide the maximum measure of flexibility and clarity to our counterterrorism professionals permissible under law. And I will exercise all of my constitutional authorities as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief if those procedures fall short, including but not limited to seeking the revision or repeal of provisions should they prove to be unworkable.

Sections 1023-1025 needlessly interfere with the executive branch‚Äôs processes for reviewing the status of detainees. Going forward, consistent with congressional intent as detailed in the Conference Report, my Administration will interpret section 1024 as granting the Secretary of Defense broad discretion to determine what detainee status determinations in Afghanistan are subject to the requirements of this section.

Sections 1026-1028 continue unwise funding restrictions that curtail options available to the executive branch. Section 1027 renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year 2012 to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose. I continue to oppose this provision, which intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute Guantanamo detainees, based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests. For decades, Republican and Democratic administrations have successfully prosecuted hundreds of terrorists in Federal court. Those prosecutions are a legitimate, effective, and powerful tool in our efforts to protect the Nation. Removing that tool from the executive branch does not serve our national security. Moreover, this intrusion would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles.

Section 1028 modifies but fundamentally maintains unwarranted restrictions on the executive branch‚Äôs authority to transfer detainees to a foreign country. This hinders the executive‚Äôs ability to carry out its military, national security, and foreign relations activities and like section 1027, would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. The executive branch must have the flexibility to act swiftly in conducting negotiations with foreign countries regarding the circumstances of detainee transfers. In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict.
Section 1029 requires that the Attorney General consult with the Director of National Intelligence and Secretary of Defense prior to filing criminal charges against or seeking an indictment of certain individuals. I sign this based on the understanding that apart from detainees held by the military outside of the United States under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, the provision applies only to those individuals who have been determined to be covered persons under section 1022 before the Justice Department files charges or seeks an indictment. Notwithstanding that limitation, this provision represents an intrusion into the functions and prerogatives of the Department of Justice and offends the longstanding legal tradition that decisions regarding criminal prosecutions should be vested with the Attorney General free from outside interference. Moreover, section 1029 could impede flexibility and hinder exigent operational judgments in a manner that damages our security. My Administration will interpret and implement section 1029 in a manner that preserves the operational flexibility of our counterterrorism and law enforcement professionals, limits delays in the investigative process, ensures that critical executive branch functions are not inhibited, and preserves the integrity and independence of the Department of Justice.


Other provisions in this bill above could interfere with my constitutional foreign affairs powers. Section 1244 requires the President to submit a report to the Congress 60 days prior to sharing any U.S. classified ballistic missile defense information with Russia. Section 1244 further specifies that this report include a detailed description of the classified information to be provided. While my Administration intends to keep the Congress fully informed of the status of U.S. efforts to cooperate with the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense, my Administration will also interpret and implement section 1244 in a manner that does not interfere with the President‚Äôs constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs and avoids the undue disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications. Other sections pose similar problems. Sections 1231, 1240, 1241, and 1242 could be read to require the disclosure of sensitive diplomatic communications and national security secrets; and sections 1235, 1242, and 1245 would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.

My Administration has worked tirelessly to reform or remove the provisions described above in order to facilitate the enactment of this vital legislation, but certain provisions remain concerning. My Administration will aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future, and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my Administration throughout my time in office.

When the door of the train closes, he plops down on the floor of the train and starts banging on the snare drum as hard as he can. Not playing it like a tune or anything, just hitting it and punctuating it every few beats with a tuneless hobo song like ""I'M VERY POOR (BANG BANG BANG BANG) AND I DON'T HAVE NO MONEY (BANG BANG BANG BANG)"".

If you're adverse to the idea of paying extra for images, some people use BitTorrent to download the images from their favorite sites for free.

Where agnostic really falls in is on the nature of God, what God's true will is, what Christ's true teachings were and if they were corrupted in translation, is the organised church good? All these things seem so subjective to me they appear unknowable. 

Going off the topic of my personal stance slightly, I have an opinion on the demarcation problem. I believe science and rationality can be use up to a point but then faith steps in. For example, I don't think there's enough evidence for abiogenesis occuring naturally and that is science and rational to my belief; not proof. Many atheists disbelieve due to the lack of evidence for God; that's rational but not proof. 

The reason I mention that is that I get thoroughly frustated with the notion that science and religion are wholly incompatible. There is a line somewhere, that's to be certain, but I don't think that science and faith can not blend and relate up to a point. 

&gt; Evolution and Abiogenesis attempt to explain two entirely different things

Yes, different ""things"" but *why make that distinction? To me it makes as much sense as seperating cosmology, including things like cosmic microwave background (CMB) and dark matter, from the big bang. Without either creation or abiogenesis we wouldn't have evolution just as we wouldn't have the CMB or dark matter without the big bang. Not to mention the model of abiogenesis has to account for starting evolution, ie the first organism would have to be capable of reproducing and evolving.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Stalling early, how early depends on the lift, is often because of not eating enough and, secondly, from bad form. The press, for one, will stall early since the muscles that move the weight are all quite small. The bench press will stall some weeks later as it can only go so high on frequent increments. These are exercises you'll have to start eying weekly increments or smaller increments on soon. As for the squat and deadlift, those are the ones that should continue going up and will determine when you are 'done' with SS. Either way, the lifts won't go up if the food and rest isn't there. This is doubly true for the upper body lifts. 

Conditioning will inhibit strength training. There is no way around it though it will help to increase some food intake to make it less noticeable; however, that does not mean one should not do some conditioning. Just expect that you won't feel as strong or be able to push yourself as much in strength training for a few weeks until your body adapts to the extra stress of conditioning. You will probably even find yourself doing better after that adaptation. One thing to keep in mind though is that it is very hard, if not impossible, to improve both strength and conditioning greatly at the same time. ","1325376877"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","See as a rabid Bioshock fan, I considered 2 to be a pretty big disappointment, for a lot of reasons.  The story was so tacked on, and involved all of these supposedly major players in Rapture that we just never heard about in the first one, but should have.  By that, I don't mean they left it out of the first one, I just mean that they really didn't seamlessly integrate them into the story of Rapture.  Plus, the gameplay really faltered.  Where they really improved upon the weapon/plasmid combat system by letting you switch back and forth on the fly and do combos, it was ruined by the fact that every combat scenario in the game can be summed up with ""Uh oh, you're locked in that large open room, and can't get out the other side.  OH NO TONS AND TONS OF SPLICERS!  You can't get out until you kill them all!""    No more sneaking down hallways, no more feeling hunted by the creepy babbling splicer whose voice bounces down the hallway so you can't tell where he is, no more feeling of being stalked by a spider slicer.  Just large open rooms fighting waves of splicers all rushing you at once, like they were trying to make Bioshock: Serious Sam Edition.

i.e. Building/equipment maintenance requires a fixed amount of money up until the point that expansion is required, so in a school with X students a much higher proportion of this money is immediately removed from the budget than a school with 2X students.  
A class with 20 students vs. a class with 25 students still results in the exact same pay for the teacher of the class, but with 20% less income from student numbers.","1325376882"

He did threaten a veto if section 1032, subsection (b) (if I recall, I'm reciting from memory) was not included in the final draft. So to make sure it went through the Republicans added the part where US citizens and resident aliens cannot be detained under any part of this bill.

Overeem was fresher because of his 1 rd. KO, compared to Saki's 4 round war as well.

Then after that he goes on to beat a 41 year old who he outweighed by 15 lbs. A 41 year old who was so beat up in HIS earlier fight (a majority decision against Schilt) that night that he was **coughing up blood in the locker room**.

Loneliness is getting to me and I keep questioning why I'm feeling this way when the rest of the world seems to be having fun.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Their construction is actually pretty awesome. As I understand it, it's not physically possible to create those polyhedrons except by 3D printer. The ones I have are the Antique Bronze Matte. They've got some serious weight to them (made of metal) and they are every bit as pointy as they look. I haven't drawn blood yet, but that d4 could wreck a bare foot, lol. 

I have all my campaign notes on Google Docs that way I can write them out on my desktop and pull them up on my laptop while running the game. I'm in the market for a tablet to further improve this process while minimizing the table space requirement, but Google just completely threw me off by mentioning the possibility of a Nexus-like tablet. 

Anyway... We meet every Sunday at one of the guys' house around 5, start playing around 6 - 6:30, end around 10:30. We alternate Sundays with me running a Divine 4e campaign and one of the other guys running a Pathfinder game. 

My game has the party as reincarnated high priests of Pelor getting sent out as a crack team of undead stompers. They're going up against one Vecna's top lieutenants, Osterneth, the Bronze Lich. I tossed out most of her back story and came up with my own, though keeping her personality traits. The world itself is one that I've run another campaign in about a year ago, except the current campaign is 150 years in the future after she's taken over and rules most of the world with undead. 

Suffice to say the party from the first campaign failed to stop her, lol. Unfortunately, two of the 4 players from that group (not my Sunday group) moved away and the game had to end. I was a little relieved because running 2 games simultaneously while playing in a 3rd is a wee bit taxing. 

I only got the thorn dice about a month ago and now I make sure to use them to maximum dramatic effect. Sometimes it's a treasure role, sometimes it's letting the dice decide how a chaotic NPC will respond, sometimes it's an environmental hazard or random encounter. They never know except that it means something interesting is about to happen. ","1325376931"

You act like the US should be greatful they have a country like Israel they're forced to give expensive military equipment to for free, which Israel then sells to the Chinese and continues to build illegal settlements despite promising the US not to.

&gt;you pay them huge money for oil they pump out of their ground for free

Are you delusional? Pumping oil out of the ground isn't free, the Saudis are producing a good which they're selling to other people to earn an income which they're using to purchase things. Even if it was free it's irrelevant, Saudi Arabia makes money by selling something, be it oil or cocaine or whatever, and with that money its buying military equipment from the US. It doesn't matter how you think it works in that deluded brain of yours, at the end of the day the US is profiting financially from these sales (or at least breaking even), as opposed to Israel where they're just losing money.

As opposed to Israel which like the spoiled child it is is demanding the US give it free stuff because someone else in the playground just bought some nice things with his own money.

Man the Israel propaganda machine has done a real number on you.

&gt;But yeah israel is all mean to people that are shooting rockets at their cities day in day out and who send suicidebombers to blow up their kids, how uncivilized to not simply be happy about that right? And they killed jesus right? but you are just being reasonable right? right...

We're not talking about any of that, we're talking about how the US is Israels bitch :)

Besides, Israels terrorist activities, numerous crimes against humanity, and general constant dickishness does not go away because of what someone else did.

I'll let you have the last word, I'm not going to reply anymore to someone so stupid who thinks that pumping oil out of the ground is free or that Saudi Arabia paying for US aircraft is the same thing as the US giving Israel aircraft for free.

he has said that he wasn't a PR guy or a customer service guy and I believe that. He obviously did the job as a favor to someone or maybe they gave the job to him as a favor to him. The point is I think we're done with it now. What is it going to accomplish calling him stupid. What justification is there in that at this point?

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","That's a good point. Lately, I've been trundling along at 12 new each day (started out high and then gradually dialed it down until I no longer felt that the devilish things on my screen were trying to reach out and strangle me), but I notice a few of them ""slipping"" once in a while.

An SRS (Spaced Repetition System) will come in handy in these situations, though. If you fail at something, no sweat, you'll have it paraded in front of your face for another few days. I have burned through slightly less than 1000 words since I started, and I've only *once* failed at one to such an extent that the program basically gave up on me. The rest... sure, I don't always remember kanji I last saw six months ago, but if I do forget them, Anki makes sure I ""re-learn"" them again, soon enough.

Of course, I don't actually recommend 12 each day. I've been on vacation for a month or so, with a lot of time I didn't even really know how to spend. When school starts again, I'm most likely going to halve that amount. Also, as toshitalk says, it's most likely best to take it somewhat easy. 

In my case, I pushed because I once did a small calculation and arrived at the conclusion that I'd be done with the ""Core 2000"" vocab in late October 2012. If you haven't already made an educated guess at how long it's going to take you... don't. I'm serious. Unless you're already working at an insane pace, it'll only mess with your head. Particularly if you suck as much at motivating yourself as I do.

I also have one more piece of advice: don't let your language study become all about the kanji, or rote vocab/kanji drilling, or vaguely twisted SRS obsessions. Have some fun with it, do different things (I watch anime, read manga, play games in addition to the pure studying - which is great because I now have an excuse to watch anime, read manga and play games :3), read about different subjects etc.","1325376963"

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","I don't know if the ""verge of collapse"" is correct.  I see a serious decline in living standards.  How far this will go is beyond me to be honest, but it feels like a collapse in all we are accustomed to already.  

I see our country falling into a quasi police state.  I see our economy falling into a long depression of the likes my generation has never seen.  I see the schools failing to provide the education I received.  In general everything since 2001 has gotten progressively worse.  Of course, in 2001 I never even thought like this at all.  

I supported our president then.  I didn't like the Patriot Act, but the sunset clause made it ok.  I understood why we needed to be on alert and vigilant.  I also understood why President Bush sought to go to Iraq versus waiting for more to come here.  He was providing targets for potential terrorist in their sand box so our children could be safe.  I didn't like it, but it was a solution I could accept.  

I moved as far away from the city as possible to avoid anymore planes falling out of the sky and tried to forget about the national nightmare that could have killed most of my family.  (My step dad was supposed to be on guard at the Pentagon, My grandmother and grandfather lived in Somerset with my sister at the time.)

Then I learned about peak oil.  I thought, so what we have at least 100 years left.  I explained away any concerns that nagged at me, until suddenly one day... I think 2008 or so I thought about all of it.  I realized this was not the world I grew up in, and due to things beyond my control may never be.  I grieved for the world I grew up in and the world my children would never be able to experience.  I saw my own family struggle financially with things that before we would have never imagined could be difficult to obtain.  

Then I stopped thinking about the past.  I thought about how I could survive any financial collapse on my own.  I changed the way I lived.  I lowered expenses.  I learned to cook and bake.  Then I learned to grow a few foods.  I took on new projects doing things I never thought were possible, like sewing, building, designing furniture.  I decided I was going to be able to provide for my children no matter how much we couldn't buy.  

When gas became to expensive to keep up with our regular outings, we reduced going out and starting staying in.  We bought board games and card games and starting playing those instead.  We found local creeks we could walk to and stand around in to cool off our feet at least.  When we couldn't afford to run as much on the electricity, we cut back, saved and got some solar power.  When we couldn't afford the 75 dollar water bills, my husband fixed the plumbing and we installed rain barrels for the garden.  When we needed more room to store food due to our growing family and my growing abilities to preserve food, he changed the old bathroom into a pantry.  This reduced our water bill further and made enough room to store 3 months of food for our family.  

We have been in a steady downhill decline as a country.  If not, my family would not have had to adapt in so many different ways.  We could have kept on doing what we always have. I wouldn't have to tell my children they better learn to garden to survive.  I wouldn't have to teach them some police officers are bad.  I wouldn't have to home school them so they could receive an education at least as complete as I received.  I wouldn't have to sew their clothes so that they are of high enough quality to last more than 4 washings.  I wouldn't have to hand wash my clothing or line dry my clothing if the economy wasn't in a serious decline.  I wouldn't have to worry how my daughter will get her medication for strep throat.  If you can ignore all of this, then God Bless you.  I can't.  For me, the collapse of our living standards has already started.","1325376983"

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","^ Excellent intro to philosophy.

Also If you want to go chronologically,

For Western Philosophy:
 look into the pre socratics
then Aristotle and Plato
Augustine
Berkely, Locke, Hume
Hobbes
Heidegger
Kant 
Hegel 
Nietsche-- read his birth of tragedy after reading some of the Greek Playwrights such as Aeschelus' The Orestia, Sophocles' Oedipus Cycle, and Euripides the Bacchae.
Max Weber, Emile Durkheim
Marx
Freud/ Jung

The Existentialists like Sartre
(Also as a response to Existentialists you have Absurdists, and Dadaists, a great play that responds to Nhilism is Waiting for Godot). 

From there you can go into branches by country or general era. The German, French, English, American, and Russian Philosophic traditions.

Or you can jump into the Structuralists like Levi-Strauss, Sybolists like Richard Gerz, Pragmatists like Richard Rorty.

And then you have great political philosphers like Hannah Arendt, Theoretical Physists like Einstein, Psychodynamic (kinda bullshitty) philosophers like Lacan and Kristeva which crosses over into Literary Theory and Narratology, with thinkers like Bahktin.

For Eastern Traditions:

For Post Structuralism/ Modernism/ Post Modernism:
Look into Foucault, Judith Butler, 

You should start with confucianism, Taoism, and Hindu thought. Look into the Vedas, the Bhagaveghita, and Bhudism. 

And though Religions are generally viewed on with negative light, theology and especially comparative theology is very philosophy heavy.

Look into Mystism, like Islamic Sufism, the Christian text ""The Cloud of Unknowing,"" and Jewish thinkers like Joseph Cambell, Walter Benjamin (Who is awesome in everything, look into Illuminations or Thesis on the Philosophy of History), and Gershom Sholem.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I can appreciate the effort you put into these and I would like to commend you for a job well done, but I always get a bit annoyed when people do a fan set for magic. There are extremely explicit design paradigms already in place for MTG, and shirking them and focusing purely on flavor strikes me as a bit lazy. Here are my notes on the cards; everything is within the context of modern design.

Banshee‚Äôs Veil: The second effect is extremely awkward as I do not believe it functions in the way you intend it to. While it is technically possible for the effect to occur (when you target your own creatures with spells) it makes no sense within the context of banshee‚Äôs veil. The effect you are looking for is: ‚ÄúWhenever equipped creature becomes the target of a spell or ability for the first time in a turn, counter that spell or ability.‚Äù I believe this type of ability first appeared in the Kamigawa block and the costing of creatures with said ability, when adjusted for creature power inflation, suggests it is valued below hexproof. The first ability is almost irrelevant. Overall, this card is vastly overcosted for an uncommon (or even if it were a common at that). I would price it at around 2 to cast 1 to equip. That is a rough number though as it‚Äôs a harder keyword to price.

Brand: With the restrictive cost of 1RRRR, it is safe to assume Brand is exclusively for mono red. Even the reflecting pool/vivid land metagame that was lorwyn block would struggle to cast him outside of mono red. From a competitive standpoint, brand is an 8 mana, 2 turn investment for a conditional two for one (his first ability is costed at 1 and 2/3 of a black lotus more than what it should be). At 2/2, he is not aggressively price and he dies to ‚Äìeverything-. You would have a hard time classifying him as a casual rare either, as the second ability is just convoluted enough to not be casual, yet the effect is too simple and commonplace to be fun.

Cloth Armor: Costs way too much. 0 cast 0 equip might even be too weak given the effect. I might consider 0 cast 0 equip with +0/+2, but that might be too strong for a common in limited (probably not though). Hard to determine a limited metagame though.

Corki: Too complicated for an uncommon. Too weak for constructed, but far far far too strong for an uncommon in limited. The second ability is stylistically inconsistent with cards with similar effects. Activate only during combat damage abilities generally only can target creatures. The last sentence is also useless.

Long Sword: Costs way too much. It should cost more than cloth armor, but otherwise the same criticisms stand.

Mordekaiser: Probably the most appropriate of the cards, however death during next upkeep limits its use. Would change to something along the lines of ‚Äúsacrifice it at the end of your next turn‚Äù so it gets one attack in at least. Adjust to 5/4. Casual only, no way to make it aggressively costed enough for constructed, though similar creatures are not without precedence (see ink-eyes).

Riven: 6 multicolored mana and 2 turns for a conditional shock is not good. Actually, I feel the biggest design flaw is that it can kill itself. Second ability should cost 1 black lotus less than it does. Would lower cost to 1WWB and remove B from cost of first ability. Also its not WW2, 2WW only.

Sight Ward: Wouldn‚Äôt even be good if it cost 0. Maybe cantrip it when it dies?

Vision Ward: Even worse than sight ward. Cantrip‚Äôing it would still make it worse than a cantrip‚Äôd sight ward so this actually is a design nightmare given the existence of sight ward.

Warwick: Suffers from the exact same problems as corki, too complicated for an uncommon, will never find a place in constructed, but waaay too strong for limited at that rarity.

Oh wait, you probably already know that.

IN men, masturbation improves sperm quality, ability to 'last' in intercourse, may reduce risk of prostate cancer, and can help alleviate prostatitis.

In women, masturbation can ease delivery ( the researchers called it 'digital massage' ), strength the vagina, uterus, and cervix thereby increasing the enjoyability of sex, help treat vaginissmus or painful intercourse, reduce the rate of vaginal prolapse in older women, increase the chance of conception if carried out before sex.

&gt; Unlucky in love and looking for some solitary fun after morning prayers? Look elsewhere.

The premise that you're only allowed sexual joy if it's another person providing you with it is beyond bullshit. 

I also learned a worrying thing about the Muslim religion that I wasn't previously aware of.

&gt; the Islamic belief that ‚Äúman and woman must reach their peak‚Äù during intercourse, and that only then is the ‚Äúdeed complete.‚Äù

Fuck. I can only imagine how many women fake it. With that much pressure to reach orgasm, the chances of her actually being able to have a genuine one with her partner are pretty much down the tubes. And I'd be curious if more religious Muslim men suffer from performance anxiety than the rest of the population.

Please note, at NO time did I reduce my food intake, nor did I cut out my beer intake (except during induction. After two months I upped my Carbs to 100/day.

Do we treat them as ""normal"" criminals?  If so, how do we go about fetching them from foreign countries without using the military?

The film makes it seem like we won't be working, and we will just be harvesting resources to live.  The reality is that there will need to be people farming these resources, developing the technology, maintaining it, teaching, and researching.  There will still a distinction between difficult jobs, dangerous jobs, and mundane jobs, and so the class distinction will still be evident.

Instead of society being divided by the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" it will be divided into the ""doers"" and the ""do nots."". Thus, it seems that the communal aims cannot be reached due to this inescapable difference between classes.","1325377035"

I firmly believe that the holocaust DID happen, but I also believe that the number 6 million is absolute and total bullshit. Fun fact, did you know that holocaust-denial is a crime in most Western European countries? Spain recently repealed their laws, joining the U.S. as a country where it is legal to have a differing opinion about history. If  6 million people really did get rounded up and exterminated by the Germans, then why go through such great lengths, jailing men and women throughout Europe, to make sure NO ONE dissents?

HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS? You cannot standardize what is taught to children in homes. You cannot police it. You cannot qualify or disqualify parents. It. Cannot. Be. Done. This is what schools do. This is why teachers exist. Professionals are not amateurs.

ALL OF THEM?

The government has, at least by extension, power over the following: 

* The training and certification that teachers go through.

* Thereby, the recommended teaching methods.

* The employment of teachers, therefore giving teachers incentive and accountability.

* A broad control over what *gets* taught, in the form of a curriculum.

* A teacher's *conduct*, in the sense that teachers get fired for abusing children, and their behavior is transparent to their supervisors, many other children, and to some degree their parents.

Probably more, my head hurts.

Homes are not schools. The statements do not contradict eachother, which is quite clear if you read it properly. What I have seen is a group of homeschoolers organize to form a 'school' that did not exist other than monthly (or less frequently) non-education-related gatherings and fictional accountability, where the people involved knew that everything, including the tests, submitted to the government were an absolute, blatant lie. I have seen parents flat-out take tests for children. There is no way in hell anything like this could happen in a public school.

I'm aware what 'teaching to the test' is. What is your problem with it, exactly? Do you believe that things should be taught that are not on the tests, then? If so, put them on the test.

It is impossible to ensure reasonable standards for homeschooled kids, by definition. The freedom you want and the oversight that is needed are mutually incompatible. Even if that were not the case, I would oppose it on grounds of isolation. A homeschooled child is quite easily hidden away from society entirely, making it very easy for parents to do whatever horrible things they like.

You're the one who keeps saying standardized testing is insufficient. In what ways? What types of things would *you* like ensured? I can't think of something that fixes whatever problems you have with the public school system without knowing what they are. If teachers are failing at their jobs, fire them. If teachers in *general* are failing at their jobs, reform how we teach and qualify them to do their jobs. If there aren't enough teachers, offer them more money. None of these are things we can do with parents.

I did have that thought about private schools as well, and not 'just as', but they certainly are vulnerable to it. I think, in that case, there's not much that can be done about it. They are privately owned for-profit businesses, and hopefully capitalism and the discretion of parents can police those on their own.","1325377049"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I know not much about the topic, and really am not a philosopher in any kind of way but some very interesting concepts about freedom (not directly related to security) had been coined by [Isaiah Berlin](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/), where you could have two way of seeing freedom : 

Positively  (in reply to the question : Up to what level are we free ?) and negatively (in reply to the question : What are the barrieres to my ultimate freedom ?).

Interesting enough is that you can probably draw a parallel between both visions and far-right (negative freedom) or far-left (positive freedom) social politics.

But since, neither of these visions really represented a valid reflexion of the subject, it had been proposed that freedom could bee seen as a triadic relation between agents, objectives and constraints.

Security then could be interpreted as a set of constraints which either lower the objectives attained or the quantity of agents capable of attaining them.

This also begets that security and liberty are not a zero-sum equation.","1325377057"

All I claimed was that racist anthropologists were the first to use the term Aryan to describe the ""race"" of the people of Northern Europe. As the [White Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_race) is itself a construction of Slavery-Era anthropology and used explicitly to justify and explain the slave trade, and as the term ""Aryan"" was [changed in the 19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_race#19th-century_physical_anthropology) from meaning exclusively ""the ethnic group of northern India, etc"" to ""that ethnic group, and also the people of Northern Europe"" based on physical characteristics including white skin, my original claim is valid.

Also, the previous article to which I link mentions a prevalent view in the mid-19th-century that the ultimate origin of the Aryan race was in the Steppe region of what is now Russia. Once again, all prehistorical anthropological data is contestable and interpetrable.

You're asserting that being convinced of something that isn't true while being drunk is robbery, in an effort to equate that with a lack of ability to consent. This argument falls apart when considering that that same scenario is just as illegal if it would happen to a sober person while, once again, this is not true of consensual sex.

&gt; Have you ever been drunk? Just a question.

Yes, actually, I have been blackout drunk before. There's a reason I don't drink anymore. And, as is right, I take full responsibility for all of my actions while drunk.

&gt; ...and consent is massively abrogated in a drunken context.

No, judgement is impaired, but not consent. We don't allow sober people with poor judgement to claim rape when anybody has sex with them, why does this suddenly magically change with drunk sex? ""I was being stupid."" is not a valid excuse for doing something stupid.

&gt; No. Contract law is quite relevant...

&gt;  You engage in a contract whenever you agree to do something with another person.

I'm sorry, but you're wrong. If you get drunk and somebody convinces you to give them everything you own (by just asking for it, not by lying to you), then you can't go back later and force them to give it back. You could try to sue, but you'd be laughed out of court.","1325377063"

I've encountered many difficult scriptures that seem to conflict with the obvious and have usually found upon deeper inspection that either my understanding of the obvious was wrong or I was not correctly interpreting scripture.

Not everyone believes the bible literally. I do. I don't see any other way. To read it and take bits and pieces of it that satisfy you or fit your world view is to destroy the whole thing I think, or turn it into nothing more than a book of philosophy. I cannot do that. Many can, I cannot - it would be illogical. 

Now, because I came to conclude that our understanding of evolution is incorrect because it directly conflicts with the biblical account of creation, I've dived deeper and have discovered science that better fits my world view. You can see a lot of it at [Answers in Genesis](http://www.answersingenesis.org/) and  and [The Institute for Creation Research](http://www.icr.org/). I recommend you check out those sites.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;Everything that you mentioned is all graphics as in complete bullshit that doesn't effect gameplay

So all the various changes don't matter if it doesn't effect gameplay? Now that's a silly way to counter the facts.

&gt;bullet drop is the same, hit registration is just as bad

Nope, bullet drop is much different, especially for rocket launchers. Most guns generally have much more range than they did in BC2. There are also various attachments that effect range.

Hit registration is much improved than BC2's. BF3 doesn't suffer BC2's sniper hitboxes. 

What you are most likely complaining about is the lag compensation. There are many ways to handle lag, but generally the best way is to prioritize the shooter's perspective. At least, to my knowledge. 

&gt;The old maps could have supported 64 players if they added more spawn points all of these features were possible before they just restricted them.

Oh god no, that would of been terrible for the console port that BC2 was. Bad company's mechanics were made for 24 in mind. Even 32 players was pushing it. 

Heavy Metal is probably the only map that could fit that bill anyway.

&gt;Your argument for why it is different is that they released the game they promised 3 years ago and labeled everything that should have been in the last game as a new feature

They never promised 64 players, jets, etc. they promised a sequel to Bad Company. Which is more or less consilized Battlefield to compete with CoD's audience. Even more so with BC2. Eventually we got a successor to BF2, which features many concepts from both BF2 and BC2. Plus a share of new ones.

To support my previous statement however, we are able to measure gravity with tremendous precision, and it varies depending on where you stand on Earth due to your physical proximity to core. Similarly, gravity is weaker on the moon than it is on Earth, and the moon's gravity also affects Earth's rotation. Meanwhile, there is also the other planets of the solar system and of course the Sun itself, not to mention the contents of the milky way galaxy. Even a planetoid's gravity is not constant, as it accrues or loses mass its gravity consequently alters.

Therefore, I conclude that gravity itself is subjective and not immutable.

At first, the shady plant seemed like an odd point of comparison for Ninevah. But the killing of the plant is a response not just to Jonah's hate for Ninevah, but to the two times he asks God to kill HIM. The implication being that he has been the shady tree for Ninevah -- the instrument of God's mercy. And so o snuff him out would be selfish; his life isn't just about him.","1325377093"

"korea","t5_2qiog","Best - Cheap cost of living. Most contracts include apartment s part of salary package. Food, alcohol, transport, all easily affordable. Low crime rates - Watch your bicycle if you leave it locked in public places, and don't leave an unattended wallet, but besides those, crime is low. If you leave a cellphone in a taxi or bar or cafe, chances are the person who finds it will pretty much immediately call you (via your friends list, or, if you call your phone, they will usually answer immediately) to arrange you getting it back. Oh, and internet plans... W35,000 a month (about $30 US, I think) for unlimited (yes, UNLIMITED) data use. And generally very fast speeds. 

Worst - Language barrier. I'm in my 3rd year, and I study the language actively, yet am still lost most of the time - And I'm proficient in 5 languages and mildly conversant in another 4, so I know how to study a language, yet this one still just baffles the crap out of me a lot of the time. It's possible, but it's hard work. Traffic - There are no actual rules. Well, yes, there are, but noone bothers with them. Take care at red lights, especially as a cyclist or pedestrian. Indicators are seldom used, so keep a sharp eye out on traffic emerging from, or approaching, side streets and intersections. Garbage - Good bloody luck finding a trash can as you walk around a Korean city. The locals will simply drop theirs most of the time, but as a Kiwi, growing up with a strong culture against littering, it feels almost blasphemous to simply drop a can or wrapper. I prefer to wait for a refuse collection bag, and squish whatever I'm holding into the top.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; Is it possible for politics to have free thought? I think so; The question at that point is how, exactly, would one proceed in such a thing? 

My thought is that people need to learn to challenge their most basic assumptions to engage in free thought. In other words, it is necessary to learn to call into doubt the values, prejudices and interpretations of events that we learn throughout our upbringings. When people take their assumptions to be self-evident or obvious, it is difficult (perhaps impossible) for them to entertain new ideas that are based on a different set of assumptions.

&gt;If you're going to start taking words seriously and not making them do all kinds of ""double duty"", you're talking...well, is it philosophy?

The more I get into political debates, the more I begin to appreciate the importance of ensuring that both parties agree on the meanings of the words they use. Similarly, as I indicated in the original post, as I notice words performing this ""double duty,"" I begin to find the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) to be more believable and more disturbing. So in the context of political discussions,  the use of words can play a pivotal role determining the thought of those engaged in the discussion, and unfortunately the importance of words in this regard seems to be issue that is the least appreciated.

"transgender","t5_2qxpm","Why are we having a straw man argument. Feminism didn't teach that men have unbridled and unrestricted privilege, and modern trans feminism addresses this. However the areas where men don't have privilege are directly relatedand as a result of the patriarchal system. Feminism recognizes that it's oppressive to *everyone.* I'm sure you've read *whipping girl* in which Serano reconciles a lot of this, including that a modern goal for feminism should be liberating *femininity* as it has a direct relationship to many of the problems we experience including homophobia transphobia, femmephobia, queer invisibility, and even dumb shit like masculine = strong and feminine = weak.

Sooooo, yeah. I'm not going to argue a straw man. And I'll agree that for a young trans woman the make restrictions of femininity can feel like oppression. Because it is. But it's oppression from the patriarchal system.

And this idea of ""women are precious"" is kind of MRA speak and I have no desire to suit here and address something we've just gone over in another thread.

Playsilks have been an item my kid has used at every age thus far, and at almost 9, he still uses them.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Pretty sad to see /r/starcraft missed the epicness that was yesterday's proleague. SK T1 vs CJ Entus.

Bisu roflstomped Effort (one of the best Zergs currently, and who takes games from even Flash) like he was just a little bug and said that pvz is so easy that he feels like ""Winning against Zerg doesn't even feel like winning anymore"".

Bisu is known for being the god of PvZ, the arguably most historically hard (when talking about balance) match up of all. It's like he was born to be a Zerg killer.

from teamliquid:

&gt;In regular leagues, Bisu's PvZ win-rate for ALL OF 2011 is 85.71% (24-4). (If you include the prelim loss to hyvaa it drops to 25-6, which is ""only"" 80.65%.)

&gt;It's definitely the most unique matchup. While Flash is arguably more dominant in TvT (which I believe is the most taxing matchup to play given the intricacies involved), PvZ has historically favored Z in nearly all respects, which makes Bisu's performance in it so much more remarkable than Flash's sheer dominance. The fact that the 2nd best PvZer is astronomically below Bisu attests to this. It's art, plain and simple, and Bisu is the only one with the vision to create a masterpiece.","1325377140"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I hate to use anecdote, but I have been subjected to multiple IQ tests. So I'm somewhat familiar with IQ tests. Basically, the ones that I took had multiple sections that tested different things, included fast memory (a quick recitation of a specific amount of numbers in correct order), vocabulary, pronunciation (I was even subjected to words I hadn't previously encountered, too, in the previous two mentioned sections. So ability to pronounce words you weren't familiar with, as well as the ability to define them was counted in). Mathematics skills, object identification, reading comprehension, physical problem solving (I was given a few puzzles), abstract 3D imaging (I'm sure you guys have encountered a 3D image where you're told to turn it X degrees in X direction and offered a choice of pictures as to what it would look like), and several more subjects.
However, while there is the testing of certain cognitive abilities, some of the stuff like mathematics and language skills are fairly relative to your previous knowledge. I'd also like to point out that each problem was given a score and you would receive a total score, then would have it divided by your age.

I'm sure we can all assess that someone like Abe Lincoln wasn't exactly stupid. However, with an IQ test testing against knowledge to some degree, Abe Lincoln would surely be hurt in his scores.

Well, ""Murphy"" came along! After I missed one, I realized I had been ""cheating"" all along by using a bag underneath the butt.

&gt;Our solution is to scramble the string

&gt;value is no longer deterministic. That is,
&gt;a String#hash result is consistent only
&gt;for current process lifetime and will
&gt;generate a different number for the next
&gt;boot. To break this situation an attacker
&gt;must create a set of strings which are
&gt;robust to this kind of scrambling. This is

The mark of a good publicity organization is to provide a counter-narrative to the bad press you get. It may not be a good idea to trumpet your defeats, but on the other hand, it's an excellent time to point out all those Republican senators you mention who tied this into a defense spending bill in the first place. What does it take to say ""look at these fucking people - they hate your veterans, they are threatening to starve them and leave their bills unpaid unless we give them the power to turn our country into a police state"". Again, this is basic politics, don't let your opposition control the narrative. Do something to counter it. For fuck's sake, try.

Not all the press is against Obama. Surely they had friends there who could have run a counter-current of stories from this perspective, to provide some fuel to their own base.

Putting overdrive on it at that point results in strange and annoying sounds, so I can't really recommend it for that purpose, but if you're looking for a good amp to take to somebody's house with decent built-in drive and some volume, the SC is pretty good.","1325377173"

I think Voldemort had cancer.

He constantly was searching for 'eternal life'. Magic is a known carcinogen and, ironically, is in itself unable to cure any kind of cancer other than pancreatic*. 

What kind of steps did Voldemort take to combat his cancer? He was constantly murdering people to create new horcruxes, which could easiy be reckoned to a kind of magical chemotherapy. Another symptom of the magical chemo is his apparent constant feeling of chills. seriously, even the dark lord is going to get a little muggy feeling wearing black robes in the middle of July. 


so I think maybe Voldemort just wanted to not day of cancer.

This is where I'd say you are a condescending asshole. So, you're a condescending asshole.

Okay. Let me see if I have this right. I'll try to sum up what you're saying, and if I have it wrong, will you please correct me?

* There is more to the pro-life/pro-choice argument then just the issue of women's rights; I do not think you clarified what other arguments there could be. 

* You say this in response to your analog: ""The external actors are the same, the internal actors and the controversy are all that is different and they interact with the external actors in identical ways. "" I am confused as to what that means. 

* I think your final case is that Church Charities should have the right to disallow certain people from adopting, based on their beliefs, and that they should only use private funds to do so, like Planned Parenthood and abortions. My question: What about non-church adoption agencies?

I took my hit while staring out at the hill in front of me I had just been arrested in in another reality as my high from previous hits began to set in. Thus, I forgot to lean down to take the hit, and did it staring straight at this hill in front of me. Just as I breathe in, I see a car come over the hill I'm staring at.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No... you're confusing the size of the money supply with the ability of the bank to make loans.   Fractional reserve banking increases the size of the money supply (i.e. amount of money in circulation) but it doesn't let a bank lend out money it doesn't actually have.*

When we both deposit 200k in bank #1, bank #1 can make a loan of up to $200k.   Someone comes along and borrows 200k - this person may deposit 50k of that money into bank #2, therefore allowing bank #2 to make out of a loan of $50k.   

This $1.4m number (or whatever it is) assumes three things, which aren't necessarily true:

* All loan proceeds are deposited back into bank accounts - which makes no sense, people take loans to buy things like cars and houses and pay off credit cards. In reality the money filters through the economy and may eventually end up at a bank anywhere in the world
* Any loan proceeds deposited into a bank account must be deposited with the same bank that made the original loan - which probably won't happen, given there are thousands of banks in the US, let alone the world.  i.e. if bank #1 made a loan of 200k, there's no guarantee the 50k deposit would be with bank #1, it's more likely to be elsewhere.
* No reserve ratio

There is definitely some element of this happening (i.e. loan proceeds becoming bank deposits at other banks), but the Federal Reserve puts brakes on lending by dictating reserve requirements for banks (i.e. what fraction of deposits must be held at the Fed, the ""fractional"" in fractional reserve).  Thus, the $1.4m thing never happens - maybe the money supply is inflated to $300k or $400k depending on reserve requirements, but this is split amongst many banks and potentially countries. Bank #1 is not going on a crazy lending spree.

In economics this whole concept is called the multiplier effect of money.
This lending/deposit/lending cycle has increased the size of the money supply, but it hasn't actually let bank #1 make $1.4m in loans. 


**Yes, a bank can monetize future loan cashflows &amp; package this as a securitized bond, and then use the proceeds of this securitized bond to make more loans - that happens all the time with mortgages - but really now, that's far beyond this topic*","1325377213"

And sometimes they happen, but the reason is not clear. It's very typical for a person not to be able to link a phobia back to a specific cause.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I'm not saying these are not generally fallacies, I'm only saying that in some contexts they do make a point indirectly.

&gt;Asking about the origin and accuracy of the bible is different than ridiculing the origins. (Presumably), the first mathematicians in Sumeria also thought fire was magic. It doesn't discredit their math.

Of course it doesn't discredit their math, because their math has something going for it independent of it's creators. But when it comes to believing in something only on trust, it's fair to question the people you are trusting and if everything else they said was a lie, then maybe you shouldn't trust them.

&gt;If also the same Bad things can happen without the good things, then it still remains it's Biased Sample status.

In simplified form;

World with just Humanism : People being nice to each other

World with just Christianity: Some People being nice to each other *and* people starting religious wars.

The crusades are used as an example of bad things that happen because of religion, which won't happen because of humanism. That's the argument and its talking only about the bad bits because that is the difference between the two.

&gt;Wait, what? We get accused of cherry picking, but it's perfectly acceptable for opponents to do the same thing?? Special pleading much? Without accountining for the other parts, then it's still the fallacy of composition (or division, depending on your perspective).

How is that cherry picking? It's asking for you to take the whole book together, and not ignore all the bad bits. When a christian says those bits don't count anymore, we are onto the real discussion, *why and how do they cherry-pick their morals and facts?*

&gt;From above, ""Discussing replication techniques of cloth has no bearing on the claims of christianity (though I don't think the shroud of turin means anything, either).""

So you don't hold evidence in a high regard then? These kind of things are miracles, held to be true by ""religious authorities"", which have been shown to be wrong. It's proof that ""religious authorities"" just make stuff up.

You say it'd do nothing to stop child molestation?  What's our current set of socially-acceptable negative reinforcement tactics doing to stop it?  Very damn little, it would seem.  All the psychoanalysis, and the rehab, and the realignment, even the legendary (but mostly toothless) threat of jailhouse horrors, and pedos **still** have some of the highest recidivism rates of any class of crime.

So what's left?  We can lock them up for life, but how often does a life sentence really remain a life sentence?  How many prisons are we planning to build, how many mouths are we going to feed?  Don't you even *slightly* resent the idea that a single dollar of your money would go to put food in the mouth of a creature like that, rather than your own or your family's?

We just have to make sure that it never happens again.

In the mean time, who can we get to introduce a bill to overturn those clauses in the NDAA and get it rammed through on a rail?  

As far as the rest of your, umm, theory goes, well then do something about it.  Work to get the bad parts of the bills repealed.   Form a PAC, raise money, start something big!

If it's done in firmware on the camera, there's the possibility that an attacker could find a means by which to make a change that would damage/disable the LED there.

If it's truly hardwired, then no, there's pretty much no way to turn on the camera without the light turning on.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My sister. Lived with her for four years in college in an off-campus apartment. 

Her room, and by room I mean the place where she slept, was nothing more than a floor hamper. There was only one place in the entire room where you could view the ""carpet"", a three by two foot section in front of a floor mirror where she would sit and apply makeup every day. Needless to say, I put ""carpet"" in quotations earlier because what you could view here was technically carpeting, but no longer the mauve color like in MY room, but a mottled splattering of reds, pinks, browns, tans, and blacks. The rest of the floor was covered in dunes of dirty clothes that measured between half a foot to two feet thick in places. It was like walking on a water bed when I would have to trek through her room to collect all the dirty dishes when I had nothing to eat on. Our cat, angry at life and at her, would periodically pee on her clothes. and cover them (like a litterbox). One would think that this would entice her to clean...but no....she would just live in the stink and I was eventually forced to retreat entirely to my bedroom in the back and keep the door closed with the window open.

When she moved out, I had huge plans for her spare room. I was going to put in some workout equipment, make it a nice man cave. So I rented a carpet cleaner. thirty minutes, one broken steam cleaner, and a 3ft by 1 ft patch of clean carpet later, I was overpowered by the smell. I closed the door, stuffed towels in the gap and walked away. When I moved out five months later I went to the office and turned in my key.

"v20london","t5_2tajz","*Bayswater*     
Famous for its Paddington train station, this area is a good bet for affordable accommodation that's close to the tranquility of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens.

*Belgravia*     
Belgravia is to the south-west of Buckingham Palace. It is known for its expensive hotels and is considered by the rich to be a desirable place to live. There are many embassies are in the area. Belgravia is generally quiet and is a great area to walk around and admire the Georgian houses. There are also a number of exclusive shops, restaurants and attractive pubs.

*Bloomsbury*     
Bloomsbury is London's literary district. This district, a world within itself, is bound roughly by Euston Road to the north, Gower Street to the west, and Clerkenwell to the east. It is, among other things, the academic heart of London.

*Camden*     
Shoppers and people-watchers flock from far away to crowd the streets and chill out at Camden Market. Good cafes and clubs make Camden much more than a great market area.

*Canary Wharf*, on the Isle of Dogs, is the heart of *Docklands*. This 28-hectare (69-acre) site is dominated by a 240m-high (787-ft.) tower, which is the tallest building in the United Kingdom, and was designed by C√©sar Pelli. The Piazza of the tower is lined with shops and restaurants.     

*Chelsea*     
Once a center of innovation in the 19th century when the area was a veritable Victorian artists' colony, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones lived in the neighborhood that has since lost in youth culture and settled into a small town atmosphere in the midst of the huge city. Chelsea is famous for the King's Road for the bohemian sixties and punks in the 1970s. It's a wealthy area like Kensington and Knightsbridge.

*City of London (The Square Mile)*     
The first settlement of Roman conquerors, The City is now the soul of the world's financial markets. Modern structures like the Lloyd's Building may outnumber ancient buildings such as the Bank of England and the Old Bailey but The City also holds the sacred St. Paul's Cathedral, Old Spitalfields Market, and Leadenhall Market and the modern Museum of London and Barbican Centre.

*Clerkenwell*     
This neighborhood, north and a bit west of the City, was the site of London's first hospital and is the home of several early churches. St. Bartholomew-the-Great, built in 1123, still stands as London's oldest church and the best example of large-scale Norman building in the city. In the 18th century, Clerkenwell declined into a muck-filled cattle yard, home to cheap gin distilleries. During a 19th-century revival, John Stuart Mill's London Patriotic Club moved here in 1872, and William Morris's socialist press called Clerkenwell home in the 1890s -- Lenin worked here editing Iskra. The neighborhood again fell into disrepair but has recently been reinvented by the moneyed and groovy. A handful of hot restaurants and clubs have sprung up, and art galleries line St. John's Square and the border of Clerkenwell Green. Lest you think the whole area has become trendy, know that trucks still rumble into Smithfield Market throughout the night, unloading thousands of beef carcasses.

*Covent Garden*     
Covent Garden's Piazza has daily open-air entertainment. The 18th century iron and glass fruit and vegetable market has gracefully evolved into fashion boutiques and other up-market stores. Stroll down Long Acre, Floral Street and the cobbled Neal Street or visit the Royal Opera House. Neal's Yard is the center for healthy food and alternative therapies.

*Docklands*     
In 1981, in the most ambitious scheme of its kind in Europe, the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) was formed to redevelop Wapping, the Isle of Dogs, the Royal Docks, and Surrey Docks. The area is bordered roughly by Tower Bridge to the west and London City Airport and the Royal Docks to the east.

*The East End*     
Traditionally, this was one of London's poorest districts, nearly bombed out of existence during World War II. The East End extends east from the City Walls, encompassing Stepney, Bow, Poplar, West Ham, Canning Town, and other districts.     
These days, many immigrants to London make their homes in the East End. London is pushing eastward. Today you'll find lots of trendy bars, clubs, restaurants, and boutiques or vintage clothing outlets here. Much of the fashionable life is found around Hoxton Square and its peripheries, such as Shoreditch and the northern half of Brick Lane. There is an array of contemporary galleries in the area.  Attractions you may want to visit if you're in the area include St. Clement Danes church, the Temple of Mithras, and Sir Christopher Wren's Monument to the Great Fire of 1666.

*Greenwich*     
Known by most as the center of Greenwich Mean Time at zero degrees longitude, come visit the National Maritime Museum, the imposing Old Royal Naval College, Cutty Sark, and Greenwich Park.

*Hampstead*     
Thick with literary history, you'll find homes of poets, playwrights and actors of past and present marked by endless blue plaques (to show where someone famous once lived). Spend an afternoon in Kenwood House or wake a stroll on Hampstead Heath to feel like you're worlds away from the hustle and bustle of London.

*Holborn*     
The old borough of Holborn (Ho-burn), which abuts the City southeast of Bloomsbury, encompasses the heart of legal London -- this is where you'll find the city's barristers, solicitors, and law clerks.

*Islington*     
This corner of North London has 'Upper Street' - a long road of boutique stores and numerous restaurants and bars. There's also Camden Passage antique shops near Angel tube.

*Kensington*     
Kensington is a fashionable residential area on the south side of Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace. There are still enough attractions to support a good selection of hotels, pubs, B&amp;Bs, cafes, and restaurants. South Kensington has the 'Big Three' museums: V&amp;A, Natural History Museum and the Science Museum.

*King's Cross*     
Long a seedy area in the heart of London, King's Cross is facing a massive regeneration program. Millions of pounds are going into its decaying infrastructure. The area is still far from chic, but was given renewed importance with the arrival of Eurostar, the Channel Tunnel Rail Link coming into St. Pancras instead of Waterloo. Because of this change in venue, it's estimated that some 50 million passengers will pass through King's Cross annually. Six tubes now convene underneath King's Cross Station, and it is the number-one connection hub enabling visitors to get to and from Gatwick and Heathrow airports.

*Knightsbridge*     
One of the priciest and most exclusive areas in London known for upscale shops and restaurants. The stores are luxurious and the homes extravagant so walking through this area is a pleasure. Spend a couple hours exploring Harrods and then stop into one of the many restaurants or cafes to relax your sore feet.

*Mayfair*      
The most upscale neighborhood in central London, Mayfair is home to elegant hotels for affluent foreigners and many impressive 18th century residences for people of fabulous wealth, plus the US Embassy in London. Discover first-class shopping at exclusive shops along Bond Street.

*Notting Hill*      
Come explore the retro shops, cafe life, designer boutiques, and antique stalls of Portobello Road Market. The year-round spot where the young, artsy folks live and hang out, and if you're here in August, this hip district is taken over by the world famous Notting Hill Carnival which brings a Caribbean flavor to the streets.

*Soho*      
Soho fuses the trendy and grungy to create a hip neighborhood that lives a vibrant double life. Still a Red Light district, it also provides a respectable drinking and dining area. Soho is a confusing grid of streets crammed with restaurants. It's a great place to visit, but you probably won't want to stay here

*South Bank*      
Just across from Westminster, don't miss the London Eye (a gigantic wheel offering unrivaled views of the city) and the newly-refurbished Royal Festival Hall which is part of the South Bank Centre. See the skateboarders under the Royal Festival Hall and visit the South Bank Book Market under Waterloo Bridge. Loads of free entertainment every summer: music, theater and performances.

*Southwark*      
Shakespeare still appears at the famous Globe Theatre while Tate Modern boasts a shining cultural program. Stroll the riverside to Lambeth Palace, the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury or pay homage to cricket at the Oval.

*Westminster*     
The British Empire, and once the world, was ruled from Whitehall. Royalty, government, and monumental London come together in the shadows of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Walk near the Kings and Queens buried in Westminster Abbey and take your own quiet stroll through St. James's Park and Green Park. Westminster also encompasses Victoria, an area that takes its name from bustling Victoria Station, ""the gateway to the Continent."" Many B&amp;Bs and hotels have sprouted up here because of the neighborhood's proximity to the rail station. Victoria is cheap and convenient if you don't mind the noise and crowds.

Welfare recipients occupy many hotels along Belgrave Road. If you've arrived without a hotel reservation, you'll find the pickings better on the streets off Belgrave Road.","1325377297"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I remember always liking Jimi Hendrix, and alwasy hearing he was the best, a super psychadelic monster that was invincible, and I believed it to some degree, but I guess I had just never totally understood the utter reverence that so many people had for him.

One day, I met up with some friends at the beach who were all tripping, and one of them casually asks if I want to as well. It was a beautiful sunny day on the San Juans in Washington, on a rocky coast with seals dipping in and out, and starfish everywhere. I decided to do it. Well, after spending some time with them, the sun started to go down, and they all began to head on, but I realized my trip was just beginning. I made my way home alone, decided to play some music as the trip took hold and thus began my moment with Jimi.

I made my way slowly into my friend's room, which was still somewhat dark. I could hear things crawling and creaking on my peripherals, my vision swam with color and things gently breathed all around me. I sat down the couch and saw my roomie's guitar hooked up to the amp. I grabbed it, and in so doing touched his computer which had been left on. Immediately, a Jimi Hendrix playlist that he had been jamming along with began to play, the guitar already set in tune, with perfect crunch. I looked up, and lo and behold the moonlight had begun streaming through a window covered by a cloth wall hanging of Jimi hendrix himself. 

His lines, his rhythms, his playing suddenly all made totaly sense to me. He weaves this incredible psychadelic pattern that is amazing colorful and delicate. You can hear two or even three gutair parts weaving in and out of his playing effortlessly while he plays. It drives itself directly to your core, and explodes with joy and light. 

I don't know how long I was there playing with Jimi, but I'll never forget it, it really opened my eyes to what Psychadelic music really was, and the power music can have over a person who has a gift like that.

Luckily, there are MANY wonderful musicians with that gift.","1325377306"

There are multiple political moves that could have been used to remove the offending language. A veto is only one option the president has; he also has a senate, that last I checked had a majority of democrats.

Additionally all of his major moves have shown that he is a president that does not value civil liberties; that he is a president that has aggressive (but silent) foreign policy. He has openly assassinated US citizens; invaded sovereign countries to assassinate OBL; carried out attacks in Pakistan (drone strikes); reauthorized the Patriot Act; kept Gitmo open; bombings in Libya; increasing sanctions on Iran that can only lead to military conflict.

You can claim these are all things highlighted by the Republicans to disenfranchise his base, but there is little in Obama's foreign policy that has the markings of progressive, liberal policies. The only thing that he could be credited with is withdrawal from Iraq (it could be argued that he was forced to do by the Iraqi's not by his own choice).

I don't buy the argument that he had no choice. This bill fits very well with his foreign and domestic doctrine.  ","1325377312"

It is hit/miss depending on the map though - some maps are great, village is fun, dome is straight rape, bakaraa is really good - some suck - arkaden blows, seatown is dependent on game type and enemy spawn location.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I recommend that people don't make resolutions.  They fail for a reason: because most people that only commit to stuff once a year typically aren't disciplined enough to follow through.  Instead, set three goals.  Only three.  Any more spreads your attention too thin, any fewer is a bit too easy.  The goals should be specific, measurable and achievable...although you should be stretching yourself a little bit.  None of this ""lose weight"" or ""eat better"" bullshit.  That is notoriously fails.  Me and my wife's for example:

1. **Get healthy and get fit.**  My wife is starting cancer chemotherapy in a couple of weeks, so my goal is to get her through that and to the other side as gracefully as possible.  After that (when she's up to it) we'll work up to doing P90X again (she's done it for 2 years...very hot, fit woman) with the goal of getting her back to her current level of fitness by the end of next year.

2. **Eat cleaner.**  Fish at least once/week, reduce our processed food intake to &lt; 15% of our food intake (the American average is 60%), eliminate preservative-containing food and eat one extra serving of fruits and veggies per day.
3. **Finish implementing my home security plan.**  I made a lot of progress in protecting my family financially, accumulating emergency savings and creating emergency supply stashes last year.  This year I want to create a video of my house for insurance purposes, evaluate the need for a house alarm and power generator and buy at least 1, hopefully 2-3 more guns an ammo.

Every year after Christmas, my wife and I sit down and evaluate how we did on our goals and set new ones.  I've found that having specific things to accomplish that you can check off motivates me to get them done.

I'm curious about one thing, though:

&gt;something more do-able then quitting smoking or giving up dark soda.

2.) Paul the angry old man. Angry old man wears the same dirty clothes everyday and threatens the young girls that work the cash registers. He's threatened to send ""his boys"" to kill a 17 year old employee multiple times. He's still allowed in the store.

3.) Bertie and Cody: The old lady with the chihuahua service dog. She's just awesome and puts the poor thing in her scooter and he looks like he's sick of dealing with her. It's adorable though. 

4.) Lisa, the down-syndrome girl that does nothing but have internal conversations with herself, but vocalizes them in public. She doesn't buy anything, but walks around the store for several hours talking to herself. I'm assuming she might have a touch of dementia. She doesn't have anybody with her, ever. I assume she comes from the same group home as Kyle since they are always in at the same exact time. I'm actually pretty worried they're just dropping people off at our store as a baby-sitting service. Lisa is completely harmless though.

5.) Duke, the homeless man. He runs around the store screaming at associates that he could do their jobs better (he's usually drunk.) He smells of beef jerky and camp-fire smoke, and the smell lingers for hours. 

Also, to the downvotes... I assume it's because of Kyle and Lisa. We're a retail shop, not a place where you can just abandon the significantly disabled for several hours, and then come back later. Our only resource is to call the police if they start throwing things or hurting people. We have NO idea who to contact and how to deal with situations like these and we aren't sure which group home in the area is abandoning them. I'm not being hateful. I taught special education, and this is dangerous as hell. Kyle especially is not capable of being on his own and has cornered people while fondling himself.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well, here's the rub: it's not really sensible to talk about the mass of an individual *bound* nucleon; the mass you refer to (where a proton weighs a little less than a neutron) is for a *free* neutron or proton.

When nucleons come together to form a nucleus, the process gives off energy -- and the system loses a corresponding amount of mass (E=mc^2). So if you think about the ""mass"" of a proton in a carbon-12 nucleus, it is smaller than for a hydrogen-1 nucleus (i.e. a free proton). This is what is referred to as the ""mass defect"" and, when you convert it to energy, indicates the ""binding energy"" for the nucleus (which is the energy it would take to blast the nucleus apart into its component free nucleons).

So what you should think about is that when you have a beta decay, the creation of the emitted particle consumes a fraction of the energy released by moving a nucleon (and thus the nucleus) to a lower energy state. The rest of that energy is usually carried off as kinetic energy (of the beta particle/neutrino/nucleus/Auger electron) and/or a gamma ray.

In fact, this interchange of mass and energy is what enables us to predict whether a nuclear decay will occur! If the decay decreases the total mass (of the nucleus plus any particles it emits), we know that it also releases energy and thus is moving ""downhill"" towards a more stable system with a higher binding energy.","1325377341"

For comparison, Russia spends about 4%, and the UK about 3%. The reason the spending is so massive in absolute terms is that the American GDP is so large.

In fact, overall, American government spending is quite low, by the standards of the developed world -- you're not going to get Nordic-style services by diverting the military budget to social programs, because you don't have nearly Nordic-style budgets to begin with. So why are you so broke? Because you're not collecting enough taxes to cover even what you do spend. The US has damn near the lowest revenue in the developed world.

"BorderCollie","t5_2sof5","1 (female) and 6 (male). 

We rescued the male years ago from a mill that was being closed. He was in a 8x8 cage with about 20 other dogs and a wire floor, and never got any exercise. Several of the dogs were fully grown and he was still a puppy, and was trampled a lot, so he learned to be submissive and stay out of their way in order not to get hurt.

When we rescued him, we lived in a one bedroom apartment and took him for walks every day for exercise. It stayed that way for about three years of his life until we were able to get a house.

His life experiences seem to have made him very mellow. He's safe and happy now, but doesn't have the typical border collie energy that others do. We've had a couple other border collies since him, (one died of Parvo -- :'( -- we have no idea where she got it) and both of them have taken on his personality for the most part. You can get our female riled up, but by default she's calm and relaxed.

TL;DR: I've found that dogs take on the personalities of the dogs (and sometimes people) they are raised with. We have a calm BC that rubs that trait off onto other BC puppies.","1325377345"

"swtor","t5_2qxih","    How do you get PvE gear?

A good start is just to PvP and trade Warzone Commendations for Mercenary Commendation and buy CHAMPION GEAR BAGS (200/200 of each commendation). You can get lucky and get PvP modded gear that is ilvl 56 (mods). 
Otherwise crafting is really good, take green level 49 items and reverse engineer them to the artifact quality. Get really good rolls and you can get triple secondary stats on them- only really sacrificing a bit of the main stats. Which to be honest isn't super big deal losing 16 STR when you gain 36 PWR instead.


    What's a Flashpoint and how do you find them?

Flashpoints are instances that are 4-mans and have their own story and bosses, generally dropping better loot than quest rewards or crafting. You can find them in the Fleet stations, generally in the Drop Station of each larger ship. There are two on Ilum.


    What's the difference between a hardmode and a normal?

Boss ability wise there seems to be no difference between normal and hard-mode with the exception of a couple bosses now spawning adds. The major and most important difference is that every boss now gains an ENRAGE timer (+200% DMG). So most of the bosses become a DPS race and healers should be DPSing whenever possible (I recommend telling your tank to blow a cooldowns and bursting a good amount in that time frame). Most of the bosses are pretty easy and not super different from normal mode, some of their ability do not even increase in the amount of damage! Trash is much much more difficult, highly recommend CC. Anything with a bestial animal seems to do crazy amount of damage as well as the elite robots not being a joke.


    How do you get gear tokens?

Final bosses in hard-mode flash points drop Columi gear token which seems to be the early raid equivalent. Otherwise as stated above CHAMPION GEAR BAGs house the PvP gear which is an excellent as well as solo-able gear up process.


    How do you get PVP gear? (And highend PVP gear)

By doing Warzones! Stack up commendations (1000 is the current cap of every commendation it seems), while leveling and PvPing you can get an entire gear set from the Fleet PvP vendors at levels 20 and 40. If you have excess Warzone commendations convert it to Mercenary Commendations to prepare for an easier time gearing up at level-50. Gear bags contain either A) 3 Centurion Commendations B) 1 Centurion Commendation AND 1 Token for Champion level gear. Centurion commendations are used to buy the lesser Artifact gear for level 50. 
There is also two PvP dailies as well as two Weekly quests. (Win 3 Warzones &amp; 5 Warefforts for the daily.) (Win 9 Warzone &amp; 15 War efforts for the weekly) Completing these will give you 2 bags per day and 6 per week. War efforts is taking part of Ilum PvP which is the far West part of the planet, you must destroy the enemy tank walkers and their battle station (OR repair your turret at the base- there's a console at the base of the turret which fixes it)


    Where are the daily quest hubs?

You must finish your main class story to do dailies, at least I'm fairly sure. First hub is in Ilum, there is another hub on Belvaius- generally someone in fleet will have a new quest informing you they need aid at a certain planet.","1325377347"

In this case, /r/atheism has a unified front.  /r/atheism is also a subreddit of like-minded individuals.  I'm an atheist who doesn't subscribe to, or even visit, /r/atheism at all.

Also, to say that the limp-wristed, flamboyant gay guy doesn't exist is ridiculous.  There are definitely gay guys who fall in line with that stereotype.  A lot of stereotypes exist because there is truth in them.

You also, I think, misunderstand exactly why atheists are so hated.  The common person on the street has most likely not heard of Dawkins or Hitchens.  Bill Maher and Penn Jillette are entertainers, so I'm sure more people have heard of them, but they don't really think of atheism first when they think of them.  Bill Maher is a comedian.  Penn Jillette is an illusionist.

People hate and distrust atheists because many times, they feel that their religious background gives them some kind of monopoly on ethics and morality.  They think atheists can't care about something bigger than themselves (which is wrong, we can, it just happens not to be a god), and therefore don't have any reason to have moral or ethical concerns.  Thus, they must be worthless and should not be trusted.","1325377359"

The only win/loss group that matters in this situation are the people. And I'm pretty sure we just got fucked. He's the president, don't tell me he's powerless. He has many avenues to get things done, such as previously mentioned, informing the public. He could have also vetoed it. Regardless of the backlash, and the lack of funding for the military, doing away with 3 amendments to the bill of rights IS MUCH WORSE!

MICRO EDIT: I realize I have forgotten years of classes on American history and government, many which informed me that a veto is not going to fling us into some state of unrest, and that the implied urgency is only there to convince us it had to happen. END EDIT.

He's not your buddy, he isn't on our side, start looking at him as the man with more power than anyone else in the world, and realize if he wants to, which he does since he requested the provisions, he could detain you for life due to whatever he sees fit as a reason. 

EDIT: I'd also like to mention, although my post is more feeling than thought, I spent a good month following this bill, have actually read it, and as such, know all the fancy revisions just made the wording more muddled. I encourage you to not be alienated by my inflammatory post, and instead, read the offending section of the law for yourself, as well as some analysis from lawyers. Seriously. Regardless of what you think about this issue, regardless of whether you normally research things before you opine on them, this is the time to do it. 

BIG EDIT: I've never had more posts to reply to than I have the time to, and honestly, I'm impressed, a lot of you know your history. Granted, a lot of you are treating this like a game of football. What matters isn't what is right or wrong, you and I, regardless of where in the world we are, are now in a struggle against worldwide tyranny, or far worse, the full on destruction of our only planet. You need to be aware that there is a lot of uncertainty to all of this. We aren't sure what any of these people are planning, just that their methods to reach their plans have moved away from the common interest of all humans. I do not know what will happen, as I've never witnessed tyranny first hand, all I know is that if we do nothing, we can assume the worst will happen. But, if we act now, and protest, and let those we interact with know how we feel on this issue, and debate, and discuss, and improve our thoughts, as we have been on reddit, we have a chance of turning the tide. The closest way to that solution I see now is what Occupy is, it's what the hippie movement was, it's a movement for human actualization, let's try to not fuck it up this time with the drugs and anti-establishment message, and make this a message all humans want to be a part of.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","From simple.wikipedia.org - 

Conductors usually beat time with their right hand. This leaves their left hand free to show the various instruments when they have entries (when they start playing) or to show them to play louder or softer. Most conductors have a stick called a ‚Äúbaton‚Äù. It makes it easier for people at the back of large orchestras or choirs to see the beat. Other conductors prefer not to use a baton. A conductor stands on a small platform called a ‚Äúrostrum‚Äù.
To be a good conductor is not easy. It is not just a question of giving a steady beat. A good conductor has to know the music extremely well so that they can hear any wrong notes. They need to be able to imagine exactly the sound they want the orchestra to make. They also have to communicate this to the orchestra so that they know what the conductor wants. Some conductors speak very little during their rehearsals. They make everything clear through the way they conduct.

In short, they are showing the musicians the beat of the song, and telling different sections when it's time for them to get louder or softer, or pointing out whether or not they are too loud or two soft, among many other things.","1325377369"

- The US is at war, has always been at war, with ~~Eurasia~~ terrorism, and the entire world is a battlefield subjected to the laws of war, as per the Patriot ActNDAA.

- NDAA says the US can jail or assassinate anyone without due process if they're suspected of terrorism, *unless they're American citizens*.

- H.R. 3166: Enemy Expatriation Act says if you're engaged in terrorism, you're no longer a US citizen.

So, let's say you're caught protesting or reading Noam Chomsky:

- That means you're engaged in (low-level) terrorism, during a time of war.

- That means you're no longer a US citizen.

- That means the US can jail or assassinate you without due process.","1325377390"

Amazing how much of this ""news"" has to be dug up from a quarter of a century ago and how short of an excerpt had to be pulled from a 156 page book. After reading it in context I believe it was a moot point made referring to property rights and existed among a cascade of political opinions which not surprisingly, were left out in this quoted text.

[To understand the context it's probably best to link to the actual book](http://mises.org/books/freedomsiege.pdf)  than to a very brief news article.

This book proceeded Paul's bid for President under the Libertarian banner. Most people who know his history understand he was wet behind the ears in those days. Likewise he was more outspoken than thoughtful. Obviously we currently we see a very different person in the man bidding for the same office.

""Each company of the Storm Corps is assigned to a major city in South Korea as a terrorism target. The target for Mr. Im's company was Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do. As Mr. Im belonged to the assassination brigade, his mission was to assassinate the mayor of Chungju. The other members of the company had such missions as overtaking the broadcasting stations, gassing major locations and demolishing buildings. According to Mr. Im, a special combat company is divided into a regular patrolling brigade and assassination brigade. Patrolling brigade takes relatively light missions like building demolition or reconnaissance, while the assassination brigade takes on missions of higher difficulty such as kidnap/assassination of important persons or releasing toxic gas.""","1325377396"

I'm on Reddit to expand my mind. Nitpicking formulation brings nothing to me.","1325377414"

The same with life, the same with the universe. No-one created the mountains, no-one created the stars or planets. They formed through natural forces, not a creator. The creation of the universe is still unknown, but given that everything we know has been shown to be created by natural forces.

I've worked on multi-million dollar feature films w/ directors that have no vfx-sense, and it's always a caustic situation -- a lot of time and money wasted when they could have shot it right the first time. You need to know what you can pull off in-camera, and what's worth doing in post. Zero budget = student work, so be smart, and subtle about what you're trying to accomplish.

Even in the correct subsection it's 1032(b) that was in the final bill that excludes US citizens and resident aliens. 1031 doesn't mention US citizens at all. The bill was also written in a manner where even the waiver can't apply since it only applies to 1032(a) paragraph 1 (which governs the criteria in paragraph 2). 

I analyzed the shit out of this bill.

EDIT: nvm, I believe you're talking about the signing statement. There was an editorialist that screwed up the sections and tried to destroy the syntax of the bill making it fit his belief. So anytime anyone says ""1021"" or ""1022"" I assume they're referencing that guy.","1325377437"

I think it's important that you focus on your leg strength and reaction time. Our goalies do land drills with tennis balls to work on their reaction time. For example, stand facing a wall, a few feet away, and get someone to stand behind you. Get them to toss the tennis ball at the wall so it bounces back towards you, and you can try to catch it. That will help you with your hand/eye coordination, and your reaction time. And they do leg strengthening with jumping drills in the water. For example, have your coach hold a stick, or pole above your head in the water, and have you jump to touch it while he moves it to different positions. As you get better he can move it higher/farther from you, and you can do it for longer periods of time.  

There are a lot of good American Universities that offer scholarships. If you're good (which I'm sure you are! :-) ) you'll get noticed with scouting. You could always make a highlight reel of some of your games. Get your parents, or a friend to video you playing and when you're getting ready to apply to University send those videos in!

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; I guess I'm just confused that he tried really hard to make me feel good and secure *at first*.

Mine did that too, and the result was that I hung on *way* longer than I would have otherwise. I knew he had it in him to treat me well -- I just knew it! I got into a pattern of thinking, if only I can just be good enough and do things right enough, he'll start treating me well again.

The truth is that with a real partner, *you do not have to earn basic kindness and respect*. This is key. You BOTH get those things, right off the bat and for the duration of the relationship. Anyone who cannot manage basic, kindergarten-level kindness is not being a real partner to you, and you leave.

I had trouble with the same thing you did: if he treated me so well right at the beginning, why couldn't we just go back to that?! Honestly, I never figured out why he thought it was okay to bait me with kindness and romance and then treat me poorly. But with time, I realized that his behavior would never make sense to me, because I want the people I date to feel good. Basically, I figured out that I'll never understand why he was a huge asshole *because I'm not a huge asshole*.

Don't be scared. You'll feel better; you'll be more confident about how your partners are supposed to treat you in the future. Take this night alone to make yourself feel really good, and just remember that anybody who doesn't *want* you to feel really good can suck it. :-)

"politics","t5_2cneq","that was an atrocious attempt to excuse Obama's actions.  a world-class example of confirmation bias applied to politics.

instead of vetoing the bill (which he can do REGARDLESS of how many Senators/Representatives voted on the ORIGINAL copy of the bill - overriding a veto requires the bill to go through Congress **twice**) and taking his case, about how the bill dismantles the right of due process, to the PEOPLE, for their consideration, Obama signed the bill and attached an unconstitutional signing statement in order to make vague statements about how he doesn't intend to enforce the bill's worst provisions.

/r/politics, THIS IS THE FUCKING PROBLEM.  you sit here and bitch about the Republicans, but only 14 Senators voted against this bill.   **a majority of both parties voted in favor of it.  Obama is not trying to help you, and there is no logical way to interpret his actions here into something that shows that he is.**

**why are you making excuses for this liar and criminal when he's actively stripping you of your rights, making no attempt to stop the process, and making totally nonsensical excuses for it at the same time?**

this is everything that's wrong with reddit.  here, in this thread.  1000 upvotes for that moron up there, who can't string together a congent political analysis without reverting to some bullshit about Democrats vs. Republicans.  we're seriously supposed to believe that Obama can't just address the people and say, ""i chose to veto those bill because it authorizes depriving people of their civil liberties, please contact the Congressional representatives who voted for it to express your disapproval and withdraw your support""?  

what a fucking load of shit.

it's times like this that i'm ashamed to even use this website.  you people need to get some fucking perspective.  you may think you're big ""rebels"" for opposing some single law that comes out of the government, but none of you seem to have any fucking idea how this system works - if you did, you wouldn't be dumb enough to believe any of the lies coming out of the Obama administration.

they are working together to screw you over.  all these fake little political battles?  those are there to make you think someone's on your side.  and right now, you people are piling your support behind one of the biggest criminals there is right now.

It does take time to become familiar with Skyrim's combat system, but it's doesn't take *that* long. All I do is stay far away, aim, and fire. You can become well versed at that after your first day of Skyrim.

And yes, I am a sneaky archer. I have 390 health and 260 stamina, or something along those lines. Archery perks: stagger, double archer damage, slowing time, and quick shot. 100 archery, 100 sneak.

"Songwriters","t5_2qtpz","My ""riff-to-full song"" ratio is pretty bad as well. I don't know how many riffs/melodies/voicing-ideas/grooves/rhythms/etc and other unfinished ideas I've got sitting around. If I were able to actually extract it all and put it on one place...it's be this massive mess of shit. Overwhelmingly uncompleted. Hell, even full songs, things I called complete, I've ended up trashing and deciding I want no part of anymore. And, if I were to go as far back to all the stuff I wrote in my teenage years, dear god... It's all part of being an artist. 

I think one of the biggest traps I've found myself in as a songwriter is occasionally getting too focused on something. Thinking I have to use something in a certain way, it really limits me. Getting so married to an idea that I can't be free to change it (potentially making it better) or look past it enough to add to it really cripples me. 

I think the thing that has helped me get past this sort of problem has been sort of a, ""make it happen, it'll either be trash or it won't,"" attitude at times. Not to force yourself, but don't let yourself get stuck because you've got something that is so awesome or so different or so specific that nothing else will work with it. 

Baby steps are okay. Just start fleshing out what you can, or trying anything new that you can. If it feels like you're building something very organically, that's great, but it's okay if it just feels like you're smashing ideas together too. Of course that's something you'll want to get away from, but sometimes it works out well. And remember, there's no such thing as ""too short"" or ""too long."" You know what's what, trust yourself.

Don't be afraid to commit to something and keep going. Even if it's not the best thing in the world, keep building. You can refine it later. Just don't trap yourself with nothing.

A decent gaming computer can last 3-4 years if you are ok with turning down settings eventually. It also tends to match consoles.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, lets see... I like you settled for the idea to go to DeVry for Business and Finance right out of high school... I actually ducked out of that at the last minute and realized that I really enjoyed making the stupid jackass videos and skate videos that me, my brothers and friends made like, EVERY DAY.  Fast forward about 3 months, and I am in Community College for ""Media Design and Production""  The next two years were basically wasted money, because my teachers didn't know shit, and I ended up not graduating, but instead pursued a freelance career in Video Production and worked on a Seattle radio show.  

Fast forward another 6 years, and I am now finding myself getting kind of tired of the freelance game, and wondering about finding a new career.  Considered the military, insurance, sales, and multiple other avenues, but I really don't know.  

So my point is, I don't know if you are really ever sure what you want to do for the rest of your life, just do what makes you happy for the time being, and if you are awesome at it... it will work out.  For all you know, you could follow your dream of say... running a restaurant, get really lucky and get a killer Venture Capitol investor, run that shit for 5 years, and get burnt out on it, because, hey... that might not be what you wanna do forever.  Some people can't do the same thing forever.  Like me... 

I have like 8 different things I do to supplement income, all of which I am pretty good at, but if I get tired of doing one, I focus on marketing my other 7 abilities and rock those for a while, then I come back.  Obviously this isn't the same situation for you, but I figured I would just put in my two cents... 

Good luck on whatever you do, but just make sure you are happy.  Because if you aren't happy, your family won't be happy, and it will bleed into your work and your homelife.    That is the best advice I can give you.   :)","1325377503"

Browsers and mail clients tend to be fine.  Anything else is a crap shoot -- and by that I'd include VoIP/IM clients (including enterprise-grade VoIP/IM) and games (relevant to IPv6 in the home).  Server-side software tends to be better about support, in my experience.

On the hardware side, routers (getting better), printers (getting pretty good!), NAS, IP cameras, and of course home entertainment systems (PVRs, stereo equipment, game consoles) are very slow on the IPv6 uptake.

The situation on both sides improves every year, but IMO the vast majority of networks aren't ready for IPv6-only unless there's a very limited set of software/hardware involved.","1325377504"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","no, not really.  Most of the games I play end up being two 8 or 9 points, and one 7 or fewer.  However, it's usually very easy to tell who is going to have the 10 points.  A few things I've gathered over many games:

People who get development cards generally win.  The more you have, the easier it is.

The robber helps the player with development cards win.

The player with development cards is also often the player who can get cities easiest.

There are 2 (and sometimes 4) points that often rapidly change hands 2/3rds of the way through the game (longest road and largest army).  It's usually easy to predict this.  For example, the longer a development card sits in front of someone, the more likely it is to be road building/monopoly.  At least, with my group.

Trading becomes much less... innocent, the more frequently you play with someone.  There are 3 or 4 people I play with who are very, very cagey with their cards at this point.  We rarely will trade 1 resource for just 1 other.  It's usually at *least* 2 for 1.  This is heavily influenced by who has the best position (not who is *currently* leading).

Finally, if you aren't first or second to secure a solid position on the board, you are likely out of the running for the game unless you get very, very lucky.

----

&gt;who can make the most devious trades at the end

We almost never trade with people who have 8 points.  It's too easy to give them a win by accident.  The only exception is when trading gives you a victory first (which means they won't trade with you...)

&gt;find the most creative way to get that last point.

There are really only two ways: development cards, or brute force.  Brute force is just out spending your opponents; lots of cities, settlements, and roads (for longest).  This is harder when people realize what you're doing and robber you up.  Dev cards you've been planning for several rounds, and everyone already is wary of you.  You probably have largest army, a road builder card, maybe a monopoly...  It's harder to defend against.

I probably play too many boardgames... this post ended up being longer than I intended.  :D","1325377507"

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","10 years ago, I told my friends on IRC and my real life friends, made plans with my best friend so I would have somewhere to move if telling my parents turned out bad.

Sat my mother down while my dad was at a union meeting.  Told her I had a secret, she got worried.  Told her I liked guys, she sighed, then said ""Oh I already knew that.  I thought you were doing cocaine!"" (apparently I had been a nervous wreck for a few weeks while I was deciding what to do)

Mom told me she would talk to Dad first, since she wasn't sure how he would react.  I went to work for the night, Dad picked me up at work in the morning, I just said ""You talked to mom?"" ""Yes"" ""Okay, everything okay?"" ""It's fine"" and that was pretty much it.

My dad had a hard time with it for a long time.  At one point I asked for generic relationship advice and he fled the room covering his ears (literally).  I got my folks together on the couch that night and flat out said if either of them didn't care to know about my life I was happy to just not talk about it any more.  Mom cried, Dad got upset and apologized, then Mom gave Dad the evil eye.

Ten years later, my whole family is okay (or flat out happy), Dad is my go-to guy for advice.  Mom still admits not being a grandmother will be sad (though I've assured her I might adopt if my partner and I both want to).","1325377508"

"Terraria","t5_2sg5b","I can't help going in depth too much:

Generally at that point you'll be ready for the Corruption. Hopefully you have gotten a grappling hook by this point, as the chasms in the corruption will just be plain annoying without one. The key ingredient is the hook, which is a frustratingly rare drop (like 2%) from Skeletons and Piranhas. 

The boss in the Corruption is called Eater of Worlds and is summoned by destroying 3 Shadow Orbs, which are floating balls that spawn at the bottom of the Corruption (they're super obvious when you see them). They can be broken with a hammer. The only snag is that they tend to be in their own mini caves and the Corruption is made of Ebonstone blocks, which you can only mine with a Nightmare pickaxe or better, which you can only craft once you've killed the Eater of Worlds! (He drops shadow scales, which are necessary to make almost all Demonite equipment). Luckily, Bombs and Dynamite still blow up Ebonstone, and you've probably found a bunch of those from pots and chests already. 

Alternatively you can craft a summoning item for him like the Suspicious Eye, but you'll probably want to get items from the Shadow Orbs anyway. When you break Shadow Orbs an item will fall out - either a Musket, a Ball O' Hurt, a Vilethorn, a Starpower Band, or an Orb of Light. Vilethorn is a spell which I find to make this boss laughably easy. However, you'll need mana to use it. For that you'll need to craft 10 Fallen Stars into a Mana Crystal, which gives you 20 max mana just like the Crystal Hearts you can find underground give you 10 max health.

So, fighting the Corruption boss. I think you have to fight him at night but I honestly didn't ever check time of day and didn't have an issue. You'll be so far underground when you summon him that you can't do much in the way of an arena, but there should be a long horizontal corridor right above the shadow orbs. The boss is just a huge version of those annoying burrowing worms, so you want to try to get in the air a bit to see him coming. Build a platform or find a naturally occurring one, it's not a big deal. Like I said, I find the Vilethorn to just destroy this guy. It basically makes a slow moving thorn that does a piddly 9 damage, but each piece of the thorn lingers for a few seconds. Each section of the boss has independent health, so if you shoot your vilethorn straight into his head as he comes at you (or just at a good angle so it goes pretty straight down his body) it will hit like 10-20 sections of him depending on his speed. This will wreck him quickly. The only issue is mana usage, and you'll run out until you start killing sections, but once you've done enough damage to kill sections they will drop items that restore 100 mana and you'll basically continually refill mana as you destroy him. If you do run out of mana you can just run up and smack him with a sword. Keep health potions to chug if you get hurt, but avoiding him isn't that hard.

You should get enough shadow scales and demonite from him to make full Shadow Armor, which is a big upgrade in defense from Gold armor, and to make a Nightmare Pickaxe. If you don't, just blow up 3 more shadow orbs and fight him again.

Also, killing shadow orbs has a chance to cause meteorites to fall. You can mine them with your Nightmare pickaxe to make Meteor Armor (which is low defense but has special attributes) and the awesome Meteor Hamaxe, which fuses your Hammer and Axe into one item and is way more powerful than the Demonite equivalents.

Okay, after that the Dungeon will probably be your next trek. I think you could do the Jungle at this point too, but the Dungeon gives you way more shit way more quickly.

To get in you have to fight Skeletor. Technically you can go in without killing him, but try it and see what happens ;). To fight him, you talk to the Old Man NPC out front of the dungeon entrance at night. This takes way less prep and ballyhoo than the last boss. Try to make a long, straight platform to fight him on. Generally I just level off the top of the dungeon and extend it with wooden platforms. If you have Shadow Armor your 15% movement bonus will allow you to stay away easily. The boss is a giant skull with two detached hands. He will float around swinging his hands at you most of the time, and will sometimes ""roar"" and then his head spins and flies at you. During this time his defense goes way down, I think, and he's super easy to hit.

If you've been fortunate enough to have a Goblin Invasion already you'll probably have a Harpoon, which is ridiculous for this guy. The Harpoon is a unique weapon because it autofires when you hold down the mouse button and it will fire the instant the harpoon returns to the gun (you'll know what I mean when you get one). This means you can stand next to something and hold down the attack button to attack it ~10 times a second. You can just run in front of Skeletor while he's spin-attacking you and rack up absurd damage.

If you don't have a harpoon, the easiest to get weapon is a Demonite bow with Unholy arrows (which are crafted from normal arrows and the worms' teeth dropped by Corruption enemies) or fire arrows. You can also go for guns. If you got a Musket from a shadow orb then an Arms Dealer will move into an open house. He sells the Minishark for 50 gold, which is a ton at this point in the game and will make it a pain to get for a new player. If you do get one you can use plain musket balls for ammo or you can craft meteor shot with musket balls and Meteor ore. The Minishark is an automatic gun that will demolish anything pretty quickly but eat through ammo. You can also craft a Space Gun with a flintlock pistol (sold by the arms dealer), meteorite ore and fallen stars. It's a gun that uses mana instead of ammo, but if you get full Meteor Armor it is free to use. That's a shitload of money and/or time, though, for something you can get done with a bow.

Once you've destroyed him, you can enter the dungeon. It's got a bunch of chests and a *ton* of enemies, traps, etc. You'll get some really cool stuff in there, though. At that point you can take on the Jungle or Hell. The Jungle offers some unique equipment, like an upgraded grappling hook, but hell offers Molten equipment.","1325377510"

1. Preheat pan for a long time on your oven's hottest non-broil setting
2. Roll out dough into the shape of the pan.
3. Fold dough or pick it up with a rolling pin.  Use corn meal or some spray to keep it from sticking to itself.  Unfold on the pan!  
4. Add other shit and bake.

If I fold the dough, I do it twice.  Another point, I make sure everything is immediately ready for assembly before taking the pan out of the oven so it doesn't cool too much.

1. NEVER point the gun at anyone loaded or not. Make sure when you hold it the barrel is always pointing at anything other than a person. 

2. Put the but of the gun against your shoulder and brace for recoil, also remember not to pull the trigger but to squeeze it. This will aid in the recoil. 

Take a good pot shot at the target brace for impact, but be relaxed, and you'll be fine.

Is that what happened?  Again, we don't have enough evidence to be confident.

Even if we had absolutely not the slightest clue, though, that's not a reason to posit that a god or godlike being did it.  Because we don't know the answer, or suspect the answer is x but don't fully understand it or have enough evidence to be confident, that doesn't mean the answer instead must be y, with no evidence and no way to even go about testing it.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","* **Lawful good - Fighting types**. Fight with honor/a sense of duty; they play 'by the rules'. There's a reason fighting is super effective against dark (that is, dark doesn't play by the rules). Moves are primarily physical based, which to me implies a sense of doing things the old fashioned way - the one who is the strongest makes the rules.

* **Neutral good - Flying types**. They're paired with almost every other type out there, implying they can get along with just about anyone. Resistant to fighting, so if they don't feel like going along with the rules, they can easily fight back. Several legendaries are flying types, so they can act however they wish too, on their own personal level rather than being bound to follow the rules.

* **Chaotic good - Dark types**. They play by their rules, not those set by others. Physical attackers, so they don't have to have a plan, just do any move and hope it hits. May not always get along well with the team, but they have their useful place. 3 Elite Four members use them, but no gym leaders - perhaps giving a sign of their usefulness, but also difficult part of being involved in a team.

* **Lawful neutral - Bug types**. The life of a bug is simple...larva-[cocoon]-final form. Grow quickly, and follow the order - no questions asked.

* **True neutral -** Probably **Normal types**. Since they aren't super effective against anything, it seems to be that they are just there, trying to make their way in the world.

* **Chaotic neutral - Psychic types**. They have the ability to do what they want, following their own desires, but can work well within a team. While generally good, their moves can be used for bad. 

* **Lawful evil - Electric types**. Can be harnessed to work and follow the rules, but has the ability to lash out and be extremely harmful depending on the situation. 

* **Neutral evil - Grass types**. Act pretty much in their own interests - while they may not necessarily look for a fight or to harm others, they're not opposed to harming others for their own gain. (ex: giga drain).

* **Chaotic evil - Fire types**. If the chaotic evil type is one that has no respect for anything, be it rules, lives, or whatever, I think fire fits the bill. It's out to destroy anything, burning up whatever will help fuel it's rage. There is no desire to help, only the goal to keep feeding itself in order to keep burning.","1325377557"

If you need to keep something in your room that she mustn't find and it's very small, here are some options:

* Hollow out a book you know she'll never read and keep it in there. If it's just paper, tape it to a page so it won't fall out when shaken. Be sure to use a book where one page sticking out won't be noticible for this latter technique.

* Tape it to the back of a drawer that isn't likely to fall out

* Put it in the bottom of some drawers, underneath the bottom drawer.

* Keep it between your mattress and box spring, and take it with you when you leave (good for keeping your mom from ""borrowing"" your money without permission)

Basically I'm trying to accomplish 3 goals here - 

1.  Learn about programming - as I said, I'm just starting to teach myself Python and I'd like to apply what I learn.  I'm open to switching to PHP for my web project, or learning both in parallel.

2.  Get a money-making website off the ground reasonably quickly - This is going to start off as a personal finance site that's mainly just blog-like content.  At the beginning, Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, or even just static HTML would probably be fine to get it off the ground.

3.  Integrate more advanced features into the site down the road - As I learn more about programming and WebDev I would like to add more functionality to the site, for example XML product and coupon feeds, dynamic content generation based on site-search queries, possibly a tracking/rewards system for users who use the site frequently, etc...  I'm guessing this is where my choice of platform will have the most impact?

How hard is Drupal to learn vs. Wordpress?  Will it allow me to grow the site bigger in the long run?  (That would make a steeper learning curve worth it to me.) ","1325377602"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","""I promise you there are times where your current method is utterly impractical to use though -- that's why we're teaching you both.""

Yo what I never understood is why don't teachers actually give more problems where it's impractical to use the other methods? If you truly understand the limitations and practical applications of the methods you are teaching, this should be easy.

For example, suppose you are teaching the application of calculus to finding minima and maxima. If you ask me to find the minimum of the function x^2 - 2*x + 1, obviously I wouldn't bother to use calculus, I would immediately recognize that it factors as (x-1)^2. Instead, you should ask me to find the minimum x^3 + 3x^2 + 5 on the interval [-1,1] or something. 

Here's another example: Solve the equation sin(x) + cos(x) = k. Yes one method is to write cos(x) in terms of sin(x) and do out the algebra and quadratic formula. But suppose the student is clever and realizes that you may rewrite the left side as sqrt(2) * sin(x+pi/4). Then he just needs to solve sin(x+pi/4) = k/sqrt(2) which is much easier. 

Basically I disagree with penalizing students for using correct methods that work. If you want them to use a certain method you should give them problems that are more suited to that method.

Also, a bit of criticism, when you're panning around during a teamfight, the mouse moving around gets distracting.  Using Mouse3 to pan would be a lot less 'noisy'.

Other than that, I'm pleased with your casting.  I would love a little more genuine conversation during the lulls in the game as opposed to the sarcastic, 'here's the most exciting part of the game as we watch xxx farm.'  Just a quick question to the player you're casting with about anything, it doesn't even need to be about the game, just something more exciting than watching Vayne farm.

The government is afraid of the people, but now they have the warmth of knowing the military can legally hold Americans who get out of line.  Something about the idea of legal warms them.  And they never needed a majority of supporters to pass it, just a majority of congress members who don't listen to their constituents.  Congress was represented, not the people.  Corporations had their hand, but now Congress holds ultimate power.

How long after several of them disappear, accused of terrorism, will it be until the law is opposed?  And how do we reveal congressional terrorists to the right people?

agreed for the most part that JK/SW are underpowered, though after respeccing at 50 I am usually top damage every single pvp match, and sentinels get nice party buffs, a couple cc, and ""guarded by the force"" which gives 50% of your HP for 99% dmg reduction for 5 sec. AMAZING for holding a node extra til someone else gets there or giving a healer time to heal you again. I'm not even fully geared yet. Usually doing between 200-350k right now. Only 1 pvp item so far. =P

But yes, my spec is extremely hard to play and very based on watching focus and using abilities in a specific order/etc/etc....not at all easy like all the other classes that can just button mash or spam knockbacks and lightning.

And guardian/jugg get better at 50 too. I'd spec tank though as if properly specced/geared/guarded and have heals on them they are a bitch to kill.","1325377655"

Boomers were the first generation after WWII. They grew up in an age of hope and were relatively happy when compared with the prior generation.

In general, I think that boomers represented a period of plasticity and hygiene - at lease in their early years. Death wasn't so much of a thing of the past as it was something to be put off by science.

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","I think this article demonstrates a pretty limited understanding of the X-Men mythos. The whole concept of mutantkind was developed 1) as an easy and convenient way of creating a whole lot of super-heroes without convoluted origin stories and 2) as an allegory that can fit pretty much any minority group in America. Yes, the X-Men fight to save a world that ‚Äúhates and fears them,‚Äù but if all mutants came pre-equipped with overtly aggressive powers, there‚Äôs not much of a story in defending the group, is there? They wouldn‚Äôt need the protection and influence of the X-Men if being a mutant meant you were a preshrunk asskicking machine.

That‚Äôs the whole point of Charles Xavier, and it drives the occasional moral ambiguity of his mission, and its relation to Magneto‚Äôs. He, like Magneto, recruits young mutants, takes them under his tutelage, and trains them to weaponize their mutant powers for his own agenda. His agenda is inherently benevolent and peaceful, which separates him from Magneto, but his methods are very similar. Until Planet X that is, which is a vastly UNDERRATED X-Men story. It accomplished two important things. First, it clearly and fundamentally delineated Xavier‚Äôs morality from Magneto‚Äôs megalomania. At the end of the day, Magneto is the primary antagonist to the X-Men, and Morrison brought his violent agenda to its logical conclusion. Planet X was always Magneto‚Äôs end-game, the extermination or subservience of mankind to its mutant successors. It just took getting mixed up with mind-altering drugs and personality-altering bacterial consciousness to drive the morally ambiguous Magneto to this decidedly evil mission. And why is there any problem with Magneto using power-enhancing drugs? He didn‚Äôt know what Kick was ‚Äì no one did. His mutant utopia was butchered, he was paralyzed, and the fate of mutantkind looked more dangerous than ever. It was time for both Magneto and Professor X to rethink and reapply their worldviews in extreme ways; Professor X went public and launched the X-Corporation as a multinational peacekeeping force, and Magneto planned his most devastating and deadly terrorist attack to date. And he did so by the means available to him, which meant augmenting his powers and infiltrating the X-Men, his most frustrating opponents. How is taking Kick any different than using Fabian Cortez‚Äôs powers to enhance his powers while destroying his body, as he did under Chris Claremont in the 90s? Same principle.

Second, it established a new dynamic which broke the binary opposition between Xavier and Magneto. Their dueling visions of mutantkind‚Äôs future dominated the X-Men mythos since its inception; Morrison showed the inherent flaws in Magneto‚Äôs violent resistance, as well as Charles Xavier‚Äôs passive idealism. There‚Äôs room for additional, morally ambiguous, subjective interpretations of mutantkind that transcend good versus evil or domination versus subservience. Morrison opened the floodgates for new stories and ideas, which were promptly closed by less creative and progressive writers and editors who decided to undo all the significant changes Morrison had brought to the X-Men.

Characters like Beak, without clearly developed offensive powers, are representative of this new dynamic. Yes, under the training of Charles Xavier, he was beginning to hone his unfortunate mutation and master the power of flight. (We saw in Here Comes Tomorrow that continued evolution and training created Beak the super-hero). But by his own admission, he refused to be ‚Äúanyone‚Äôs soldier.‚Äù You have to accept a place in the stories for characters like
Beak who are simply uninterested in the seemingly endless power struggle between Xavier and Magneto, and who aspire to a different, simpler dream. Likewise, you have to allow for the possibility of revolutionaries like Quentin Quire, whose views clash with Xavier‚Äôs and are even more extreme than Magneto‚Äôs.

Morrison contributed a lot of terrific stories to the X-Men mythos, ones that embraced every aspect of its legacy, from the crazy space-operas to the evolutionary struggle. In the process, he opened to door to a lot of potential new stories, an opportunity that, in my opinion, has not been taken advantage of.

Tl;dr: Grant Morrison may have provided a lot of unpopular shakeups to the X-Men mythos, but all of these shakeups were pretty logical extensions of existing trends, characters, and dynamics.  And, not to be snobby, but anyone who hasn't read The Invisibles isn't going to understand Morrison anyway, and should do so for his own wellbeing.","1325377671"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Question: ""Why pray? What is the point of prayer when God knows the future and is already in control of everything. If we cannot change God's mind, why should we pray?""

Answer: For the Christian, praying is like breathing. It is easier to do it than to not do it. We pray for a variety of reasons. For one thing, prayer is a form of serving God (Luke 2:36-38) and obeying Him. We pray because God commands us to pray (Philippians 4:6-7). Prayer is exemplified for us by Christ and the early church (Mark 1:35; Acts 1:14; 2:42; 3:1; 4:23-31; 6:4; 13:1-3). If Jesus thought it was worthwhile to pray, we should also. If He needed to pray to remain in the Father‚Äôs will, how much more do we need to pray?

Another reason to pray is that God intends prayer to be the means of obtaining His solutions in a number of situations. We pray in preparation for major decisions (Luke 6:12-13); to overcome demonic barriers (Matthew 17:14-21); to gather workers for the spiritual harvest (Luke 10:2); to gain strength to overcome temptation (Matthew 26:41); and to obtain the means of strengthening others spiritually (Ephesians 6:18-19). 

We come to God with our specific requests, and we have God's promise that our prayers are not in vain, even if we do not receive specifically what we asked for (Matthew 6:6; Romans 8:26-27). He has promised that when we ask for things that are in accordance with His will, He will give us what we ask for (1 John 5:14-15). Sometimes He delays His answers according to His wisdom and for our benefit. In these situations, we are to be diligent and persistent in prayer (Matthew 7:7; Luke 18:1-8). Prayer should not be seen as our means of getting God to do our will on earth, but rather as a means of getting God's will done on earth. God‚Äôs wisdom far exceeds our own.

For situations in which we do not know God's will specifically, prayer is a means of discerning His will. If the Syrian woman with the demon-influenced daughter had not prayed to Christ, her daughter would not have been made whole (Mark 7:26-30). If the blind man outside Jericho had not called out to Christ, he would have remained blind (Luke 18:35-43). God has said that we often go without because we do not ask (James 4:2). In one sense, prayer is like sharing the gospel with people. We do not know who will respond to the message of the gospel until we share it. In the same way, we will never see the results of answered prayer unless we pray.

A lack of prayer demonstrates a lack of faith and a lack of trust in God‚Äôs Word. We pray to demonstrate our faith in God, that He will do as He has promised in His Word and bless our lives abundantly more than we could ask or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). Prayer is our primary means of seeing God work in others' lives. Because it is our means of ‚Äúplugging into‚Äù God's power, it is our means of defeating Satan and his army that we are powerless to overcome by ourselves. Therefore, may God find us often before His throne, for we have a high priest in heaven who can identify with all that we go through (Hebrews 4:15-16). We have His promise that the fervent prayer of a righteous man accomplishes much (James 5:16-18). May God glorify His name in our lives as we believe in Him enough to come to Him often in prayer.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Why not organize his political base, so people who actually liked and voted for him knew what was going on, straight from the source? Do it over and over until the message sinks in. Then these people would have been defending him today, instead of washing their hands of him. This is politics 101. Communicate with your people.

Right, so he should do this with every bill that people feel strongly about, at least the big ones.  Like SOPA and NDAA and spend tons of resources essentially spamming his voting base about what he's doing while he's doing it.  Of course, then we'd find something he didn't comment on (enough) and claim he's hiding something... When people refuse to read three paragraphs on Reddit, getting them to read reasoned arguments on bill after bill after bill isn't happening.  The people who'd do that could actually read the bill themselves or find individuals who go through the bill from other places, like Reddit.

There's very little Obama could offer more than rubberstamping some of the explanations posted here on the thoughts behind 1021(e) and his analysis of how he disagrees with people like Greenwald.  The problem is, he'd be called a liar and a shill and then have to keep doing this over and over again.  While trying to keep the process of solving the bill itself going along.  

Let's be honest about it, if the problem at this point is a lack of communication and not the bill itself, it could be a tad worse.  Maybe people should realize that the President doesn't have infinite time and resources, just like the rest of us.  It's nice and easy to reduce politics to ""they want a fascist state"", ""Ron Paul 2012"" and ""Obama is a Godsend"", but if one wishes to actually participate and converse about politics, invest time.

Fuck you and and go OD on something.  Better yet, stay alive and keep believing all this shit, so when you're on your death bed you'll have have a realization in your last moments -- that you will die a worthless piece of shit, and the only good you did in this world was also ruined because of you.

A sign that it was properly lit rather than only using natural lighting is that in the latter, there usually always is a blue-ish or orange tint. A good example of this is (forgive me for this!) the same difference between a professionally shot porn film and an amateur one. The am one will always have bad lighting, a distinct tint (blueish if daylight is used as a source, or orange if its lit by internal bulbs) and heavy cast shadows due to only one light source!

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","We seem to have already covered the original question, so here's something else...

&gt; If they were to get onto the front page with that type of view... the wrong or biased opinion could spread. We know it's not right, but some redditors do not.

&gt; The downvote button is just showing we don't like their opinion. If we downright hated their opinion we would respond trying to preach the truth, right?

I disagree. A well-thought-out, truthful response contains more information and has a better chance of success in stemming the hate than just a downvote. All a downvote says is ""I don't want people who sort by best to see this post,"" which is a lot shorter and perhaps poorer message than ""I want you to abandon this way of thinking because it is hurtful and/or inaccurate, but I want to be calm, loving and tolerant in my attempts to convince you,"" which can be expressed in a comment reply. Also, in terms of public perception: in the best case scenario, your downvote will prevent people from seeing an intolerant comment, which is good... with a comment response, however, the best case scenario involves not only transmitting the message seen above and successfully turning the commenter away from hating bronies (impossible with a downvote alone), but also conducting that conversation in public and letting haters and neutrals alike witness your argument and the positive way in which you make it.


* Best-case scenario (downvoting): The comment is hidden from view and no one reads it, preventing the opinion from spreading... but the original commenter sees their words hidden with no response, and their hate is only reinforced.
* Best-case scenario (commenting): The comment remains in view, creating the possibility of the opinion spreading, but your tolerant and more accurate response is the top reply, letting those who might agree with the original comment read *that* as well. In addition, the original commenter reads your response and is converted away from hatred, and this takes place in a public forum where it serves as an example to others.
* Worst-case scenario (downvoting): The commentor continues to hate, and their comment remains in plain sight.
* Worst-case scenario (responding): The commentor continues to hate, and their comment remains in plain sight, but so do your tolerant responses, which may still provide an example to others.

Given these possibilities, I conclude that responding is a better strategy overall. Discuss. Or don't. It's a free reddit.","1325377739"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","It's not that vagina size is preset, as vaginas do stretch, of course, but the depth and circumference of a vagina *before* being stretched is different from woman to woman (not vastly, except if there are health or developmental problems there), and so the maximum amount that it will stretch can vary somewhat.

My vagina used to stretch just fine, but since having had colorectal surgery, a pregnancy, and a rectouterine pouch abscess, as well as possible endometriosis...it just doesn't anymore. My boyfriend is 6 3/4 inches, and 5 1/2 around, and the length is painful to take, even if I don't take it all the way. Now if he goes slowly, it's not painful until after sex is over, and I sure as hell always WANT to take it all the way, but my vagina's opinion might be different from mine at that point.

I'm mad at my vagina right now, actually, because it's disagreeable. But I have a size preference, which may or may not be a dealbreaker in a hypothetical situation, depending on other factors of said relationship. I like a 6-7 inch long penis, and I like 5-6 inch girth. That is an optimal penis for me. My vagina is not optimal, though, and that makes life tough. My vagina is a bitch.","1325377741"

As far as casting I had never planned to get into it but it just happened so it is something I have to get myself to improve on as it's probably the hardest thing to do. Solo casting and making videos is MUCH MUCH easier than trying to duo cast and please everyone in a hectic live environment.

While there are men and women, it will always be a battle, and both sides need to be strong for progression.

The female side is always strong, just waiting for an opportunity, the male side is easily weakend in one way or another, and, as we see today, too weak to be a counter-balance to women and feminism (although that is changing, ironically, because women have become too strong, and the negative effects are being felt widely).

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Yes ""free ride"" to the event assuming they qualified for the live tournament. Still forced them to wake up at like 4AM-6AM to play their matches and at times wait around for players who never show up which affects their sleep schedule and in-turn their play in other leagues such as the GSL (JulyZerg I think it was woke up ~4am once only to wait around till 9am to find out his opponent wasn't going to show) which is complete BS.

Really wasn't worth it to them to sacrifice so much for such a small chance to ""win it all"" no matter what the NASL wanted to do in terms of flight and hotel compensation. It's just a poor format for foreign players not to mention the length of one season is twice that of GSL Code-S. I understand its the ""NORTH AMERICAN Star League"" but still, it gives too much of an advantage to NA players to force their opponents to wake up at ridiculous times just to get their games in along with having to play on NA which hinders them even more by having 200ms+ ping when they can focus on other tournaments such as the GSL which is way more prestigious. 

So lets be realistic for a minute: Koreans would be forced to play at ridiculous times, be forced to play on NA (even if their opponent agrees to play on KOR/EU) which gives them insane lag, Fly out to a 2-3 day tournament as late as the NASL decides (meaning if they gotta be there Friday the NASL can just book a flight for thursday or whatever) so they come in extremely jet lagged and tired and all of this for a tournament that runs TWO months (8-10 weeks) and has the same prize pool as the GSL... Oh, and did I mention it's also single elimination so ontop of being jet lagged, tired and the schedule taking it's toll on you for the last 8-10 weeks you also cannot afford to drop a series otherwise you've completely wasted your time.

Really, the NASL is a JOKE and the only reason they offered what they offered to korean players is because they know their viewership and competition level would be on the decline without them. And for those who say ""well look at S2, it had 45-50k viewers!"" Think about how many more viewers it would of had with players like boxer, mc, nestea and other BIG names.

A few examples from the beginning of the webpage:

-Calla lilies have an inflorescence consisting of a spathe and spadix. The white ""petal"" is not a petal but the spathe (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spadix).

-The genus Euphorbia has inflorescences with specialized structures, known as cyathia (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyathia) Again, the pink structures are not petals.

2. Calculating Defense: Each system uses a different defensive metric. fWAR uses UZR, while rWAR uses TotalZone (developed by Sean Smith). UZR is more accurate but is only available from 2002 onward, while TotalZone values can be calculated for any player in baseball history.

3. Baserunning: rWAR includes this, while fWAR doesn‚Äôt.

As a result of these differences, rWAR values typically come in lower than fWAR values, meaning a 6 rWAR is more impressive than 6 fWAR.

Here's the thing. I believe we are morphing into a society where learning lessons is frowned upon. A 16 year old girl will get fucked up at a party, get sick and not want her parents to know because she will be grounded etc etc. However, that is just aiding actions without consequences. 

The same, in my eye, is going for protesters today. Actions are being made and when consequences happen they get angry. This is because they are not used to consequences, they have been shadowed and shunned because getting away with things gives more of a high. 

Same can be said for Steam today. People are getting banned for trying to abuse the achievements and getting free games on separate accounts. This is against their rules and their main accounts are being banned without refunds. Broke the rules, got caught and expect the consequences to disappear. 

Rules are in place because Society at one point willed them and demanded them. They remain in effect until broken, however breaking them will have consequences. Bastardizing those who enforce the consequences isn't really appropriate since it is just a rebound of action.

What I find weird is that it's very common for indians to bad-mouth their politicians, being the embodiment of corruption they are. As for anti-religious censorship - well, in some ways of putting it, it's already there.

It is understood in physics that space and time came into being with the big bang. There was no before the big bang. There was no *before*, before the big bang. There can't have been a cause, because there was no time for it to do anything *in*. You can't have any action, any change, anything that goes from one state to another without time. For *anything* to happen, anything at all, time would first have to come into being. So it follows that the only thing that *could* happen in a spaceless/timeless/matterless/energyless void is something very much akin to the big bang, or the generation of a place for things to happen *in*.

If dev. gets picked by another player but settle doesn't then you need to get that replicant robots down and sacrifice the world. On the flip side if settle gets picked you're probably best served sacrificing the Replicant Robots.

You're only harming yourself if you're skipping phases picked by others early on without doing anything in order to gather cards.

I can't begin to tell you, my fellow Redditors, just how much that makes my Democratic Socialist head spin, but frankly Greenwald has laid it all out really well.  

Holy. SHIT!!!  

Seriously, my fellow Progressives, this blows my goddamned mind.  Take a look at my comment history to see that this is no Ron Paul shill account - in fact I just wrapped up a 2 day exchange with Ron Paul supporter arguing why he's a nutbag, etc.¬π  I still kind of think that, but now I think of all the choices, INCLUDING OBAMA, Ron Paul may just be the best thing we've got going.

I don't see him overall as being a Progressive's ideal, by any stretch of the imagination, but godDAMNit he actually is a lot more progressive than Obama.  Would I rather see Bernie Sanders as president - OF COURSE! - but that's never going to happen (he doesn't want the job for one thing).  I'm a Eugene Debs/Bernie Sanders Democratic Socialist.  I am not a fan of common Libertarian social stances.  But if Ron Paul were in office, I wouldn't be too worried about those things.

A President Paul would only be able to act unilaterally as Commander in Chief.  This means his social policy changes would require the endorsement of Congress - not likely to happen with a cohesive Progressive Caucus.  However as Commander in Chief, he could immediately withdraw troops from Afghanistan and other conflict areas (overt and covert), he could immediately declare an end to the ""War on Terror"", etc.  (*there is one potential downside to his doing this, but I'll footnote it below*. ¬≤)

All in all, I don't think he'd be as dangerous as we Progressives tend to view him (and yes, I still think his social positions are largely dangerous).  Moreover, if we allow Obama to continue on his path we only assure ourselves of a now known quantity.  Obama has been a very slick politician and has done SOME progressive things, but overall he's very easily more of a centrist than a progressive.  He has surrounded himself with his Goldman Sachs buddies, has signed the extension of the PATRIOT Act, has reversed his campaign promise to shut down GITMO, has authorized assassination of US citizens without trial (or even accusation), and today signed NDAA.

I still see Ron Paul as generally a nut on economic and social issues, but when laid out the way Greenwald has masterfully done here, I can honestly say there's actually a greater chance of my voting for Ron Paul now than Obama.  Half an hour ago you couldn't have convinced me of this.  Now (**for now**) I am virtually certain of it.

MIND = BLOWN  
___  
¬π I will be messaging this person to concede my newfound ""support"" for Ron Paul.  

¬≤ My big concern with **someone like Ron Paul** bringing home the troops en masse, is that where a progressive president would try to put them to work on infrastructure projects, ensure they have adequate support from the social safety net, and otherwise ""take care"" of them, I see Ron Paul potentially just letting them fend for themselves in keeping with his Libertarian views.

Hell, I'm depressed enough as it is too-- I don't like it when people say ""There's nothing to lose! Whats the worst that could happen?""

&gt;I feel as though WATMM has been getting smashed with listen posts, and that is why the weekly feedback thread exists. There is actually on link to the current one on the right side of the page right above the ad. Listen posts should go there, and the comment should start with the genre in brackets (i.e. [experimental electronic]) so people don't have to wade through a bunch of music they can't give decent feedback about.
There are a lot of cool articles and posts that are extremely informational that get passed over because there is too many ""[Listen] I made this yesterday, it's ok"" posts. There is a reason the feedback thread and r/thisisourmusic exist. If you are just looking for a place to post your work and don't necessarily need feedback, I'm not sure this is the place, but that is up to WATMM I guess.

Hearing peoples works are great, but the posts are becoming overwhelming.  Many times, the page is over run with ""[Listen] My song lol. [Listen] My dubstep remix where all I did was add bass. [Listen] How's my friend's brother's roommate's mix?""  If you are going to post something for serious feedback on WATMM, make sure it is your highest quality work.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","First off, PLAY IT.  Bioshock 1 is one of my top games of all time.  It's flawed, but it just oozes atmosphere and originality.  The first game has some really creepy moments.  The enemies like to stalk you, but you get pretty overpowered for combat so they're not that scary.

There is one part that always makes me jump, and I'm not gonna tell you where it is in the game (the anticipation will kill you).  At first I thought it was a really awesome random event, but I learned it IS scripted, and happens every time.  You find an item sitting somewhere, and it's an item you are going to pick up.  Other stuff is sitting around it.  The room is, as far as you can tell, completely empty and safe.  As soon as you pick up that item and turn around, there is someone right behind you, almost literally standing nose-to-nose with you.

I don't think they really made the argument that Al Queda doesn't exist. 

The argument was more that there was a small group of people led by Bin Laden and Al-Zawahiri, who hate the west and feel terrorist attacks against the west are justified.

The name ""Al Queda"" itself, may have come from the CIA, but once the name Al Queda was public, Bin Laden embraced it. There may not have been many, and the organizational structure in the 1990s may have been more complex or simply different, than is currently described, but their numbers certainly grew after 9-11.

How many there actually are, and what their capabilities are is an excellent question. Once that is established, perhaps we can argue what kind of fight we should have against it, if any at all.","1325377847"

Yes, two willing people. You keep going back to some seedy guy who's hanging out in bars with the express purpose of finding some smashed chick and taking her home to take advantage of her. This is not, by far, the only scenario that leads to drunken sex, which is what I was attempting to point out.

&gt; You do, all through your argument. Don't get drunk or you'll get raped.

Point me to a single statement from me that says this. Anything. I have stated repeatedly that being drunk *does not remove* one's ability to consent, but never that being drunk *equates to* consent.

&gt; I was refering to alcohol consumption. People should not be intimidated by fear of violence not to engage in legal activities.

There are people who don't drink because they become violent while drunk. There are people who don't drink because they act like idiots while drunk. By your logic, we should remove all responsibility for any actions taken while drunk, because nobody should be intimidated by fear of dealing with the consequences of their own actions to engage in legal activities.

There are people who don't drink because they sleep with anything that moves while drunk. And there's nothing wrong with that, it's called being responsible.

&gt; The facts are never known.

Using this logic, we can never convict or acquit *anybody* for *anything*, because there's no way we could possibly know for certain what actually happened. Just because we don't know the specifics of this particular event (which I mentioned above) doesn't mean that one can never know what happens to anybody at any time. And once again, your statement goes both ways. If I can't say that it could have been consensual because I didn't know if she went willingly or not, then you can't claim that it was rape because... again, *you* are no more an ""archangel"" than I, and you have no more idea of what really happened than I do.

&gt; ...what grounds do you have to doubt her? Women make false rape claims? Women are all willing? What's your reason?

At no point in this woman's sign does she detail any activity that can be constituted as rape. She makes a slight allusion to something happening that people are assuming to mean that the guy took her into a stairwell and raped her, when this could quite well have been consensual sex that she later regretted. Or, on the other hand, it's entirely possible that she doesn't remember anything at all, and only assumes she was raped because she woke up alone in a stairwell. It's entirely possible that the guy ran off scared when his ""date"" passed out in the stairwell.

I'm not saying she's lying, only that we have no way of knowing what actually happened. Also that, while a person's word is enough to warrant an *investigation* of rape, actual evidence is required to actually *prove* that a rape occurred.

&gt; So I shouldn't get in my car because it's risky? I should sit at home in a padded room? After all, it's all my fault if something bad happens to me.

Yay, Ad Absurdum, haven't seen that in a while. Oh, wait...

Driving a car has easily avoidable risks, and unforseeable risks (such as another insane driver.) I'm talking actions with known, blatant risks. Like the risk of injury from cliff diving or bull riding. Or the risk of doing something really, really stupid while drinking.","1325377858"

&gt;The Red and Black, founded in 2000, is a worker-owned cooperative restaurant and community space in Southeast Portland, Oregon. As a non-hierarchical and democratic workplace we are, in our own small way, living the dream of a world without bosses. We are proudly unionized with the Portland branch of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and are a closed shop, meaning all of our workers are union members. We also belong to the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives.

&gt;The Red and Black is a hub of radical activity; we host regular events by a variety of local, national and international social justice activists, authors, filmmakers and others. We always seek new ways to best support our community; a key part of that support is that we maintain a Safer Space ‚Äî we strive to prioritize the safety and needs of people who are survivors of abuse and oppression, as well as those typically marginalized by the status quo.

&gt;We are dedicated to animal rights and environmental sustainability, and utilize as many organic, locally-sourced and fairly-traded ingredients as possible in our 100% vegan menu. Many of our goods and supplies are transported by bicycle.

&gt;Embracing direct worker empowerment through our collective model, we stand in solidarity with those who continue to struggle, fight and organize towards a more egalitarian workplace and liberated future for all.","1325377858"

Let me tell you that metal theft is a huge problem.  My uncle had the copper ripped out of his air conditioning system for the building for his business.  Cost him 50k to repair, thieves got maybe 200 bucks for it (insurance had lapsed, unfortunately).  My dad did construction, and he lost things all the time from people stealing it to sell it for scrap.

Here's how I feel about others: know your limits. One of my friends has no problem driving around stoned, and honestly, I have no problem with him doing it - he pulls it off really well, and his only accident was when he was totally straight, but tired. I feel more in danger when the driver of the vehicle I'm in is on the phone than when he's driving HAF.

I think drugged driving laws, since there's no easy way to detect cannaboid levels, and everyone's tolerance is different anyway, should only be related to how one is driving - obviously if you're being an idiot, you shouldn't be driving, but if someone's obeying all traffic laws safely, and happens to be high, I really don't have a problem.","1325377868"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Many of those issues are semantic, as you implied. Evolution refers to the fact and theory of the mutagenic and selective alteration of organisms over time. There is a ridiculous amount of evidence for evolution, though you seem to be aware of this.

It is unfortunate that you have had to deal with disingenuous atheists. Not all atheists are very good at being scientists, though many more than are would purport to be. The 'dictionary' problem is a semantic one, and is more an indication of the silly semantic debating practises of individuals than of the merit of their intended arguments (as I suppose you're aware).

Anyway, abiogenesis is in some ways a separate problem from evolution,  but not entirely. Evolution has primarily been investigated within a common biological framework, the central ""dogma"" of molecular biology, wherein DNA is the blueprint, RNA is the intermediate, and protein is the effector. However, a good biologist does not assume that this has always been the case; the idea that this scheme is the thus-far stable result of prior lower-level evolution is commonly accepted. For instance, many scientists believe (with reason) that RNA may have once been the blueprint, and that the evolution of DNA resulted in the current genetic scheme because DNA is more chemically stable than RNA. 

The point is that evolution is essentially the connection between continual change and its effects on survival, and this would also apply to the lower-level chemical systems that existed prior to the establishment of the current genetics, and even prior to the first cell *per se*. 

At the most basic level, this question becomes harder to answer, but it is not unfeasible that continued chemical reactions over many millions of years would lead to persistent, stable groups of chemicals that would keep evolving due simply to their ability to persist and be diversely modified. Investigating this scientifically is difficult due to its anciency (it is more hidden by the changes that came later), but that does not mean we should start invoking third parties. 

Peer-review is flawed when the peers have a consistent bias. The idea that scientists necessarily share biases that non-scientists do not is nonsense.","1325377870"

I can recognize beauty, but I'm not as attracted to it as everyone else seems to be. I prefer the term ""panromantic"" because it has a nice flowery ring to it, and takes the ""sexual"" part out of it, sidestepping the whole ""bis are promiscuous"" notion, while at the same time getting rid of the ""bi"" part and replacing it with something more inclusive, but still not quite the whole truth, because I can't see myself in a relationship with a fat chick, a heavy duty body builder, a little person, etcetera etcetera.

I think the concept of sexuality as this static, binary thing is stupid. Love and let love. It really does seem to be the social paradigm that keeps us in these roles. And it really does feel like the LGBT community for the most part goes along with it, even while being different.

I mean, heck, I've noticed that even among the *T* people get hung up on gender and sexual preference. Um, hello, you're *changing* your physical birth sex.

Most of our influence came from the fact that in WWII we punched vastly above our population weight militarily. Our navy and air force were among the largest in the world despite having a tiny population. That's what earned us the respect of the Americans and Europeans, not a predilection for ""fence-sitting."" We certainly didn't sit on the fence during the first two world wars.

Finally, the whole ""peacekeeping"" mantra has failed. The Europeans and the rest of the Western world are withdrawing from the combat zones of the third world. We aren't going to fix their problems for them, and 10 years of Afghanistan demonstrated that very well. Just look at how NATO and ISAF failed to find replacement troops in Afghanistan. The Germans pulled out, the British pulled out, we pulled out, and now the Americans are the only ones left over there.

Paying for college sucks for everyone who isn't born rich, especially now, and if you look at other countries, they don't have the ridiculous tuition fees that the U.S. has.  Are scholarships really an answer at all for most people?  No, because there aren't enough for anyone, of any race or gender.  The answer lies in drastically reforming our education system.  I'm of the opinion that everyone deserves a good education for free (and definitely not $40,000 a year), so scholarships as a whole, IMO, are not very effective because they leave most people completely out, even if they deserve it - not because they're going to people who don't deserve it, but because there are just too many people who need help.  And don't get me started on loans because that is just a trap to make you a slave to the system.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Most rapes -2/3- aren't perpetrated by strangers. [Source](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-offenders)

That negates the only vague argument you put forth really.

But, yes, it is more dangerous to walk alone in dangerous parts of town, but not everyone is lucky enough to live in a ""safe"" area or have someone to walk with them at all times. Also, you don't have to be pretty to get raped. You don't have to be dressed up to get raped. 

The thing that bothers me the most about the way rape is treated in the US is that as a woman I have spent my entire life being told how to avoid being raped. I've asked my guy friends how many times someone ever told them not to rape anyone. A lot of them were hard pressed to think of a time outside of sex ed. 

The bottom line is that raping people is NEVER ok. No behavior by victims warrants being raped. The fact that it's looked upon as a ""Well that's what you get for dressing like a whore"" situation is the problem. The rest of society tells us that looking like a whore is a good idea when we go out. Until we get raped. Then we were asking for it. 

Rape is a crime that causes so much confusion, shame and inner turmoil. It so often goes unreported [Source](http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates) because of the way society treats victims. It's a shameful thing that women are taught to feel responsible for. No one deserves to get raped, but many victims feel it was their fault. Even if they did everything right. Even if someone breaks into their locked home in a good part of town, or into their dorm room between campus security sweeps. That's what rape culture is. Victim blaming/offender coddling. 

People should just stop raping other people. But unfortunately that's too much to ask for. ","1325377898"

The toys are expensive, but you don't want to deal with cheap garbage.  

Start out with some bondage cuffs and tie her ass down.  Get some bondage rope (not sisal) and learn how to tie a body harness.

Watersports (ie pee play)?  Spanking?   You need to find out what fetishes she has.  Sexual fetishes are quite the rabbit hole to jump in, and if you jump too far you can get in more than you really want to.

After U.S. support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration tried to covertly continue contra aid.

&gt;During the war against the Sandinista government, the contras carried out many violations of human rights. Their supporters in Miami and the White House often tried to downplay these, or countered that the Sandinista government carried out more such violations. In particular, the Reagan administration engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion on the contra which has been denoted as ""white propaganda"".

If there are eligible voters not voting because of ID difficulties that are not their problem (and not making time to get hold of an ID that is valid for 5 years or more isn't anyone else's fault) at any meaningful level, demonstrate it.  All you've done here is repeat that it is so.

Edit:  Since apparently you don't need to source your claims, I did some Googleing.

From the [The National Commission on Federal Election Reform](http://web1.millercenter.org/commissions/comm_2001.pdf)

&gt;A small percentage of adults, perhaps about 5 to 7%, do not possess a driver‚Äôs license or other photo identification.

I'll let *perhaps* go, although it doesn't exactly speak to their confidence in their methodology. In the presidential election of [2004](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/turnout.php) approximately 79% of voting age residents of the US were actually eligible to vote, meaning that 21% either weren't registered, were not citizens, were felons, etc. None of these are ID issues. So that knocks you down to *perhaps* about 3-5% Which is half or less than the 10% you claim to be *the* estimate. Meaning you pulled it out of your ass.

Further, without knowing the criteria by which your claim that voter fraud rates in Washington and Ohio were established (or from where it comes, for that matter) it is well within reason to assume that those numbers were actually *prosecuted* voter fraud.  Which is an entirely different thing from actual voter fraud rates, much the way that the number of eligible voters without an approved ID is an entirely different thing from eligible voters without an approved ID *who would've actually voted*, since voter turnout rates are generally in the 50% or lower range.","1325377913"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","An important fact that I try to bring up whenever this topic is mentioned is the fact that the frontal lobe does not finish developing until your mid-20s. The frontal lobe is the part of the brain tasked with risk assessment.

The same principle is at play in regards to people with severe mental deficiencies from something like down syndrome. They do not have the faculties to properly consent, so we do not allow people without mental deficiencies to have sex with them.

Now, when I bring this up, the response I get most often is, ""Oh, well I guess we should ban people from having sex until they are 25!"" Forgetting the fact that this response doesn't even address the science, should we? I don't think we should since the brain is far enough along at 18. 

Another response is, ""Well, then I guess I was a rapist at 16 when I had sex with my 16 year old girlfriend."" Though, again, the science is not being addressed, and this is a sarcastic response, I think it is acceptable for two teenagers to have sex with each other. While a person with normal cognitive abilities is prohibited from having sex with a person with down syndrome, it is not illegal for two people with down syndrome to have a sexual relationship. Hell, there are videos and training materials to help them to have safe and enjoyable sex.

I'm not sure what the ethical explanation is for that exactly, but there is something that just doesn't feel immoral about two people with similar cognitive impairments having sex with each other. Perhaps because the down syndrome couple, and the teenage couple are on an even playing field. Neither of them has an incredible advantage that they could use to exploit the other with.","1325377914"

I personally own a set of Beyerdynamic [DT770 Pro-80's](http://www.amazon.com/Beyerdynamic-Pro-80-Closed-Studio-Headphones/dp/B0016MNAAI), which are known for their excellent bass and surprising soundstage and pronounced treble but thin midrange. They sound fab from a home receiver or my iMac without additional amplification. Yes, they will fucking RIP listening to dubstep. Seriously, these are the headphones that Monster Beats wishes it could be.

However, if I were starting from scratch, I'd be REALLY tempted to order a set of [Beyerdynamic DT990 Premium-32's](http://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-990-Premium-32-Headphones/dp/B0024NK344). They're an open headphone design (as opposed to closed like the 770's) which means they'll leak more sound in and out. They have slightly less bass than the 770's although they're 32 ohm and drive better from ipods and other portable music players in addition to desktop computers and receivers. Plus, the 990 32-ohms have a really big, beautiful soundstage. Both headphones sound great, are very comfortable and are extremely well-built. If the pro-80's clamp too tight you can bend the steel headband out slightly and reduce the pressure. Same for the 32's, but they're set up to be looser from the factory. I've owned my 770 Pro-80's for 5 years and listen to them for 6-7 hours a day at my desk for the past 2.

You won't go wrong with either of these two headphones. Either will be a HUGE step up from your Beats. Oh, and they both have a pretty long cord, so you'll probably use a rubber band or velcro band to take in some slack.","1325377920"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Regarding the tabs/spaces thing, I see others have helped you with that but honestly the fact that you were having trouble means, in my opinion, that you're not using the right tools.

Let me clarify this by saying that there's nothing wrong with using a text editor to write code in, if you're doing it as a hobby and you like doing so. In that case, gedit is just fine.

However, if you're writing python professionally, you should be using something that actually understands your code and can help you. For my money the best tool for that at the moment out of the box is pycharm, but there are others as well.

These not only offer rock-solid basic editing (next/prev method, select block etc), but will also perform static analysis of your code as you go, check and offer to correct bugs and missing imports, integrate debugging etc. Getting good with one of these tools will improve your productivity dramatically.

Normally I wouldn't recommend this to someone who is just getting started (there's something to be said for learning the hard way using basic tools), but you've been at this for a while now so I'd say now is a good time to take that step.

Now lets address the bugs thing, because you know that you said something really pretentious and your covering tactics aren't fooling anyone :) (but it's ok! but we've all done that! it doesn't matter what you SAY, just what you know about you).

I'm never gonna say you're a fool. You wrote some solid code, and believe me after 23 years of coding, 15 of which have been commercial, I can read a lot about someone from the code they write.

But that same length of time (which isn't all that much really, I'm certain there are people around here who have been coding longer than I've been alive) gives me a different perspective on what it means to write software. I've written a lot of code in my time, I've written it when I was in the groove and everything was sweet, and when I was dead tired staring at a deadline I was sure I couldn't meet. I've written it when I've been flush and happy, and when everything has been going down the crapper and I was wondering how I could buy food for the next few days on 50c.

You will make mistakes, hundreds, thousands of them, big and small. Not because you're not smart, and not just really subtle mistakes either. Big, obvious ones where you'll wake up the next morning and go ""wtf?"".

Understand this: If you're serious about this coding gig, and I suspect you are, then you are preparing yourself for a lifetime of writing code. You will get better and better during that time, but the statistics are brutally in favor of you writing many, many bugs. To date, we only really know of five mechanisms for reducing those numbers in your favor:

1. To use good languages.
2. To write clear code.
3. To use static analysis.
4. To be peer reviewed.
5. To write tests.

By releasing your code to us yesterday, you fulfilled #4. And what #4 is telling you, is that you're missing #5 :) Maybe it doesn't matter in this instance, but I think you'll be surprised. The thing about writing tests is that they don't just tell you about bugs, they force you to think in a different mindset.

I remember once reading an article that really crystalized this concept for me: it talked about how NASA wrote code by having a coding team, and a breaking team. The coding team wrote the code and tried to do as good a job as they could, and then the breaking team tried to break it. It turns out that the two mindsets are really distinct. When you're writing the code, you don't want it to break. You need to put yourself into a different place, where you're thinking ""make it robust"", before you can start to see the holes.

They're not always bugs either - testing often reveals conditions that are simply ugly. For example, what happens in your code if the codebase only has 9 files that match the filter? do you think that response is appropriate, even though it's technically correct?

Finally, writing tests creates a mindset of creating interfaces that are testable. This is often a valuable trait in coding. As Lewisham pointed out earlier, putting the scoring function in a separate place makes it easy to test, and this is a good architectural decision as well because it makes it easy to adjust or replace in isolation. (This, by the way, is why retrofitting tests onto an untested codebase is such a nightmare - not only are there no tests, but the code is not designed to be tested).

It's good to get into this habit early, because coders rarely work in isolation - eventually, you will be working with others, and even if you're a statistical anomaly and actually don't write bugs, your co-workers will, and so the whole codebase will need testing anyway. If you can't write code in a testable fashion you're going to be a drag on the project.

Finally, in answer to the other questions:

Named tuples I'm not sold on yet. They sound great, I'm ready and willing to use them when I see other people using them a fair bit. Go ahead and use them if you want, personally I'd stick with class.

I'd hand the scoring properties to the score function directly, rather than handing a bugspot class. This helps ensure that the interface between the scoring function and everything else is clean, and thus makes it easier to test :)

Good luck. I strongly recommend giving PyCharm a go, and when you do, print out the keyboard shortcuts and stick them to the wall/desk next to you and do nothing but look up every navigation movement until you're using them natively. Believe me your jaw will drop at the coding speed you can attain using intelligent auto-complete, rapid navigation and a good set of live templates. If it ends up working out well for you but you hit the 30 day limit, come back on here and talk to me and I'll consider buying you a copy.

(Here's a quick recap!)

From DrEddgarAllenPWN

&gt;Segregation doesn't apply to only black people. Segregation by definition is the action or state of setting someone or something apart from other people or things or being set apart.
Sounds like the cop was being segregated for being a cop.

From Bigbuddha:

&gt;segregation is separating two different races of people. Unless cop is a race this isn't segregation.

From ChronosRegex:

&gt;Segregate: Verb 1. to separate or set apart from others or from the main body or group; isolate: to segregate exceptional children; to segregate hardened criminals.

From Bigbuddha:

&gt;Dude how was this segregation?
You are literally comparing an entire era of history where people were forced to build separate housing and bathroom facilities for other races to one cop getting asked to leave a coffee shop.
Enough with the dramatic bullshit. The world doesn't end because one of our ""sacred men in blue"" aren't getting their daily recommended dose of doughnut.

This leads me to the conclusion that it is in fact, you, who is confused regarding the word ""segregation.""

You seem to equate the word with one and only one example of the word. What you seem to be think is that segregation is something that only exists within the context of discrimination, on a large scale, based only on race. Segregation isn't something that has to be applied to a large population or group. It can be as simple as separating one pup from it's litter because based on plans to adopt it. One may segregate a meal based on it's contents. Organization is a form of segregation. 

In this sense, (my understanding of) your view of the word ""segregation"" is wildly different from my view of it. 

I agree that to make a big deal and to have an entire news report over a simple thing such as this is quite silly. I'm rather inclined to believe that ChronosRegex is probably on the same boat as us, however your misinterpretation of the meaning of the word ""segregation"" has lead to a rather ignorant conflict. (or several based on the rest of the posts in this thread.)

This is why attunements were removed and the previous tier's gear is made more accessible immediately after new content is released, because the WoW dev team gets what so many of the game's players are unwilling to.

Also, you didn't see me perform then, so it's unfair to say I personally would need to be carried.

This is a great start but it's not enough. Either have the character know why it's important, and think about those feelings (easier), or explore the character's feelings about not knowing (harder).

&gt;Maybe this is the house you grew up in, before you were taken away. Where were you taken? I was taken here. Why can‚Äôt I remember?

I can't remember lots of things and it doesn't bother me. Clearly, it matters to this character, which is good, but you need to get into his head. What's that like for him? Be specific and give us his experience.

If you come to sell the lens, bin the third party one and sell it with the original one and you'll get a fair bit more money in an auction environment than if you sell one that looks like it's been abused. Hoods take a beating, even if it's just from setting things down.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Sorry I didn't reply earlier. Got caught up in the holidays and then distracted, but since I was getting back into some discussions I thought I definitely owed you the time for a reply, however brief (or so I thought when I started typing).

I still don't understand how Miktheinfidel wouldn't be making a gnostic argument. In regard to my argument, you said this:

&gt; you are ultimately making a statement that says a degree of certainty can be made about the existence of God.

MikeTheInfidel said:
&gt; Your reasoning is irrational because it posits the potential for beings to exist without physical form. Nothing in the entirety of human experience fits this description, so there is thus far a prior probability of zero for that position.

He seems to be arguing that there is a zero probability for any and all Gods and he's using observation, that we never have experienced something without physical form, to support his argument. 

That's a relatively poor argument that uses heavy handed inductive reasoning, but his argument seems gnostic by the explanation you provided. 

The distinction interests me because of the common frustration I experience debating with many atheists. I feel like I'm playing dodge ball with someone who's able to throw whatever he wants at me while standing in a safe zone of sorts, where any argument I provide is nor relevant because ""I don't have to provide evidence that pink unicorns don't exist"" or ""I'm not making a claim, you are."" 

To me, those last statements are purely agnostic arguments. I can't argue against the agnostic stance but I'm continually bombarded by what seems to be gnostic arguments that supposedly are not gnostic. What more when I am outright mocked by the same person not making a claim. It seems like outright hypocrisy that is given free range.

  Add onion, till almost translucent (shallot at this point if you've got it) and garlic. Remember garlic will burn and turn bitter quickly, so add it after the onion is almost done. 

Now you can go in any direction and never fail. . . De glaze with white wine and add herbs of your choice.  

Tarragon and parsley?  It's perfect for scallops.   Pat them dry, sear, and pour the sauce over.

Herbs de Provence?  Saute chicken and serve with herbed potatoes.  

Basil and Oregeno?  Saute Veal or chicken cutlets and then swirl some pasta in. 
Ponzu?  Add carrots, water chestnuts, snow peas, and Mushrooms then saute chicken.  Dollop of honey or molasses and rice. . .tasty.

Add dijon mustard, some deli ham, a little cream and stir in cooked pasta.

gun is a term that refers to something being expelled out of a barrel in a more or less directed fashion, originally applied to cannons. it has since become useless broad as it is applied to all firearms, most artillery, and pretty much anything with a nozzle and a trigger

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The first thing I'd do is divide the population to prevent any sort of revolt or insurrection. Choose an arbitrary, defining characteristic such as race, religion, education, etc and start working to make one side resent the other. The best way to do this is to start blaming one side for everything, turning them into scapegoats for everything that's wrong with the country. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to burn or destroy a national symbol and frame them for it.

I'd Begin to disenfranchise problematic sectors of society. Military draft is an *excellent* way to do this. Every male, on their 18th birthday, is drafted into military service and sent across the country, away from their family and friends. Away from their traditional support base, they can be weakened and indoctrinated with the ideals of the prevailing regime. Such division makes any attempt at armed revolt logistically and organisationally impossible, as unified groups are spread across the country, mixed with loyalists.

Care should be taken to avoid direct and overt punishment of dissent. Some degree of protest should always be allowed, the key is to alter the public's mindset so that they dismiss the protestors as crazy and illogical. Control of the media is the best way to do this, however again, care should be taken to avoid direct propaganda. Instead, tactical story placement should be used to weaken and subvert claims of inequality and injustice. Protestors rallying against poverty, for instance, should be briefly mentioned in the news, alongside numerous stories about families celebrating the holiday period. No overt statements of wealth need be made, it is sufficient to simply interview these people outside their large houses, or in front of trees with presents piled underneath them. A strong undercurrent of success and largess should permeate the media. Individuals living in conditions that do not agree with those shown on TV should be made to believe that their misfortunes are the direct result of the actions of the aforementioned scapegoat social groups.

Numerous government initiatives should be publically and outwardly undertaken in an effort to curtail the actions of these unpatriotic minority groups. Through chains of intermediaries and unscrupulous opportunists, minority-led campaigns should begin to spring up demanding changes to fundamental tenets of the nation's spirit (such as changing the national language, a more immigrant-friendly welfare system, the recognition of 'heroes' that are widely reviled by the public), further alienating these groups from the general public and diverting attention away from the government.

Communications between citizens should be widely discouraged, especially over large distances, such as between groups in different towns. Large-scale mobilisations of popular support via social media should be nipped in the bud by a secret police dedicated to the creation and maintenance of several tens of thousands of fake social media profiles, involved in all manner of social circles. These accounts should act as 'spotters', and never reveal their presence as governmental authorities. Rather, they should prioritise the identification of ring-leaders who would be subsequently arrested and imprisoned for treason, their accounts commandeered and used to subtly spread resentment against other movements claiming to desire social justice. So long as those vying for rebellion are too busy arguing amongst themselves, they'll never be able to generate the levels of popular support necessary for open revolt.

An overhaul of the education system should be undertaken at the soonest possible opportunity in order to begin the process of indoctrinating the next generation of adults. Parental involvement should be discouraged, where possible, and children frequently separated from their parents for increasing periods, starting at a night or two early on, right up to two month periods as they enter their late teens. These separations should be taken as an opportunity to subvert parental authority and teach loyalty to the state. Where necessary, subtle measures should be taken to destabilise family life and create tension within homes. Examples might include having a boss fire a problematic worker, and then hiring his son, emasculating him as the 'man' of the home and robbing him of his authority.

Throughout all of this, the presence of a strong, yet compartmentalised military should be paramount. Military generals should be played against each other, and left vying for favour and control. When necessary, problematic leaders should be made example of for arbitrary reasons, instilling fear and doubt into the others. Care should be taken that blame is never clear, leaving commanders hesitant to make alliances with each other. Racial / ethnic / religious differences amongst generals should be overemphasised and exploited in order to create further friction. Military squads and battalions should, wherever possible, comprise a diverse range of the populace to prevent collusion and organised dissent. Leadership in each case should be achieved via the strategic placement of small, tight networks of loyalists who are rewarded for their service with priveleged positions.

As time went on, I would instigate the growth of several opposition parties of my own creation, led by puppets under my employ. These opposition groups would serve to divide any actual opposition to my reign in elections, focusing on creating protracted and embittered debates and petty squabbling for popular support, while I was portrayed as a valiant leader, struggling to save the nation against the tide of the aforementioned scapegoats and their virulent social influences. If any oppositional group became too powerful, I would have one of my pawns form an alliance with them, and then create a large scandal to rob them of their support. It might be something as tame as an affair, or even extend to political corruption or wholesale treason, depending on the specifics of society's current attitudes. Opposition to me would be portrayed as divided, petty, and mostly incompetent. Stupidity and unpatriotic sentiment would be the hallmarks of my oppositional candidates, ensuring that even with ""fair"" elections, they were never able to oust me.

Personally, I would maintain a simple and unelaborate lifestyle, all the while embezzling public money slowly but surely. As time went on, I would slowly withdraw from the political scene, inserting puppets in my place. As my grip on the national media and spread of information tightened, I would begin the process of deifying myself. The instigation of numerous social projects during my reign would be the basis for my people's love, but the catalyst would be my eventual conquering of one or more of the many scapegoats I established as threats to the nation's security. By killing or removing these threats, I would elevate myself to the level of a national hero, spreading wealth and power to loyalists while undermining any opposition through an intricate web of blame and divisiveness. My supporters would love me, and through their love I would control the political climate from a safe distance, constantly fortifying and expanding my own powerbase while splitting and dividing that of any opposition that grew too big. Eventually I'd be able to retire completely, with an entire national dedicated to nothing more than carrying out my every wish.","1325378010"

Here's some good news.  You're young - and your early relationships are likely going to be amongst your worst.  And they're temporary - I swear if I could impart just one thing to young adults about ""love and romance"", it is to not ""play married"".  Young people get way too serious over early relationships which by definition *are not going to last forever.*

When people are young, they and their partners go through a lot of rapid change - both in lifestyle and psychologically.  Roots have yet to be set.  So much is in flux.  The idea that a romance will survive this - esp in our modern world - is silly.  More than ever, young people have so many options that getting to stuck on one person is unreasonable.

* borderlands - mix FPS, co-op multiplayer (singleplayer is essentially the same), RPG, and a diablo-like weapon-collecting scheme and you have borderlands (I like to refer to it as hoarderlands). It's pretty cheap now, too.
* Fallout New Vegas / Fallout 3 - First-person sandbox rpg. I like killing shit and taking everyone's stuff. *""I need all your shit so I can save the world""*
* S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Shadow of Chernobyl. Sometimes the gameplay elements can be a bit obtuse, but in general the game plays fantastically. The story is intriguing and makes you want to get to the bottom of things. Sometimes you might soil yourself. There is ""stalker complete"" mod you can get to upgrade the graphics, but it *does* change the gameplay (mostly makes it harder, but more immersive). The ""stalker complete"" pack is pretty decent.
* (FREE) [UFO: Alien Invasion](http://ufoai.ninex.info/wiki/index.php/About). A turned-based combat &amp; strategy (e.g. base-building) game loosely based on the old X-COM game, this game is pretty much computer crack. From when I played it last, the tech tree is greatly expanded to include more weapons, longer progression (X-COM was quick and dirty), more balance to the weapons, etc. I had a hell of a time playing it and highly recommend if you're into that type of game.
* Mass effect then Mass effect 2 - a light RPG that's probably more of a movie than it is a true RPG, but you can't argue with the story. I was blown away and enthralled by it.
* Fallout 1, Fallout 2 - warning regarding the top 3/4 view (2d overlays, sort of like diablo), and the turn-based combat system. Anyway, if you can handle the graphics, turn-based combat, and reading text (I enjoyed all of these), these games are classic. Full of quirky humor, interesting, and entertaining. ","1325378020"

The conclusion does not follow from the premise; it's just as reasonable (i.e., not really at all reasonable, but we can discuss it as if it were) that there are an infinite number of universe and they're all exactly the same. Or maybe they were all exactly the same up until 20 minutes ago at which time a random number generator somewhere produced a different result in each of them. Or any number of other possibilities that don't imply ""everything that can happen happens in one of them"".

To get to that latter conclusion you have to assume 1) there are an infinite number of universes *and* 2) any time a physically possible event could happen, it happens in some universe.

I reduced the max speed of the rocks from below.

&gt;a shitload of rockets hit me from behind, sometimes even carrying me to 600 height without me doing anything.

I reduced the amount of rockets that come from behind like that.

&gt;spamming boost, you're able to maintain your height fairly well.

Originally the boost recharge was muuuch longer, and the rockets much faster, so it made sense to give some upward momentum to make it hit the rockets, that's no longer necessary, so I completely removed the upward boost.

As a side effect it makes it a bit easier to dodge rocks.

Thank you for the feedback. It was pretty helpful.

Catholics believe that God prevents the pope from falsely defining doctrine *only when he is solemnly defining doctrine*, which happens only a handful of times per century.

&gt; I think the Pope has to explicitly state it as such, which is rarely done, rather that everything he says being automatically granted this status, so this could simply have been a non-divine personal opinion of the Pope.

To avoid confusion on whether he is invoking this privilege or not, there is a proper formula that goes like ""We solemnly decree and define that ... is what's cool to believe under pain of anathema"".

When the pope issues an order, or even proposes a theological explanation, this is not proposed to be an infallible statement.","1325378058"

I am speaking of the socialist direct-democracy version of anarchist government or, alternatively, the consensus democracy. Either version is viable, and both are as viable as any other form of government. Both implementations would eventually fail, like any form of government or economic policy.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt;Therefore, given that history, Israel had the right, the obligation even, to counter that act,

I whole totally agree with this assertion.  Regardless of any other factor of this incident, Israel did have the right ""to counter that act.""  Where we start to go our separate ways here is in, after establishing the fact that Israel had the right to counter the act, what was the best course of action to be taken?  

&gt;and doing so can not be considered anything but an act of self defense.

Here is the difference between our points of view... I'm with you in the view that Israel has the right to counter this act, but while I (in the sense of Israel's stated goal of the ceasefire to be stopping rocket attacks) think a more pragmatic counter measure would have been wiser, your view seems to be that because Israel has the right to counter this act, Israel can respond as lightly or as devastatingly as they wish and no one in Gaza has the right to respond/retaliate/be upset about it.

If that's how you feel about it... Fine... Your entitled to your opinion and it's not as if your reasoning is absurdly illogical or anything.  My point here is that when you take a step back and analyze the tunnel act and the course of action Israel chose as their response, whether right or wrong Israel was going to get a rocket attack response from Gaza in reaction (which everyone knew would be coming).  Your point seems to be that the reality of the situation in terms of what actions were going to cause what reactions doesn't matter... Israel had the right to do whatever it wanted to take care of the tunnel act and no one had any right to do anything about it in response.       ","1325378099"

Many people know languages better ""passively"" (reading it, hearing it and understanding) vs. ""actively"" (having to produce it through speaking/writing). Since this is just reading (not even hearing), I doubt HuK needs to dumb his English down that much. For instance, I'd say that most Koreans who know a little bit of English will understand that ""I"" is the first-person singular personal pronoun, even if they don't really know how to use ""I"" and ""me"" correctly when writing. To someone with a basic level of English comprehension, ""I love you"" and ""me love you"" should convey the same overall meaning; it's just that one's actually grammatically correct and thus should be used so that people understand that ""I love you"" is how the phrase *should* be said.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;    ""The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions‚ÄîAfrican slavery as it exists among us‚Äîthe proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old Constitution were, that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with; but the general opinion of the men of that day was, that, somehow or other, in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away... Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the idea of a Government built upon it‚Äîwhen the ""storm came and the wind blew, it fell.""

&gt;    Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition.""

But I don't know why you even need to be ""sold"" on Clang.  Try it out.  It takes two minutes to install and run, it's a drop in replacement for GCC, and you can switch back and forth at will.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I think it's definitely possible, but it would require changes in how the government (I'm from the US, so I'll talk about them now) approaches education.

The latest trend has been standardizing education across the country.  There are a few problems with this:

* Costs required to train teachers and purchase supplies
* No room for poor or excellent performance - the goal is to be ""standard""
* Teachers only have to meet the standards in order to have a job - those who go above and beyond aren't recognized while those who do a poor job are allowed to slide by
* Education prescribed by beaurocrats in DC, not the teachers who know and work with the kids
* Schools don't get much-needed funds unless they implement the standards

We should eliminate national standards and standardized testing and allow teachers and schools to design their own curriculum and tests.  Good teachers will know their students best, and can come up with unique ways to engage them and get them excited about learning.

Essentially we need a ""free-market"" approach that encourages teachers to identify the best ways to teach our kids - not just in the essentials but also things they are interested in.  Not-so-great teachers should be let go.

*I'm actually a bit rushed at the moment, going out soon, so I can't get all of my thoughts down eloquently :P But basically I do agree with the article, we just need to get regulations and federal government out of the way*","1325378134"

All law is applied with a threat, and use, of violence.  All governance ensures is its retention on what constitutes legal violence; criminalizing the unsanctioned.  Hierarchical organizing, institutional or otherwise, atomizes individuals and stratifies communities.  Anarchism does the opposite; strengthens communities in support of individuals.  More simply, this is fear of anarchy without anarchists.

If that fails to convince, recommend considering prison populations.  Where exactly does political hierarchy keep this shining beacon in the defense of minorities?  As far as I can see, it is one of the most egregious offenders.","1325378145"

"juggling","t5_2qs90","A lot of places don't like knives either, cause they can damage floors (and floors can damage your knives). 

I'd argue that torches are much more flashy, as even simple flourishes look very impressive. Juggling knives are dull, and if your audience figures that out, it loses all flash. Torches are also safe because the fuel fumes burn at low temperatures, while the kevlar wick stays relatively cool, but it's fire, so it still looks dangerous to everyone. Even after I tell people that I've caught the wrong end numerous times wil no injury, people still don't believe me and fear for their safety, due to their instinctual fear of fire. As for challenge, they are all pretty much the same. A good set of knives and torches will be balanced like a club, but a little heavier. Plus, torches make a really cool wooshing noise. 

To answer your original question, I can't recommend you any knives because I don't own any and the few people I know that own a set all used Dube knives. I don't think there is much variety with juggling knives, so that will probably make your choice easier. Most have hard wood handles, so keep in mind that they will be harder on your hands (most torches have wrapped plastic handles, which are more forgiving).","1325378166"

When I started out it told me I was 280 and 40% BF (which would mean 168lbs lean mass). Recently it told me 255 and 35%, which would mean 168.3 lbs of lean mass, today it told me 521 and 33.8% BF, which would be 166lbs of lean mass. (I'm 5'10)

Now that seems pretty consistent, but I just don't think that number can be accurate. That would mean at 195lbs I would be 15% body fat, yet according to BMI carts that would put me at a BMI of 28....which is well into the overweight range.

But just because it is a BF game that makes it justified where as on CoD it isn't? Both series are doing the same thing. CoD just doesn't need a ""new engine"" since the old one was solid, so they change it instead of go from the ground up. And they did say BC2 would have 64 players it was a big deal on reddit when they did. The only way either franchise will change is if new consoles are released, the updates now are really minor. And CoD4 with it's small maps had over 40 players at times and it worked. The current BF maps could use at least 10 to 20 more players on each team to make the game more authentic, strictly talking about conquest. The maps now are mostly too big for 64 players. And yes I am talking about lag compensation which is the single most important part of the game and they have yet to make it work well, a problem which was solved in the 90s. And at the end of the day bf still feels like the same game, but honestly mw is different. Compared to mw2 and mw1, mw3 plays a lot differently and I can't say that about bf3.","1325378184"

"funny","t5_2qh33","All metals have microscopic holes (future cracks) in them just from the way that physics works -- even if they're carefully manufactured. There are roughly three reasons why there are holes in metals: holes around foreign atoms in the metal, holes formed when metallic grains grow into each other, and then holes existing due to the laws of thermodynamics requiring everything to have a bit of entropy.

You can see how a metal atomic lattice has imperfections in it due to reasons 1&amp;3 [here](http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/defekte_alte_uebersicht.gif).

When metals cool from their liquid form, they have to start solidifying around something. Usually that something is foreign matter in the liquid. If there is no foreign matter, then it starts solidifying at the solid surface of the container that it's in. The first parts to cool down from liquid to metal form a grain nucleus. This grain grows until it encounters other grains. They look like [this](http://knowledgepublications.com/doe/images/DOE_Material_Science_Grains_And_Boundries.gif).

Whenever your material is bent, compressed, pulled, etc, the grains within the metal shift. The imperfections, the holes, etc, within a grain start getting pushed out of the grain to the grain boundary. The crack at the grain boundary keeps slowly growing until in a very short period of time (something like 1-5% of the total lifetime of the part) the crack growth jumps and if it's not caught in time, the part splits in half through that crack. 

Anyway, vibrations due to air resistance and decompression cause the parts to fail :D","1325378203"

I was dating this guy for a long time and he wanted to get married but I wanted to graduate college first. We were on and off for a while, and we ended up going to a cruise together with out families. 
He does a bunch of things and we end up in the same room. 

The main eating area is set up like a buffet, so I ate. A LOT. Now, I am a fairly thin girl. I am 5'5 weight 125, but my boobs are huge. 34 DD. 
Last few days of the cruise, we are doing it cowgirl style. We had just come back from lunch and decided to have some fun. 
He put his hands on my belly and says ""This is how you would look if you were pregnant with my child. Your boobs look like they are ready to feed my baby. You would be a great mom.""

I gave him what I now call my 'You are dead to me' look and told him to finish himself off.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; A guy being short aren't acceptable grounds for dismissal of a mate either....They might turn down short guys, but they aren't going to voice that it's because they're short.

But it is acceptable and that is the reason voiced.  The column I linked quotes a study where only 2 of 79 (2.5%) said they would date a shorter man.  This means 97.5% would not on the grounds that he is shorter.  This may not be a large case study, but it is an accepted and pervasive attitude in general society.  You mentioned that ""past high school, no reasonable woman"" would turn down a guy simply because he is shorter, but this trend and study shows that to be untrue.  It is indeed unreasonable, which confounds me considering the ubiquity of the attitude.  Something along the lines of 'short guys need not respond' is not uncommon on dating site profiles and ""I couldn't date anyone shorter than me"" is not an unusual sentiment either.  
&gt;Similarly, a lot of white guys would probably turn down black girls and vice versa, but they wouldn't say ""I'm not dating a nigger.""

I'm confused.  Would they turn down the person **because** of their skin color?  If they do, then that would be considered shallow and socially unacceptable.

It does have a high learning curve with all the various menu shortcuts and learning to pilot your ship effectively but it was worth it to me.  I don't have a time played on my steam account because I was offline the whole time but I played it around 10 hours a day 7 days a week for 3-4 weeks at least before I got bored.  (I was deployed)

You start out with one or two ships depending on who you choose to start as but you can purchase larger and more powerful ships as you get better.  When I stopped I had a fleet of about 30 ships consisting of traders, 4 station transport ships (essentially mega cargo ships), several heavy fighters, destroyers, and frigates.

Plus, the value is fantastic; in Canada, you can pick up a bottle of 12 for the same price as a Johnnie Walker Black.  This Scotch was what got me obsessed.  I still have fond memories of the Glenlivet 12, and it's my go-to gift for anyone who doesn't know much about Scotch, but wants to learn.

If you absolutely want an Islay, Lagavulin or Ardbeg are good choices.  Jura Superstition is another good choice too, since it's both sweet and smokey.

Nothing in that story supports the claim that the bill can be used to detain citizens. It quotes Obama saying there will be no ""[authorization of] the indefinite detention without trial of American citizens"" and responds with a oped by ""one writer for the progressive blog FireDogLake."" He says that future administrations could twist the bill to allow the detention of U.S. citizens. The bill clearly states that it:

A) does not expand current power

B) does not override existing law concerning the detention of citizens

C) exempts citizens from detention

The only way that the argument that future administrations could twist the bill to allow the detention of citizens is if current law would allow it. Therefore, the NDAA changes nothing.

"arduino","t5_2qknj","5 Volts on gate - check

5 volts on drain - check

source to positive of LED - ok

I assume the negative of the LED then goes to ground to complete the closed path? If this is how you have it hooked up it *might* work.

Now the reason I have the LED on the drain side is this. For the MOSFET to switch on for an N-Channel device, the gate must see a threshold voltage of 2 volts **referenced to the source** ([IRF510](http://www.irf.com/product-info/datasheets/data/irf510.pdf)) This reference to source part is important. In your application, when the MOSFET is on, there is a voltage drop across the LED. If the LED and resistor are both on this side the voltage at the source will appear to be 5 volts. This is a probelm because as we said before to properly switch the MOSFET you need source voltage+threshold voltage. By grounding the source, and having the load on the drain side, your reference for the gate is now ground (0 volts) so your threshold voltage onle needs to be above Vthreshold, which in the data sheet is 2 volts.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Your TSA example is moot because all those incursions of liberty are done so voluntarily. People give up those rights for the convenience of air travel. No one is stopping you from taking a bus.  
But if we get back to the laws of nature which is basically a free for all clusterfuck , small societies inevitably form with meagre laws to provide security for persons and property.  
&gt;IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.  
- John Locke, Second Treatise of Government

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","Hi, I was involved in modelling and printing the Minecraft village that was linked in this thread. Thanks all for the interest in the project, and the hints for improving my photographic skills.

I thought I could add some info on how these pictures (and the miniature) were created.

* The miniature is approximately 10x15 inches, the maximum size the printer (a Zprinter 650) can do. 
* The printer works by spraying colored glue on layers of plaster powder. The models are then fixated by dipping them with superglue. So its not plastic, but some sort of sandstone.
* The printing size (1mm^3 per block) was a little small, so we lost almost all trees in the process (and a couple of battlements and torches). 2mm^3 per block works much better.
* We have done a video that shows another model we have printed, you may get a much better idea of the size and quality of the models in the video (the village is the same size as the smaller of the two models in the video): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sku5jOTwCP8
* Given that half of the comments circle around the quality and style of the pictures, I have to say for our defense that a) the pics were done in a hurry and that b) it was no artificial tilt-shift effect, but the shallow DOF resulted from using a 90mm macro lens in an environment with little light and no tripod available. 
* I have added a couple of more images to the photostream that show the finaliized model (as you can see, we where a little bit generous with the superglue, so the model looks a little bit glazed.

If you have further questions, I will be happy to answer them. But it is 1:37 AM here, and I am a little drunk from the new year celebration, so it will probably take me some time.

Happy New Year, everyone!

Sorry, that's bullshit. 3 paragraphs on Reddit are meaningless, Reddit's not running in any elections, we're not voting for President on Reddit. If you think 3 paragraphs on Reddit by some anonymous guy carry the same weight as hearing the words from the guy who wants to be President of the USA, I'm sorry, I can't agree with your logic.

And there's no need to make a straw man out of it. I didn't argue that he should have spammed his voter base over every single little bill, you made that up entirely out of thin air. I said specifically this bill, because it's important enough to matter to a large fraction of his voters. But since you mention it, I think SOPA is also important enough to merit some words from him. Sorry if that's too much, but really, you shouldn't be in politics if you can't be bothered to set the record straight on things of this magnitude, things that matter to your base. ","1325378285"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Developmental biology time! The vaginal canal is a column of ring-shaped muscles called the pubococcygeal muscles. It's quite literally the outer part of the penis, only inverted. 

The muscles can become ""loose"" over time via repeated exercises for that purpose. But it can easily return to its original size, or even smaller (to an extent, of course... physical limitations and all), by doing different exercises that strengthen/increase the size of the muscles (read- Kegels), When the muscles grow, the circumference of the vaginal canal decreases, making a ""tighter"" feeling vagina. 

Since the vagina is a muscle, that muscle strength is subject to the same factors that your other muscles are related to. Diet, exercise, genetics, general health, advanced age (read- 70 years and higher) and so on. 

So yes, a promiscuous woman can easily have a tighter vagina, if she does Kegels regularly. She could, in theory, be tighter than a woman who is a virgin, but has never done Kegels. ","1325378292"

Instead of taking a piece of history or literature or giving their view on it, they give it to the class for a day, letting everyone study it themselves. Afterward, we have a debate on it, giving our points of views on the subject and arguing points with each other. When no one else can dispute a student's point, the teachers themselves enter the debate and try to. Many students in these classes don't take this opportunity, but through debating with my teachers over the subject I have  learned much more than i would've otherwise.

"politics","t5_2cneq","imo, everything you just said highlights how weak of a president Obama is.  If he were effective he would speak to the public about the process, what is going on with this situation and state his opposition to it.  He should have done this months ago and threatened to veto it then.  Then, after telling the public why we would veto it sit back and wait for Congress to either remove it or not.  In this way, the blame can be transferred to Congress since his position is well known and they can be seen as cheap for trying to pass it by attaching it to the defense spending bill.

This whole situation shows not only how weak of a president he is but his complete inability, or lack of desire, to change anything about the way politics works in Washington.  Effectively the signing statement just says, ""SOrry Americans, I felt bad about giving your rights away, but I gave them away all the same, don't hate me.""

"Games","t5_2qhwp","**Best mechanic:**   

Leveling in Ultima Online.  In UO you leveled specific skills (swordfighting, blacksmithing, casting, stealing, stealth, etc) as you used them.  Skills ranged from 0.1 to 100.00.  The .1 increment raises came randomly, with decreased regularity the higher the skill got, so you got a nice little thrill of accomplishment every time ""You're skill in [whatever] has raised to 92.6.""  But you only had 700 total points to work with.  Since characters as a whole had no overall ""level"" like in most games, each character was a unique mix of skill and speciality. It was perfect.

**Worst Mechanic:**

Leveling in vanilla un-modded Oblivion (and I assume Skyrim, haven't played it).  You gain skill in individual skills by using them, like in UO, which is great...but there is no overall point cap total, so basically if you spent enough time you could just max out everything and become the perfect ultimate savant polymath hero.  That's boring and unrealistic and requires no planning or developmental strategy.  Additionally, the enemy creatures and opponents in these Bethesda games level *simultaneously in direct proportion to the protagonist*...i.e. it is equally difficult to kill a wolf or a troll or a zombie at the beginning of the game wielding a kitchen knife as it is to kill the same creature 200 game-hours later with a maximum skilled character wielding the best weapon in the game.  That is a system so incredibly and insanely lame and ridiculous to me that it blows my mind that people actually exist who might think it is a good idea to implement.

Whatever your investment would gain or lose on its own, your initial contribution is bolstered by whatever the company throws in. As an example: my company matches 100% of my contribution, up to 5% of my salary. So when I throw in my 5%, I'm effectively investing 10%, immediately doubling my total contribution.

But 401ks tend to have higher expense ratios and far fewer options for investing your money. So after you get the free money, your retirement funds work harder for you in an IRA.

*But* you can only invest up to $5k in an IRA each year (depending on your adjusted gross income). So once you've reached your max, then you should invest back into your 401k, which has a higher maximum. While it has faults, it's still a tax-sheltered investment for your retirement.","1325378316"

People say they care about Gitmo being closed but then, they never pay attention when the Senate refused to fund its closure or the transferee of prisoners.

People that argue against software piracy seem to think that paying for it is enough. If paying for it is ample punishment, are we punishing the general industry for buying it (charging them the same price as pirates who steal it).


This sort of thing needs a strict ruling that can be used in every case for the sake of both the RIAA and the average person. The RIAA wants to charge exuberant amounts, and the average person wants to pay nothing. I say meet them in between at 10x the cost and a theft charge on their criminal record (Piracy is theft.

Didn't the reddit admins/devs recently fork a newer markdown implementation to be more reddit-specific? If so, it seems reasonable that there could be new mechanisms for **bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~ and ...underline :-( It took about three years of asking just to get the ~~strikethrough~~!

Eh, lemme try something:

*italic with asterisks*

_italic with underscores_

**bold with double-asterisks**

__bold with double-underscores__

***triple asterisks***

"politics","t5_2cneq","He seems to do a great jon analyzing things, but then fails at the end. He perfectly understands the dynamics of the free market and why we love them as buyers, yet hate them as sellers. His first crack in logic though was saying that nobody ""believes"" in a free market, when he really meant nobody wants one as a seller. We can still believe in something, but wish to circumvent the system.

At the end though is the real flop. Again he clearly understands market dynamics, but he seems to ignore them as the same for the labor market. Why isn't labor just another commodity? He never really says why.

OK, despite this lapse in explanation, he apparently wants government to manage labor markets instead of buyers and sellers competing. What he's missing is that corruption and favoritism will then takeover. If you are friends with the politician, then you come out of labor negotiations always on top, regardless if you're the buyer or seller.

He's done th analysis well, he just needs to accept that as a seller and as a buyer we enter the marketplace differently. Because it's free though, neither party engages in a transaction that doesn't profit themselves. win-win.","1325378358"

Yes, be as good a friend to her as you possibly can. Be very supportive. Having someone who is rational that is understanding will go a long way.

This situation is tricky because if you attack her beliefs then she'll avoid you (as she was trained to) but she'll continue to be miserable until she is freed from the church. 

There is a trick though. Don't ever tell her that the church isn't true or that a certain belief isn't true, instead ask questions or a series of questions where the correct answer‚Äîwhich she has to think of herself‚Äîcontradicts the church. Do enough of these and she'll eventually snap out of it. This can be tricky though since you don't want her to realize what you're doing, generally sneak it in when talking about unrelated topics and don't mention the church at all.

All whose names are not written in the [book of life](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020&amp;version=KJV)

I am going to guess that the hell you are referring to is the contemporary and widespread one, with the devils and the pitchforks, something costumed like LaVey, or some extract from the horrors of Dante's fecund imagination.  Correct me if I am wrong.

Nothing could be further from Biblical truth.  The wages of sin is death, not eternal, tortured life.

God will not force people to live a certain way, or any way:  He will behave exactly as Jesus did, which was to speak the truth, heal, allow wo/men to choose their own path.

If that choice is not Given them it is not.  If God exists, then this choice is known to God.  If God is our creator, then he knows what is right and what is wrong, and has the ability to fix what can be.

We have choice.  You have choice.  Love is harmony and growth and beauty and peace.

Other than love is disharmony, deterioration, death.  I shall not be given the power of God unless I can wield it like God.  

*'...imagine a boot stamping on a human face...forever...'* - 1984
Imagine a squadron of immortals led by an immortal Hitler.
Or Pol Pot.
Or me, or you.

God will not subject us to this; the net result of rejection of God is annihilation, as a remedy for the alternative of perpetual pain and discord, in the presence of a created being which presumes itself not to be.

The Beast and False Prophet are other than we; Satan is other also, and these do not die.  We *can*, and that is the point.  If you do not wish to live forever in peace and harmony, you will not be forced to.

God thinks [nobody](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:10-18&amp;version=KJV) is good, compare this dismal sketch of so-called 'good people' with the example of Christ.

When God puts on a show, then judge it if you can.  I suggest you read about the efficacy of this in Scripture, its lessons and sequelae.

If your quarrel is with Christians that is a different story and irrelevant to the matter of the judgment of God - it comes to the Christian *first*, and swiftly.

Personally I want to have the band-aid ripped off quickly.  Personally I want to be a charter member [1](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%20104:4&amp;version=KJV), [2](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2033:3&amp;version=KJV), [3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2022:1-7&amp;version=KJV)

Ignorance of the law is no excuse in a human court of law, Biblical revelation of God reveals a difference before His throne.  

Note the rest of the dead not returning to life until the end of a thousand-year reign; that these are not reported to be resurrected for judgment but simply that they are resurrected, and then judged.  

That will be their time.  By virtue of baptism and invitation to the Spirit of God, this is mine.  Is it yours?  I cannot think of a more serious question to ask and answer.","1325378383"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","This topic gets me on rant mode, so I'ma gonna rant away.

One thing that astounds me about people and the internet in general is the failure to comprehend that there can be more than one cause for things.

""She should have watched her drink"" is often conflated with ""She should have HAD to watch her drink"" and thus people get angry at telling women they should be careful, as if that takes responsibility off the people who abuse them.

""Offensive people are everywhere, it's best to get over it"" gets replaced with ""Offensive people are everywhere, and that's how it should be.""

And on the flip side of that same coin, ""People shouldn't get offended when I say things that sound racist because I'm not racist"" is another great example.  You're right, I shouldn't presume that every joke you state is a moral stain on your character.  But guess how it really works.

""Male teachers should not be alone in offices under 16"" is another example.  Maybe in a fair and just world you wouldn't have to proactively prove your innocence, but you're an idiot if you think you can do otherwise.

The advice I would give to grumpy santa (if he asked, which I don't think he would of me) is how to deal with an unfair reality.  It in no way justifies the reality.

I wear clean cut suits and forcibly remove all traces of ""blackness"" from my speech when I'm in business, because it means people take me more seriously.  I use a very different style when I call family.  I would advise anyone who wants to rise the corporate ladder to do the same.  Should it be this way?  Aww hell no!  I should be able to say ""Girl what?  These numbers are some BULLSHIT!"" and not have people think I'm an idiot.  Sadly, it doesn't work that way.

If I could get everyone on the internet to take a breath and go ""things have more than one cause"" and ""the way things are is not the same as the way things ought to be"" the internet would be a kinder place for communication.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You are misinterpreting what the signing statement does. This is actually quite badass on his part. Congress' job is to write the laws, and it is the executive branch's job to enforce them. The signing statement is Obama saying he will *not* enforce the law as Congress intended it. If you read the whole statement, Obama goes over each problematic section and explains why it either is not a change from the status quo or why he can (and will) interpret it in such a way as to make the provision meaningless, or why the provision is unconstitutional and therefore can be ignored. Read the whole statement. Here are some highlights:

&gt;my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law.

...

&gt;While section 1022 is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty, I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations.

...

&gt;I have signed this bill on the understanding that section 1022 provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it, and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement...under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention.

...

&gt;Section 1028 [...] would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. [...]In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict.
...
&gt; should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.

**TLDR: The purpose of the signing statement is to provide a legal case for Obama to simply ignore the problematic parts of the legislation. He signed the act but this is him promising not to enforce large parts of it. Obama is not betraying us.**

EDIT: what Obama is doing here is very similar to how Bush used signing statements as almost a line item veto: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statement#Controversy_over_George_W._Bush.27s_use_of_signing_statements

The thing is, I already typed what I intended to say. It's all still up there. There's no good reason whatsoever to expect to to retype everything over and over again.

&gt;This is where I'd say you are a condescending asshole. So, you're a condescending asshole. It has nothing to do with my intelligence, it has everything to do with your syntax, structure, and how you reference different parts of the discussion; You use vague descriptors like ""the argument"" without clarification, and that makes for a difficult discussion.

Everyone else understood it. You stumbled on it. We can all draw our own conclusions from this.

&gt;There is more to the pro-life/pro-choice argument then just the issue of women's rights; I do not think you clarified what other arguments there could be.

I did in fact tell you what another argument was. In fact I believe I did so twice and milaha as well restated it to you.

&gt;You say this in response to your analog: ""The external actors are the same, the internal actors and the controversy are all that is different and they interact with the external actors in identical ways. "" I am confused as to what that means.

I described what an analogy is when you disputed what I said. I defined it in fairly neutral and simple terms both for your benefit and to remove room by which you could again contest the analogy.

&gt;I think your final case is that Church Charities should have the right to disallow certain people from adopting, based on their beliefs, and that they should only use private funds to do so, like Planned Parenthood and abortions. My question: What about non-church adoption agencies?

re: this course in college, I have to admit that was a lot to do with my own problems tbh, as I did spend most of those classes trying to read the board through a small hole in my fist (yes it looked stupid) because I'm nearsighted and didn't have glasses at the time, and kind of didn't bother with the calculator instructions since I had an 86 and not an 84. this was the same for all three classes, I got glasses later on.

the thing w/college math is that the classes are always huge, so, it was probs good of the guy to at least meet with me as an individual at all. though the grading was still bull.","1325378389"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Well, okay. First off, fernly's right about this not being a story. It really is more of a character sketch, than anything. The guy's estranged from his grand daughter, he's been buying her secret flowers for a couple months, yeah. Why? This is important in a story. He could be some creepy stalker, but the story doesn't seem to want us to think that. There are a few small style problems as well, though. ""Climbing laboriously"" is not good. The reader should see him stepping the way your friend wants us to, not the way each of us think ""laboriously"" looks like. Something like, ""The old man stepped slowly down the steps, gripping the metal railing with an unsteady hand. He put out his free hand to balance himself, as if it had something to clasp to."" We need to be *shown*, like small children, what ""laboriously"" looks like, not told that is was laborious. 

Next, word usage. One of the things that every writer has to always remember is that *every word counts*. Never say with three words what only requires two. This can be monumentally hard to accept, but tell your friend that it only takes practice. Here's an example. ""She always looked like that: happy, kind, and always, always laughing."" Okay, so the most glaring word here is ""always"". It's used three times in the one sentence. I'm personally okay with using a word twice in quick succession to emphasize a character's thoughts. In this case, Emerson sees his grand daughter as a very happy person, unlike himself. Two things on the use here: Get rid of the first ""always"" if you decide to keep the second two. My other thought here, though, is that the other two are false. She clearly can't *always* be laughing, because it would be super-weird. Your friend's words must depict the fictional world as it is, not as the often-used hyperbole of real life says she is allowed to. This is not conversation, it is prose. Words must be precise.

But, on to plot. Why is he so sad? What happened between him and his child, that he feels he must spy on this girl? We don't need concrete answers, but we need *something*. There are opportunities in the text for a little character deepening. The conversation with the florist. He goes to him every week, right? The man can offer Emerson some platitude that gives the reader an insight to Emerson. The man must think that these are actually going to someone, right? How about, ""There you are, Mr. Dependable."" Whatever, that sucked, but with a line like that, and Emerson's reaction, we can be given a small insight to him. 

Tell your friend that she needs to keep on writing. Keep on practicing. It gets easier, kind of.

Then you aren't particularly imaginative. 

Do you know of any governments that operate the way you suggest? 

&gt; There are 3000 dead american troops due to bad intelligence based on lies from our President.

Not our current President. 

&gt; They aren't coming back and yes, it makes me not trust the government.

That's nice. I was marching against Iraq back in 2003. And you know what? It was fucking hard. People were shitty to you. You don't trust the government? How about being smart enough to not trust them at the right time?

&gt; If that intelligence was public, this war would've never happened 

Fair point, but then again, I didn't need to see the intelligence to see that what we were doing was bullshit. Neither did the other people out there marching. 

What the Bush administration did was criminal. That said, the people were complicit in the crime. Jingoism and nationalism carried the day. 

&gt; Fuck no, I do not trust the government. They harmed my pocketbook and killed people I know.

You are a bad judge of character then. You weren't out there with me in 2003, but now you get one of the top 10 presidents of all time and you won't support him.

It looks like you just follow the crowd. 

&gt; That has nothing to do with freedom of speech. It's also illegal to lie under a number of circumstances.

How do those things not have anything to do with freedom of speech? I'm honestly asking. 

&gt; What I'm arguing about is the right to due process being taken away. EVERYONE - even non-Americans, have a right to due process. NO exceptions. It's in the constitution and written that way for a reason

All people may have a natural right to due process, but what is actually codified in the Constitution only protects Americans. Still, yeah, I'd probably agree that everyone has a natural right to due process. And everyone has a right to freedom of speech. And we accept minor compromises to these things in the name of public safety. And then people on reddit freak out an over react and totally ignore the amazing amounts of civil liberties they do have. And guess what? If you are arrrested, you are going to experience due process. All your bitching and whining and that is still true. 

&gt; Yes I would. I don't want to live in a country that doesn't want to be free.

Then you are a horrible person. 

&gt; And I doubt your elderly mom will be dead with your fucking dumb ass hypotheticals you keep throwing at me. 

Terrorist attacks aren't very selective to a particular demographic. 

&gt; Keep yourself blind, watch your money get stolen by these assholes,

You are incredibly ignorant. 

&gt; You live in a world of hypotheticals created by Fox news.

That would be the Fox News that I was criticizing before most people were aware it was full of shit? Yeah, thanks, you are a moron.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I'm gonna give this a shot being in Business School and having a Libertarian Business Ethics teacher. I don't think he says countries can't do quite well with those policies, however he probably believes that an Austrian-school free-market system is the most efficient and therefore the best, especially in the long-run. I think he believes these socialist policies can be quite successful in the short-run but they will ultimately be problematic in the long-run due to things like diverting money which could be used for innovation/investment into inefficient bureaucracy (inefficient is a relative term here compared to ideal free-market conditions) which is probably continuously growing (assuming government is not reorganized more efficiently or downsized or limited). Paul, as a self-proclaimed ""[US] Constitutional scholar,"" seems to be most concerned with his interpretation of the Constitution, arguing against the common interpretation of the term ""general welfware"" in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution and arguing that this does not allow for things like Obamacare (I say the term with bittersweet pride). What it all boils down to is his belief of market efficiency and the federal government not interfering in the least with [probably almost] any of the means of production (eg socialism: Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy). He would probably cite innovative companies like Apple (I just cringed but [the good parts of] their business model are something), Google, Netflix, and Amazon as examples of what a free-market has to offer. While it is not necessarily incorrect or correct to assert these things, these things, I believe, strongly depend on the mentality of people. Were companies like BP more aggressive in protective environmental measures or Wal Mart more caring for employee (a la Boeing engineers perhaps) to their employees a lot less people would feel less inclined to criticize the more pure form of capitalism advocated by Republicans, Libertarians and Blue Dogs.

The North Korean artillery in that area is set on rail tracks that rolls into fortified mountain caves, and the doctrine is to only have the bunker doors open long enough to drag the gun out, fire it once, and pull it back in to reload and repeat. In WW2 the Japanese had stationary guns on Iwo Jima and Okinawa in heavy mountain and earthen bunkers, and *the heaviest aerial and naval bombardment in all of military history* left them completely untouched in their bunkers, where they were then used against landing Allied forces.

If we have the North Korean artillery sites mostly mapped out, we can presumably use precision bunker busters or other appropriate weaponry on these locations. If not, well then... I wonder if there will be low-yield bunker buster nukes utilized.","1325378405"

One was broken by starting to bring my own lunches to work, another by adding c25k to my exercise routine, a third by cutting down on my coffee habit.  It's up to you where you can squeeze in more exercise or fewer calories into your lifestyle.

As a general recommendation: If you're already counting calories, try looking for places where your calorie counts are off.  Items that aren't being tracked, items that are being tracked at a lower calorie count then they really deserve, exercises that are being credited with too many calories burned, etc.  Even when you're using a good calorie tracker, it's easy to fool yourself when you want to.","1325378406"

I promised I would go ahead and do it unless somebody, just some human somewhere, did ANYTHING cool to mark the occasion and give me some hope. Some blessed fool put up a Space Odyssey monolith in a park in Washington. I decided I would take what I could get and postponed for a year.

The next year, I met the man who would become my boyfriend and later my husband. I also started meeting my housemates, the ones I'm living in better-than-you-can-fucking-imagine communal bliss with. I am about as happy as a stupid hippie can get.

But I didn't know it then. I was still all set to die in the first seconds of 2002, just like I was in 2001. If I'd gone through with it, if my life hadn't started turning around out of a clear blue sky and despite ALL my best efforts to fuck it up, I would have missed things that are... so good, I don't want to rub them in people's faces.

And I did _nothing_ right. :) Or at least, had convinced myself totally of that. I only bring up how awesome my life is now to contrast it with how absolutely worthless I felt in 2000-2002. And I can't promise you that similar things are waiting for you, dude. I wish I could and I wish I could make it so.

Marxism is, by definition, what the majority of the people want. Rarely in, say, USSR, were the decisions approved or even considered by the people. It was an autocraty, a dictatorship of a group of people under the illusion of freedom.

&gt;  You're trying to bury me in details, and I'm discussing generalities.

If you are making an assertion about  what evidence there is, you need to be able to look at details. So if someone says that a dog has never evolved into a non-dog, looking at an example where that has occurred is necessarily more detailed than what started. This is part of a more general logical rule: If someone claims that all X have some property, then in order to show that's not the case, the best thing to do is to find an X that doesn't have the property. 

In this context, actual discussion must involve actual details. At another level this shouldn't be surprising: you are talking about what one sees when one looks out at nature. Nature is full of all sorts of little things, so discussing it requires discussing the actual evidence.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Agree.

I'd see an explanation along these lines: atheists tend to be critical thinkers who don't enjoy marching in step as the religious do. Herding cats, kinda thing. Jonathan Haidt does talks where he explains how ""herd mentality"" tends to be part of the set of values of GOP/Christian/Conservative folks, and not of Liberal/freethinking people like us. EDIT: Most of us, sorry. I think that's a reasonable assumption.

I think being better organized might help with gaining and applying political and legal power. The FFRF, American Atheists and others, including Reddit to some extent, are helping a bit with this. But what grows atheism is the growing lack of faith among the religious, and that's proceeding on the efforts of individuals too, and in fact the most potent force in our favor are socio-economic factors that are effective with or without our help. Gregory Paul argues that modern corporatism is instrumental in dismantling religion in the US.","1325378457"

When I first started working there is was pretty amazing, then you get to see that most of these people are total a-holes. They always get their way, so you can never say ""no"" in fact it's a rule that we never say the ""n"" word, we apologize and say something else. Anyways, Keanu has been to our hotel several times, and he is the only guy that actually remembered my name, after about the 4th time checking him in! ""Wait, don't tell me....Ashley right?"" (not my real name :p), it was so cool, he has a great smile :) And a great sense of humor, he's also the most down to earth person, doesn't have a chip on his shoulder. Anyways he came in really early one time and his room wasn't ready, I told him we could switch it, but he said he would wait the 10 min or so until it was ready (no one ever waits and it was just bad timing). Anyways, this VP from a very well known corporation comes down with his daughter, basicly dragging her behind him, she's crying and holding her doll, he tells her to ""shut up and go wait for your mom over there"", he tells us he was late for a meeting and his wife would be back from shopping to get her soon so he wanted us to watch her. I called security over and a couple of guys kept a close eye on her (this happens alot). Anyways, Keanu saw the whole thing and started making funny faces at her, she started smiling and then after a few minutes he was playing peek-a-boo with the little girl for like 5 min. Then I kid you not, for the next 45min until the mom showed up he was listening to this little girl talk about her doll and describe all the things they do together. She had no clue who he was, it was so funny. The mom showed up and she ran over because they had to leave, but she whispered something into her moms ear then ran back and gave him a big hug and left. Then he finally checked in when she left. I've told the story so many times, he's treated as royalty here now.","1325378459"

Perhaps you are correct in saying that there is little one can do to control the behavior of their 1-year-old.  Parenting babies is not so much about controlling your child as it is learning your child's abilities and needs.  These parents know that their 1-year-old is well enough behaved that they can take her out in public without being disruptive to others.  If their daughter was fussy, poorly behaved, or cried a lot, being a good parent would mean either picking somewhere more baby-appropriate or leaving the kid with someone else for the evening.","1325378475"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","It kind of works both ways. You're being needlessly hostile to an earnest recommendation because you wouldn't want to be an ""elitist hipster d-bag"" (it's alright, you can cuss). I watched Pulp Fiction when I was like 14, and because I hadn't seen many films I probably would have pegged it as my favourite movie. This is the case for a lot of people. I've seen more movies now and while Pulp Fiction is a far cry from the best, I recognize that it helped me gain an interest in cinema. I was turned on to my favourite director, Sam Fuller, because Tarantino is always citing him as an influence. 

So yeah, Al_X_Gore is right to assume that Pulp Fiction is a favourite movie for people who don't watch movies. He's not being condescending; he's probably been there before. The worst thing you can do is write off his recommendations as elitist, which are all pretty popular and critically acclaimed among cinephiles by the way. He's just trying to help. ","1325378477"

But, the reason why some atheists tend to piss off non-atheists is because they *don't* share the same views on a certain things and aren't apologetic about it. We atheists are allowed to disagree and openly dissent. Do you think that there aren't many more Christians who are ""verbal, vocal, cocky assholes""? But they get to rub in others' faces because they're the majority. When ""In God We Trust"" is even on our money and there's no shortage of public prayer and pro-Christian billboards, why are atheists the ones who are seen as rubbing their lack of belief in people's faces for saying, ""Hey, not everyone is Christian.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Newer aircraft are more tolerant of emissions, but remember that most aircraft flying were designed many years before the flood of personal electronic devices on planes. So it's really *not* a design flaw since back then they couldn't foresee the issue, but it is a risk (albeit a very small risk) and the risk increases slightly during landing and takeoff.

In fact, cell phone use is already allowed on planes with microcells and when flying above 10,000 feet. Many airlines just aren't in a hurry to install microcells because of the cost and weight and the potential problems from passenger problems (talkers vs. non-talkers) ","1325378494"
"cowboys","t5_2re7g","I'd say a lot more's on the defense than on Romo.  He's had a good year, despite his injuries, Bryant's failure to develop, Austin's injuries, the lack of a RB for half the year, the youth, lack of talent, and learning curve of the OL, and the inexplicable turnovers (which haven't happened since week 4).  

The defense, in contrast, has shown itself to be unable to stop teams, including the Giants, with the game on the line.  Which is to say, as soon as teams start passing.

It's probably safe to say that every member of the sub is looking forward to the game with a pretty much equal mix of hope of success and expectation of ridiculous failure.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Short answer: The LED is hardwired. If it comes on, the camera is on. If you're worried, tape is your friend.

Long answer: Some web cameras will allow you to grab a few stale still images without the light coming on because of the way their drivers are designed. They implement a series of buffers that hold images from the camera; Accessing the buffer to get an image does not activate the camera. The images will usually be from the last time the camera was used this power cycle, but they might be blank/corrupt/out of focus.  Cameras that have worked this way include Phillips and some super-cheap cameras based on the CPiA and Spca chipsets. 

Other, newer ones, will allow you to grab a single still in a time so short the light is imperceptible. The image will probably be so bad as to be unusable, but sometimes you can get one out of it that merely has horrible exposure. Cameras that work this way include some of the Creative (and possibly Microsoft) branded cameras out in the last few years. ","1325378545"

How is it cost effective to feed, house, hire guards to watch over, kitchen staff to feed, counselor staff to mind massage, and the slew of other supporting staff roles it takes to support 1 offender a cost effective way to make license plates.

State agencies could have those fuckers made in China for 80 cents a pop.

Inmates get paid shit wages because most of their money gets yanked to pay their legal financial obligations and victim's compensation, and if they have child support, there goes that too. So by the time their done, their $1.50 an hour job is down to somewhere around .55 cents.

They are capped where I'm at to $55 a month. It's controlled because money is power and inmates with power will use that towards unsavory ends.

Yes it's shit wages, but their in prison as punishment, not as a job opportunity. The things they build or make are for government use, and are wildly more expensive than having private sector Asian labour do it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a bit late, but if you are interested in a reasonable explanation of chiropractic I could fill you in on some of it.  Where I am not a specialist, I can defer to authors who are specialists in evidence and research compilation.   I'm not a quack.  Some chiropractors are.  You have to be careful.  I consider myself extremely analytical, and I could not execute my job confidently if there were not evidence to support it.

This is not to say that the chiropractic profession has not shot themselves in the foot so many times they almost have no feet, however the medical profession has definitely done it's share of fear mongering against the profession (see the ""Wilks"" case where the AMA was found guilty of anti-trust and unfairly trying to eliminate the chiropractic profession.)

One thing you have to keep in mind when researching chiropractic online is that many of the people online are what I like to call ""extreme skeptics"".  They have little interest in understanding paradigms outside of their own, but have much more interested in simply dismissing any and all chiropractors as frauds and snake oil salesman while inflating their own egos and loading their cases with ad hominem.  

The research within the profession continues to grow, but the future of the profession as a whole remains uncertain. However, to say that millions of chiropractic patients who are helped by chiropractors every year are experiencing some sort of mass placebo effect is scientifically absurd, and much of the modern evidence supports this notion.  Placebo certainly plays a part, but there are some demonstrable physical and even physiological effects of chiropractic adjustments that go well beyond placebo. One of the main weaknesses of chiropractic research though is the fact that double-blind, placebo controlled studies are virtually impossible due to the fact that the doctor must put his hands on the patients to perform the adjustment.

Kiss down her neck, use a little tongue, find where her hair stands up if you kiss it, enjoy what you know she is feeling. 

Step 3: Gently stroke her, really feeling her, spreading the wet around, enjoy that this is the vagina of the woman you are crazy about, and you are lucky enough to enjoy it fully. Appreciate it's warm slickness, the plump readiness

Step 4: Move against her, still enjoying the feeling of her, allow your tip to rub against her hot wetness. slowly move the tip closer to the middle. Enter slowly and enjoy the feeling of the tip moving in and out always in contact with her tight opening. Slowly move further in as she arches against you desperate to have all of you

What if someone said ""Playing video games is sad, lonely, and depressing."" Someone who plays video games would look at that and say ""hey, I play video games, but I'm not sad, lonely, and depressed."" 

Someone providing a blanket offensive opinion on an activity that people partake in (casual sex or playing video games) *OR* a group people associate themselves with (being black) is equivalent to singling out any person who partakes in that activity or a person who is in that group.

You may not think of them as logically equivalent, because you view playing video games as being morally neutral and having casual sex as being morally deficient, but they are equivalent statements.

Me, or anyone else, being outraged at having casual sex ""being called sad"" isn't any kind of reflection on our own beliefs of our actions. It's righteous indignation at someone else who has no knowledge of our life or our choices attempting to shame us and proselytize to us.

It's a trigger for me because Christians and other religions use the same kind of shitty hand-wringing shame in their attempts to call being gay shameful or sinful. And saying ""we just don't like casual sex/the act of gay sex"" not ""the slut/the gay person"" is the same bullshit ""hate the sin, not the sinner"" mantra that pisses me off.","1325378583"

Not only are the Patriots and Packers more experienced in the post season recent history offense wins championships, not defense.  The most parallel comparison is the 2006 season, Bears vs Colts SB.  A truly elite defense with a good run game and a serviceable QB losing to an elite offense with a not good defense that can force turnovers when the other team is forced to throw to keep up.

Maybe they will manage to get to the QB like the Giants did in 07, but the Giants had more than a serviceable QB throwing the ball.

&gt;   And naturally, up until that life is fullterm it is unable to survive without the mother and thus it is part of the mother.

This is a false statement in every sense of the word.  Full term is defined as 37 weeks of gestation.  Viability occurs *way* before that point.

Viability is commonly accepted now at 24 weeks.  [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preterm_birth#Mortality_and_morbidity)

If you truly believe that a viable fetus should not be aborted then you are closer to pro-life than pro-choice.  A pro-choice person would believe that a fully viable 9 month infant can be aborted as long as the head is not delivered.  And, in fact, this is how the law reads and how late term abortions are done.

I was 16 and my brother was 18.  He had his license suspended so I naturally was forced to drive him everywhere.   On this evening I had to take him to pick up his girlfriend.  We picked her up and were driving to our house.  

We lived about 20 miles out of town in a nice rural community.  The drive used to be gorgeous but has since been developed (or demolished).  There was a light sprinkle and the roads became a little slick.  Going into our valley you had to take a winding road with a steep slope.  

Years earlier (~1989) another brother drunkenly crashed and totalled my mother's Bricklin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricklin_SV-1) on the same road.  He escaped unharmed.

On this day, coming around one of the curves I absentmindedly looked into the ditch and saw a motorcycle.   It was a harley and pretty nice.   I slow down and my brother tells me to ""hurry up and stop fucking around"".  I pull over and go look at the bike, bro gets out with me.  In the drainage ditch is a man in Biker's leather.  We know him, he's the father of a girl in our high school.   He's pale white, lying on his back, mouth agape, and a nasty cut on his head but there doesn't seem to be any blood.  His head looks like it is coming out of his chest as if he were trying to curl into a ball.  Later we found out that during the spill he landed on the back of his head which was pushed into his chest, breaking his neck.  He was not wearing a helmet but my father said that given the way he fell it probably wouldn't have saved his neck.

The rain is still sprinkling but everything else is dead quiet as my brother and I stare at this man, both paralyzed or lost in thought.  The silence was broken by my brother's girlfriend's shriek.  She wanted to see what we were doing and had gone into full blown hysteria.

At this point the man gasps for air very suddenly and loudly.  We are all caught off guard and startled.   This was before cell phones, so we had to drive to the nearest home and call 911.  My brother asks me to stay because his girlfriend refused to get out of the car again.  They leave and I'm alone with the corpse for about 10 minutes.

Shortly after they return, a highway patrolman comes.  He is comforting, but we're still pretty numb.   I tell him about the last gasp of air and he says it is fairly common and that the man was most likely NOT alive when we arrived and that we shouldn't feel guilty.   My father is a doctor and later confirmed that the man's injuries were in no way survivable.

After the commotion we go home.  My mom was a psychologist so she tried to counsel us.  This was very annoying, especially 2 years later when my best friend committed suicide and she tried the same thing. 

My brother's girlfriend was bat-shit the rest of the night.  She'd look out the window and ""see"" the corpse walking up the hill.  My brother takes her to his room to ""watch a movie"" which means fornication (we had a big house on 80 acres).   I thought it would be hilarious to go outside and start making noises and prance around in the rain acting like a zombie to scare her.

I was successful- she freaked out and starting crying thus cock blocking my bother.  

edit: added description of injuries.

TL;DR - Found dead guy, cock blocked bro.","1325378605"

[The case of ""Terman's Termites"" was dependent on Binet's IQ tests.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Studies_of_Genius). The ""IQ tests are rubbish"" meme seems to have come about as a progressive reaction against the [research showing that people of African descent, and in African countries, typically do badly on IQ tests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_bell_curve). Also showed that people in right-wing states typically do badly on those tests. This was perceived as information that would be used to justify racist policies, so people said the apparatus used to get the information (IQ tests) was rubbish. It also caused a lot of people to start popularizing the old idea of [""multiple intelligences""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences#Critical_reception). In my personal humble opinion, people seem to like this, because it's very ""everyone get's a trophy""- no matter how dumb you are, you get to call yourself ""smart"" in some way.

But IQ tests in particular, and psychological tests in general, are pretty exhaustively tested and researched, for years. Dismissing them out of hand is just ignorant. I'm pretty appalled that people rejected research because its conclusions were offensive to their other beliefs- in my own humble opinion, it's the progressive community's version of creationism.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","I found that argument rather odd and weak though. Basically they are arguing that Suarez is a liar because 2 sources (I will count Comolli and Dalglish together since Dalglish only knew what Comolli told him) gave similar interpretations of what Suarez told them was said. In the conversation with Kuyt, the exchange was in Dutch, how do you translate a phrase like ""Por que, negro?""? maybe ""zwart"" (the term Kuyt says he used) is similar, since it is used for this [friendly fellow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwarte_Piet), but when the case in front of you relies on subtle differences in language, translations into and back from a third language just make things much trickier. Sidenote: funny that so many people say Suarez should have known better about acceptable racial relations after being in Europe for so many years. I guess it is easier to condemn others than look at your own failings.

Anyway, the other conversation was with Comolli who says he has a working knowledge of spanish, but the committee seemed set making sure that he was known as ""fluent"" as shown by this strange, circular paragraph:


&gt;287- The referee recorded in his report that Mr Comolli spoke fluent Spanish. Mr Comolli
&gt;denied in evidence that he had told Mr Marriner that he spoke fluent Spanish, telling us
&gt;instead that he simply told Mr Marriner that he spoke Spanish. However, we do not think
&gt;that Mr Marriner would have recorded in his report that Mr Comolli speaks fluent
&gt;Spanish unless Mr Comolli had told Mr Marriner that he did. Mr Marriner did not know
&gt;who Mr Comolli was when he entered the referee's room, so it is unlikely that Mr
&gt;Marriner understood from any other source that Mr Marriner spoke fluent Spanish. Mr
&gt;Marriner says in his witness statement that Mr Comolli told him that he speaks fluent
&gt;Spanish, and Mr Marriner's witness statement was accepted by Mr Suarez. We accept Mr
&gt;Marriner's evidence that Mr Comolli told him that he spoke fluent Spanish.

So even though Marriner only met Comolli for a few minutes, he knows better than Comolli himself what level of Spanish he speaks, and it is not possible that he could take something like ""I speak Spanish"" to mean ""I am fluent in Spanish""? Not to mention that they wrote the statement to be ""Tues negro"" which should be ""tu es negro"" which should really be ""tu eres negro"". Wouldn't someone ""fluent"" have gotten that right? Is it possible that there could be a miscommunication between Suarez and Comolli on something as similar as ""Por que, negro"" and ""porque es/eres negro""? I know I've gone on for a long time about this, but it is hard to ignore problems in the reasoning behind the prosecution and I think it is important to note.","1325378642"

I've played around 300 games of SC2 and I've played plenty of Broodwar.  SC2's biggest improvement is in game UI which I admit is a big improvement over Broodwar but the units in SC2 are incredibly bland comparatively.  This is a point that's been made in other places but really what it comes down to is Broodwar was designed to be fun first and then balanced for competitive play later.  SC2 was designed to be competitive from the get go and in an effort to make sure nothing was imba they just toned everything down so much.  Additionally lets talk about that SC2 campaign.  I could find middle school writers that could come up with a better story and the dialog is absurdly cheesy.  Sure the SC1/BW campaign wasn't Oscar worthy or anything but at least it was coherent, the decisions characters made made sense, and you actually cared about them somewhat.","1325378645"

**118\.** We received evidence from four of Mr Evra's team-mates about what happened 
immediately after the game. They were Valencia, Hernandez, Nani and Anderson. Their 
evidence was given in the form of written witness statements. These were served on Mr 
Suarez on 16 November 2011 with the Charge letter. Mr Suarez did not require any of 
these four players to attend the hearing for cross-examination and so Mr Suarez accepted 
their evidence in full. **We proceeded, therefore, on the basis that the evidence contained in 
those witness statements is true and sets out what did, in fact, happen immediately after 
the game.**


**303\.** There are a number of other surprising aspects to what Mr Dalglish and Mr Comolli told

"DotA2","t5_2s580","You become a more effective Tinker by not maxing out March of the Machines first. It does not help your last hitting nor do you have any need to push out the lane. 

Edit: I'll just add things.

Also, get the bottle IMMEDIATELY when you have 600g. Your starting items were wrong too, but it was not an issue as Storm was an idiot (if he had checked your items he would have known to harass you if he was remotely competent - especially seeing as you went for March of the Machines which means you'd have less nuking power).

March only becomes truly powerful once you get your BoT up and can TP lane &lt;-&gt; fountain 24/7 to keep lanes pushed out.

Edit2: You don't even get a bottle? It's an AMAZING item on Tinker. Not only should you be controlling runes for ganks and regen but it also synergizes **extremely** well with BoT since you can spam it in the fountain while you're re-arming for BoT etc.

Edit3: You need to think of Tinker as having different roles in different stages of the game. Early game he is a powerful caster that can gank very well when rune-whoring due to 2 excellent, high-damage nukes. 

Mid game he's very useful as an anti-pusher and continued ganking due to a very global map presence and March of the Machines. 

Late game he has amazing CC due to Sheepstick + any other active item you pick up that works well with Rearm.

You were not doing anything at all to help out your team in the early game. Being 0/0/0 ~22 minutes into the game makes zero sense.

I know this is a low level game but things like skipping the bottle is just a very, very big problem on a hero that does so well with it. Your last-hitting is pretty good for your level so that's alright.","1325378656"

The stipulation, that the parents join my hired cleaning staff for the building and maintenance so they can get on the job experience so they can build their resumes. Or they provide me with a letter from a school every term proving they are enrolled in a program to better their lives.

Most importantly I would have a large black throne at the top of the office tower that would allow me to laugh maniacally over the city. And should I need to pass, judgement on new applicants who request exemptions to my prior rules.

"ruby","t5_2qh21","&gt; Why is this a problem? It would be a bigger problem if it was the other way around.

AR::Base provides a LOT of functionality, most of which is arguably metadata.  Granted, a lot of the functions, ala find_foo_by_bar are dynamic via missing method, it stomps all over the namespace of the class that is the model.  The model should not be a slave to the database, but the other way around.

E.g. If I have a class that has an attribute that is a structure that is circular array, or a tree, or something else that AR doesn't readily support -- the representation that is in the db to support such structures are exposed to the user of the class and its objects.  

It's nearly normal for synthetic keys, such as a User and its id to be exposed, just like a SSN is tied to my person.  But clever things like left and right in structures such as http://www.sitepoint.com/hierarchical-data-database-2/ just get in the way of users of those objects.  Further more, if you wish to persist an object to multiple stores, say a mysql db, google, a serialised file, something that does bulk inserts, your classes end up with way too many metods.

Hibernate and the datamapper/dao mappers are two/three things/methods that illustrate how it should be done.

&gt; While I am at it. Rails does not force you to use AR. You can use ruby DBI and write SQL statement all day long if you want. That's dumb of course but you can do it.

To get off the ground quickly, sure.  Some other ORMs let you do custom sql for insert/update/delete to override existing ones.   But once you are so heavily invested in AR, working your way out of it.","1325378684"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Hmm. Well first, I really appreciate the effort at an honest discussion. Second, I'm not sure how to reply to this. My inclination is to go through source by source, but I don't want it to seem like I'm just dismissing evidence. Here goes:

Josephus: the first passage is almost certainly compromised, as I think most scholars believe. Josephus would have been very unlikely to refer to Jesus as ""Christ."" The second passage is also questioned, although to much less a degree, as you acknowledged.

Cornelius Tacitus: this is probably the best account there is, even above Josephus. There are facts regarding Jesus' life instead of simply descriptions of Jesus as ""wise,"" etc. Still, the Annals are written some 80+ years after the events in question.

Lucian: this is not really a historical account of Jesus (at least the portion you provided) but of Christians. That same passage could be written today without changing anything much at all, and we wouldn't give it much weight as a historical source. Lucian, let's remember, is also over a century after the supposed death of Jesus.

Pliny: this is about Christians and not about Jesus.

Thallus: neither passage says anything about a historical Jesus.

Mara bar Serapion: I don't have much to say here. The reference is not explicitly to Jesus, there's not much in the way of a historical account (beyond ""murder of their Wise King""), and the time of writing is hazy.

Suetonius: as you acknowledge, this says nothing about a historical Jesus.

Celsus: written almost a century and a half after Jesus, FWIW. There is, however, some specificity and the author appears to be critical of Jesus (which could arguably add a degree of authenticity as to our central question).

Galen: completely useless, as far as I'm concerned. He puts Moses and Christ together ... clearly he's not purporting to have intimate knowledge of these figures.


So, again, I'm not simply dismissing all these references. I'm only offering my doubts. I don't view this as simply a counting game, where we scour the globe for possible references and, you know, six does the trick but three does not (if you understand my point). Instead, I tend to look at the strength of the evidence as a whole. Overall I remain incredibly underwhelmed by the evidence for a historical Jesus, but I assure you that I am giving it a fair consideration and not just looking for reasons to dismiss it.","1325378686"

Do you touch/hold her hand - If your hands happen to touch, let it lay there, maybe your arm around her?

Should You do something after the movie - YES! ask her if she wants to do something, suggest the bowling alley and a coffee at a starbucks etc

Do you try for a goodbye Kiss - Depends on how the date went. You'll have to sense. Sorry. 

Try to spend sometime before or after the date, just talking) walking with her to the subway or her home is good way.

Our True Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ Almighty, Holy Warrior and Master of all will not tolerate whores such as SighThouMayst. Adultery is in her heart with the way she begs for sexual attention with her provocative dress and the consumption of alcohol. Luckily, even for her, there is a way to escape the punishment of death and eternal damnation that she and all of us deserve.

We all have sinned and the punishment for sin is death and eternal suffering in hell with the false lord, Satan. The only way to escape this punishment is to accept our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, into our hearts. He died and rose again from the dead in order to defeat Satan and his prophets of evil and wickedness. Through Him, we can ask God for forgiveness and obtain the blessing of eternal life and happiness in heaven. It sounds pretty easy, doesn't it? It is. Accept Jesus or fuck off and die.","1325378695"

an extremely expensive sushi bar and ordered 4000$ of booze and food that they barely touched, only picked at. He walked out and left the assistant with the tab.

I recall one story of a guy that was moving, and he had part of his collection filling up his car's trunk.  As luck would have it, he got a flat tire somewhere on the interstate in this state.  It was late at night, and to get to his spare tire he had to empty out his trunk, which was completely packed with guns.  A KY State trooper pulled up behind him and was holding his flashlight so that the guy could see while he changed his tire.  The guy told the state trooper he had a big pile of guns from his collection in the grass on the side of the road, the trooper looked at them with his flashlight for a second and then said ""alright"" and put the light back on the tire.  After the tire change was done, the trooper said ""have a nice night,"" got back in his cruiser and drove off.

He has your back through thick and thin, but he doesn't worship you and he doesn't calculate his behavior to suck up to you. He treats you as his equal. 

Girls (and, I imagine, guys) generally desire this in a significant other.

As for how common it is, it really varies. Some people have slightly different preferences and compatibilities in this regard. For example, I'm a bit of a pushover and I get taken advantage of very easily, so I prefer guys who are a little bit of a pushover themselves. That way, no one takes advantage of anyone; we each give equally.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","This seems the issue may be with the main vacuum, I would suspect perhaps there was an issue somewhere in that.  1 volt seems very odd, and I doubt there is issue with the motor.  If I were you I would try this:

1. Completely disconnect the motor from the wiring in the vacuum.

2. Use an extra power cord from something (maybe an old computer, a broken lamp, just about anything would work) Leaving the plug, strip the wires on one end. Ignore the ground if there is one.


3. Connect the two power wires up to the wires on the motor, use wire nuts, or if there is a crimped connector, you might get the appropriate male or female end from a hardware store.  I have alligator clips on some heavy gauge wire that I like to use for this sort of thing.  It is designed for 120v 60hz according to the numbers on it, so direct current from a US wall should not be an issue,
4. Plug that into a a power strip that has an on/off switch, and plug that into the wall.  Before you turn the switch on, hold, or better yet clamp the motor down in something.  The torque from the  start up will spin that unmounted motor and possibly rip the wires out leading to bad things.

"obama","t5_1a8ah","&gt; I hate corporations taking our money and seeing the rich and poor classes drift farther apart at an alarming rate.

Fair enough. Ideally, I'd like the country to lean more left as well. That said, an important question is, how are you going to get there? Are you going to attack the party that was against *Citizens United* and for the *2010 Campaign Finance Reform Bill* because they aren't left wing enough for you? Ever heard the phrase ""the left eats their own""? How about the phrase ""the right will never speak bad about another right winger""? This is why we on the left are getting our asses kicked.

&gt; They have strong unions and now more freedom.

2011 was a good year for unions in the US. Some of the nuttier laws that various governors tried to pass got struck down or reversed. 

As for Germany having stronger unions, that is sort of a half-truth. Their unions enjoy more popular support, but they also may do less for their workers. 

&gt; We're letting the people who created Nazi's be more free with less room between the rich and poor.

Well maybe you should find your ass with both hands and start standing with the other people on the Left, instead of attacking them. ","1325378735"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Gotta cover this in two parts:

&gt;nobody will ever really know the truth about that kind of stuff until you're dead anyways

&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

If you're dead, you won't know anything because you're dead. A deceased body can't know much.

&gt;I mean, nobody will ever really know the truth about that kind of stuff until you're dead anyways, so why fight about it?

Why fight about it? Because there's a lot of people who abuse their ""faith"" to push their personal worldview on others. They force their ""faith"" into schools, into laws, and into overall policy. This presents a huge problem when you're trying to have a discussion on something and the other side CAN'T because their faith prevents them from actually having a conversation but also prevents them from realizing they should recuse themselves from the discussion. Your religion says drugs and alcohol are bad? Fine, you can avoid it. Don't force your beliefs on me because it's destructive and you can't change me just because you feel like it. You believe abortion is murder? Then don't get one. There's no pragmatic level of why a person shouldn't be able to get one (even health risks associated are a personal choice). You believe Israel is never wrong because your god was born there or you believe god gave you that land? You obviously have a level of bias that reason and level-headed discussion will *never* be able to overcome. This is a communication problem and people being completely unaware of themselves and their conditioning. An atheist, at least, has less outside influences and can try to approach things from a more measured stance with less outside interference.

Why fight about it? Because we want freedom, too, and your beliefs being pushed on us takes away our freedom.","1325378737"

Even if it's just a one-way trip and they plan on abandoning them at the camp site, it would be a shitload safer for everyone to be sleeping in SUVs or RVs.  The only zombie preparation I saw was some cans on strings around the camp.

However, it seems like the only people that left the camp were the ones running to Atlanta for supplies.  Lori told Shane that they should've put a sign up on the road telling people to avoid Atlanta when they heard Rick broadcasting on his radio, but Shane said they hadn't had time.  If they can't put out a simple sign, they wouldn't have time to look around for new cars.

On the other hand, the group running to Atlanta could try to take a vehicle or two every time on their way back.  It seems like they didn't think of that until Rick came along, which I find unlikely.","1325378739"

She probably realizes that she shouldn't be pressured to get married, but may believe that the people pressuring her have authority or receive revelation for her.

Cognitive dissonance can be a very uncomfortable thing to deal with.  There are two main ways to reduce dissonance: by changing an element of the dissonance and its importance or by adding a new element as a buffer.

You probably need to choose one of the following options:

* Be her friend for her, do nothing else, and support her during any potential fallout
* Help her realize that the church isn't true (we can certainly help with that here)

(If you're wondering: yes, I *did* find this out the hard way. Actually, the *especially* hard way: I locked it around my sensitive bits and only realized my mistake after it was locked on.

In the bigger cities, such as Dublin or Galway, you'll always find a bit of craic during the week.

He can't do anything about NDAA, it's already passed and was passed with a majority able to override his veto. 
The Controlled Substances Act, passed in 1970, is what places cannabis as a schedule I drug, and Obama cannot change that without that Act being modified by congress. So, yet another of your demands he cannot legally fulfill.

She would also hold prayer sermons for me with her family when I told them I was an atheist and repeatedly tried to get me to sit down and do a tarot card reading. You have to explain to her that just wishing those problems away will never help. That having ""faith"" that a random happening will cure your disease or bring you wealth will not do anything. You must really **push** the fact that the universe is both unbiased as well as completely random in it's decisions. ""The Secret"" is a book based on the fact that having faith will make something happen while subconsciously forcing you to pursue the resolution. It's supposed to be a new-age science and I encourage you to tell her that the universe will not put happiness in the palm of her hand.

"science","t5_mouw","To give you a context of how severe the situation was, she had a sinus infection for several months that wouldn't go away, then with in a space of a week she went to the hospital because she was having breathing problems, to being admitted to the ICU, for pneumonia, to being int abated because she couldn't breath on her own anymore. 

After that she was unconscious for three months before the doctors could diagnose the bacteria affecting her. I'm still conflicted as to why it took them so long to do a lung biopsy. But that determined it was a mutated form of pseudomonas. (before that they did a lumbar puncture)

After they figured out what it was, the anti-biotics got her breathing on her own within 48 hours. 

It took another 2-3 months to rehabilitate her back to into everyday life because she had been more or less unconscious. 

Edit: While they were treating her, they had to ween her off the Humira, and then get her on massive doses of prednisone for reduce the inflammation in her lungs. 

She still takes Mucinex every day, because current medical science can't completely kill pseudomonas, it's one of the most adapting bacteria known. So instead giving anymore anti-biotics, you cough it out.

TL;DR It was a real life episode of House. If possible, don't take Humira, there's a reason why it's used as a anti-organ rejection drug. She's taking a new drug now (I can't remember the name), that's not as reducing on the immune system) ","1325378789"

By definition, a government must enforce marriage contracts and dole them out.  So denying people the right to marry is a feature of a large, intrusive government.  It's not a libertarian position.

Also, if a state wants to allow same-sex marriages, then a big government could intrude on this and deny it the opportunity.

The basic idea is that you can 'cancel' a weaker move into a stronger move. Light = A, Medium = B, Strong = C, Launch = D. So for say Wolverine, you can do ABCD, Super Jump, BBCD for a combo.

Yes many wrong things developed AFTER the apostles died. Not any of them for the good.

&gt;The Apostles were the first Bishops of the Church however.

Sorry you are wrong, you may want to call them bishops, but if you read the book of acts the apostles main concern was doing what Jesus commanded. The book of acts was all about them trying to expand the preaching work Acts 5:42 shows they witnessed even to houses. 


&gt;No, and neither do the Orthodox Bishops and priests of today.

Yes they do I have to see an orthodox priest, or bishop, or church follower at my door trying to share the good news Jesus preached. You may not know what is going on out side of you areas or country but in some place the orthodox church officials are driven around in expensive cars and wear expensive clothes. You should be mindful of you WHOLE organization and what they are doing.

&gt;Well its obvious you know nothing of the Orthodox Church 

Again not to cause trouble bur like I said they arent at my door, JW are preaching in 235 lands producing FREE literature in over 500 languages, more then the U.N. by the way. All without doing tithing, or governments hand outs. Do you really think God holy spirit inst directing the work we are doing? We are the second fastest growing religion in north america after the evangelicals ONLY because they have over 1oo million more people then us.

The ones taking the lead in the JW org doing wear fancy robes, and gold sceptors and get driven around in expensive cars. AND they preach. I highly doubt any of your clergy at the top preach. If I could bet I would would put money on it.

&gt;Well its obvious you know nothing of the Orthodox Church 

I know enough to know the orthodox clergy have played a hand in JW getting beat up in our churches. I know that the JW spent the last 15 years fighting lies inspired by the orthodox church in the eastern block countries. Trust me I know more about your faith then you do.

&gt;and you may be preaching and teaching but you are teaching and preaching a man made deception.

If we are discussion man made deception, why is it we are the only faith that has achieve true unity, and peach the world over? Sorry but man made deceptions don't run that deep that people will acutally change their whole personality for the better. Ones who are under a man made deception, don't let the truth of God's word affect their hearts so every year they end up fighting in your places of worship, while you turn a blind eye.

Since we are talking about man made deceptions you are aware that the everything you beleive is a man made deception. The trnity and the word is not found in the bible. IN fact Luke the writer of the book of Acts warns all true Christians that after the death of the apostles new teachings will be grafted on. 270 years later you guys are voting and grafting on the trinity.

Hellfire and God burning people is another lie. 1 John4:8 says God is love. Eccl 9:5 says the dead are not conscious. Yet you carry on the lie God burns people because you want to stay ignorant of the bible.

Going to heaven? Nope the bible doesn't say mankind will all go to heaven. Ps 37:9-11, 29 says the wicked will be removed and the righteous preserved to live FOREVER on the earth.

Matt 7:13,14 is a very critical scripture you should actually read. Verse 13 says the majority are on the wrong road. What do the majority beleive? Hell fire, going to heaven, trinity. Hmmm!!!! Verse 14 says only few are on the road to life so ask yourself what do the few beleive. You should acutally find out, it means your life.

&gt;They are, you're not.

We arent? How many times have JW come to your door? How many times has an orthodox come to preach, not knowing you live there? ZERO. ","1325378823"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","The logic of the article is absolutely atrocious (cue: the SEP members saying ""The article raises criticisms, is this really all you have to bring to the conversation? Pfft, I would expect nothing less from a silver-spoon-using-petty-bourgeois-educated-upper-middle-class-ISO-shill."")

The ISO's article is about the lockout and the picket, it is not about the USW. But here's the thing, the USW mobilized its members for a picket in solidarity with its workers, this is something that should be celebrated. The article was not about the USW, and I will apologize to the WSWS that the ISO does not take every chance it gets to shit on any form of organized labor.

Now to address some of the individual points of the article. 

&gt; An article by Shaun Harkin posted December 16 on the ISO‚Äôs web site, socialistworker.org, is little more than a hack piece written for the benefit of the USW officials. There is not a word of criticism of either the USW International or Local 207-L. Nor is there so much as a suggestion that more aggressive action should be taken to halt the scabbing, or that the union should call out the other Cooper Tire plants, including the Texarkana plant, in solidarity with the Findlay workers. The idea that the union should provide strike benefits to the workers is 
not broached.

This criticism of what is not in the article is laughable because even if the above items were written about, WSWS could have chosen 10 other things to nitpick for not being there.

&gt;The ISO, supposedly an ‚Äúinternational‚Äù organization, does not criticize the union‚Äôs promotion of ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù economic nationalism as a means of lining US rubber workers up behind ‚Äútheir‚Äù bosses and pitting them against their class brothers and sisters internationally.

The ISO has criticized this in the past. Perhaps the reason why it's not mentioned here is because it is a farily long argument; one can't simply say ""economic nationalism (aka ""protectionism"") is bad."" A [recently republished article by Ahmed Shawki](http://socialistworker.org/2011/09/16/dont-buy-buy-american) illustrates why protectionism is bad, not only from an internationalist point of view, but also from an (USA worker centered) economic point of view, and Shawki actually argues that such ""nationalism"" is bad for unions in particular. 

&gt; Today, bosses in the U.S., Britain, Japan and Germany are all blaming workers in other countries for the crisis--and laying off more workers because profits aren't high enough. Meanwhile, the need for steel and other products has grown, not decreased.

&gt; Accepting the import controls arguments leads inevitably to giving up the struggle for workers' living standards and interests. They disarm unions. Owen Bieber, the UAW's new president, says, ""I don't want to suggest that you will never see a strike again by this union in the United States, but on the whole, you are going to see a lot more cooperation than 10 years ago."" Sweet words to the ears of General Motors.

&gt; Worse, import controls are also racist. They blame foreign workers for our problems--claims to the contrary aside.

Back to the WSWS article: 

&gt; Finally, the ISO holds up as a model for the Findlay workers the referendum mounted by the unions and the Democratic Party that overturned an anti-workers‚Äô rights law imposed last year by the Republican governor and Republican-controlled state legislature of Ohio. ‚ÄúThe struggle against SB 5 [the anti-worker law] galvanized Ohio‚Äôs labor movement and demonstrates the spreading mood of resistance,‚Äù the article declares.

This is hardly ""holding up the model [of] referendum,"" Harkin's statement is saying that the labor movement has been emboldened over the last year, and this was illustrated by the referendum and everything leading up to it. I openly criticisize that fact that the unions waited until now to mobilize, but SB5 created a moment where workers rights were the central issue. WSWS seems to miss the fact that the referendum was part of a larger struggle that included that largest protests that Ohio has seen in years and a struggle that agitated an enormous amount of people.

The WSWS article goes on to suggest that the SB5 issue was a non-issue because it ""[promoted] the fiction that workers can defend their rights and conditions through the Democratic Party and by seeking to pressure the institutions of the capitalist state."" I agree with the criticism of the unions and the movement--I have been critical of this movement's view of the previous (Democratic) governor, who froze pay and cut wages and jobs, as a governor in exile--but I do not got to the extreme that WSWS does in discrediting the entire thing. This follows WSWS's general logic that anything that is reformist ought to be shoved off, which is the largest criticism I have of the organization's platform. Apparently, protest isn't worth it unless it's going to lead to the revolution tomorrow.","1325378825"

 I guess we will have to wait until these pills come out to see whats up with them. I really wonder if hydrocodne is dangerous to IV like I've heard from some places or if it'll work just fine.

but let's look at it pragmatically: there is no other third party candidate presently that stands a chance of winning a primary, let alone an election. presently, the US is stuck between a rock and a hard place as far as compromising morals go. simply saying that ""well, if you did something differently, we wouldn't be in this mess,"" helps *no one*. 

I proffer that to vote for Ron Paul, one doesn't even have to support him. a vote for Ron Paul is a vote for a decidedly different kind of politics -- one that goes beyond bipartisan bickering. a vote for Ron Paul is a vote for a third party candidate, and in no time in recent history has a third party candidate even stood a chance of coming close to winning the election. 

if you wish to inspire people to come back to politics, to fulfill their civic duty, I think what's most important is reminding them that there ARE alternatives, and that those alternatives can be viable. 

* I recognize Ron Paul isn't technically a third party candidate at this moment in time, but few would think of him as a true Republican. ","1325378846"

I was charged with getting this guy to pay his rent at a trailer park. Went to his trailer and got no reply from knocks and shit. His car is there - no one's seen him for a day or two. The curtain on the door is a little ajar so I press my face up to it and cup my hands around my eyes to block the glare and - 

There's a fucking clown laying on a coach just inside the door pointing a fucking revolver at me!! Serious!

Turns out the guy shot himself in the mouth while reclining on the couch. When he slouched and found his final resting place he was still clutching the revolver, which was pointing at the door. It was a day or two since it happened so he was all white with a dark ring all around his mouth from blood (that looked like a clown face makeup in a quick glance). One of the scariest damn things I've ever encountered. I HATE clowns. Was pretty shocked.


Second worst was finding a body in flood waters just kinda drifting downstream at a decent clip. I reached out with a boat hook (not a real hook - a boat mooring tool for ropes) to try securing the body beside our boat for retrieval and her arm just pulled right off like well done chicken from a bone.

I gotta say I am fortunate not to have you as my math teacher. Then again, I had some of my math teachers said similar things to me. First day of Calculus class, the teacher went on a rant about how Calculus is different and how we have to take notes. (Similar to your rant about how you can do fine in Algebra 1 class but not Calculus) I made sure I did not take note for a single day. I was still the first one to finish the tests like I did with the other math classes that I took in high school and prior to that. I have other example of teachers thinking a certain way is the best way.

I'm not saying your way isn't the right way for most people. I'm saying your way is the wrong way for me. I feel bad for those of your students who are like me. I wish more math teachers would see that some students have different approaches to solve math problems. For me, I like to understand the concepts behind things. I need to understand ""why"", not learning how to master the ""methods"". The methods seemed dumb when I was learning, and they still seem dumb to me now. Too often I see people get the methods down without understanding. Math is hard if you can't understand what is going on.

Texas should have a case then.  I agree Texas should be given more than a year to adjust if they have had less than a years notice that they were included.  But I have little sympathy for the owners of these plants.  Their engineers have probably been asking for a decade for the company to invest in new equipment for the plant, as it hasn't exactly been a secret that the standards would eventually be tightened.  My impression is that they have been making an economic decision not to update their pollution equipment because they were old outdated plants.  Since the plants have been fully paid for any extra length of time they can keep them open without investing new capital is just gravy for the company.  It makes more sense to spend a few million dollars on lawyers and lobbiests to delay the implementation of the rules than it does to refit and update the plant.

"bf3pc","t5_2t7ev","The reason the list had to be deleted was because it was Vio1ent's idea. Not mine. It wasn't EIN's, but Vio1ent's, the idea of one person. 

The goal of this subreddit is NOT to recruit for EIN. It's just like it says at the top:

&gt; Find people to squad up with. You should always have someone to play with. If you feel like hopping in-game, make a thread and let us know, we'll see it and add you on Battlelog!

When the subreddit started to gain more and more members, we put our servers and TeamSpeak info in the sidebar. As more and more members began to join our TeamSpeak from bf3pc, both EIN members and bf3pc members got along, and many decided to join EIN, as they would have access to competitive play. 

You keep stressing that EIN is interefering with this subreddit. We've not pushed any rules on this subreddit, except the removal of that list, which wasn't my idea, so I was technically stealing that idea from Vio1ent. 

If you look at the other posts, everything is operating smoothly, and efficiently. People ARE finding others to play with, and are enjoying the game more than they have before, which is the goal of this subreddit, as stated before. 

If you feel that EIN is imposing too strictly upon this subreddit, than I'm sorry, but we've not once said ""you cannot play on this server, or cannot join this TeamSpeak"" or anything of that nature. I'm already aware that other members of bf3pc are offering TeamSpeak servers to play on, separate from EIN. The only way EIN imposes on this subreddit is by offering their servers and TeamSpeak to play on. 

Jeebs, after speaking with Vio1ent, he's okay with a list being remade. I already messaged you with details on that. ","1325378903"

Granted, other bacteria killers such an astringent with pure ethanol (i.e., Sea Breeze) can help but it WILL dry out your skin like no other.

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is copypasta from AsABlackman

So there's a lot of misconceptions about the NDAA - long and short of it is that it does not authorize the indefinite detention of American citizens. And no, I don't care what Glenn Greenwald says. His reading of the statute has some massive holes in it - and it only works if you ignore 1021(e) in relation to the rest of the bill.

The NDAA specifically states (in 1021(e)) that existing due process law is unaffected by the NDAA.

Background on due process law: Court cases from Boumedienne, Hamdi, and Hamdan: The Supreme Court ruled that due process cannot be taken away if:

    You're a citizen captured anywhere in the world - like John Walker Lindh (American Taliban guy). This is based on Fourth and Fifth Amendment due process protection. Or

    You're a foreigner captured in an American jurisdiction - like the Underwear Bomber (based on the Fourteenth Amendment).

So 1021(e) says that the NDAA does not modify existing law on the detention of US citizens. Which law is this? Due process law. More specifically, Boumedienne, Hamdi, and Hamdan (and to a great extent Ex Parte Milligan). These cases mandate due process for any American citizen, even when captured abroad. Due process is also mandated for non-citizens if they're captured on American soil (or an American jurisdiction). Ex Parte Milligan also precludes the use of military tribunals on citizens if civilian courts are open.

Boumedienne makes it clear that habeas is available to anyone held in American custody, and that if habeas is suspended, there needs to be a workable alternative to allow detainees to challenge their custody. Habeas is related to, but distinct from, due process. Habeas is the right an individual has to challenge her detention. Due process is the burden the government must bear to impose detention or punishment. Habeas can be suspended because of a national emergency, but the NDAA, the Patriot Act, and the AUMF have not done so. So habeas is untouched and available to anyone in American custody. But back to due process.

1021 also only applies to two kinds of people

    A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks.

    A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.

If you think ""substantially supported"" or ""associated forces"" is too broad, keep in mind that these groups also have to be engaged in hostilities against the United States. So this exempts people who innocently/unwittingly associate with al-Qaeda or Taliban members (the support isn't substantial enough). It also exempts people who support groups that aren't engaged in hostilities against the US, or didn't help with/plan 9/11.

And even if you did associate with them, if you're an American citizen your due process rights are never suspended. Ever. Not even under the NDAA. The government has to produce enough evidence to convict you beyond a reasonable doubt, otherwise you go free. You can always challenge your detention in court since the NDAA does not suspend habeas corpus. Remember that due process is a constitutional right that cannot be suspended by statute. 1021(e) makes it clear that the NDAA does not affect existing due process law.

Also, believe it or not, you don't lose your citizenship by being accused of supporting al-Qaeda or deemed a terrorist. The government will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt before citizenship is stripped or any other punishment is imposed. Edit to add: someone pointed out to me in the comments that the Eighth Amendment (through Trop v. Dulles) doesn't allow natural-born citizens to be stripped of citizenship as punishment.

The indefinite detention power in the NDAA only applies to foreign fighters captured during hostilities. How is this justified? Under the laws of war, a sovereign nation has the right to deprive its enemies of personnel and materiel for the duration of hostilities. It's the same rationale that allows countries to hold prisoners of war without trying them. (It wouldn't make sense to try an enemy soldier for following the lawful orders of his superiors).

The problem here is that al-Qaeda and the Taliban aren't sovereign nations, and it isn't clear whether their fighters are following lawful orders. This is a gray area - and the NDAA deals with it by giving the military the option of turning over captured fighters to their home nations for prosecution under their criminal systems. They can also be brought here to America and tried as well. Or they can be held as prisoners of war and treated accordingly until hostilities end.

The other problem is the number of detainees at Gitmo that the United States cannot/will not release because (1) the detainees will probably go back to terrorism, but we cannot try them after the Bush administration tortured information out of them (2) they don't want to go back because they fear torture or reprisal (3) no one will take them in. This issue is complicated, but outside the scope of the NDAA itself.

Third problem: when will hostilities end? Easy answer is ""when Congress says so."" But that doesn't really solve the problem I stated above. It's also beyond the scope of the NDAA as well.

TL:DR: NDAA doesn't take away your due process rights, nor does it allow for indefinite detention. How do I know? As a black man, I make it my business to know when/how the government does its arresting. Due process is a constitutional right, and cannot be abrogated or changed by statute. I also read the fucking bill.

For trans youth, just living as their gender can be extremely mentally painful day-to-day which makes for a unique (and particularly painful) situation...

&gt; It occurred to me while answering that post on /r/parenting that the fine denizens of /r/lgbt may well have well distilled, practical advice for young people that is better than what we have in the /r/atheism FAQ for kids still at home, but who worry (with good reason!) about an extreme reaction if they tell their often quite religiously conservative parents. 

I think the ""standard"" advice is that if they're still entirely dependent on their parents and they think there's a decent chance of their parents going apeshit, then they should try to stay in the closet until they can get out of the family home and somewhere safe.  That usually means finishing up high school.  They should do what they need to do to maximize their safety. 

It's surprising how many of the youth that get that advice have an objection to that, actually.  They feel bad about ""exploiting"" their parents.  They shouldn't.  Parents have an obligation to protect and support their children, queer or not. They shouldn't feel bad about doing what is necessary to survive.

Once basic survival is no longer in question (senior high school, after high school, college-aged youth, etc.), it becomes one of balancing having their family in their life and the benefits of that (financial support for school, their company, etc.) vs. being out and being true to yourself (a release from the fear and oppression, opportunities for romance, sex and companionship).  I personally lean strongly towards being true to oneself.  If someone has to burn their bridges to do so, then so be it.  

But it's a personal choice, and again, the personal cost of being closeted LGBT is probably higher than a closeted atheist (not to be dismissive of the difficulties faced by atheists with fanatically religious families).  It limits your romantic, sexual and social life tremendously.  I'd be more willing to recommend for an atheist to ""stay in the closet"" than someone LGBT in that case.","1325378917"

There's no inconvenience in clicking a few times and transferring a domain name. There's no inconvenience in typing long-winded bullshit about why GoDaddy is evil. Want the perfect example of how reddit acts when it does require inconveniencing themselves? Origin and EA. ""We hate Origin so much, but must play shootan games...""
I hate 4chan, but reddit seriously needs to take at least one lesson from there: the ultimate futility of online discussion, and the absolute buffoonery of those who take part. 4chan is completely self-aware of this ""faggotry,"" as they'd call it.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I posted this elsewhere but I'm posting this again because it needs to be read:

You are misinterpreting what the signing statement does. This is actually quite badass on his part. Congress' job is to write the laws, and it is the executive branch's job to enforce them. The signing statement is Obama saying he will *not* enforce the law as Congress intended it. If you read the whole statement, Obama goes over each problematic section and explains why it either is not a change from the status quo or why he can (and will) interpret it in such a way as to make the provision meaningless, or why the provision is unconstitutional and therefore can be ignored. Read the whole statement. Here are some highlights:

&gt;my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law.

...

&gt;While section 1022 is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty, I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations.

...

&gt;I have signed this bill on the understanding that section 1022 provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it, and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement...under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention.

...

&gt;Section 1028 [...] would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. [...]In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict.
...
&gt; should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.

**TLDR: The purpose of the signing statement is to provide a legal case for Obama to simply ignore the problematic parts of the legislation. He signed the act but this is him promising not to enforce large parts of it. Obama is not betraying us.**

What Obama is doing here is very similar to how Bush used signing statements as almost a line item veto: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statement#Controversy_over_George_W._Bush.27s_use_of_signing_statements

"funny","t5_2qh33","One of the world's best inventions is the spoken language.  Unfortunately, we can't rub antennae together and know exactly what the other person means.  I could say, ""I love you."" or I could say, ""I *love* you."" and most people would automatically assume the latter is filled with my affection because of inflection, but I digress.

There are several people in the world, so it's ignorant to start off a philosophy with, ""There are three types of people in this world."" or the like.  (I'm not accusing you of doing this by the way.)  People will believe whatever you tell them if you present it right and deny them of information.  This is why there is so much agony related with SOPA for instance.  One could say that, ""God *loves* you and wants you to love Him"" or ""God loves you and wants you to *love* Him."" (Some people will become outraged just for the capitalization of the pronoun) It's the same thing right?  People are/aren't dumb depending on how it's assessed.  So if there's a simplistic outlook on religion there are three types of people in the world, they are the ones being controlled, the ones controlling, and the resistance.     

Now this is where it gets extremely opinionated, so don't rip me a new asshole if you don't agree.  Sadly enough, people found VERY VERY early that fear and the unknown go hand in hand, and if used properly people can become controlled automatically rather than someone exerting energy to keep people in line.  Religion is an invention much like language, but the detriment far outweighs the benefit.  While modern Christianity is like the eldest child of 3 that sleeps in a vat of radioactive material all his life.  He may be deformed, but the other kids still look up to him because he has experienced more throughout his life.  There's nothing wrong with believing in something that encompasses straight-forward, moral attitude.  Using scriptures that denote socially taboo acceptable without properly taking into account the historical context or the application to modern times is unfair but extremely easy (Ok it's funny too sometimes.)  

So let's say that the oldest, intact Bible is from the 8th century.  During it's travel through time, politicians, greedy men, and rhetorical masters have been in charge of distributing the Bible.  While much has changed, I think that well before the King James Version, (17th c.) the Bible was something completely different. 

As for the Christian Bible being intolerable, I'd agree with you.  There are many factors that contribute to this pattern of thinking (Cultural, time, personal experience, etc.)  The Bible may have been complied for good, but if someone gave the power to control the world to one man or group it is destined to be corrupted, especially over 13 centuries.  It's impossible to determine that someone is a Christian even if they say they are.  There are plenty of priests, politicians, and preachers that are not Christians, but use religion to benefit them in a way that is unacceptable.

I don't dispute that we're running out of oil, but everything I've read puts estimates somewhere between your incredibly lowball figure and 20 to 30 years.  Since we're not citing sources to back up our numbers, you can do with my figures what I did with yours. Scoff or consider, dispute or disregard. Either way - without data they are just opinions. 

I guess the only thing unfair about your reply is that I feel it assumes I am operating with the mind of a child. That's cool though, it's certainly not the worst way someone has talked to me on the internet, or in real life!  I'm adult enough to not sweat it. 

I understand that resources are finite.  Do you really think I didn't know that?  It's obvious that a model based on perpetual growth can not continue unabated forever.  These are not responses to my feeling that we can pull through, because I don't believe we need MORE CONSUMPTION to pull through. I don't believe that in order to still be ""Us"" we have to continue living as we have for the last 30 years. Things can change in unheard of ways almost overnight.  

Let me ask you, was the world wide web a multi-billion dollar industry 20 years ago?  Did users of web forums have enough political clout to inspire comedians to host rallies?  Could web users wield the kind of clout that causes businesses to backpedal and rush to reverse their support of unpopular legislation?  We both know they didn't. The point of this is that things change.  As I stated before, our culture is in a constant state of flux.  There will always be new businesses, new resources, (physical or intellectual) to be used.  Huge frontiers of new technology are always opening up.  

It seems to me that you look at us running out of oil as a sign that everything is coming down around us. They sky is falling and everything will end in tragic ruination. I see us running out of oil as an incentive for the brightest creative minds of the world to innovate.  Crisis and adversity drives the creation of new technology and science, which in turn fosters industry and the economy. 

U.S. hegemony isn't ironclad. Our reign has been short, less than 100 years.  It may have been caustic in some places, but - the average living conditions and lifespan of the average human on Earth is better than it has every been at any point in human history. We're living longer, happier, healthier lives on a global scale.  It is an unprecedented time of prosperity for the human race.  Yeah, there is some fucked up shit going on, but it is *always* getting better.  

Civilizations do come and go. We are no different. I never said we were. I just said I don't think it's our time. Not yet. A slactivist friend of mine told me 6 months ago he expected to see revolution in the U.S. by the end of the year.  I disagreed, and I still do.  The U.S. has another 40-50 years *minimum* as a leading nation in the world. (notice I didn't say *the* leading nation) This is obviously, as per the constant use of ""I feel,"" and ""I think,"" all just my opinion. I'm sorry but your stating of basic principles of consumption hasn't swayed my belief, because those things were already factored in.  

Remember, everyone thinks Rome ruled for 1000 years and then collapsed and was never heard from again.  The truth is that Rome changed a lot. Changed it's name, it's capitol, and it's sphere of influence was drastically reduced.  But the New Roman or *Byzantine* empire still enjoyed success and prosperity for an additional 1000+ years after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire.  Rome's got nothing on us. We aren't done yet.

The biggest thing you need to remember when designing these things is, rather than trying to create entirely new effects to match flavor, try to dig up existing card abilities that would be appropriate for the card.","1325378931"

Lay it out in simple terms without legislative jargon, and the like, so the average person realizes and understands the repercussions for such a bill.

Her Autoattack is terrible, but hey, its something that has to do with her animation. If you can lasthit with other champs, you can also lasthit with her.

She isnt underpowered at all. LeBlanc falls of Mid/End Game. Kassadin is easy gone when focused. Anivia stays Powerfull trough the whole Game. Solid DPS AoE ult with low CD. AoE Stun (1:1 Ratio) Heavy low CD Nuke (1:1 Ratio) and a Passive that is THE attention drawer.If you build even a bit tanky, going into passive form will give your team a huge advantage, because the enemy can do the foloowing: Focus your or your team.

Kassadin is strong, yes, and its Naturally that Kassadins&lt;Casters. He is an Anti-Mage- ofcourse he is better than her, because he is the counter to her. What youre not understanding is that, even thought Anivia is hard to be good with, as soon as she has a Team that fits her playstyle, she literally Wrecks. 

She relys on hitting Q. Thats the only thing, next to W, that you need to learn about her. When to use Q, because, as I already said, players that start a Nuke with Q, will not deal the damage their hoping. Exception is when you know youre gona hit it for sure.

So there's a lot of misconceptions about the NDAA - long and short of it is that it does not authorize the indefinite detention of American citizens. And no, I don't care what Glenn Greenwald says. His reading of the statute has some massive holes in it - and it only works if you ignore 1021(e) in relation to the rest of the bill.

The NDAA specifically states (in 1021(e)) that existing due process law is unaffected by the NDAA.

Background on due process law: Court cases from Boumedienne, Hamdi, and Hamdan: The Supreme Court ruled that due process cannot be taken away if:

    You're a citizen captured anywhere in the world - like John Walker Lindh (American Taliban guy). This is based on Fourth and Fifth Amendment due process protection. Or

    You're a foreigner captured in an American jurisdiction - like the Underwear Bomber (based on the Fourteenth Amendment).

So 1021(e) says that the NDAA does not modify existing law on the detention of US citizens. Which law is this? Due process law. More specifically, Boumedienne, Hamdi, and Hamdan (and to a great extent Ex Parte Milligan). These cases mandate due process for any American citizen, even when captured abroad. Due process is also mandated for non-citizens if they're captured on American soil (or an American jurisdiction). Ex Parte Milligan also precludes the use of military tribunals on citizens if civilian courts are open.

Boumedienne makes it clear that habeas is available to anyone held in American custody, and that if habeas is suspended, there needs to be a workable alternative to allow detainees to challenge their custody. Habeas is related to, but distinct from, due process. Habeas is the right an individual has to challenge her detention. Due process is the burden the government must bear to impose detention or punishment. Habeas can be suspended because of a national emergency, but the NDAA, the Patriot Act, and the AUMF have not done so. So habeas is untouched and available to anyone in American custody. But back to due process.

1021 also only applies to two kinds of people

    A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks.

    A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners.

If you think ""substantially supported"" or ""associated forces"" is too broad, keep in mind that these groups also have to be engaged in hostilities against the United States. So this exempts people who innocently/unwittingly associate with al-Qaeda or Taliban members (the support isn't substantial enough). It also exempts people who support groups that aren't engaged in hostilities against the US, or didn't help with/plan 9/11.

And even if you did associate with them, if you're an American citizen your due process rights are never suspended. Ever. Not even under the NDAA. The government has to produce enough evidence to convict you beyond a reasonable doubt, otherwise you go free. You can always challenge your detention in court since the NDAA does not suspend habeas corpus. Remember that due process is a constitutional right that cannot be suspended by statute. 1021(e) makes it clear that the NDAA does not affect existing due process law.

Also, believe it or not, you don't lose your citizenship by being accused of supporting al-Qaeda or deemed a terrorist. The government will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt before citizenship is stripped or any other punishment is imposed. Edit to add: someone pointed out to me in the comments that the Eighth Amendment (through Trop v. Dulles) doesn't allow natural-born citizens to be stripped of citizenship as punishment.

The indefinite detention power in the NDAA only applies to foreign fighters captured during hostilities. How is this justified? Under the laws of war, a sovereign nation has the right to deprive its enemies of personnel and materiel for the duration of hostilities. It's the same rationale that allows countries to hold prisoners of war without trying them. (It wouldn't make sense to try an enemy soldier for following the lawful orders of his superiors).

The problem here is that al-Qaeda and the Taliban aren't sovereign nations, and it isn't clear whether their fighters are following lawful orders. This is a gray area - and the NDAA deals with it by giving the military the option of turning over captured fighters to their home nations for prosecution under their criminal systems. They can also be brought here to America and tried as well. Or they can be held as prisoners of war and treated accordingly until hostilities end.

The other problem is the number of detainees at Gitmo that the United States cannot/will not release because (1) the detainees will probably go back to terrorism, but we cannot try them after the Bush administration tortured information out of them (2) they don't want to go back because they fear torture or reprisal (3) no one will take them in. This issue is complicated, but outside the scope of the NDAA itself.

Third problem: when will hostilities end? Easy answer is ""when Congress says so."" But that doesn't really solve the problem I stated above. It's also beyond the scope of the NDAA as well.

TL:DR: NDAA doesn't take away your due process rights, nor does it allow for indefinite detention. How do I know? As a black man, I make it my business to know when/how the government does its arresting. Due process is a constitutional right, and cannot be abrogated or changed by statute. I also read the fucking bill.

You are misinterpreting what the signing statement does. This is actually quite badass on his part. Congress' job is to write the laws, and it is the executive branch's job to enforce them. The signing statement is Obama saying he will *not* enforce the law as Congress intended it. If you read the whole statement, Obama goes over each problematic section and explains why it either is not a change from the status quo or why he can (and will) interpret it in such a way as to make the provision meaningless, or why the provision is unconstitutional and therefore can be ignored. Read the whole statement. Here are some highlights:

&gt;my Administration will not authorize the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens. Indeed, I believe that doing so would break with our most important traditions and values as a Nation. My Administration will interpret section 1021 in a manner that ensures that any detention it authorizes complies with the Constitution, the laws of war, and all other applicable law.

...

&gt;While section 1022 is unnecessary and has the potential to create uncertainty, I have signed the bill because I believe that this section can be interpreted and applied in a manner that avoids undue harm to our current operations.

...

&gt;I have signed this bill on the understanding that section 1022 provides the executive branch with broad authority to determine how best to implement it, and with the full and unencumbered ability to waive any military custody requirement...under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention.

...

&gt;Section 1028 [...] would, under certain circumstances, violate constitutional separation of powers principles. [...]In the event that the statutory restrictions in sections 1027 and 1028 operate in a manner that violates constitutional separation of powers principles, my Administration will interpret them to avoid the constitutional conflict.
...
&gt; should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding.

**TLDR: The purpose of the signing statement is to provide a legal case for Obama to simply ignore the problematic parts of the legislation. He signed the act but this is him promising not to enforce large parts of it. Obama is not betraying us.**

What Obama is doing here is very similar to how Bush used signing statements as almost a line item veto: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statement#Controversy_over_George_W._Bush.27s_use_of_signing_statements

&gt;&gt;While an ordinary Deverry craftsman would have drawn a falcon as a circle for a head on top of a pair of triangles for wings, Otho‚Äôs work was a lifelike side view, detailed to give the illusion of feathers, and yet it was only an inch tall.

So side view, of a falcon going for a strike, done in a realistic rather than overly stylised style.

I have used the tipsy tow service twice since it was introduced. The first time, it took 4 and a half hours for the tow truck to arrive, and the driver didn't seem happy at all to be there. The second time, my buddies and I ended up leaving the car and taking a cab home, because we have gotten no response from the local tow company after almost 3 hours since AAA supposedly dispatched them. 

Keep in mind, AAA is a corporation, and the main purpose of offering this service is for marketing. Use it when you're out of options. Call your friends (or mom) first before relying on AAA, this way you don't end up drunkenly freezing to death outside of the night club, or where ever else you might end up tonight!

"AmIASexyQueer","t5_2t7uh","Hooping is SO easy. Seriously. I never thought I could even make the hoop go around more than once, but it was explained to me like this and it clicked instantly: (I have since taught other people this way and they also get it instantly.)

First you need a relatively heavy, large hoop. A heavy hoop will be about two pounds--I make starter hoops out of 1'', 100psi PVC piping. You can get it at the hardware store but they only sell it in amounts that will make 7-10 hoops. There's tons of stuff on Instructables for making hoops. I digress. But a light, small hoop will not be good for your first time.

Get your hoop.

Stand with your feet hip-width apart, but step forward with your left foot. (This is if you are hooping counter-clockwise, which is how my roommate and I do it. Reverse everything if you're gonna go the other way.)

Start hooping. Don't ""hula"". You pretty much just want to do a back-and-forth pelvic thrust. No side-to-side motion. You want the hoop to hit your body on your left hip bone and your right love-handle.

Try this for 20 minutes. You WILL get it. Once you get the basic hoop motion, you can start spinning in place (both directions! Very important! With the hoop AND against the hoop), and once you can spin, you can begin learning tricks, like the vortex.","1325378964"

We'd lived together before, when I was 15, and we'd gotten along well enough then so we figured it'd be a good match. Oh, how wrong we were. 

Not only did she almost constantly sexually harass and molest me when she found out that I identified as bisexual, but she had absolutely no consideration for the fact that I lived there, too. She didn't spend much time at the apartment (we shared a studio because it was all we could afford in Southern California), except to occasionally crash if she was nearby or to bring people over for a party. I'm not the partying type at all, so sometimes I'd go to my grandmother's house for the weekend and let her have the place to herself. Which would've been fine if she didn't let strangers sleep in my bed without asking and leave beer cans and alcohol all over my desk (which was especially worse given that I'm a bit sensitive about alcohol in general; my mother was an alcoholic and I just associate it with her bad days).

Once, while I was away for the holidays, she threw up in the bathtub and then left it for *five days*. The reason she didn't clean it up right away? Because she had to go to work in the next town over early the next morning and she just stayed at her dad's house for the whole week. She was also supremely messy in general, with so much stuff falling out of her half of the closet and the dressers that I could hardly get to my own shit most of the time.

Another time she told a friend of hers that he could store some of his boxes in our apartment while he was between places, once again without asking me. I wouldn't have minded if they hadn't taken up a quarter of the already tiny living room area (also my bedroom area, with the way we split the space up) and completely blocked the sliding glass door and only window.

About 9 months into our year-long lease, she decided she wanted to opt out early (which we were allowed to do before a certain date as long as we paid a fee of about $1000). I didn't want to be a bitch and force her to stay, but I wasn't keen on being forced out, either, so I told her I'd go as long as she paid the fee. She fought me on it for months and she still owes me $400 for my half of the security deposit (which they wouldn't give back until she paid the fee in full). 

And because that wasn't enough, she called me the day that the fridge rental place came to get their fridge back, and asked me what to do with the food that was left. I told her to donate anything that wasn't opened and throw out the rest. She says okay, and I figure everything's fine. I show up to get the last of my stuff a couple of days later and find that she decided just leaving the food all over the counters and on the floor was the same thing as taking it to the dumpster five feet from our front door. I also found that she'd used three of my nearly new white towels to clean up something mysterious that was brown in color and that I really want to believe wasn't shit.

Well, that was a long rant. Needless to say, we're no longer friends, but I'm such a non-confrontational little doormat most of the time that she may or may not actually know that.","1325378968"

"Korean","t5_2rd8q","There are I think seven politeness levels, of which it's important to know four. There is the non-elevating formal, ÌïúÎã§, polite informal Ìï¥Ïöî, casual informal Ìï¥, and polite formal Ìï©ÎãàÎã§. Most people start out learning Ìï¥Ïöî because it has the widest range especially in basic conversation, and the casual informal form derives straight from it. This is the fundamental like way to conjugate verbs, and you alter the ending based on the last vowel in the root (discounting Ïúº). You can read about that here: http://learnkoreanlanguage.com/Korean-Verbs.html

This doesn't just change based only on target, but that's the main part I guess. If you're friends with someone who is your coworker, you still use formal speech during a meeting or whatever.

In Korean the verb is the location where you put most of the lexical shit in the sentence. For instance, phrases like ""in order to"" or ""because"" or ""therefore"" and ""if"" all get shoved into the verb. These aren't ""sentence endings"" proper, but you have to learn how they get tacked onto verbs. But also you need to learn other conjugations for questions/commands/propositions and so on (for some of the speech forms). Really imo ""conjugation"" isn't a good term for what you do with Korean verbs.","1325378969"

But then I played a year of plenty and built a settlement with it. Another time, I convinced someone midway through the game to cut my friend's road off with his settlement in exchange for most of the ingredients for a settlement. still another time, I got people convinced that a development card I'd been holding on to was a single point. Then, right when I hit eight points, I played it and it was my third knight to claim largest army. It's moments like these that keep me playing.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","My calculus exams back in University usually only required you to solve 4 problems (sometimes split into subcategories, such as problem 1.a, 1.b etc.). Each exam was 3 hour long and you couldn't use any calculators or other similar tools to help out.

This meant each problem usually took a few pages of handwritten calculations to solve.

When you are doing multiple pages of calculations, for just a single problem, a single irrelevant error can lead to a completely wrong final solution. Yet those multiple pages of calculations can still easily show the professor that you actually perfectly understood the method he was testing you on. In those cases, the teacher can be 'lenient' and give you a full or near-full grade for your answer. This is because the final solution isn't actually what he is testing you for. He is testing to see if you understand and know how to apply a certain method (or a set of methods).

Until you come to me wanting to dismantle property ownership though because of the procedural violence of it, then stop talking about opposition to force because you clearly aren't serious about it (and I am not emotionally moved by your pro-authoritarian (when it comes to property) anti-authoritarianism (when it comes to currency) -- YAWN).

Btw, I don't care what people want to do when it hurts me. People bought a bunch of scam gold from Glenn Beck, but that doesn't make those interesting or reflective of rationality. Gold currencies will hurt me. So I oppose them. Don't hurt me. So long as we use government aggression and violence to invent property ownership, we need to make sure people aren't harmed by currency stupidity.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","This is a Chinese way:

Line a pot or wok (not nonstick) with foil. Put a pinch of tea, a teaspoon or two of brown sugar, a pinch of uncooked rice (optional), and a pinch of five spice powder (or any of the individual component spices, optional) on the foil. (You can do it without foil, but it will make a mess of your wok/pot). You can experiment with different spices. The key is the brown sugar--it tends to melt and cover all of the other spices, causing everything to burn and smoke fairly evenly.

Put the salmon on a steaming rack above the smoking ingredients. Make sure there is enough room for a lid to cover. Heat the wok/pot over medium-high heat until the ingredients are smoking. Put the salmon in and cover. You may have to wrap the edges of the lid with foil to prevent smoke from escaping. Leave the heat on for 5-7 minutes, then turn off and let sit for an additional 10 minutes or so (time can vary depending on thickness of fish and desired doneness).

This works well with most firm-fleshed fish (I especially like doing this with mackerel). I prefer using lapsang souchong over green tea, though--it is already smoked over a pine fire, which provides a very nice flavor.

Also even if there was evidence to say that Nintendo licensed Phillips to make a Zelda game for Nintendo, Nintendo has made it quite clear that the CDi-zelda's are not canon games, and are not part of the Zelda series or timeline.

NDAA is a response to the Greece/London riots and OWS. The politicians know exactly what the future will look like and they can see that OWS is just a step away from a nationwide riot. If a nationwide riot occurs, there isn't enough police, let alone courts to handle the situation in any reasonable manner. They therefore need NDAA to corral rioters in FEMA camps will they put down the rioting. The last thing they want to do is put a million people on trial over a weekend riot.

As a teacher, I do not give a fuck about whether or not you get the correct answer. Why? We have computers. They can do that for you. In fact, I use them all the time to solve problems, but I still fully expect my students to be able to do calculus by hand, and understand the terminology. If my students don't understand that, they won't know why they're screwing up solving more complicated problems with the computer later on.

Oh, there's an extra factor of 2 floating around? How did that get there? Well, if you're trained in analysis, you'll figure it out. If you're trained to churn out numbers, *you might not know anything is wrong.* You have all the same flaws as a computer, but you lack the computing power. Understanding the context is vitally important. 

We want engineers that don't forget that factor of two when they build bridges - the software they wrote won't tell them they're wrong. We want our cell phones to stay on in an emergency because some software designer troubleshooted all the *logical* math errors in the phone. We want even non-technical types to understand why they are putting numbers into a calculator, so they aren't gypped by subversive and deceptive marketing.

 You sound really jilted that people held you back for not learning what you need to know, but you know what? I agree with them. They should hold you back just as long as it takes until you know what you need to know. Otherwise, the world will be filled with a bunch of self-entitled idiots who think that they somehow deserve to advance. Not saying you yourself are among a class of idiots, but that's what abandoning such policies would produce. Fact of the matter is, if you cannot follow some basic instructions and use field standard terminology, *you will be a crappy contributor to society.*","1325379054"

We had a particularly cold and snowy winter and apparently that was not enough to deter her from her trip to the store.  She made it to the store, and all the way back to her front porch where apparently she sat down to catch her breath.  She never did.  I found her a couple hours later laying on her side in the snow that was piled up on her porch.  Her skin was blue and ice cold.  Just a surreal scene.","1325379066"

The reason being that a vast majority of top lane champions are melee so your ranged autoattack is free poke and is great for allowing you to push them off the creepwave and sustain as well with wriggles.

In terms of being OP, I'm not completely sure where I stand there.

This kind of hipster/jazz scholar bullshit is what's keeping the music out of the hands of the people. People are actively NOT listening to jazz because people like you tell them that they can't possibly understand it without years of study. Well Fuck Everything About That.

Maybe MMW isn't as technically skilled as your favorite new horn player of the week, but that isn't the point. 

The point is that MMW lays down a funky groove that people have a lot of fun listening to, and maybe after that they'll see that there is plenty of other jazz out there that they might like as well. Its all Jazz. You'd like to be able to package it up in a little box and write a thesis about it and say, ""this is jazz, but this is not""...and you can't. Jazz has a remarkable ability to be all things to all people. 

If you want to be a jazz scholar, fine, go do that, if that's how you feel most connected to your music then great, but keep your pretentious bullshit from coming between the rest of us and our music ya fuckin' peckerwood.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","You are partially right, sometimes people trade freedom for security, and sometimes they trade it for the illusion of security.  We are required to give up some liberty for basic security, ie we don't have the freedom to murder people without consequences, in exchange for people not having the freedom to murder us without consequences.  However people seem only too willing to give up liberty for the sake of pretended freedom.  However the massive pains the tsa did is/where for the sake of the national psyche, to make people believe they were safe traveling, basically an extension of the placebo effect.  The thing to remember is person is smart, people are stupid, and fear makes them stupider, so some of the stupid things done was/is to make people feel safer.  Ignorance is important if people are to continue living their lives uninterrupted by fear.  Now though what is happening is that people believe that you must trade in liberty for security, therefore if they trade in liberty they must be becoming more secure, which is of course logically stupid, but how people think.  It is very interesting to see how Bush traded on fear to gain more power for the government, in a similar light to how Hitler/Mussolini gained power through fear in the 30's.  The German people were led to believe that there were serious security problems so they began surrendering more and more liberty, until they found themselves in serious problems.  [Please note, i did not say that Bush is Hitler, or is like Hitler, just some of his actions are not dissimilar to Hitler.]  Now to lighten the mood, a youtube clip of Yes Prime Minister where they explain the purpose of National Defense.

&gt;* Character XP gained = Skill level acquired

&gt;Example: Training alchemy from 20 to 21 gives 21 Character XP points

&gt;* XP required to level up your character = Current level * 25 + 75

Leveling up give you a choice of health, magicka, or stamina (and carry weight) and one point to spend on perks.  It's the first time I haven't felt an Elder Scrolls leveling system was pants-on-head retarded.","1325379088"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It is too easy to point at a university or 2 that has been aided by Christian groups and think that all is OK. Historically, religious sects have oppressed science when it becomes too uncomfortable. Baghdad's Universities, destroyed, Alexandria's library, destroyed, Gallileo, the Dark Ages, the Inquisition, witch burning; (should I go on...) all due to religious belief.

This is still happening with Christian sects having their own universities that do their best to discount the rule of science and discredit DNA, evolution, historical dating and anything remotely against Biblical references. In Africa ""missionaries"" still utilise a combination of biblical teachings and traditional culture to get numbers into their Churches, with minimum interest in the sociological impact upon the spread of AIDS, witch burnings and the previous cultures. Such simple facts as the impossibilities of Noak's Ark are discounted. Judaism and Islam are no better in their oppressive approaches.

if you allow a child to see the world with open eyes and make their own judgements without all the insidious influences of religion, then perhaps there will be less mistrust of differing cultures, comprehensive schooling, honest questioning, less homophobia and gender equivalency. 

Children rely on adults to teach them about the world, before they take on the responsibility for it as adults. The least we can do is impart wisdom, respect and honesty.

If you think 3 paragraphs on Reddit by some anonymous guy carry the same weight as hearing the words from the guy who wants to be President of the USA, I'm sorry, I can't agree with your logic.

I didn't say it had the same weight, I merely said it isn't impossible to get a broader view without having to get it directly from the horses PR mouth.  I mean, Obama just presented a quite detailed signing statement, how did that go down around here?  I doubt anything he'd say to his base would be any different, those who are loud are those who demand a veto, pretty much no matter what.  Consequences be damned.  I doubt that'd work very well either.

As for what bills to comment on, lots of people here would like to hear about SOPA, others about anything regarding pot, anything related to gay marriage / DOMA would hit a good part of the base, there's still a debate on the beginning of life and abortion which matters deeply to a lot of people...  What's important varies, with the way NDAA looked as it got signed, I'm fine with Obamas allocation of resources.  It sucks, but it's probably the best compromise possible.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I too used to work at a public library, in small rural town in Georgia.  it's been a while, but here's what I can remember:

* most of our weirdos were homeschoolers and their families. one day, this kid that couldn't have been older then 8-9 asked me if I was a liberal or a conservative. I hesitated before telling them I lean liberal, and he immediately started moaning and groaning and pleading with me to ""switch."" I told him I would think about it. it made me sad that he was so young and his shitty parents had him so thoroughly conditioned and indoctrinated. I saw him again ten years later managing a Chik-Fil-A in the mall while looking very forever-alone.
* there was another lady who would always return her books absolutely reeking of garbage and animal urine. we had to leave her bookson the side walk behind the building for a few hours every time to air out before we reshelved them. we finally barred her from returning after she returned a sack full of books full of cockroaches. every book we opened, it was like an avalanche of roaches. so gross!
* we had so many cheezy romance paperbacks that we didn't even bother keeping track of their circulation. they were all donated so we weren't loosing any money if they didn't get returned. there was one lady (who probably owned thousands of cats) who would come in every two days without fail to get a fresh grocery bag of romance novels. I couldn't help but imagine her masturbating furiously, for hours on end, from the comfort of her recliner soaked in equal parts cat piss and old-lady-love-sauce.","1325379122"

"OneY","t5_2s5ni","I don't really care about the whys or wherefores. I'm actually pretty sure this exact same article was posted here about a month ago and we had this same discussion. My main problem is that it's talked about at all - whether it's lying or boasting is irrelevant, the sheer fact that it's spoken about as a factor reinforces every worry a man could ever have about it.

The number of times I've overheard women remarking on cock size when they think they aren't to be overheard is staggering, and what's more worrying is that none of them know a fucking thing, but fail to realise it. From a partner exaggerating the size of his penis so she now thinks all five-inchers are over eight, to her fucking an eight-inch guy and thinking that's what does it for her when she fails to notice (because she can't see between her legs) that she only actually takes the first four inches. But still we're told to our faces ""it doesn't matter"" and ""it's what you do with it that counts"". But then you overhear discussion that leads you to wonder otherwise.

I dunno, I know guys can talk on trashy subjects too but I've never been part of one of those conversations, as I'm sure many women have never discussed a guy's cock size. But unfortunately all it takes is one incident to ignite that little spark of insecurity.

The worst thing is that you can look up every statistic and measure it to the millimetre, and even if you know you are factually significantly above average, as I am, it does nothing to assuage that anxiety about it. It's a niggle that won't fuck off, regardless of your size. That's the most fucked-up part.","1325379153"

If the district manager noticed a girl with mascara on, he would ask that she be given a warning. No fingernail polish is permitted, but toes can be red, pink or french tip. I was a manager there, and I was not allowed to hire anyone who was, lets say, more than chunky. Guys had to be clean shaven for every shift, and were sent home if they were not. Their hair couldn't be long either. Our district manager has what is called ""cast of"" list of the top 10 best looking girls and guys in the store, if you have enough to meet his criteria. One kid had semi-long hair (enough to gel it back to the nape of his neck) and he was not a part of cast of, and once he cut his hair he was ""allowed"" to be on the cast of list. Their rules are ridiculous and everyone who is higher up in the company (and even some assistant and store managers) treat the company like they cure cancer or something.

Unfortunately we have a huge population problem in the world today, which means that for the first time in my lifetime wheat is actually worth some money, so no one is putting anything back in grass anytime soon.

If there is a bright side to this it would be that during the recent droughts in the southwest part of the country we have not seen the kind of erosion that we experienced during the Dust Bowl years. Modern farming practices appear to be doing a little better.

I am not arguing that it is a good thing to have a monoculture. I have thought a good deal about the risks. I still live with them every day. Pollan and his ilk over simplify the situation. My high plains grassland is under tillage and raising wheat because wheat is profitable. Raising wheat is not a bad thing. People need wheat. Bread and Pasta are made with wheat.

But it's more like waiting all day at work knowing at some point in the day I will cry, coming home, taking a shower, eating dinner, little bit of personal internet stuff, sitting alone in my living room, maybe have a beer or two, crack open another, watch a bit more television until something reminds me of him.

Then that's when all hell breaks loose.

The first year I probably cried 2 hours straight.  But this year will be the sixth year since he's been gone so it will likely be in the 20 to 30 minute mark.  I know I'm going to cry, I just never know what it is will trigger it.

Hell, maybe I have to go into my basement to get something and see his guitar in the corner.  He had no will, so my grandparents told people just to take what they wanted, all I wanted was that guitar and one Zippo from his collection.  I was offered the deed to the house but I didn't want to live there or have to deal with selling it, because, I'd have to go back in the house to show people around.

My grandparents, his parents insisted I take the entire Zippo collection though which was nice of them.  I just wanted one.

Then irony for me came full circle when they asked me if I wanted one of his guns.  To be honest, up until then I didn't know he owned a gun, let a long guns.

I have a few guns for protection purposes and the occasional shooting range trip with my friends.  I don't want a gun that my uncle could possibly once held in his hand contemplating whether to kill himself or not.","1325379197"

Scorched Earth gives him great regen to mitigate harass, as well as what would be a free Radiance in lane, either to push or farm peacefully. Devour gives him not only bonus gold but a way to farm while staying behind creeplines - basically, if he is taking heavy harass, he can use Devour to get some gold and XP safely.

You can't take away his STR because of his role towards lategame - a tank who can output significant damage with his skillset, Radiance, Aghanim's and Refresher.

I was in a very horrible marriage with a really nasty piece of work for 8 years, one day I just had enough and made A Plan. When he was out scoring some drugs I had the locks changed on our house. This gave me time to grab what I could carry in bin bags, and gather up my two children and my dog, he was screaming and swearing at the door as I calmly called the police. It took him 6 hours to get out of the police station as he needed to prove that it was his address and the police don't take kindly to hearing ""I will kill you bitch!!"" , by which time  I was long gone.  I had nothing but my children a border collie and some clothes, the only house I could get was in a absolute shit hole surrounded by junkies, but I was *free*

I moved way out of the area and he has no idea where I am, he hasn't bothered to try and find me because *my* son  is disabled and he knows he would have to pay child support, also after **6 years** the courts would tell him to jog on if he went for visitation. 

So yes I'm on my own, I have the drink *I* like to drink, *I* have the remote control, I'm on my computer not giving one single jot what he's up to and am not even remotely worried that I'm going to hear my possessions being smashed downstairs. 90 mins ago I woke up my daughter and we had a new years cuddle and it was gloriously peaceful.

Roman wars were virtually always a matter of conquest or defense, but like the Popes of the Dark Ages that wielded armies for financial rewards, religion was but a tool of the wicked and power hungry.

Religion has always been a separate entity from politics although the two have been at times inseparable. Just as now, religion and the indoctrination methods tried and perfected by many faiths are used by despots in an attempt to elevate themselves to the level of a deity.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","""Rendering"" is when the computer uses math to make the visuals output. Shadows, reflections, colors, everything you see on a movie or a game is calculated with math.

Video games are rendered in real time, which means that the computer is doing the math to make what you see on the game as it is displayed. Ten seconds of rendering on a video game is 10 seconds of gameplay.

Movies are prerendered, which means the computer has plenty of time to do the math. Ten seconds of a movie can take two minutes to do the math. With more time to render, there will be better quality.

A good gaming computer has, lets say, eight gigabytes of RAM. The more RAM, the faster something can be rendered. Avatar, the 2009 film, took 140 terabytes of RAM to render (among many machines), which is about 18,000 times more RAM.","1325379217"

Every few seconds in game, ask yourself what the best thing you could be doing at that moment is.  Constantly scroll through the F keys to check on other lanes or look for gank targets.  If your top lane is overextended, and the jungler just disappeared near middle, alert him to a possible gank.  Look at the other team's summoner spells while the game loads.  If someone doesn't have flash or ghost, they are likely the easiest to gank.  WARD WARD WARD your lane.  If 3 of the enemy are about to take out your top turret, and you can't stop it, take advantage and push the bottom turret, or rally the rest of your team to dragon.

I played 10 games at 762 elo on a friend's account.  It was elo heaven.  The other team was so much worse than I was, that I could win all of our lanes by ganking from level 2 on.  Nobody warded.  If you are in a low elo range, there is a reason.","1325379219"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","You need to talk to him. There's really no other way of dealing with this. It won't be an easy discussion, but it's important for him to know how you're feeling so you can both work together to fix things. You avoiding sex just because it doesn't last long is one of the worst things you can do. He's probably feeling like you're not attracted to him anymore because of this. 

How long is his refractory period? Most men last longer on their 2nd or 3rd rounds. So have you tried getting him off with your hands and/or mouth and then him pleasuring you while waiting for him to get hard again and then giving sex a go? While losing weight and eating healthier will most probably improve things, there are [other things/techniques](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/prematureejaculation.htm) you can try to help him last longer. Try not to be mad at him or blame him for this. I'm pretty sure he would love to last longer. So being angry about this won't help either of you. 

In terms of the way he's going about losing weight/becoming healthier, HE has to want to. You really wanting it isn't enough. He needs to see the benefits of eating better and exercising. If it's that hard for him to go work out, then he clearly isn't enjoying it. What activities does he actually *like* that involves getting the heart rate up? Whether it's joining a sports team, going for walks/hikes with him, taking a dance class, whatever it is, if he actually has fun doing it, he'll be motivated to continue on, which then makes eating healthier a bit easier.

I've even cried about it on multiple occasions. In fact, the only good thing that came out of it is that now I understand the wisdom behind making these things haraam. 

A couple things that have been made more difficult. First thing is that I have a lot of trouble staying away from partying now. Every now and then, I just feel like the only thing that can make feel is drinking or smoking. It's intense at first, and at least for me, the urges keep coming back. Sadly, sometimes I fall for my base desires and every single time I feel like I've betrayed Allah. 

On the subject of girls, it's all about honesty in my opinion. Most of those people you refer to do not tell their spouses about their past lives. In my opinion, that is starting a relationship on lies. Alhamdulillah, I am now married, but I was turned down by girls just because I was open with my past. That was probably the most demoralozing  thing for me. No manner how much I tried to convince them that I had changed, they just didn't want to risk it. And I completely agree where they are coming from. Luckily, my wife is very understanding and helpful, but that's only because she went through her fair share of troubles as well. 

And to leave on a positive note, remember that Allah will reward you for sacrificing dunya in the akhira. You should ask yourself, would you rather enjoy yourself now or reap the benefits of your good deeds in the hereafter?

We've been airing out the mattress next to a window for two months already, and if the weather in March-April (I'm due in April) is warmish and dry, we'll let it sit outside in the sun whenever possible (Japanese people do this with their futons several times a year to disinfect them).

Big cuffs make you look shorter. It looks like your torso is roughly the same length as your legs so this has a negative effect.

Your jeans are a straight or relaxed fit. You're not really muscle-bound enough to fill them out -- tighter jeans are *in*. Try something tapered that gives you breathing room through the seat and thigh but makes a nice profile at your calf.

Your shirt-sweater-tie combination is very conservative. While you may just be starting rebuilding a wardrobe, don't be toooooo conservative with what you're wearing. In RES resize the picture to about a 1/2""x1"".. it looks black and white!

Backstory: I recently went to a friend's wedding, and she's one of those quirky do-it-yourself (even if it ends up looking like a trainwreck) types¬∞ (see note below).  The bride's and groom's immediate family didn't grumble about the festivities¬∞¬∞, but I heard a few far-flung relatives muttering about how they expected something more ""traditional"" since the bride's father is quite wealthy, elaborating that adding heirloom jewelery does not make a home made satin slip gown into a wedding dress and that the small, dimly lit venue was ""not what they were expecting"".

Go fuck yourself, you old biddies-- if you knew *anything* about the bride you'd have known that it wasn't going to be a lace and baby's breath event!!




¬∞ The centerpieces were lava rocks that had been spray painted with matte brown paint.  Guests assumed that they were chocolates and tried to eat them.

And what would you have us do with people who have drug addictions?  We have to treat them if they show up at the ER, the most expensive point of treatment.  If they go to prison, it costs even more.  I really don't see any other way to care for them.  We can't check every ER admit for drug addiction before we decide whether or not to treat them.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I'm from a small town of less than 20k. Everyone knows everyone. For some reason, the town has produced quite a few athletes and well connected professionals. There was a celebrity golf tournament going on one weekend, and they somehow managed to pull Michael Jordan as one of the celebrities.  This was years and years ago when he was still married to his wife.  Well, this tournament is a HUGE thing for the town, especially with Michael Jordan participating. He drove by the school I was attending and waved to everyone out of his limo window. Kids went apeshit. 

Here's where it gets lovely. There was a 24 hour cafe that we would tend to hang out at in the evenings. Small town, not much else to do. After several cups of cocoa, I'm out of money and go out to use the pay phone to call my mom. As I'm dialing the number, Michael Jordan walks in with 2 women and 2 bodyguards trailing him. I whisper into the phone for mom to come and pick me up and BRING THE DAMN CAMERA. I make my way back to my table of friends and see this fucking 'sports hero' with one girl on this lap and the other kissing all over his neck. Neither are his wife. So, in the middle of a country restaurant located in the middle of the damn woods, this guy is getting freaky with 2 females at a dinner table. It was quite a display and of course we weren't allowed to take pictures or even talk to him.

I've also met Charles Barkley and despite what an asshole he seems, he was a genuinely nice guy and was very complimentary. Just proved to me that apparently no matter what field of entertainment you are in, acting is part of the deal.","1325379264"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","There are two card ""families"" to choose from, Nvidia and ATI. Many people have no preference, many others are loyal to one and hate the other. Each family has it's own pros and cons, and you can find those with a little google-fu.

I am running a Nvidia GeForce 560TI. My laptop is running an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870. I personally have no preference, although obviously my desktop card is much more capable.

First off, what size case and power supply do you have? Can you fit a video card inside, or is it already pretty tight? If this was a store bought computer, chances are your power supply sucks, as they usually keep them pretty low wattage, 400 or so. I run a 750watt PSU, which I would recommend as a minimum for future proofing other additions to the computer.

[This website here](http://www.tomshardware.com/charts/graphics-cards,1.html) has a ton of resources for comparing different cards and how powerful they are. Then you can start running some price comparisons on Newegg.com, Tigerdirect.com, and Amazon.com to see what your budget will allow.

One last thing; a video card may have several ""assembly"" companies. For instance, my 560TI was manufactured by Nvidia and assembled by Nvidia. However I can buy the exact same card, but branded EVGA, Asus, or Gigabyte. Now I may be wrong, but it is my understanding that these companies are assembling the product based on the manufacturers specifications, and therefore they are incredibly similar, but a ""shittier"" company may have a few more flaws. Perhaps someone can educate me on this.","1325379269"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Dishwasher at an Italian restaurant back in Richmond VA while I was in HS.  The staff was entertaining as hell and I learned a lot from the owners.  I was the only black kid working with a family of Italians and a few other white people, but they all treated me like a brother/son.  It was pretty hard work, but it was worth it just being around them.  They ALWAYS fed you before a shift and they also let you make your own food to take home after a shift. The owner was a very experienced chef who had cooked in restaurants all over the world and was very generous with his knowledge.  He had spent some time in Costa Rica as a young man and I think the only reason he hired me was because he found out my dad was Costa Rican. 

One busy saturday I skipped out on my shift to go out with a girl I had a crush on.  The next day, I showed up for work with the puppy dog face on and they said the only way I could keep my job was if I got to 3rd base with the girl and I had to give explicit details...good times!  ","1325379268"

"funny","t5_2qh33","A) If we disallow that type of 'comic' then where do we draw the line? 
It would mean that any funny picture that is illustrated comes under scrutiny, and that any funny upload, photo or drawn, with more than one panel (or movement) should also be disallowed. That is stupid, because that makes r/funny just another r/pics but with funny pics instead (which is basically what r/pics is anyway) so it renders r/funny useless. 

B) You would be alienating a variety of really funny, uplifting material that we would all like to see just because it has panels or is illustrated, and would leave in its place a subreddit which does not have a variety of humorous content, but instead only photos that are the equivelent to punchlines. This is like going to a stand-up comedy show and banning the comedian from telling any stories and any jokes that last longer than one sentence...YOU'RE GOING TO CONDEMN EVERYBODY ON R/FUNNY TO AN ETERNAL JIMMY CARR SHOW...DON""T DO IT! And although Jimmy Carr is a great comedian, I'd like to live a life online where I can experience humor that is lengthy similarly to the material of the masters such as Bill Hicks, Stewert Lee, Bill Bailey etc. Whose humor doesn't just end in one sentence. 
  
These maybe lousy metaphors, but you know exactly what I mean. Give people the chance to experience all types of humor. 

BTW. I'm also not cool with your NO POLITICS rule... Try telling Laurence Marks, Maurice Gran, Mark Tavener or Jon Stewert that there is no humor in politics. Is it just me or is this all getting a little ridiculous?","1325379274"

Verily I, the servants, the helpers, and my followers defend them, because Christians are my citizens; and by Allah! I hold out against anything that displeases them.
No compulsion is to be on them.
Neither are their judges to be removed from their jobs nor their monks from their monasteries.
No one is to destroy a house of their religion, to damage it, or to carry anything from it to the Muslims' houses.
Should anyone take any of these, he would spoil God's covenant and disobey His Prophet. Verily, they are my allies and have my secure charter against all that they hate.
No one is to force them to travel or to oblige them to fight.
The Muslims are to fight for them.
If a female Christian is married to a Muslim, it is not to take place without her approval. She is not to be prevented from visiting her church to pray.
Their churches are to be respected. They are neither to be prevented from repairing them nor the sacredness of their covenants.
No one of the nation (Muslims) is to disobey the covenant till the Last Day (end of the world)."" How come this isn't brought up more...to both sides. So what he sent it to one church, he seemed to mean all to me.","1325379291"

(i.e. if you FFE - ask your Zerg opponet to roach all in) Ask your practice partners to exploit those, and continue to build on that, once you have a go-to strategy for each race, refine and do that in ladder until platinum, then begin to expand your horizon. 

Builds I learned when I was in Gold through Platinum

Zerg - 1gate FE/FFE (almost always use these two strats, unless zerg cheese or you feel you can pressure the Zerg with another build (I think 3 stalker rush or something? I don't know, go to www.scdojo.com - It's artosis' own blog about Protoss build orders, might help)

Terran - 2gate robo (Awesome opener for 2 Marine/1 Marauder pokes, which is quite prominent in lower leagues, also it's great for holding all ins, and is a great transition for 3gate robo all in yourself. However, build an obs, and you should be expanding around 34-40 supply if your Terran opponent is expanding too)

Protoss - I used to 3gate robo and just hope I could out-micro the opponent, Immortal focus fire and good force fields will usually win you the match up to Platinum, however recently I've been exploring stargate builds - not much to say about this match-up, as it's mostly just Micro and reacting to scouting your opponent.

I understand that, but what I'm saying is that the attunements were much less relevant than the gear and experience. Even without attunements, it's not like successful guilds would suddenly welcome everyone with open arms. You still need to be geared for the content or you're holding the raid back... and at that time, the only way to get geared was by completing the prior content (which covers attunement).

&gt; This is why attunements were removed and the previous tier's gear is made more accessible immediately after new content is released, because the WoW dev team gets what so many of the game's players are unwilling to.

I understand the concept and I think it's a good one. I just think attunements are unfairly blamed for holding people back when more often than not, they were just the most visible. Even throughout WotLK, many PuGs required the dungeon completion achievement *for the very dungeon the group was clearing*. That's even dumber than attunement. 

&gt; Also, you didn't see me perform then, so it's unfair to say I personally would need to be carried.

I don't mean any personal offense, but any guild geared in S2 PvP gear without gear past Moroes would not be able to kill bosses in SSC or TK... even if they were all excellent players. ","1325379304"

There was an old woman, very dirty, who would bring in homemade cakes for some of the girls.  These had to be put in the bin, although she was always told that they were lovely.

A guy who came in every week, asked us our sales figures, and claimed that he had invented the scalp massager and was going to patent it.  He never acted like he had had the conversation with us before.

A guy who used to stand at the escalators, watching women's legs.  He would also drop stuff on the floor on purpose so he could crouch down and stare at women's legs.

A guy who would only ever come in at Christmas, but then say really foul stuff to the women at the counters.  Security had to be called if he was spotted.

A very, very tall man who wouldn't say anything, but would stare very intensely with a small smile on his face.  He did this to me once, to the extent that I was flushed scarlet and horribly uncomfortable.  One of the girls told me he had done this to women at other counters (security had been warned a couple of times), and explained that he liked a particular hair colour.  His behaviour was very unnerving, and I would usually keep my head down if I spotted him.  One day, he came towards the counter from a different direction than normal, and I turned with my automatic smile on.  His face lit up, and he lifted his hand tentatively to give a little wave.  I froze in fear when I realised who it was.  His face totally shut down again, and he walked away fast with his head down.  The memory always makes me feel bad.

I mean, what he's essentially saying is that since **he** assumed that the form of the grid implied a supremely non-linear fashion that clearly that must be the**sole** reason it was constructed as such.

But that's still a lot.  There are still quite a few different ways to level up each character which constitute a range of choices for a player.

Ventura on the other hand will atomic-leg-drop the establisment from the top rope.  

Also, one thing a lot of RP supporters don't think about, is that if Ron Paul were to ever get elected, it's very likely that some powerful people will try to 'remove' him from office.  JFK was the last president who tried to abolish the federal reserve, remember what happened to him?   By choosing a VP thats crazier than he is, its increases his chances of survival.  They can't remove Paul, because then they are stuck with Ventura as Pres.

"politics","t5_2cneq","i just want to leave this comment right here.  this thread has been totally hijacked by morons (i mean Mauve_Cubedweller).

a bill requires two passes through Congress for a veto to be overridden.  it has to be passed the first time, vetoed, and then passed through Congress again, with the President's objections having been considered.

here is what Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution says about vetoes:

&gt; Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. 

Obama, instead of vetoing this atrocious law and requiring the bill to be forced through with his ""Objections,"" simply signed the bill into law and made an unconstitutional signing statement in an attempt to excuse his actions.  if he had vetoed it, he could easily have made a statement to the people that could have prevented the bill from being passed at all, and pushed for, say, another defense budget bill to be passed - one that did not strip us of rights that we've held as totally inviolable for the last 234 years.

this is not ""clever political manuevering by the Republicans.""  Obama chose to pass this affront to our human rights, of his own will.  in fact, the Obama administration reportedly [pushed for the bill to allow for indefinite detention of Americans](http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/politics/10170-obama-admin-pushed-for-indefinite-detention-provision).

there is no defense for what he did here.  even with a signing statement.  both the NDAA and the signing statement are unconstitutional.  Obama has violated his oath of office and betrayed all of you.  

i almost threw up when i saw how many upvotes Mauve_Cubedweller got.  this is the worst shit that happens on reddit - when political mythology gets upvoted to the top, and all the correct explanations get ignored and downvoted.  

shame on everyone on this site who upvotes total bullshit just because it reaffirms what they already believe.  we're trying to have a revolution over here, jackasses.

-----

edit: just to be clear on this a thousand times over, the ""editing"" of this video (the video was *cut around the edges, but not spliced together*) does not inaccurately depict what happened.  Carl Levin, the co-sponsor of the bill and head, with John McCain, of the Armed Services Committee, directly stated that the Obama administration had asked for the provision protecting American citizens from indefinite detention to be removed.  this section of the final version of the bill - section 1021(e) - does NOT protect American citizens from the indefinite detention provisions:

&gt; ""Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States."" 

as this passage only appears, to begin with, in a section with the following heading:

&gt; SEC. 1021. **AFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES TO DETAIN COVERED PERSONS PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.**

&gt; (a) IN GENERAL.‚Äî**Congress affirms that the authority of the President to use all necessary and appropriate force pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107‚Äì40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) includes the authority for the Armed Forces of the United States to detain covered persons (as defined in sub- section (b)) pending disposition under the law of war. (b)** COVERED PERSONS.‚ÄîA covered person under this section is any person as follows: (1) A person who planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored those responsible for those attacks. (2) A person who was a part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act or has directly supported such hostilities in aid of such enemy forces.

the bill explicitly states that Congress affirms that this indefinite detention ability **already exists** - meaning it is NOT affected by a statement that says ""Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law.""  technically, this is illegal, null and void, for a ton of reasons to begin with - for Fifth Amendment violations, most vitally, and also for the fact that you can't retroactively create a law.","1325379318"
