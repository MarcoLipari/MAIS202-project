"DotA2","t5_2s580","**TL;DR - GET INT ITEMS ON OD**

&gt; How can I use OD's ulti effectively?

You want intelligence boosting items on OD so that his ult does more damage. Your build doesn't give you any int besides Dagon, which really should be a force staff instead.  

His Arcane Orb deals damage based on your mana remaining, but that doesn't mean you get items that boost mana pool, such as Point Booster. You get items that boost intelligence.  

---

&gt;Point Booster

Let's compare Point Booster (1200g) to Staff of Wizardry (1000g).  

PB gives 150 mana, Staff gives 130 mana.  

At full mana, you will deal an extra 9% of 20, due to Point Booster giving 20 more mana than Staff of Wizardry, which is 1.8 extra pure damage. Because the damage-mana pool is calculated on impact, Essence Aura has to proc on the attack, which it only does 40% of the time, so really it only adds 40% of 1.8 = 0.72 extra pure damage to your attacks 

However, Staff of Wizardry will give you 10 extra damage from your auto attacks (because OD is an int hero) and also give you an extra 100 damage to your ultimate, because it's based on the intelligence difference between you and the enemy hero.  

Clearly int items are superior than flat mana items.

---  

&gt; Dagon instead of Force Staff

Dagon is a shit item because OD doesn't lack damage. He generally lacks survivability. Force Staff gives him an escape, or an initiation tool, intelligence, and some passive HP regen (which he lacks without Mek).  

---

&gt; (if enemy has tons of magic damage) Hood of Defiance

BKB is better than Hood because it blocks ALL magic damage, not just some of it, and also blocks the stun component of spells, whereas Hood only blocks damage.  

---  

&gt; Bloodstone

I seriously don't understand *how* people think of such ineffective builds. Get a Rod of Atos if you want HP, as it also gives intelligence. It's like the least popular item in the game and that's because it's never gotten in the shit bracket which is like 80% of player base.  

The item gives you 100 HP and 5 int for free, compared to the components alone, never mind the active 60% slow.  

---  

&gt; Assault Cuirass  

OD doesn't need attack speed. Yes, his attack speed is rather lacking since his main source of attack speed is from Treads, but because of how Arcane Orb's damage works, it's better to get int boosting items and upping the damage of each Arcane Orb rather than throwing out weaker ones faster.  

He's scales like agility heroes, but with intelligence. Agility heroes gain 1 damage and 1 attack speed with each point of agility, whereas other attributes only gain 1 damage. OD however, gains 1 damage from int, and 9% of 13 (1 int gives 13 mana)= 1.17 *pure* damage for every point of int he gets.  

Pure damage is important because it is unreduced by anything except magic immunity (which blocks it entirely). As the game goes longer and enemies gain more armour (from agility gain each level), physical damage becomes weaker, while Pure remains the same. Magic damage gets weaker as people afford Cloak / Hook / Pipe.  

---

&gt; I get about 60% win rate with how I play OD.  

That's just because you're playing against equally crap players. When you get matched up with players better than you, you're going to lose because of your ineffective build.  

---  

&gt; Tango, Null Talisman  

That is not an adequate starting item build, you lack regen. Especially if you're not going Bottle and you don't have any passive HP regen items (Mek for example). You'd easily get harassed out of lane and OD doesn't lack last hitting ability, he has high base damage and can gain damage from his Astral.  

Compare 3 Branches + Mantle of Intelligence (300g) to Null Talisman (470g)  

* 3 Branches + Mantle
+3 agi, +3 strength, +6 int  

* Null  
+3 agi + 3 strength, +6 int, +3 damage  

You are paying 170 damage for 3 extra damage and item slots. However, you aren't lacking item slots in the early game, and an extra 3 damage isn't going to help you last hit more than an extra 400 HP from Salve.  

It doesn't matter how high your damage is if you can't even go near the creep wave because you're scared of dying. You'll miss far more last hits because you can't go into range of the creep than because you lacked 3 damage.  

If you go Mantle + 3 Branches + Salve + Tango you'll have a far easier time last hitting because you wont be forced out of lane. When you do get some gold, then you could buy Null if you wanted, and then you now have Null, Tangos, Salve and 3 Branches, compared to just a Null + Tangos.  

If you're going Bottle, 3 Branches + Tango is good. If not, then you'll be sitting in lane for a while and you'll need some form health regen in order to stay topped up on health if you get ganked.  ","1393632005"

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","It's a cave that's opened at the surface. Caves in MC generate like a bunch of gummy worms that are distrubuted randomly throughout the map in a 3D field, and imagine that field being overlaid in the Sky over Earth sort of world of minecraft. Some of those imaginary worms cross through the surface, which is where cave entrances are found. Most of the time caves are aligned horizontally but often have vertical segments. note that on the right side of the bottom of the hole, the cave continues off to the right.

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","There are a lot of things that came out of Darwin's work that he did not intend at all. For example, Social Darwinism, which was basically used to justify treating everyone else like shit ; the evolution vs. creationism argument, which the media and many people attempt to boil down to Christians vs. Athiests rather than the acceptance or rejection of science argument that is really at hand (Darwin, being a Christian himself, certainly did not mean to spark a debate about religion) ; and of course, our favorite, eugenics. 

Evolutionary biology is already a well established field, so there's tons of stuff you could write about, but it would all be science based and that's not very interesting.  For example, you can write about how modern science, specifically genetics, looks in the face of Darwin's original work. That's what I would write about, it being my field of interest, but I get if that's not you.

Or you could go outside the work, which it seems like you are wanting to do. Since I think you're right and it's hard to write that much about one limited topic, if I were writing this paper I would talk about how Darwinism has been manipulated and misinterpreted across the ages by different people, as I mentioned above. That way you could talk about what you were thinking but not be limited to one subject.

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions or need me to clarify anything :)","1393632012"

One should probably acknowledge that, though the broad foundation of the tech industry is of course an outgrowth of DARPA, NASA, and the general subsidization of science in postwar America, *some* of that stuff did happen outside the context of a government agency.

EDIT: I, on the other hand, just hadn't thought that hard about my political ideology, or what the broad-ranging effects of said ideology might be.

""We are clearly not going to change each other's opinions, so we will have to agree to disagree.""

&gt; Do you folks have any tips or techniques to divert your attention away from topics that upset you? Particularly when you are emotionally invested in the issue at hand?

Courage to change the things I can, Serenity to accept those things I cannot change, Wisdom to recognize the difference.

&gt; And are trying to help change people's perceptions and attitudes to help make the world a better place? Or is that egotistic of me?

The way you hold yourself out, and live your life can be a way to show others a positive way to view the world and to live one's life.  However, while you can lead a horse to water, if you try to make him drink you just end up with a drowned horse.

&gt; I don't know whether to help save the world and let it tear me apart, or distance myself from people's suffering and focus on my own well being.. it's a very difficult line.. that causes me great anxiety.

Live your life to its fullest, in the happiest and most fulfilling way possible.  Ghandi said ""Be the change you want to see in the world"".  You cannot successfully distance yourself from others' suffering; we're all connected.  Do what you can within your own moral framework to make the world a better place, and be happy with what you can accomplish.  You cannot save the world on your own, but you can help a little bit at a time.

&gt; Also, it's February in Canada. Everything's an existential crisis this time of year. Sending you all wise, positive, healing vibes... ;)

It's going to be -58 degrees Celsius here tonight with the wind chill.  Hope everyone makes it through alright.  Cheers!

"Diablo","t5_2qore","This article has a major spoiler (thx for no warning) :/, here is the Interview without that:

*


PC Gamer: Diablo III obviously took kind of a beating out of the gate back at launch. How did you feel about that?

*

Martens: Well ""bad"" is the short answer. We felt terrible about the connection issue stuff. I know people that sent their families out of town on vacation so that they could sit down and play the game, and they couldn't connect. So that stuff was terrible and I think we've spent an incredible amount of time ensuring that kind of stuff doesn't happen again. We took that very seriously and certainly feel bad about that.

*

I think we did eight major patches on the game. We did many months of support, we added new content, we did big tuning passes. Like anything, best laid plans meeting 15 million people usually means that you're going to learn a few things... or a lot of things in this case. That's what I think I like about expansion development. It's kind of our second at-bat and we know a lot of things about what's actually fun about the game. And we don't have to fight against player instincts or make guesses. We can do what people do; we can see what people like to do, we can read on the forums, and we can interact with them at BlizzCon and other events, and we can make a game that closely matches what people want out of a Diablo game.

*

PC Gamer: Do you guys continue to stand by the decision to require an internet connection to play Diablo III? Is there any chance at all of that changing in the future?

*

Martens: Yes, we stand by it. Diablo III is a co-op game from the ground up, so having the social stuff be there at your fingertips whenever you want it is integral to the experience.

*

PC Gamer: Not too long ago, Blizzard announced that it was shutting down the auction house. Is it fair to characterize it as a failure at this point?

*

Martens: It did what it was intended to do in one way, which was to make trading a safe place to happen without trading scams and other ripoffs. However, it had a very bad unintended consequence of making trading the best way to get items in the game. The fact is that the most fun way for the vast majority of people is to kill monsters and take gears from their cold, dead claws. Trading became very easy. The auction house lowered the barrier of entry so much that it became the best way to get items, and ultimately players will do whatever is smartest. They will find the golden path and do what is most efficient.

*

You should play the game to get gear to kill the monsters. You shouldn't get gear to kill monsters because you will get bored too quickly. It stole people's reward curve is essentially what it did; it made it very easy for them to do it. So trading isn't a bad way to get items, but if it negates playing the game, then we've made a huge mistake. And we did, which is why we're shutting down the auction house.

*

PC Gamer: Sounds like the majority of your efforts since launch have been based around responding to fan feedback.

*

Martens: Yeah. And the auction house decision didn't come easy. It's not like the day we realized it was a mistake was when we could shut it down. A lot of things had to come together for us to get to that point. And honestly, what the console build did with their loot system... what we have now we call ""Loot 2.0,"" what they did I would call ""Loot 1.5."" They had no auction house inherently, more because they couldn't than anything else.

*

So it's been a learning process for us as well. And finally as the loot stuff came together; as the enchanting system was dialed in; as our new legendaries were coming online, we realized that we could get rid of the auction house and get rid of that reward curve problem without causing new problems of people going back to trade scams or people feeling like they couldn't have any fun gear. Now we can give it away like candy, along with all of these ways that people can upgrade it, and all these crazy powers. And you can get it the way you're supposed to, which is by killing a monster and taking it from them.

*

PC Gamer: What else have you learned since the launch of Diablo III?

*

Martens: I think the randomness thing. We should have made everything random from the start. So the reason we didn't have random exterior zones was because we wanted the game to have more of that real RPG feel; that the world was real and had a sense of place. And like the loot problem, until Loot 2.0 was really dialing in, it was hard for us to figure out what to do with the auction house; it was the same with the randomness. Until the other aspects that made the game more RPG and more connected to the world were dialed in... you know, we've gotten better at storytelling since Diablo III; the world map that comes with Adventure Mode makes Sanctuary feel a lot more real just because you have a map of it, if nothing else, and that's a relatively simple solution to the problem. All of that made us comfortable with introducing randomized exterior zones as well.

*

Paolilli: Yeah, and that's actually one of my favorite things that we've done. With the map you have that sense of place, whereas before I think the environments looked great, but you didn't really have that sense of how everything is connected. And I think the map and the ability to go anywhere and do anything helps.

*

Martens: Dynamic Difficulty is another great example of that. We had our old-school linear difficulty that was inherited from the past, where you had to play through normal, nightmare, and so on. Dynamic Difficulty, which we made for Adventure Mode, allowed us to break that dichotomy for the game as well because otherwise we would have had to have a version of a monster for every possible level. So if you played Act II, we would have to have a Level 31, 32, 33... all the way up to 70 version of every monster for it to be fun. The overall Dynamic Difficulty system removed that burden and let us focus on a grander vision for our gameplay.

*

PC Gamer: On that note, it seems like Adventure Mode is kind of the main selling point of Reaper of Souls. Is that fair to say?

*

Martens: Yeah, I would say that's it. I would call Adventure Mode the primary feature of the expansion. That said, I think Act V is our best act, so we did take everything we learned there. And you do have to kill **** once with one character before Adventure Mode is unlocked. But knowing that you don't have to play story mode over and over again allows people to relax and just enjoy Act V for what it is; and they may or may not come back to it after that, but they don't have to. It doesn't feel as onerous to sit through those things.

*

PC Gamer: There have been some fans on the internet who have expressed concern that Reaper of Souls may be a bit pricey for the content that it delivers. What are you feelings on that?

*

Martens: I don't know about pricing as such, but I would say that the Adventure Mode changes the game pretty much completely. It's totally different. And it's not like a linear thing anymore. You don't just kill **** anymore and the game is done. And I think that was a little too much the case, unfortunately, in Diablo III. That's not the case anymore. When you kill ****, now you're finally starting Reaper of Souls. As good as Act V is, once you get into Adventure Mode and you see the promise of everything random that Diablo does; that makes replayability the point of the game. It's not linear anymore so you're experience is different everytime you come in.

*

PC Gamer: Are you happy with the state of PVP as it is right now?

*

Martens: Well, [Brawling Mode] is okay, and it can be really fun if you've got two people of similar level. PVP is still something we talk about a lot. [Former Diablo III director] Jay Wilson wrote a long blog post a couple Decembers or Januarys ago explaining why what we tried didn't work out. And that stuff is still the case.

*

PC Gamer: What would you say to the players who felt turned off by Diablo III at launch and gave up?

*

Martens: It's crazy awesome now (laughs). You're going to get the keys to the Ferrari. I use the car metaphor deliberately. If you had a Corolla before and you're watching people swing by in their Lamborghini all the time; well, everyone gets a Lamborghini now. Everyone gets a shot at it now. Legendaries are dropping now from Level 10 onward, and we have put code in to ensure that everyone gets some legendaries, and a chance at the wacky powers as well.

*

So the promise of what Diablo can give you, everyone gets a taste of it. And there's still lots to earn for the people who put in the time; they're still going to get better things and more things. But everybody gets some of it. Our game director called that philosophy ""endgame for everybody,"" and he didn't mean that you have to get to Level 70 to start earning Paragon Points to get the endgame. He wanted to take that stuff and move it earlier in the game so people wouldn't have to put in hundreds of hours. However, if you put in hundreds of hours, you still get more.

*

Paolilli: Yeah, we've done a lot of work to make sure that no matter how much time you put in, whether you're having a short play session or going for a lot longer that you're going to get rewarded for that amount of time. We want to give that sense of infinite possibility where the more time you put in the more you will get, but you don't have to play like an endgame player would in order to get rewarded.","1393632020"

As for the second part of your post

If the Crimea wants to secede that's great for them. They should be given the freedom to do so, provided this happens in a orderly democratic fashion. If Russia forcefully enters the Crimea with the intention to speed this progress along, its an act of war against the sovereign nation of Ukraine. International law will be blatantly ignored and the Russian Federation will (again) put itself above the UNSC and above the Nuremberg principles. 



While i agree that the prospect of European troops dying in some (with all due respect) Eastern European clusterfuck just blatantly sucks, we cannot let Russia just annex a part of another nation, a nation that the UK, your country , guaranteed the sovereignty of. Russia can't just be allowed to bully the former USSR around like its 1960. On a side note hampering Russia's control of the Black Sea and in extension the Mediterranean is in Europe's strategic interest. I think it is in Europe's best interest to no let Russia take the Crimea.  

Me responding to the second part of your post is just my opinion on the matter and it should not be seen as anything else. I respect that people see things very differently. Its a very complicated and delicate matter.

I couldn't get a parking spot at the museum I'm researching, the post office lost the cell phone I sold, financial aid denied me summer aid (which means no internship credit), a distant family member died but it shook up my mom pretty hard so I had to deal with that, and then financial aid wrote me again to tell me I needed more documents (how?) for Fall so my application is on hold. 

Did I mention it's Friday so none of this can be really dealt with until Monday?

"TrueDetective","t5_2tyoq","Nice read, tlink, although I really wanted you to mention dialectic when you brought up Horkheimer and Adorno!  Thanks for offering some strong examples of semiotics that could actually be used in the classroom.

Now I'm going to attempt to start a gender theory analysis/discussion of *True Detective*.  It's begging for it.  The female characters realize their own sexual desire only through the desire they inspire in the men of the show, as seen in the following scenes (spoiler alert):

1. Lisa (Marty's first mistress), says ""You want this?"" to Marty as she undresses seductively in the first few seconds of their sexual encounter, implying that her sexuality stems from his desire for her, not from her desire for him.

2. Beth (Marty's second mistress), tells Marty over the phone that she ""wants him so bad,"" but she is admiring her own body in the mirror (presumably imagining herself as he would see her) instead of, for example, looking at pictures of him.

3. Maggie has sex with Rust to inspire jealousy in Marty, not out of her own desire.  She is using her sexuality in terms of its value to men, not as desire for sex in and of itself.

4. Dora Lange doesn't get noticed by society until she becomes an image sexualized in a ritualistic murder.  On a non-sexual level, she is not desired by society until a male turns her into his fetishized image of desire. She is a prostitute, a subset of society that goes ignored until being involved in something sensational, like the sexualized death Dora experiences.  Her own desire is certainly not factored into her tragic and violent rape/death.  

So, while we could say that the show is objectifying women and pushing commercially-created and unrealistic images of female beauty (and holy hell does it ever--anyone noticed that all the nudity centers around young, white, thin women?), I think it's doing so ironically.  The desire of the women mentioned above is so centered in male desire that it's clubbing us over the head with it.  I think *True Detective* is actually asking us to question the sexuality of the women on the show while simultaneously filling HBO's necessary nipple quota.  

Driving this point home is this line from trailer-park bunny ranch madam Jan: “Girls walk this earth all the time screwing for free. So why is it you add business to the mix and boys like you can’t stand that thought? Because suddenly you don’t own it the way you thought you did.”

This opens up a whole new can of worms that the latter waves of feminist theory have been discussing for a while.  Who's really getting screwed when a man pays for sex from a woman?  The prostitute or the john?   

Also up for theoretical dissection is Marty's treatment of his wife and mistresses and his expectations about sex, marriage, family, and boundaries.  Discuss.  ","1393632021"

If you say SK is not a top team right now, when for several observers they are the strongest team right now then this means not a single eu team is a top team (which might be what u think I dont know but then u should say it). 

If I used Roccat as an example its not because of your flair, its just because they are 1st place in standing at that point and yet lost twice to SK and even mentioned they were most scared of SK.

If for whatever reasons you think SK is not a top team, then maybe give some valid arguments to back it off so ur ""text I didnt read"" would be taken more seriously.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I'd go with Illyrio Mopatis, something of a schemer and although widely known and of high stature, he isn't in too many scenes/POV's.  When he is though, big things are afoot.

1. Marries Dany off to Khal Drogo
2. Shadily struts through the dungeon in KL where the Dragon skulls are kept.  With Varys, he discusses Lions fighting Wolves and junk.
3. Tyrion's reception at his manse after he flees KL with the Spider's help. He kinda shows his hand here, or as much of it as he feels Tyrion ought to see.

Illyrio is minor in the narrative, operating in the margins of the overall story, but a big time player on a global scale in their world.  Important men at least as far away as Qarth know of Illyrio.  His ability to project power is apparent, he sends ships all the way to Qarth to fetch Dany after word of her Dragons hatching reaches him.  Even though this fails, it shows he has a good intel network (spider.net) and the ability to act on the information provided.

And possibly Bronn,

Saving Tyrion from Lysa's 'justice' and helping to with the Battle of the Blackwater.  Without him, I reckon that Tyrion would have died at a couple points in the story.

Even Tyrion, no stranger himself to wealth and power, is impressed with Illyrio's manse, lifestyle, tastes (the wine cellar) and clout.","1393632022"

In my opinion that doesn't mean someone needs to step into the blurry side by choice. For example Taylor Phinney. He has publicly opted not to use ""finish bottles"". This is one of the items that sits closer on blurry line. It's not illegal yet it doesn't feel honest. Basically there is nothing on the blurry line that is really justified as required and if you willfully step into it I, as a fan, will not support you. But please note, I am talking as a fan being depressed by the information. I am not claiming it should or should not be banned. 

I would say all riders are searching for an edge. But to me there is a difference between a rider that is willing to step into the blurry realm of using Xenon and one that will not.

* make soap

* sew clothes

* can vegetables and fruit

* how the remote control on their tv worked

* how to explain electricity/steam-engine etc.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Hmm hard to pick 3 favorite champs but here are mine.

Jinx - My tip is put emphasis on q over your w. W is just a long range slow with decent damage while q increases your auto attack range and damage. (which is everything to an adc)

Fizz - My tip is use spell weaving to your advantage. Get in some auto attacks then use your w -&gt; q -&gt; e (useing playful trickster to escape or for killing blow.)

This last one was hardest to pick. I really love playing support and I have a few I LOVE useing. After some deliberation this is my favorite. (beat out malphite, volibear, darius, soroka.)

Blitzcrank - He is the best support hands down. Use full tank masteries and full tank runes. (armor quints and reds) Open with q then get e then w. Emphasise E then W then level your q last. Useing talisman of ascention in unison with boots of mobility + your w makes you literally impossible you catch. Meaning you should rarely if ever die if you know when to run. His pull is better than thresh's but it takes accuracy and instinct to make good ones. Don't spam your q it costs alot of mana.

&gt;

&gt;**ReactOS** is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source) computer [operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) intended to be [binary compatible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) with [application software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) and [device drivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver) made for [Microsoft Windows NT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_NT) versions 5.x and up ([Windows 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000) and its successors). A spin-off of a previous attempt to clone Windows 95, development started in early 1998, and has continued with the incremental addition of features already found in Windows.

&gt;ReactOS is primarily written in [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language\)), with some elements, such as ReactOS Explorer, written in [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). The project has been ported to the [ARM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) and [AMD64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD64) processor architectures, and partially implements [Windows API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Windows_NT) functionality. The latter is assisted by including parts from the [Wine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software\)) compatibility layer for [Unix-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) operating systems, but other functionality is implemented by the developers themselves. However, progress has been hampered by a lack of developers with relevant skill-sets.

&gt;An extensive [code audit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_audit) is in place to protect against legal problems, such that implementation of the Windows API is only done by means of a complete [clean room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) [reverse engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering) process. The audit was initiated following claims made in 2006 by a former developer that the project contained [disassembled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler) [assembly code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) from Windows.  The allegations did not conclusively prove the existence of − and the audit has not found − any legally compromised code, and the claims have not resulted in any adverse legal consequences for the project.  Nevertheless, the audit has since been turned into an ongoing continuous effort as part of a generally cautious approach.

It's rare. I'm thinking that the few times it does happen, someone goes yelling warnings on the internet and makes it seem like it's a common occurrence.

Although I will say that it's a possibility that a store owner might hand in confiscated IDs to the police. After talking to a couple, only a couple, owners when buying liquor, it seems that they're a bit more venomous towards fake ID users since their liquor license is at stake.

The civil laws in the OT are only applicable to the theocracy which was ancient Israel. In the same way that it wouldn't make sense to obey the United States law about driving on the right side of the road when you are in Great Britain. The ceremonial laws were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The moral laws continue to apply.    
    
So for the law that OP mentions, the moral principle still applies, and yet the enforcement of that law (the penal codes) were only applicable for that time and place, since the penal codes were part of the national laws.

"altnewz","t5_2y9zm","&gt;“This board will not bend its will to ideologues who proclaim their ‘right’ to post whatever they want, wherever they want. This is no more different that posting sports scores to /r/gaming.

This is both someone who spends very little time at /r/gaming and very little time actually learning about what constitutes news in the 21st century. /r/games might have been a better subreddit choice because of how strict they are, but what do you expect from someone with an absurd amount of tunnel vision.

&gt;We have a very specific set of rules which are written to enforce a very specific moderation philosophy: Quality content, nonbias, objectivity and factuality.

Slides directly from the government isn't considered content. Slides directly from the government are obviously biased, because, umm, they come from the government? But wait, that's the content. Oh shit, it looks like this power hungry mod thinks it's biased because the government releasing the slides is actually the content? It's not supposed to be objective. You don't interview someone from the government to comment about what the government slides are, in fact if you did that you'd get nothing but propaganda, which is apparently news to these mods? Factuality sounds like trutheness. You just made up a word, didn't even give it a definition and expected everyone to know what you're talking about.

&gt;A more reasonable criticism would perhaps relate to the effectiveness of /r/news’ existing ruleset. Indeed, there is an argument to be made that perhaps the rules of /r/news barring analysis should be opened up to allow stories depending on context and importance.

The person in charge with making and enforcing the rules thinks it's theoretically possible that the rules need to be revisited to actually end up displaying news, and only came to that conclusion after a massive shit storm. Fucking brilliant. ""Context and importance"" gee I wonder if that's like almost the definition of what makes something news worthy. The idea that someone like that is in charge of a subreddit like that is what keeps reddit a sad joke of power hungry mods with personal agendas who care solely for what they care about, and get off on banning anything that doesn't fit their personal ideologies. Change /r/news to /r/BipolarBear0 and remove it from default subreddit and give /r/news to people who are actually interested in news.","1393632033"

I would call it more of an exaggeration. It obviously applies to appartment complexes, commercial property, and those single-family homes that NINJAs were buying a decade ago and have been foreclosed on during the last few years.

&gt; that bastard, giving is money to higher education! 

I wouldn't call economics ""higher education"".  Mainstream macroeconomics is a pseudoscientific religion that helps capitalists acquire and retain wealth and political power by confusing the masses with fairy tales about nonexistent equilibria. For ideological capitalists like the Koch brothers, it's just a cost of doing business and another weapon in their ongoing war against the working class.

"math","t5_2qh0n","I agree.  One typically doesn't want to maximize the ""chances of selecting the *best* apartment in the lot"" (thus considering the second-best as bad as the worst) but ""the quality of the apartment chosen"".  So a cardinal payoff variant seems much more appropriate.  However, I would choose one where the *a priori* \[quality\] values are drawn from a Gaussian distribution rather than a uniform one (one argument for that is that the ""quality value"" of an apartment is probably best modeled by the average of dozens of different random and somewhat independent criteria, so a Gaussian distribution makes some sense).  Funny that this variant is not mentioned in Wikipedia.

Another thing which confuses me is the following sentence in the cardinal payoff section of the Wikipedia article:

&gt; To be clear, the interviewer does not learn the actual relative rank of each applicant.  He learns only whether the applicant has relative rank 1.

Why this assumption?  It seems to me that it makes much more sense to assume that the interviewer knows the relative value of all the applicants seen so far (including the rank, among them, of the applicant which is now to be selected or rejected).  Is there a reason to make the decision only on the knowledge of whether the applicant is the best so far?  Does it change something?  I'm confused.","1393632037"

If it turned out that the surgeon who did your bypass surgery is in fact a plumber moonlighting as an ""unregulated"" practician at the local clinic, being told afterward that the guy ""had known issues"" with his practice, is not going to do you a lot of good.

That's precisely what a regulating body does: ensure that you, as a consumer, do not have to personally go and audit the product (/code/skills) of the company you are entrusting your valuables with.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Can't wait to see human resource managers on a list like this in the future. 

Description:
Human resource managers were employed by mid to large organisations in the early 21st century, initially as internal recruiters. But soon their responsibilities grew larger as a result of making up a plethora of rules and regulations for just about anything you can think of. As the scope of the rules widened, companies employed more HR staff to cope with the work load. At the HR era's peak, many companies ended up with a ratio of only one engineer, managed by up to 15 HR staff. As output suffered, most HR departments decided to let go of the engineers and other workers so that they could focus more efficiently on making up more elaborate rules. Eventually this led to the great HR bubble of 2056 that caused GFC 5. 

These days most HR department has been replaced by the relatively new concept of common sense, a resource that was vastly over looked earlier this century. ","1393632043"

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","Congrats! 

I have heard that for some people, when they become lucid they fall into that suspension of dark space thing.  I've never experienced it myself, but I think there are tips on how to get out of it, like closing your eyes and walking, imagining a scene, and when you start to hear and feel things around you, opening your eyes. That sort of thing. But I am not sure on that. 

My first lucid dream involved someone being in the dream that I haven't seen in years and that I have a complicated and emotional past with.  I got in an argument with them, and somewhere in my rage, my dream self yelled, ""Why are you in all of my dreams?!"" and I immediately became lucid.  My husband had told me what lucid dreaming was, and I was amazed at what was happening, but I didn't know how to stabilize or anything so I woke up a few seconds after unsuccessfully trying to make things appear and happen around me.
  
After that I actively started trying to lucid dream, and my first intentional lucid dream I achieved using FILD.  Now that I have spent more time trying to achieve lucidity, and I'm more familiar with my dreams in general, I often become lucid without needing to do reality checks or things like that, kind of like how you describe how you just suddenly knew you were dreaming.

I know, I've been conducting level 2 engineer interviews for a few weeks now (and previously), I'm a gatekeeper for your position. 

Another thing to keep in mind is culture fit. If you're a bad person, condescending, talking trash, etc I'm not going to recommend you for another interview. 

The great thing about this company is that your future is in your hands. Want to screw around? Cool, you've got a few years with the company, but eventually you're gone. 

Lastly, our recruiters don't know jack. I've had many of interviews where I read the resume and wonder how in the hell the person is even getting an interview. Others, I interview and wonder why they put what they did on their resume: ""I'm proficient in python""...great! Answer question xyz: Ummmm. Get the point?

I recently refereed a friend who never spent a day in high school, he has no GED or HS diploma. He never stepped foot in a university or community college, zero credits anywhere. Had Facebook and Google fighting over him. Facebook won because they moved faster and the bureaucracy at Google is getting bad.","1393632049"

 [**Summary judgment**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary%20judgment): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), a **summary judgment** (also **judgment as a matter of law**) is a judgment entered by a [court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court) for one party and against another party summarily, i.e., without a full [trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_(law\)). Such a [judgment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_(law\)) may be issued on the merits of an entire case, or on discrete issues in that case.

&gt;In [common-law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common-law) systems, questions about what the law actually is in a particular case are decided by judges; in rare cases [jury nullification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification) of the law may act to contravene or complement the instructions or orders of the judge, or other [officers of the court](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officers_of_the_court). A factfinder has to decide what the facts are and apply the law. In traditional common law the factfinder was a jury, but in many jurisdictions the judge now acts as the factfinder as well. It is the factfinder who decides ""what really happened,"" and it is the judge who applies the law to the facts as determined by the factfinder, whether directly or by giving instructions to the jury.

&gt;Absent an award of summary judgment (or some type of pretrial dismissal), a lawsuit will ordinarily proceed to [trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_(law\)), which is an opportunity for litigants to present evidence in an attempt to persuade the factfinder that they are saying ""what really happened,"" and that, under the applicable law, they should prevail.

At one point, she worked at a convalescent home; not just for old people either. It was for folks who were a little nuts and couldn't take care of themselves. One lady there has this disorder. She thinks EVERYTHING is food, as in she'd eat her dinner and then start trying to eat the napkins. As you can guess, she ended up morbidly obese. She was too fat for the showers, so they had to take her out back and hose her down like an elephant. Since she was so fat, she had a lot of rolls, and they couldn't get everywhere. Now, one day the family friend is making her rounds of the complex, and was stopped by this dude in a wheelchair. He mumbles something at her. ""Bitch stole my Doritos..."" ""What?"" ""That fat lady stole my Doritos and SHE WON'T GIVE 'EM BACK!"" ""Okay, okay, calm down. I'll get your chips back for you."" She goes into the fat lady's room. She's in their with the chips and nothing else. Buck naked, with her legs spread. There's this thick almost gelatinous discharge in the fat lady's vagina. And she's dipping the chips. And eating it. With that cheese drip on pizza stretch effect. She apparently had this big smile as it dripped down her chin.","1393632050"

You clearly must have missed all the news these past few years on all the PERSON-BASED PRICE-FIXING that has been going on across virtually every market.  Gold, LIBOR, housing, currencies, equities, etc.  It's all people.  

Supply and Demand is who the indoctrinators misdirect you to while they pick your pocket.

The nice thing about ""Mr. Supply"" and ""Mr. Demand"" is they can't be sued, or held accountable in any way shape or form.

Cartels determine prices.  Organizations of people set prices.

There are three different grocery store chains a few blocks from where I live.  I compared prices, and there is little to NO price competition between them.  They have an oligopolistic understanding.  It doesn't matter if I go to one or the other, the price is the same.  Where is the magic of market competition driving down prices, lol?  They have a captive ""market"" and they know it.  Read up on company towns to get an idea of what I'm talking about.

The demand is created by brainwashing through the mass media.

Your post's wording is fairly hostile, and I don't think a lot of people will appreciate it.

This being said; a BLMs dps is going to be higher on Turn 4 because of mob groupings, flare bombs, and a lot of Fire 2 spam. I say this as a SMN who raids with a BLM of similar gear level and skill. SMN has a lot of utility that BLM doesn't have, some of which applies to Turn 4, such as keeping a Shadow Flare under dreadnaughts for slows.

If the community's decided SMN is worth *actively avoiding*, are we sure it's because of their lower dps, or because of something else?","1393632054"

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I almost feel bad posting since many of you ended up splitting with your partners, but my relationship got better, believe it or not. When we were in college, we spent a lot of time alone and I was very comfortable being myself with her. This was before even I knew I was trans so I'm just talking personality wise. Since we graduated, I became more withdrawn and depressed. I was extremely nervous about coming out to her, but when I figured it out for myself, I knew I had to tell her and soon. When I sat her down, it took me a good 15 minutes before I could actually say anything because I was so scared that this could be the end for us. When I explained everything to her, I made sure she knew that person she was with in college was me, everything else was me acting like a man. She naturally had loads of questions and she was confused about herself (is she bi or gay), but there was never any doubt that we were going to stay together. Since then, she's been extremely supportive and as I've been able to let more of my personality out, we've only gotten closer. We laugh together constantly and just genuinely love to be in each other's company. I hope a positive story like ours can encourage someone to know that it can work out. ","1393632055"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","She will not owe any tax.  
$10K is under the annual gift tax allowance, so she won't owe a gift tax.  
You mentioned to us the UNRELATED FACT that you were helping her with something, but she is NOT paying you for that work.  If she were paying you for work, she would owe capital gains tax on the part of the value that was unrealized gain and you would owe income tax on the full $10K.  But since it was a birthday gift, none of those taxes are due.

When you sell that stock someday, you need to know your cost basis.  It is the smaller of what the stock was worth when given or when purchased.  So if she purchased it for $12K and it is now worth $10K, your cost basis is $10K and the gift is a poor idea for tax purposes (vs. her selling the stock and giving you the money to invest).  But if she bought it for $8K, your cost basis is $8K, and the gift may be a good idea compared to her selling the stock, paying tax on the gain and giving you the remainder of the money.

Assuming she bought the stock for less than it is worth now, you will someday need to pay tax on her gain.  But meanwhile those delayed taxes are invested for your benefit.  So even if your tax rate when you finally sell will be higher than her rate today, it may make sense to pay those taxes later at your rate, rather than now at her rate.  If your tax rate will still be lower when you sell, it makes even more sense to pay that tax later and at your rate.

All that is US tax rules.  If you are one of those from another country asking tax advice online and expecting us to guess what country you are in, I apologize for being an ""arrogant American"" who assumes that anyone who asks tax advice online without identifying the country wanted USA tax advice.

Its incredibly inexpensive overall, too. Just one or two solid classes will give you the basics you need, and a good head start on a portfolio if attending a more in-depth school is really what you want. Alternately, you may decide you like the community college and stick with it for a bit. Its a win win!","1393632063"

Just as I was lightly pulling at it to see where it went, everything lost power. Ran on over to the low-voltage side of the transformer station, nothing had tripped. Ran over to the building where our presses are, and all that was dark too. Turns out one of the transformers for the induction heater had gone boom and taken a substation that provides power to a lot of neighbouring factories with it too.

&gt;**To Catch a Predator** is an American [reality television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television) series that features [hidden camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_camera) investigations by the television [newsmagazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmagazine) program Dateline NBC. It was devoted to impersonating [underage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America) people (generally ages 12–15)  and detaining male adults who contacted them over the Internet for sexual liaisons. People were lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host [Chris Hansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hansen) clarified in an interview with NPR News that these subjects should be labeled as potential [sexual predators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_predator), and not [pedophiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedophilia). ""Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex,"" he stated.

1. install pads
2. Loosen bolts holding caliper in place just enough that it wiggles around
3. Spin wheel a few times and pump brakes in between
4. Spin wheel one last time and hold down brake lever.
5. Continue to hold down lever while tightening caliper bolts
6. Brakes should no longer rub.


If your brakes are still rubbing after that there are a few possible causes.


If your rotor is bent or out of true you will get intermittent rubbing when you spin the wheel 


If both pads are constantly rubbing or there is not enough room between the pads to fit your disc rotors try prying them farther apart with something thin and plastic that won't mar the pads. 
If it is still rubbing it is possible your brakes were bled with worn brake pads and need to be re-bled to remove some excess brake fluid in the lines.

I think sometimes people can fall into the trap of focusing too much on movement when the other 60% is tactics (or special tactics as White Ra would call them). I want most of the complexity to be in tactics.

I wouldn't say its advanced because it's not all that hard of a skill to acquire, but speaking in front of really large groups does actually take learning to speak in front of really large groups and not everyone will ever do that. 

That being said, I don't think *speaking in public* is an advanced skill. 

There's no such thing as mastering social skills, or being perfect at them, or having them all.etc.etc. but there are basic social expectations that - lets say - you are at Level 1 of whatever skill, though it could be theoretically leveled to the infinitive. If you have less then Level 1, you are working at a sub expectant level, and this will throw people off because they won't parse you as even a Level 1 Commoner. 

So to reiterate, I don't mean to say that skills are binary in that you have fully acquired the skill or you have not acquired the skill, I simply mean everyone expects you to have obtained a certain minimum amount of proficiency in that ability. 

I've critiqued PUA literature before and I hit the character cap before I even made it into any of the stuff beyond .. Pre-game and the idea of how you should approach a ""target"" or something like that, and pointing out how incredibly dehumanizing and sexist basically everything in the methodology and terminology is. I am not eager to do that again, nor do I feel inclined to - but what are you referring to as ""advanced skills"" in PUA? As far what I *was* talking about in regards to why I dislike PUA, its because everything is based around the idea of how to manipulate others and yourself *in order to get laid*. Its using it as a means to an end instead of realizing that becoming an actual person with actual person qualities and interact with actual people like they are actual people gets you laid, *and* has all the other benefits in life *because its not just women that expect you to be able to do this*.","1393632071"

"tappedout","t5_2v7cj","You bring up a really good point. I hadn't realized or thought about th4e inventory aspect of it.

Once a person has done the freebie thing and has a zillion items what do they do with them. I guess that's where the ability to sort inventory would be great.

I hadn't thought they might be dumping stuff on the land just to not crash because of a full inventory, or just to sort it easier.

I was mainly thinking of people who've had what looks like a jumble sale on the land, for months, though. Tons of hail ant signs, the same cars, random junk, wide empty space in the middle, garbage still everywhere, and buildings crammed so tight nothing can get in. Just randomly wedged in buildings like it was Tetris.

Then it stays that way for weeks or months. 

But at least now I know one reason why and that one makes sense to me. They're overwhelmed. Maybe they intended to pick it all up again but then it became too much to deal with or something.

Some of those people, I noticed, once we got the update, weren't playing much. I deleted some of those ones, since those towns tended to crash me anyway. Others play daily though. All I could think was ""how do they navigate this thing daily and find all their characters or tap all the buildings?"" 

I have trouble scooting around my town sometimes and I don't even have half of the land yet and my buildings are kinda spaced apart. I have some parking lots, streets and stuff, although my town isn't as good as I want it to be.

So it just got me thinking about different reasons people play and also whether or not the looks of it matters to everybody.

Good luck with your city. I'd start with the parts most important to you, make that the center of town, and build outward from there. Zone it so it makes sense to you and also make parks and pretty things and parking lots so it seems more real. That's my .02 since you wanted advice :)","1393632072"

It was then that I realized that he thought I was masturbating which embarrassed me and made me blush a bit which he took as an admission of guilt. The worst part was that when he yelled for me I put the puzzle away out of fear of him thinking I wasn't using the bathroom. So not only could I not prove that I was really doing a puzzle, but I also lost all that work I did on the puzzle. It's been about a decade since that incident and I can laugh about it, but it still kind of bothers me in the back of my mind that my dad didn't believe me.

TL;DR If you put together puzzles your dad will think you're jerking it","1393632083"

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; One person is always going to be the aggressor and one is always going to be the person using defensive force.

Why must that necessarily be the case? Self-defense laws don't depend on *actually* being in imminent danger; they depend on having sufficient reason to *suspect* you are in imminent danger. For example, I have a right to act in my own defense if someone draws a knife on me, even if it's just a plastic knife that they were only drawing in jest—so long as I *think* it's real, and any reasonable person in my situation would agree with me.

If one person responds to what appears to be an imminent threat (even if it isn't actually), then *that* person becomes an imminent threat to the other, and now you've got two people posing an apparent danger to each other and two people in a position to act in self-defense against each other. If there are legal guidelines in place for one person or both people to step down in any given scenario like this, then a deadly altercation may be avoided. But if neither person must step down, then the law has created a situation where two people can legally kill each other.

Obviously, only one person really knows what happened between Zimmerman and Martin that night. But let's say Zimmerman was stalking Martin to see what he was up to, and he had *no* intention of taking matters into his own hands. However, from Martin's perspective, he was being pointedly stalked by a mugger with a gun, and he may have reasonably feared that he had only seconds to act before he might be shot. Ideally, Martin should have retreated—ducked behind a building and run away, for example—but the law did not require him to stand down and, instead, permitted him to attack Zimmerman in self-defense. As soon as Martin attacked Zimmerman, Zimmerman was now permitted to attack Martin in response. Suddenly we have ourselves a duel, where it is legally defensible for either person to kill the other.","1393632085"

"birding","t5_2qliv","I'm in 12th grade. I do think that being a birder something that's innate, and people can't really be ""indoctrinated"". Anyway, here's the story:

I have always loved birds (I think it was because my mom read me an ""Owl Babies"" book when I was a baby, and an experience I had watching Ospreys dive in the early morning at a Manitoba campsite when I was about 8), but never pursued them or frankly even noticed them in everyday life.
Last summer I found a pair of binoculars in a trunk in my living room and played with it, enjoying the special look at faraway things. The snow was still melting but that day I took my bike and biked to a wooded area by the shores of the rushing Ottawa River, a large waterway that attracts diverse waterfowl and looked at faraway Bufflehead. It was fun. I was sat on a rock, and I saw a little burst of colour to my right. 
Separated by a little bramble but in perfect view about 2-3 meters away from me was a full breeding-plumaged Yellow-Rumped Warbler, hopping on the sand towards the water, and drinking from the River, completely oblivious to my presence and unbelievably beautiful. I fixed my binoculars on it and was able to see it as if it was sitting on my fingers, the beautiful little eyes and intricate colours (it looked like this: http://bybio.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/yellow-rumped-warbler-male-1.jpg). I was flooded with joy. It was surely my ""spark bird"". I'll never forget that moment, it was so powerful.

Ever since then I became more and more interested, educating myself about common birds on my spare time, trying to answer questions I had about birds and ecology.. it was daunting at first but now I'm pretty much a master of ID (in my region), although I still need to work on mastering birdcalls. Birding takes up most of my my spare time, it's an obsession but super rewarding, intense and fun. I have a life list of 101 so far, and get my parents to drive me out of the city to look for Snowy Owls, read the blogs, check eBird every day, frequent the subreddit /r/whatsthisbird probably too much...

I think a love of birds has to be cultivated at an early age and this can be done by profiling LOCAL birds that are interesting and can be watched. Talk about life cycle, diet, migration, especially cultural significance. For young children, attaching it to music and art is good. But yeah.. I think birders are everywhere, and if you put out a call loudly enough in local schools the innately interested and naturally-minded kids will come. So yeah, that's my story. Good luck!","1393632087"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

"thelastofus","t5_2t7gp","My opinion on this subject (quoted from my review of BNS but applies to many other fanfics as well) **CONTAINS AFTERMATH: PART II AND A BRAND NEW START SPOILERS meshes don't read this**

One too many times there was a dialogue exchange between Joel and Ellie that went something like ""I can't live without you. You're my baby girl,"" or something of the like, which is all fine for a one time use during a very emotional part, but I feel Joel's use of the name baby girl is a bit overused. Now I know things have changed since the game's story, but during the entire game Joel calls Ellie baby girl only two times, once during her most vulnerable moment (David) and once when he's carrying Ellie out of the hospital (which she's unconscious so she can't hear him anyways). With that being said, I feel like the nickname should hold a more powerful meaning and should only be reserved for when Ellie shows a bit of her fragile side. It seems like Joel calls her that a lot during the fan fiction, and it loses its (almost sacred) connotation. Also, more than once Ellie will flat out say to Joel, ""I can't live without you,"" or something of the nature. Remember, Ellie's a tough cookie who rarely shows her emotional side, and she doesn't really seem to express her affection towards Joel as directly like flat-out telling him. Same goes for Joel. Joel flat-out says ""I love you"" to Ellie when she gets her fever, so this is much more understandable. But the other sappy stuff he says to her sometimes is unlike something his character would say. I mean, even to Sarah he doesn't really show much affection (I'm not saying he doesn't love her, we all know she was the most important thing in the world to him, but he just doesn't have that soft personality where he showers her with affection and ""I love you""s.) I'm going to make another reference to Aftermath: Part II here, when Joel tells Ellie he loves her, except indirectly. Tommy is the one that tells her he loves her, and she actually had a somewhat ...surprised reaction (for lack of a better word), which I feel is a bit more suitable for Ellie's character.","1393632094"

I wonder if it would be feasible to play a five or six player game and then post record audio from an observer's perspective with each player commentating from the perspective of another player, and just talking about how everyone plays... or have a series of games where one Let'sPlay'er observes and casts each different one as the other players actually play - opening skype calls to the players every so often to get their view of how things are going down...

&gt;I don't see any proof that nuclear weapons are a deterrent to invasion or any logical reason they are. Land skirmishes have occurred between countries with nuclear weapons, and no really powerful (at the time of invasion) country has truly been invaded since WW2 but that includes countries with and without nuclear weapons. As such, I don't see any true link of causation there. 

First, which are these nations which had land skirmishes even?  Who could we possibly have land skirmishes with?  Second of all, yes they haven't been invaded because they have nuclear weapons.  How can nuclear weapons not be a deterrent?  Are you aware of all the times we almost went into nuclear war as a species?

&gt;Also MAD makes using nuclear options to combat a traditional invasion pretty problematic because then the country that invaded will just nuke you back, and then we're all gone. 

Well, that's my point.

&gt;Your OP doesn't deal in probabilities at all or time lines. You say:

&gt;AT ALL and NOT EVER both imply that there are no exceptions. I was stating exceptions. If Space aliens invade earth a la Falling Skies and our government utilizes the draft to fight back, that might also be reasonable. It seems the least likely use of it, but I can see it as a scenario in which conscription might be reasonable. 

Yes but I wouldn't be for a draft even in your scenarios, so I am being consistent.  I would have been against the draft in World War 2 for example.

&gt;The reason for conscription in necessary wars (and whether WW2 is just or not, we have agreed it was necessary, no?)

Now now, I didn't say that.  I said one could argue it was necessary, but I wouldn't say so.  There's always another way, even if you can't see it.

&gt; is that eventually fighting forces get depleted, tired, and ""rah rah - it's the right thing to do for me and in general"" war time spirit doesn't work against natural human ""in-the-moment"" self-preservation, especially in an overly individualized society like the United States. It's not necessarily for the best for everyone, even individuals, that the war force becomes depleted and the government has no formal conscription to supplement its initial forces. Necessary wars usually get volunteers but not at those turning moments when you need reinforcements - at the beginning when hope is strongest - so they need conscription sometimes when hope wanes. 

If it's so necessary and noble, why won't every man, woman and even children volunteer to fight?  I'm not kidding, I want to know why not?

&gt;Not all wars are avoidable or unnecessary.

How can you actually say that with certainty?

&gt;Not all necessary wars attract a steady supply of volunteers as needed.

How so?

&gt;An army is more likely to lose a war without a steady supply of soldiers. 

Why should all armies win?

&gt;It is better for the country - and generally individuals in the country (even those who die, frankly, who might have saved others they care more about than themselves) - if the army wins the war. 

Was it better for Germany and Japan to win World War 2?

&gt;Whatever the lead up to WW2 (and we could debate the nuance of that as well, but it doesn't fit in this argument), whatever the attitude to nuclear weapons, it doesn't relate to those points, really.

They do, because in the end they demonstrate we don't need a military.","1393632100"

&gt; The Department is aware of recent events at Coolbanagher Castle, Co Laois, a Recorded Monument (LA008-015---Tower House) under the terms of the National Monuments Acts 1930-2004.

* Pale, 2 Row           1.8# 
* Munich Malt II         0.2# 
* Victory Malt            0.2# 
* Caramel Malt 20L   0.2# 
* Chocolate Malt        0.1# 
* Folgers Columbian - 2 tsp  in bag during mash

* Northern Brewer 0.1 oz @ 60
* Northern Brewer 0.1 oz @ 10
* Saaz 0.1 oz @ 10

* S-04 ( 1/5 packet)

* OG 1.065
* FG 1.017

I put all of the grains + coffee grounds in the bag, heated to ~160F, tried to keep it around 155F for 70 min, did my best to run 170F water through the bag to sparge. Then, did everything like normal, cooled to 70F, placed in my fermenter, and checked gravity. 

Questions:

1. Upon my first gravity check, I got something like 1.110, so I added 4 cups of boiled (then cooled) water and got about 1.07, was that process correct?
2. Can I keep the S04 I didn't use in a plastic bag in the fridge and use it later?
3. Do I keep unused hops in the freezer or fridge?
4. Is there anything I can cook with all of the grain leftovers?

Jackie leaving and the last year on terrestrial radio after Howard announced he was leaving for ""Eh-eh-eh"" was good times. The first few years on satellite will always be the best! Howard was inspired by the new medium and the emergence of the great Artie Lange was like you said. Untouchable. 

The current state of the show is.... Well... Weird and not as good. I was hurt when Artie left. I could not stand how it was handled on the air and the last year and a half... I just wish they would have helped him. I stopped listening and have only recently picked it up again. Robin not in studio is so different and I think it has hurt the dynamic but I understand it and only wish her the best. Howard has lost some of his edge. Not as eager to exploit the wack pack, saving kittens, AGT, 3 day a week schedule, etc.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","I'm having a very easy time imagining the Shield as faces. This was a perfect example of how their chemistry would be if they were faces. Ambrose can be funny or simply likable in the Heath Ledger Joker kind of way where he is just such an intense character yet can be a little goofy or insane.

He can have the impulse control issues and, just as long as the Shield fight as the good/fair guys, the audience will embrace it. Imagine if the Shield's music hit while the Wyatts were beating John Cena on RAW. 

Also to me he is a little goofy in the ring as well. All the facial expressions he pulls off and the way he just brawls with people makes him even look like a kid, immature.

By the way, Ambrose was always my favorite of the bunch. I really like all three of them but I just really like Ambrose's whole portrayal of the character. And on a side note it saddens me that I don't think he will ever be booked as a strong main eventer. I see him at Jericho's kayfabe power level at most. Not that that's bad in any way but Jericho was never really booked to look strong.

* A website that allows you to store a message for eternity for a loved one. It sends both you and the recipient a message that will live on the blockchain forever, like writing your name in a tree. Instead, you're writing it in a coin, which is much more permanent! 


Freedom of Speech

* http://florincoin.info/freespeech
* A platform to send free speech messages to the blockchain:
* This website allows a user to send a message to the blockchain. It's a prototype for the full twitter-like free speech app we're creating.


Gaming on the Blockchain

* The blockchain can be used to store an eternal, globally available rating system for games.
* Here's a presentation I made a few nights ago on the topic: http://vimeo.com/87682214#t=45m30s
* Here's a write-up of the protocol: http://aterna.org/game

**More Applications**

We've got plans for additional decentralized applications:

* Receipt hashes stored in the blockchain, to provide a decentralized trusted party to ensure the integrity of the retailer as well as protect the retailer from false return receipts.
* Hashing any type of text in the blockchain to prove it existed and was signed by a certain private key. 
* Color coin implementation on top of the messaging system.
* Gaming on the blockchain.

**Other Media**

I've been interviewed a few times and talked briefly on subjects related to Florincoin and crypto-currency.

Think about the production process for a second.  The Government who is highly inefficient is going to just stamp blank planchets with their little logo and symbols... The government has to buy these blank rounds to stamp from Sunshine mint and other private companies...

So there is no way in hell the US Government is going to be producing Silver Cheaper then other mints.  

And then look at how ASE's are distributed...

The markup is to high and ASE's aren't any more liquid then any other piece of silver.

People who fall in love with Government Silver often times lose out in the profit process.

Stick with generic 1 oz rounds of silver because they will be cheaper and YET they will STILL contain the same amount of silver atoms and weigh the same as the ASE... only difference is that you will have MORE silver when you buy the cheaper 1 oz generic rounds.","1393632118"

[W.E.T #2 - Basic Energy Building Techniques](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1pcnfz/wet_2_basic_energy_building_techniques/)

[W.E.T #3 - Psi-balls](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1q06e6/wet_3_psiballs/)

W.E.T. is an acronym for Weekly Energy Technique - they're threads that discuss various topics, ranging from beginner level material to some fairly advanced stuff. Give the post and the comments a read, and try them out for yourself. The first link is an energized meditation exercise. The second thread discusses ways you can learn how to feel your energy, and the third is a basic energy exercise.

Once you can feel your energy, try extending it across to someone and see if you can pick up what he or she is feeling. Use caution though, if someone has strong negative emotions, you can also get affected. You may want to build a shield to combat this - the [5th W.E.T thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/energy_work/comments/1r3uh8/wet_5_shielding/) covers this. 

As for weather control, this is a much more advanced topic, and I don't have much experience in this. Maybe someone else can comment on weather control, but for now the info above should be more than enough to help you get started. Good luck! :) ","1393632122"

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","I have read the most recent issue. And it was a great improvement, especially over issue 4. But the series as a whole has had a strong lean towards Superman. 

This series has been enjoyable. The writing is solid. The art is great. But this is a Superman series, first and foremost. Despite the fact that Wonder Woman’s name is in the title, this book has focused almost constantly on Superman and his villains. When we saw Diana’s villains, we saw how *Superman* dealt with them. When we see Diana, she’s typically talking/thinking about her feelings for Clark. Whereas Clark is dealing with bigger things, and almost never pauses to think about Diana. Everything is either Superman, his villains, or Diana talking or thinking about Superman. As a fan of Wonder Woman, I had hopes that this book would be a little more balanced between the two of them. And issue 05 was definitely an improvement. I can only hope that in the future, we’ll see more of Diana, and perhaps even get to see Clark deal with his feelings for Diana.

To be clear, though: I am enjoying the book. I look forward to it every month. And I am certainly no where near dropping this title. I just hope the next story arc is a little more balanced.","1393632123"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Different circumstances.  If you had to pay that 85k off in full and it were at 6.8% you might have gone with a different strategy.

If, instead, you are only at 3.4% (you didn't say your rate) and in 5 more years the remaining ~50k (I also don't know how your current loan is structured) goes away then your path makes a lot of sense.

Also depends on your risk tolerance.  In the previous example of a 6.8% loan that *has* to be paid off, you're getting a guaranteed 6.8% return by paying things off.

However, there is something to be said for not *having* to make a debt payment, especially when its a debt that only goes away if you die.

As for the year- I recall recording it over a week or so around Christmas, except for the live tracks, which we recorded a few months earlier for a radio show.  The album probably came out early spring or so of '95.  We graduated HS that summer, and some band members kept at it for a while, but it died out pretty quickly after that.

EDIT- Just realized you asked what 1995 was like.  Pretty boring for me, compared to '94.

Assuming you're actually spending time studying some kind of quasi-serious degree, ~40-50 hours/week, you can't reasonably work more than maybe 15-20 hours/wk, and even that is pushing it if your degree is at all difficult and you plan to sleep. 20 hrs/wk at $10/hr is $800/mo. If you live somewhere cheap, you can probably pay living expenses out of that (at least if you have public transit, good luck if you have to own a car). From where are you going to come up with the tuition money on top of that?

Mid-game. Gank a lane, take the turret. Usually this happens to outer turrets.

Late game. Split, 4 people in one lane, 1 person in the closest next lane. (mid/top)(bot/top), then they will try to initiate, back off. Let the person splitting take the turret.

You must ask yourself. Who do I send to split? (Either a fed ass adc, or usually a top laner who can escape or fight really well)

Maybe they can comment on people who want to watch content someone is PAYING alot of money to broadcast and develop, when you want to watch for free. Shame

""Justus and Crs NY has minimal viewership so the revenue doesnt really matter"" - Crs Revan has POSTED ON CoDcompetitive reddit SEVERAL times about the ""Higher viewers totals"" his team and others get on MLG.tv compared to Twitch.  I can link you if you'd really like me to?

""Viewership is overall higher on Twitch"" - No one ever said MLG viewership will be higher, they are a premium content provider like stated in their initial release.  twitch is on mobile apps, xbox, ps3/4 so on.  They've been around for years with no competition.  And they've done a great job giving people the ability to broadcast, and make some change doing it.

""MLG is a cash cow already"" - Saban, you know that MLG hasn't been profitable a SINGLE year out of 12 since  they've been open right?  Look up this in google ""MLG EBITA positive for first time ever"".  This is why SO MANY gaming event organizers go bankrupt, or dont pay prize money.  MLG is the front runner inventing the wheel of **SUSTAINABILITY** I can't keep explaining basic economics, profit/loss, business, revenue, sponsors, investors, ads so on to people who dont have any idea...it all comes from CASH flow and Sponsor/Ad dollars.  ALL of it. No matter what lol

So, now that i have answered those question we are left with just this...like i said...**""MLG chat is terrible. Slow and delayed. MLG is vastly underwhelming to Twitch. Needs a lot more work to be even comparable to Twitch.""**

^ Above is the only reliable **PRO** you listed of twitch.  I would have brought up the apps and console integration, which MLG is working on.  But hopefully i answered some questions.","1393632135"

&gt;

&gt;The **Sherman Antitrust Act** (**Sherman Act**,  July 2, 1890, ch. 647, 26 [Stat.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Statutes_at_Large) 209, [15 U.S.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_15_of_the_United_States_Code) [§§ 1](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/1.html)–[7](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/7.html)) is a landmark federal statute on [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) [competition law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law) passed by Congress in 1890. It prohibits certain business activities that federal government regulators deem to be anticompetitive, and requires the federal government to investigate and pursue [trusts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(19th_century\)).

&gt;It has since, more broadly, been used to oppose the combination of entities that could potentially harm competition, such as [monopolies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly) or [cartels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel).

&gt;According to its authors, it was not intended to impact market gains obtained by honest means, by benefiting the consumer more than the competitors. Senator [George Hoar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hoar) of [Massachusetts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts), another author of the Sherman act, said the following:

Eventually the doctor figured out that she was reusing a raw hot dogs she kept in the fridge to masturbate with. She thought because they were kept in the fridge that all the bacteria would be killed off, so she could reuse it over and over. The doctor told her to stop using them. See how I used the plural ""them"", well she had had to come in one day for an emergency appointment because she had lost one of them up her you know what. He said when he pulled it out it was the nastiest hot dog he had ever seen, it was discolored and the odor was something on the scale of rotting fish mixed with a hint of feces.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Teleportation brings with it a host of other problems, though.

The basic principle behind most sorts of teleportation (in science fiction) is that your body is broken down at the molecular level, converted to energy, transmitted, and reassembled on the other side.

Now there's all sorts of ethical and philosophical questions with this that makes it a bit of a tricky prospect.

An easy to understand and simplified example is this: Take a photograph. Scan it, and print it out on the other side of the world. Now burn the original. Is the photograph on the other side of the world the same photograph as the original one? What if it's a 100% perfect carbon copy down to the atom? Now try doing that with *people*.

There's also the fact that your standard sci-fi teleporting relies on conversion of energy to matter. With this comes a butt-ton of economic problems. If matter/energy conversion exists and is used for teleporters, then that means that replicators can also exist. That means so long as you have a replicator you can create nearly anything made out of matter if you have the energy.

Money would not need to exist as everyone would have everything they need. The economy wouldn't really be a thing anymore - society would be in for a *massive* upheaval - and there's a chance that it could be *really* bad. (Only the more involved *Star Trek* fans know that the niceness of the Federation was preceded by World War 3 and a whole bunch of nasty shit including wars fought with soldiers who were fueled by designer drugs.)

That also leaves out the issue of people being able to make pirate copies of you. If you can break someone down and reassemble them, there's also absolutely nothing that stops you from making a copy. How would you feel if someone who was obsessed with you made an illegal copy of your body to keep as a sex slave? How would you feel if there was a glitch and *you* were the copy? (This issue is addressed in the *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episode [""Second Chances""](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Second_Chances_%28episode%29) - a pretty good episode overall.)

Now that's your *Star Trek* kinda teleporting, but there's other kinds as well.

*Stargate* is basically the same stuff - broken down at one end, transmitted, and then re-assembled. Replicators don't exist in the *Stargate* universe (at least not for the Tau'ri), but assuming they could screw around with the Stargate's OS some more and feed it enough power then they could probably use it as an ad-hoc replicator (just to be clear, the ""Tea, Earl Grey, Hot"" kind of replicator, not the ""eats technology and is the bane of the Asgard"" Replicator).

*Stargate* nonetheless carries with it all the same philosophical questions and paradoxes as *Star Trek* teleporting.

There's one other concept of teleporting (in a sense) that hasn't been addressed and that's *space folding*.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/bW8hNVt.jpg) a picture that might help to explain things conceptually. If space were a flat piece of paper, the shortest distance between the two edges of the paper is straight across. But there is a sort of loophole in physics - you can fold the paper and make the edges touch. You can turn an insurmountable distance into something entirely negligible.

Now in *this* kind of teleporting, you as a person remain intact. You just bend space around you. Most ""portals"" in science fiction are probably some sort of space-folding. *This* kind of teleporting wouldn't have any Heisenbergy quandaries. It also wouldn't allow replicators to exist - you've just found a way to get from Point A to Point B a hell of a lot faster.

Regardless of the kind of teleporting, you can still have someone just pop into your bedroom at night and, I dunno, *pee on you* or something. Or maybe someone maliciously beams a rock into your chest cavity. Or maybe someone beams you into space.

So when teleportation comes along, society will change *hugely*. Whether it will be for better or worse will remain to be seen.","1393632145"

*Big Nothing* gets a little dark and slightly over the top, but it's definitely an enjoyable watch. David Schwimmer 
is the director and star I think, if you're a Friends fan.

*Scoop* isn't technically a comedy, but it's actually pretty funny. Plus, Scarlett Johansson OR Hugh Jackman for your enjoyment, with Woody Allen and Ian McShane as support.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","As a Christian girlfriend who unfortunately had the same experience, I would say that if you love her, you should forgive her. I had to talk to my boyfriend about stuff like this and I felt very ashamed and dirty because I was used by guys. 
I was afraid that my boyfriend would leave me. He told me that it bothered him a bit, but that he would probably get over it after a while.

Since then I've been nothing but honest with him and he said he isn't bothered by my past at all. I'm still a virgin and I am repentant and will not be doing what I did before. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year now and we plan on getting married.

Now, if your girlfriend honestly thinks that what she did wasn't wrong, you may need to talk with her about that. Even if certain things didn't go certain places, lust is sinful and so is promiscuity. Make sure that you confront her IN LOVE and reassure her that you're trying to support her, not fight her.

If she eventually repents of her actions and turns away from her sin, then continue with the relationship. If you continue to think that she doesn't care or is not remorseful about what she's done, then it's really up to you on what you want to do with your life.

It makes you wonder who is being attacked by the imputation of massacres against humanity when these numbers in the millions appear out of nowhere.

Witch trials: men.
Spanish Inquisition: Catholic Church.

Even though in the witch craze, women were just as likely to be accusers as men.  And even though all of the executions of the Inquisition were done by the Spanish Government, and none were imposed by the Catholic Church.

&gt; Near the outset of the Inquisition, in a letter of April 14, 1482, Pope Sixtus IV instructed the Spanish to ensure due process, allow legal counsel and appeal to Rome.[53] King Ferdinand defiantly rejected Papal control, the Inquisition becoming thereafter a tool of the monarchy, rather than the church.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","In a nutshell, electron orbitals. There are mathematical equations modeling where an electron is at any given time. This is called an orbital. It is easiest to think of this as a cloud. Orbitals come in levels. 1,2,3,4,5,6, etc. Each row is a level, with each elements adding another electron. Each orbital can only hold 2 electrons each with opposite spin, but some orbital levels have multiple orbitals in different configurations. For example, hydrogen has only 1 electron and its electron configuration can be written as 1s1. Helium would be 1s2. Lithium would be 1s2 2s1 (the numbers after the letters should be in subscript). The larger the element becomes the more orbitals you add on. You see that giant gap because after beryllium (4) you add on p orbitals. There are 3 p orbitals in each level of p orbitals. 1 in the x axis, 1 in the y, 1 in the z. They are shaped like balloons. After calcium (20) you are now large enough to have a d orbitals. The pattern is such that, any element in any row, have the same valency (number of outer electrons) as every other element in that row. Therefore they have the same reactivity (or similar reactivity). This is what is so useful about the table, its predictability. However, valency and therefore reactivity are only affected by s and p orbitals because d and f orbitals are much smaller than s or p orbitals, albeit much higher in energy. As an example of this titaniums electron configuration would be 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2  3p6 4s2 3d2. As you can see even though titaniums last 2 electrons are in the d shell, it is still given a coefficient lower than the s shell, because this coefficient is a factor of how far away the orbital is to the nucleus. This is why the valency rule is limited to 8 and why elements can only have certain numbers of bonds.

To stop people who have higher ed in chem from pestering me. These are general rules. For example, theoretically the max number of bonds you can make from one molecule is 4 because you only have 4 orbitals to access. Realistically however, a molecule such as phosphorus can make up to 6 bonds because it sometimes has access to its d orbitals which only gets filled when it is thermodynamically favorable (i.e. when any other configuration would be in a higher energy state). There are always exceptions to science. Got to learn to roll with the punches :/","1393632155"

"confession","t5_2qo2a","I'm going to throw this out there just because your situation sounds similar to mine, and I had to come to terms with some things about myself that I didn't want to admit. I finally had to admit to myself that I am a sex addict, and here's why.

I used to cheat on my ex-wife constantly. I felt no guilt about what I was doing, and very little shame. The only feelings I had were fear if I got caught - fear of losing my marriage and my kids. I realized I was an addict because I was obsessed with it: the excitement, the feelings of being desired and wanted, of pleasing someone, and even the taboo of sneaking around and doing some very kinky things. I also constantly thought that I was missing out on something that I needed if I didn't take advantage of the situation. Even now, I'm remarried to someone that I really love and am totally attracted to, but I still keep on looking for something else. 

I realized that this way of thinking had become a habit, and I had been thinking this way for a very long time. It's a constant obsession with me, in that I think about what I'm missing, of feeling that excitement, and I have justified everything in my mind so I didn't feel guilt or shame. 

I have everything I ever wanted in my current relationship, but I know that I will always feel this pull from my obsessions. Those thoughts and feelings are real, no doubt, but they do not reflect reality and what I really, truly want. 

The reason why I'm sharing this is that maybe it would be good for you to really figure out what you feel and how you think and what you really get out of these relationships. Take some time to figure yourself out and know what you truly want, then tell your scumbag brain to go fuck itself and be someone that you are proud of.

Depending on where your city sources their water the annual water report can vary drastically from month to month.  Often municipal water utilities have to switch or even blend their sources of water which can sway the balance of mineral content quite a bit.

Well the reason that I mention distilled is because it's for the most part H2O that is void of minerals (There are trace amounts yes I know).  I use distilled water because I build up my water to the style of beer I am brewing by adding mineral additions.  If you buy a bottled drinking or spring water you can never be 100% sure of mineral concentration so it's hard to consistently hit the mineral profile you desire for the type of beer you are brewing.","1393632159"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","From my own personal experience, firefighters and other emergency workers love calls that don't end up resulting in life threatening and highly stressful situations. The most recent ""fire"" happened when our neighbor put a pot of beans on the gas stove, forgot about them, and went to sleep. We smelled a cooking smell, but the smell kept changing and getting worse so we went looking for the source. The neighbors lights were off and she didn't come to the door when we knocked, but we still thought something was wrong and called the FD. As soon as they pulled up they identified it as a cooking fire and after pounding on the door for 30 seconds were ready to bust it down. Luckily for our neighbor she finally heard something and answered the door. Smoke came rolling and billowing out of the apartment, but she was so groggy that she didn't even notice and had to ask what everyone was doing outside. If we hadn't been so vigilant, she might not have woken up the next morning and who knows if our apartment would still be standing. Compared to the first two fires I experienced, where there was structural damage, the third case was very mild and the firefighters were much more relaxed about it. They were glad that we called them early and that their entire brigade's presence was overkill and that the emergency wasn't severe or dangerous.","1393632160"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; as your wealth increases so ~~does your standard~~ do your demands, and as your ~~standard~~ demands increase~~s~~ the costs of maintaining ~~that standard~~ those demands also increases.

Let's say that a decent comfortable standard of living costs 60k/yr. For that you get a vehicle, a place to live (I'm thinking the equivalent of a small but comfortable house or a good spacious apartment, both with enough room for you to work and play in), you're out of debt, and when you're hungry you get to eat pretty much whatever you want outside of a Romanov budget, although you do get to hit the swank French places every now and again. You're not running around in Armani, but you always have the clothes you need for whatever the occasion. 

That's a decent living. For me, that's a fucking dream that will never arrive. 

When you make $120k, that gear up there doesn't go up in cost (inflation aside). It still costs that much. You now have $60k *extra*. Will you get binged by $20k in lawyers, accountants, and financial planners? I'm sure that size of a nugget will cost you *something* to manage. That's still $40k *extra*.

Your expenses haven't gone up. You've still got *everything* you'll ever need and plenty of what you will ever want. 

Your standards of living don't go up. Your sense of entitlement goes up. Your *greed* goes up. And both of those things are completely voluntary if you avoid the fantastical rationalization that having money makes it more expensive for you to live.


&gt;Now that is not as universally bad as someone not affording food for the month but relative to their standard it could feel devastating.

Boo fucking hoo. Feelings aren't reality. It *isn't* devastating. At all. If you get badfeelz because you had to trade in your beemer for an altima, *too fucking bad*. You're a weak, *greedy* selfish asshole and a *detriment to society, your community, your friends, and your family* if that's how you operate. That badfeelz is *greed* rearing it's ugly head, and the only thing that you are ""suffering"" is it's frustration. Boo hoo.


&gt;Thus you can have several times more financial struggles as a rich person than as a poor person who only has one.

No. No they don't. They have several more financial *opportunities* than a poor person. Whether or not they make wise decisions with those opportunities *is their fucking problem and their fucking responsability*. If they put themselves in a situation where they can't meet that $60k standard above, that is because they over extended themselves past their actual means. You will find that rather common among the wealthy. That is because they are *conceited*. If they still have that $60k standard available, then *they have fucking everything* already.

Boo hoo, cindarella, you had to have the Ball at the Holiday Inn this year. Excuse me, I have to go unload trucks for 12 hours.

&gt;money does not buy happiness.

Yeah. It does. It buys health. If buys security. It buys safety. It buys *opportunity* If you haven't got the kind of mind that can find happiness when those things are made available to you, then you haven't got the kind of mind that can find happiness in *any* circumstance. 

&gt;Would you rather live poor and happy than miserable in a gilded cage?

Such a bullshit false dichotomy. Poor people and rich people are just as likely to have *personal* problems. The difference is that rich people don't have those personal problems exacerbated by starvation, unemployment, homelessness, overcrowding, exhaustion, illness, debt, and social devaluation. Rich people get to have those problems on 300 thread count sheets.

I'll take the cage. Watch what I do with it when I get my hands on a blowtorch.","1393632160"

"Loadout","t5_2tm6l","Here are some other tips that have worked for me:

* Don't always engage the opposite hammer carrier, if you are just reaching your base with it, avoid him and let another team mate kill him. The hammer mechanics are unreliable and if you lose the fight your flag will be returned and all the effort you made lost. Similarly, if the enemy is getting to the base you can try to kill him but then again, you could also flee, buying your team more time to finish off the opposite hammer carrier. Basically, fighting the opposite carrier is a coin flip, engage only if you are confident in your skills or have an advantageous position over him.

* You can quickly drop and pick up the hammer, you can use this to quickly drop a grenade when you know and enemy is coming, set up a turret to ambush your pursuers, you can also use your weapons if you are confident you can kill with them... This is more useful the less charges your hammer has.","1393632161"

&gt;Correlation in this case very much isn't contamination.

Yet, the studies exist and you're just denying their findings wholesale. Let's see your evidence.

&gt;&gt;Water contamination by the chemicals used to frack IS the problem

&gt;Which has everything to do with cut corners up-process with disposal and nothing to do with the process of fracking. It's not like these are somehow the only chemicals where improper disposal is a problem, this problem exists with non-fracked wellheads as well.

Again, you make an extraordinary claim not backed up by anything. Weird how for literally over a hundred years we've been drilling in some of these places and yet the water wasn't flammable or contaminated then.

&gt;&gt;The common denominator is fracking

&gt;The common denominator is drilling.

Are you autistic or really just this pedantic? The drilling isn't the problem, its the pumping of he chemical slurry to crack the rock/shale and we've been drilling in the same spots for over a century without the same effects.
&gt;&gt;but to argue that flammable fucking tap water just began out of nowhere coincidentally when the fracking started

&gt;**It's from leaky well casings which have nothing to do with fracking.**

No the fracking has nothing to do with the wells made to perform fracking! None at all! Holy fuck you're as dumb as the rocks you study.

&gt;&gt;It happens because of fracking.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","* Budget - 185 to 290 USD

* Source - Directly into laptop and eventually a desktop PC, or my Samsung Galaxy S4

* Requirements for isolation - I would preferably be able to wear these in public, no sound leakage and decent isolation. 

* Preferred type of headphones - Over-ear (circumaural?) 

* Preferred tonal balance - I am new to quality audio, so maybe just a balanced mix. 

* Past headphones - Have used a pair of Steelseries Siberia for the past 6+ years, have never really tried anything better quality. 

* Preferred music - Indie, rock, some electric, some rap - very varied. 

* Location - Denmark. Shipping to Denmark is a must, amazon.co.uk is a site I have used before, otherwise [this](http://www.4sound.dk/) Danish webstore seems to be fairly well-priced [(direct link to headphone section, sorted by popularity).](http://www.4sound.dk/shoppingsystem/produkter.asp?gruppe=Hovedtelefoner)

I have considered several headphones: The ATH-M50, which seem to be a decent entry point, and are priced at a fair 185 USD in Denmark. Sennheiser PC360 G4ME at 245 USD, which seems to be an audiophile-level gaming headset, with a mic included, which I also need to have (can buy external if necessary). Philips Fidelio X1, which are open-back (this causes sound leakage?) and seems to have exceptionally great reviews, and are on sale at just 278 USD. 

So please, help a new guy out! :)","1393632163"

If you want to post complaints online then please try to be constructive and mindful while posting because many of the people volunteering  are probably seeing your posts.

"RBA","t5_2v8ns","&gt; R91% is essentially the same thing as a KFL. The Taifun GT is similar, but a little different. These are all often called silica style or silica wick RBAs because they're designed to be run with a silica wick instead of mesh like a genny, though I think most people use cotton instead of silica. With these, you don't usually get as much vapor as a well-built genny or an RDA but you do get a lot of flavor and they're not as likely to leak. When you wick it, there's a delicate balance between flooding it and getting dry hits, but once you figure out how to wick your build it's not difficult to do. They're usually pretty low fuss once you get them set up.

This is going to be a drastic oversimplification, but I have come to view the Kayfun-style devices as ""Rebuildable Protanks"".  Of course, if I had gone with a different clearo they'd be ""Rebuildable Aspires"", but the point would be the same.  :)

The Genesis is top-coil, bottom tank.  The Kayfun is top-tank, bottom coil.  The genny has to fight against gravity to get the juice up to the coil, so you generally have to use something that can wick via capillary action.  The Kayfun uses a vacuum to keep gravity from dumping the juice in your pocket, and it can get a bit fiddly.

You *can* get much more vapor production out of a genny, but doing that has it's own set of issues, specifically keeping the juice where it's supposed to be when not held perfectly vertical.","1393632170"

 [**CryptoLocker**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoLocker): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;**CryptoLocker** is a [ransomware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware_(malware\)) [trojan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing\)) which targets computers running [Microsoft Windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)  and first surfaced in September 2013. A CryptoLocker attack may come from various sources; one such is disguised as a legitimate email attachment. When activated, the malware [encrypts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) certain types of files stored on local and mounted network drives using RSA [public-key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), with the private key stored only on the malware's control servers. The malware then displays a message which offers to decrypt the data if a payment (through either [Bitcoin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) or a pre-paid voucher) is made by a stated deadline, and threatens to delete the private key if the deadline passes. If the deadline is not met, the malware offers to decrypt data via an online service provided by the malware's operators, for a significantly higher price in Bitcoin.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Is this for regular numbers? Or is the (dot) for scalar products of vectors? In both of these cases, the proof depends on two fundamental facts which hold for any numbers (or vectors) *a*, *b*, and *c*:  
*a*·*b* = *b*·*a*  
*a*·(*b*+*c*) = *a*·*b* + *a*·*c*  
The first is called commutativity (of multiplication) and the second is called distributivity. Using only these two facts, the proof is:  
(*A*+*B*)^2  
= (*A*+*B*)·(*A*+*B*)   
= (*A*+*B*)·*A* + (*A*+*B*)·*B*    {Distributivity}

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; I think you're misunderstanding the categorical imperative here.

You're probably right there, it's been a while and I was going out on a limb a bit using that.

&gt; To see why it doesn't apply here, consider this: would you use the categorical imperative to determine whether or not to repair shoes for a living? If everyone does it, everyone starves.

Again, you are right it does not apply to all situations. The argument I was trying to make (unsuccessfully) was this:

If it is 'rational' for one individual to not bother voting, then surely it is 'rational' for all individuals to not bother voting. However, we know this is not the case because if all individuals did not vote, there would be no election.

&gt; Any given individual vote only determines the outcome if that vote breaks a tie.

I'm not sure I agree with that. Even in the case of a tie-break, if an election is won 100 votes to 99, you might say one individual vote determined the election, but which one? There were 199 votes in total, and it was ALL of them that determined the outcome, not one particular vote.

Following on from this, if a candidate wins an election by millions of votes, your vote still had the same influence on the outcome as every other vote.

&gt; [people vote in larger elections] because the goal isn't to change the outcome (perhaps the goal is to feel a sense of civic pride or to assuage feelings of guilt about not voting)

I think this is part of it. It's not just the outcome in terms of 'winning' and 'losing' - it is the outcome of a successful democratic election (which is good, because voting shouldn't be about self-interest anyway, but that's another discussion). Participation is its own reward and all that.","1393632172"

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","You say that suicide seems like the easy way out. Well that's exactly what it is. Life throws a lot of shit at us, and all we can do is take the blows and roll with them. If you give up now you will never know what is waiting for you on the other side of this rough patch. Everyone's luck changes, sometimes for the worst, sometimes for the better, but I can promise you that things will pick up. Suicide is a very permanent solution to a temporary problem, and I can assure that you that this is temporary. In 20 years you are going to look back on this, and you will not believe that you even considered ending your life. 

Some of the world's most amazing people started with nothing, absolutely nothing, and yet they still managed to achieve insane things. What makes you so different? You say you aren't smart, that you aren't good at sport, that you're socially awkward and have no future. Says who!? You are the only limit on what you can be and what you can do. Achievement is 10% talent, and 90% blood, sweat and tears. It's cliché, but it's true. Keep fighting, no matter how much life kicks you down, keep going, because you are going to come out the other side of this, it might be a long fight, but it will end, and that end is not suicide. There are 7 billion people in this world, you haven't even met a fraction of a percentage of them and yet you seem to be of the opinion that nobody wants to be your friend? Well you're wrong. There are hundreds of people out there who would count themselves lucky to be called your friend, people who aren't Shitty like those 'rats' you talked about, go out and find them. Don't worry about feeling awkward, because everybody is human, and everyone has insecurities and worries, you will get over them, just like you are going to get out of this rut in your life. 

I sincerely hope this helps you, please, please, please don't give up. You are in a really rough patch right now, but if you end it now you will never get to experience all the awesome things that life has in store for you, and trust me, they are waiting for you, just hang in there.

PS. I like your denial, making it specific about my country

It's not just Cyprus  mate ;) Actually Cyprus is increasingly adopting the western concept of being 'gay'.

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","Where did I say anything like that? I explicitly said that there are situations that we explicitly cannot describe mathematically. If I agree that there are things outside of the knowledge of mathematics, how can I be a reductionist?

I am not a reductionist. Reductionism doesn't make any sense, because not everything is merely a sum of it's parts. Chaotic systems, for example, display qualities that are not present in their component parts. They are more than just a sum of their parts, and display qualities that require unique mathematical tools which were developed over the past century.

If you want to call me something, based on what I've written here, you could call me a positivist. Though, I'm not sure I am really a positivist, either.

I admit that there are things that might not be describable, but there are mathematical proofs that most systems are describable using existing maths. I can point you to some of them offhand, but every example I've given has been backed up by proofs and personal experience with these systems.","1393632179"

It took me about a month to find anyone I actually wanted to meet, but when I did it went really well. I received some weird messages from older men that were a little off putting and some men seemed overly entitled and angry, but no outright sexually explicit messages like the ones that get posted from OKC. Most men genuinely seemed interested in getting to know me, as opposed to just convincing me to hook up with them. I think the fact that Match is designed for and attracts people looking for relationships, not just casual sex, helps filter out a lot of the worst people.

If anyone can find an official copy of Doctrines of Salvation Vol 2, check on page 48 and see if this quote by Joseph Fielding Smith is in there.  I found it on a non LDS site so want to make sure it is real.  

&gt;The Father has promised us that through our faithfulness we shall be blessed with the fulness of his kingdom. In other words we will have the privilege of becoming like him. To become like him we must have all the powers of godhood; thus a man and his wife when glorified will have spirit children who eventually will go on an earth like this one we are on and pass through the same kind of experiences, being subject to mortal conditions, and if faithful, then they also will receive the fulness of exaltation and partake of the same blessings. There is no end to this development; it will go on forever. **We will become gods and have jurisdiction over worlds, and these worlds will be peopled by our own offspring**. We will have an endless eternity for this.

"boston","t5_2qh3r","Usually I don't like talking politics online because the internet in general is more liberal, I'd hope people in this thread aren't going to downvote the republican because he has different views. Even if they do, oh well, it's my dedicated ""conservative"" account anyways, so here goes nothing...

&gt;increasing tax base in a small area so overall tax rates can decrease


Are most republicans for or against this? I wouldn't see this as fair if it's talking about making areas that are higher priced pay more per $ of what their houses are worth. It's arguable everyone yields a similar benefit from services provided by property taxes (roads, police, fire, etc...) and while a flat tax isn't fair (Every property is $xxx no matter what) I think taxing every property on it's assessed value, so $x of tax for every $1 your property is worth, is more fair than saying a certain small area has to pay for their property at a higher rate. I would be worried about not only the fairness of the system if tax rates were to ""target"" higher income areas because honestly, taxes in Boston are high enough as is and I'd be worried about wealthier people leaving the city if taxes shot up for their homes. 

As far as the infrastructure, any expansion is probably more expensive than upkeep of what's already there and has been there for years (I haven't looked at any Boston city report on the costs of upkeep of roads and bridges however so I can't say this with 100% certainty.) And while road taxes come from property (because the gas tax is state wide, not a city tax) you have to remember a lot of bike infrastructure relies on the same roads that are used for cars and trucks. Also, I feel as though there's already a good enough infrastructure in place where people will bike to work if they want, but the fact of the matter is that most people aren't going to bike anywhere in the winter, when it rains, or when is 90+ degrees. You need the car and public transport infrastructure for days like this. I think it's good to give people options with transport, but it's not worth pulling funding from the core types of infrastructure that are already in place. 


These are just my opinions though and if I was seriously in charge of making decisions like this I'd need a lot more time to look at studies, budgets, and would want to hear further into both sides of the issues. I wish more people on reddit would realize this, because sometimes its fun to have a debate you'd have with a friend over a beer without someone personally attacking you for political viewpoints/","1393632183"

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","I went through this with my dad. He reminded me (at 11) that the shame I brought upon myself also damned my entire family. That, and that I was to lay in the bed I apparently made, so it continued as a form of punishment. 

My mother, on the other hand, when she found out was mortified, angered and guilt-ridden she hadn't known, and made me understand that I was still precious and worth every bit of love in the world. It took me years to tell her, and I'm glad I did.

I got old enough to realize not only was it not my fault, that old testament mentality is what makes people hate Christianity, and spread hate to those around them. And that my father was clearly not right in the head. 

I remember, 10 years later, finally being with a man that I loved for the first time. I was terrified of what my mother would say, what she would do. I ""did it again"", but this time I made the choice to be with someone, outside of marriage, out of love. It had taken a lot for me to get there. And I came to her, and confessed what had happened, and she looked at me, tears welling up in her eyes. You know what she said? She said ""did it... did it take some of the pain away?"" 

And I wept. And I told her it did. And I sat there in awe as she hugged me, and cried, and told me how *proud* of me she was. Proud. In spite of all the pain, and going against everything I was brought up to believe, she was *proud* I made that choice for myself. 

You've got a long hard road ahead of you, but let me tell you this: not everybody is going to react the same way, and just because she's in denial, and saying hurtful things, doesn't mean you are any more to blame. Rebuild, move forward, and know that it slowly does get better, with time, patience, and people who truly love you supporting your journey.","1393632189"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Although it won't be in the *very* near future, I think movement could be solved with Omnidirectional Treadmills in a few years.

Things will be very different from the way they are now, especially in scale. If you had a TES-like RPG, there could be horse-riding or hiking through the countryside, but it would be adjusted to a level where it's a significant distance but not like 5 hours of walking through the woods.

&gt;I have no desire at all to be active when I'm trying to be lazy.

Then why play games at all? In games you have to think and interact and press buttons and figure out problems. Why not just watch TV 24/7? You don't need to interact, you can just sit there and be constantly fed a story.

Why walk when you can *segway*?


In the future people'll be walking around and stuff, but it won't end up being running around at full physical exertion constantly like CoD or Mirror's Edge, because nobody would ever be in a situation like that.  If you tried to play CoD on a holodeck, you'd get tired pretty quickly because CoD is totally unrealistic and you'd be sprinting around shooting everything and anything that moves without rest for hours on end.

Games will adjust and be designed to have an acceptable level of physical activity, at a level where it's not exerting you but you're still capable of moving around in the environment and actually *feeling* like you're moving instead of moving an abstract version of yourself by moving a stick or pressing buttons.

At the moment our society is very much focused on a sedentary lifestyle, the major forms of entertainment being reading, watching TV/Films/Plays, listening to music, and playing games. When games reach a point where a game is better for having the player physically engaged in the story, I think we'll see quite a boom in physically fit people.","1393632190"

Back before the large setup I had today and literally a few days before the 1st stand was going to be ready for an inhabitant...I received word of a Giant O.scyllarus that was apparently caught specifically for me without my knowledge, either way I wanted it and 1 was on the list.

But I had no where to put it for the few days before the 1st stand was ready for inhabitants (the spearer stand), so I had to fashion a ""cell"" for the big smasher to prevent it from killing my larger spearers...smashers are far more pugnacious and powerful then spearers so there really isn't much contest.

You can see in the photgraph how Morgoth the zebra spearer below has arched himself in the defensive combat position, bringing his telson up front to cover him, whilst the Juggernaut above eyes him down...

Nothing ever happened, neither actually came face to face and the dodgy jail sell held up, the giant smasher albeit cramped looking, even successfully molted inside this little cell.

&gt;It neither became better during the last 10 years, nor the last 3. So what are you trying to tell me? I don't know what ""better"" means.

Before it can be better there have to be a step. But at one point you were better i guess. Because you don't remember a time it was better does not mean it can't be better. That you found something in your life what makes you smile at some time. Gives your life aim again. Find work with you like. etc

&gt; I won't since these people just want to steal my money and dumb me down with their drugs and endless talk.

I don't know your healthcare but mine pays for medicine and therapy for my illness. So i guess they pay something don't they?

&gt; Happiness is for people who have too much free time

Happiness does not require much free time. I can be happy just for a moment but it can through the whole day.

&gt;  It's just a drug that blinds people

Why is that emotion a drug. And to what does it blind you?
Happiness is more enlightening i think. It appreciate moments more. Let someone strive for more.

&gt; That makes them look away when facing all the world's problems.

It does not make someone look away. I think it helps people to help others. It helps to survive still in those world problems but looking away is more because of hate, pain and greed.

Can be but don't have to. Not everyone is a parasite. Its to a big part their decisions.

fuck each other, ignore all problems and just produce even more parasites.

The subreddit sidebar quite clearly says non-conservatives are not exactly welcome. So by participating on their site you are indeed trolling whether that is your intention or not. Why can't you respect their wishes? 

But regardless, I hadn't been to /r/politics or /r/conservative in a while so checked them out. I didn't see anything to back up your statement about /r/politics but I did see what is perhaps your issue with /r/conservative. It seems it has really become the conservative version of /r/politicalhumor. It's mostly stuff making fun of the other side, highly partisan, and not a place for discussion. The only differences between it and /r/politicalhumor is that they admit they are biased and obviously their bias.

If you want to continue your crusade to combat inaccuracies you should consider adding /r/politicalhumor to your link. At least then you'd be participating in a place you're welcome.","1393632196"

personally at the moment league doesnt seem much fun to me (but thats prolly just my own opinion), and ive been playing for ~4 years now. this has nothing to do with being bored with it after 4 years, its more a problem with the current meta, i think, so it *shouldnt* be too big of a problem for you.

if you want to get started with a dota clone, then lol is a good one, as its easy to learn, and a lot of fun, if you dont play to win in every game. that being said, try to find friends to play with, because if you dont, the community will drive you crazy (think cod community, only without voicechat). league is more fun with friends, too.

im *guessing* league will have a certain longevite to it, based on community size, so getting started now shouldnt be too bad. that being said, if you dont want to spend real money on league, it will be a LONG way for you to grind yourself to a decent amount of champions and runes. someone recently did the math, it takes about 4 years to get all the champs and runes/runepages, given certain high playtime requirements, and i can confirm based on personal experience, as i have been playing for about 4 years, and will in a few weeks probably have all the champions, so it took me a while. if you dont want to spend real money.


let me put it like this: try it for a month or so, and if you like the game keep playing. if you dont, just stop. the grind will get worse and worse (but you also will always learn new things and champs and stuff, so its up to you).","1393632202"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;I'm sorry, what does ""rhetorical question"" mean to you? Because to me, it's a question that's intended to make a point to the listener, not garner an answer.

Right and he presented a question in the guise of demanding an answer. It [the question] wasn't to ""make a point to the listener"". Using proper reading comprehension skills, one reads a request for evidence in the context that they did not care if the theist explains ""the origin of the universe with God"", as long as they provided proof so that the op could accept it. Again, not rhetorical. 

&gt;Given that they both have the same basis of ""somebody made something up once,"" yeah, they kind of are equivalent.

This is the problem and the presupposition you are starting with. Assuming I read this correctly, you are asserting that God, like pink Martians, is the product of man's fanciful imagination. Again, assuming I was right about that statement, your positive rejection of the existence of God is not a sustainable position in the hopes of retaining any grasp on reason. The most you can say is:

-Outwardly: ""I do not know if God exists"" or ""I do not care.""
-Inwardly: ""I, personally, do not believe a god exists.""

The moment you make a claim that God does not exist or that He is the product of man's imagination, you lose what grasp you had on reason because you affirm your own deity in the process. What I mean is that the only way you can know there is no God is if you are God because it takes such a being to know for sure. 

&gt;It must be rejected as all unfalsifiable and baseless propositions are. There are an infinite number of these, with an infinite number of them being contradictory. In order to define reality, we cannot use them.

&gt;God is one of these.

While I generally dislike the phrase ""you can't prove a negative"", I have to call you out - again. You are making an irrational claim that is not sustainable because of the fallacy side of the universal negative. The problem with this idea is that all claims without evidence must be rejected (according to you) because there is not evidence to support them. I am reminded of the rediscovery of the Coelacanth (the once believed extinct fish, found alive). In light of the fact that the fish was found again after once figured as being extinct, would it have been rational to reject any idea that the fish was still alive? Certainly not. ","1393632203"

"STD","t5_2s4ni","Unfortunately yes it can. 

~80% of the adult population in the us has herpes type I (which is also called oral herpes) the majority of outbreaks are on or around the lips/mouth. With the increase in oral sex we are seeing a lot more cases in the genital region. 

The good news is- your girlfriend probably already has oral herpes and has never had an outbreak- especially if you two have ever kissed on the mouth right before a sore started or while you had one (which I am assuming you have since you were kissing her vagina). 

So yea- she can get it down there and should watch for symptoms because the first outbreak is the worst but can just feel like a urinary tract infection. 


So yea bottom line- shit happens. She probably already has it from some other source (her mom, sharing glasses, chapsticks, or a previous lover) but try not to make love to her mouth or vagina when you have a cold sore or when you feel one coming on.

They may score high, but it seems we have a biased moderator here. It is widely understood in the NeoReaction community that Jews are a PC-sheltered ethnicity. What you are arguing is that a) Jews are the smartest b) Jews should be protected from any ""blame."" Hrmmmm... I'm starting to see a pattern.

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","vocal stamina is a really good point. im new to streaming but feel i have a good hold on everything. I try to do full 8 hour streams. my voice is DEAD today haha, but that'll get better in time. if anything, talk just to improve your vocal stamina, its amazing how draining that can be and you don't want to be in that situation when you do have viewers.

that leads me to my next point: while you do want to talk all the time, BREAKS ARE IMPORTANT. absolutely do not sit at your desk playing a game for a full 8 hours. i take a 5 minute break every 2 hours and maybe a 1 minute or two as needed. during that break, i switch to a break view in obs and stream some music. sitting for a full 8 hours is detrimental to your long term health, do NOT do it. get up, stretch, take a breather.

also, have something to drink handy at all times, your vocal cords will get dry from all that talking.","1393632211"

Though there probably never will be a society having dogecoin as its currency, I think the same idea kind of applies for it. Maybe something like dogecoin can offer a genuine alternative in the otherwise harsh world of finance and capitalism (these are just my own controversial opinions) in general. Doesn't have to be a huge difference, as long as there is any, it might grow when more likeminded people join. We can have that, and anarcho-capitalists can have bitcoins and [seasteading](http://www.seasteading.org/) for example, which is perfectly fine.

"vaporents","t5_2upjd","I've been using an MFLB for the last year or so and it's awesome. But a few days ago I bought a used Firewood 1.0 and it is so much better it's ridiculous. The only thing the MFLB has the edge in is stealth and portability, but since I was mostly using it at my house the firewood is much better. The taste on the firewood is really good, and once it gets heated up you can blow clouds like no other, like comparable to a desktop. Like the MFLB it really helps you conserve, you can do a single pinch and get ripped and feel it for hours. I haven't tried the firewood 2.0 but I can't imagine it's gotten worse, I'd say go for it.

The only thing I miss since switching is that with the MFLB I could take a small drag and put it down, and do that every 15-20 minutes. With the firewood it has to warm up, so your basically forced to go through whatever you put into to it in 1 quick session.","1393632212"

"beatles","t5_2qt7l","Rick Astley was a prophet too.  When he says ""were no strangers to love"", its really about how love is inside us all and we may not always recognize it but its there all around us. When he says, ""you know the rules and so do i"" he is referring to the fact that the rules or 'nature' of love is set by a higher power and if we are open to receiving it we will be fruitful.  

Is there a deeper meaning behind the Beatles music?  Sure, but not in the sense this article portrays.  You can find whatever meaning you want behind their lyrics.  One of the beautiful things about art is that it can be interpreted many different ways to many different people.  Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up can be a simple song about love or a meditation on Love as a whole.  

This article is implying the Beatles are prophets and treating certain interpretations of the Beatles lyrics as dogma that is inspired from somewhere to give us spiritual truths. Doesn't this seem a bit much?  

The Beatles are a great band with great music and many great qualities.  I'm sure when they came out they may have even seemed like a force of nature as the article states.  But they were not prophets (though bigger than Jesus). Fun read though for all its ridiculousness.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Android commands colours to be produced on a screen as a percentage of maximum colour intensity (with no awareness of what the gamut is). If a display has gamut beyond sRGB the maximum colour of sRGB will be intensified and be over saturated. Pretty much all content is designed for sRGB. Setting maximums outside sRGB makes the display look more vivid than a screen with sRGB colour gamut but is ultimately less accurate.

So if the screen is capable of going beyond sRGB, it's good in terms of progress, but they should give us the option to constrain it to sRGB since we generally work in that colour space, and not some arbitrary boundary that they have defined. If we know that certain content is specifically designed to be in, for example Adobe RGB, we can switch to that wider colour space. But simply forcing sRGB content on to a display calibrated with wider gamut than sRGB isn't the way to go.

Basically, that triangle should not exceed the sRGB triangle if it's accurately calibrated.","1393632212"

Sure, but you can just use the m40A5 or the Gol Magnum (both of which I find better than any of the rifles you mentioned) if you want to do that and you don't have to sacrifice your long range potential if you need it.

Also no gun has all of the things you mention. The FY-JS, for example, compared to the gol and/or the M40A5 has a identical hip fire &amp; moving ADS accuracy on top of a slower rate of fire. The only thing the FY-JS has on either of those weapons is a higher muzzle velocity which ironically is less important under 100m than any of those other stats.

"swrpg","t5_2vzmi","What I dislike with this method of accounting the linked weapons is that you pay extra hard points for no real added efficiency. Let me try to prove my point :

- front mounted single medium laser
- add a second front mounted unlinked laser.

You can now shoot 2 weapons in that weapon arc, those weapons will be shot by 2 different shooters, them being dedicated gunners, or droids or whatever else you can imagine. You actually need an action each to shoot those 2 weapons against 2 targets (who could be the same).

Now let's start over with linked weapons :

- You install a weapon in the front arc.
- You link a second weapon to the first, paying a lot of extra money to do so (and as per RAW, 1 additionnal hardpoint). 

You now have a single linked weapon in the front arc, who can be shot by ONE gunner against ONE target. If you happen to get 2 advantages and choose to spend them that way, you can trigger a second hit, applying the same result, to the SAME target.

For me, the linked weapon does not deserve nor required a hard point. Basically, you installed a SINGLE weapon, who happens to have 2 barrels and that can hit the same target twice.

I've already stated this opinion in an earlier post, and most of the other posters disagreed with me ;)

As a comparison, if you replace a stock turret mounted weapon in the YT1300 by a single rule-described Quad Laser, you actually get a linked 3, accurate 1 weapon for ZERO hardpoints. If you custom build a linked weapon of your own choosing, you pay a LOT of hard points for a weapon that is going to be inferior. I dont buy that... :p

That's why this rule has been houseruled in my game. Of course, I am not trying to feel right, or to impose that view on anyone, you do however you please in your games, but at least you got a clear explanation why I do so, thus allowing you to consider another point of view on that rule that felt wrong to me.","1393632218"

As TSPS Operators, we basically fulfilled verbal requests such as ""I'd like to place a collect call to this number"" or ""I'd like to pay for this call using my credit card"". We didn't use the patch-cable switchboards pictured in this post. Instead, we used a [push-button console](http://www.privateline.com/circuits/TSPS_history.htm) with a single-line LED numerical display. Each console had a flip-card reference book.

Children who grow up in single parent households are more likely to be poor themselves, drop out of school, have children before they can financially support them, become addicted to drugs and alcohol and worse, they're more likely to end up incarcerated in their lifetimes than children who come from a two parent home.  There's many other statistics like these, all properly sourced that can be viewed [here](http://thefatherlessgeneration.wordpress.com/statistics/). 


While I do think it's great woman are more independent and less dependent on men (in general, esp the workforce), I whole-heatedly disagree when it comes to child rearing.  Besides for the multitude of statistics I linked above, a single mother is infinitely more likely to require government assistance to raise her children than that of a married woman (for obvious reasons).  It's a perpetual cycle of poverty passed on from one generation to the next that's rarely ever broken.  Hence the need for an even bigger welfare state with each new generation.   

None of this is good my friend.

So I smoked my first cigarette at age 19 or so. Coughed like mad, didn't see the appeal in smoking.

To this day I have absolutely no addiction to cigarillos, I can go for weeks and months without smoking, and if I smoke too many in a day I feel sick so that's a natural repellant.

Not saying it'd work for ya, but going your entire life without smoking at all seems kind of desperate. Are you so afraid you'd get addicted?","1393632220"

"Metalcore","t5_2rfut","Parkway Drive, Architects, letlive. and In Hearts Wake
 
Lyrically favorite song by each band:

Parkway Drive - The Blue and the Grey, crazy relatable deep poetic lyrics about sadness. ""..I sat on the rooftop until I knew deep inside, like the sky I will always be empty, the horizon, my love, forever just out of REACH"".

Architects - Unbeliever, the best album closer ever with a short summary of the state of humanity from the past until the present accompanied by amazing music. ""..But we sharpened our claws and we went to war with ourselves with each other with the rich and with the poor with anyone different who believes less or more, step out of the shadow cast by left and right wings, take refuge in each other and the triumph that it brings...""

letlive. - Muther, CRAZY personal song for Jason, the singer, about his issues with his mother cheating when his dad was in prison. I love how he seems to pull it off every show to give a personal speech about his struggles.

In Hearts Wake - Anything off of Divination but especially Winterfell (The Tower). Lyrically the entire album is interesting because each song is a Tarot card (The vocalist's mother is a Tarot reader). Winterfell is especially a favorite of mine because it doesn't feature annoying guest vocals (Looking at you Adrian) or too many muted open chords (Looking at you Departure). Lyrically it is about the environment right now written from the Earth's perspective, assuming that the Earth is a living organism. The Earth feels damaged and it is going to have a massive revenge on us humans. ""I dine with the Moon, I am the father of Mother Nature."" ""My winter comes for you all, I will make the mountains cry, I will call upon the raging tide, I'll bring the fire, I'll take the air, I am the Earth that we will never share, I will bring you down"".

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Been awake for nearly 40 hours now and working for 20 of those, so bare with me here. Hopefully not too much of a mad ramble:

I don't think anything changed Weezer, particularly, just the way in which Rivers communicated with his audience.

Pinkerton was recieved to pretty dire acclaim when it came out, it's singles did terribly, it was panned critically, and sold nowhere near as well as Blue (in fact, it's still sold only about half as well as Blue Album, going by Wikipedia). Thanks to this, Rivers basically went a bit mental, called a hiatus, and became somewhat of a hermit.

What he did in this time was start studying songwriting. Like, really studying songwriting - he's talked a bit about a folder containing hundreds of analyses of great pop songs from the '70s to the '90s (We're talking ABBA to Green Day and Oasis, so... alt pop?) that he made during his breakdown, and he used what he learned to write 'perfect' pop songs, as seen on the Green Album. He also talks a little about (relatively mild) drug use to aid in his songwriting around here - taking 'lots of Ritalin and tequila' before writing Hash Pipe and Dope Nose.

Now, the way he went about analytically (even clinically?) writing pop songs to be as appealing as possible doesn't, to me, suggest a huge change in Rivers' pre Green Album plan for the band - even since Blue Album, the band have made no secret that they wanted to 'sell out' (or whatever), and actively pursued going down the most corporate-rock route for promoting their music as possible, really capitalising on how effective a marketing tool a great music video was at the time. The difference between Blue and Green is that (I find, anyhow), their approach to marketing (being as aggressively mainstream as possible) started really seeping into their songwriting.

Now, here's where I'm kind of making blind opinion comments - when Pinkerton rolled around, Rivers' writing was... intense. Very intense and personal. Which is nowhere to be seen in Green. I'd say, from that, and how pro-mass marketing they were in the early '90s, suggests that the only reason Weezer has ever existed, has been as a bit of an ego project for Rivers, in a bid for... acceptance, I guess, from the record-buying public. Each album since Pinkerton seems to have been (to various degrees) a reaction to the preceding album. When Rivers really put himself out there on Pinkerton, and people hated it so much, that wounded him to the point of releasing the clean, impersonal, completely radio-friendly Green Album, and when older fans complained about how polished and subdued it was (despite being pretty popular, commercially), he tried to meld the styles of old and new Weezer with Maladroit. When Maladroit sold like shit (which is a shame, because it's fantastic), he went right back to releasing mindless pop songs on Make Believe. That worked, so they carried the trend on with Red Album, as well as jumping on using internet memes as part of their marketing strategy.

Red Album sold poorly again, so they released what I'd say is Rivers' most honest album since Pinkerton - Raditude. It's still mindless pop, for the most part, but they have by this point dropped all pretenses of being a 'real' rock band, having fun with some (somewhat) genre experimenting, collaborating with pop artists, covering Lady Gaga/MGMT at gigs, and basically fully embracing the fact that they are an embarrassing band of middle-aged millionaires still trying to writing music appealing to teenagers they have no connection with any more. Sadly, when Raditude flopped (being their worst-selling album to date), they decided to carry on riding the tired nostalgia wave with Hurley, and the Blinkerton tour, rather than carrying on just doing their thing, or quitting.

How do we ignore people on this site? Nintendo is slacking and they are so far behind there's no hope of them catching up at this point. I used to hand wave those kinds of accusations away as well but when you consider that they basically stopped supporting the wii in 2010 and are still behind in HD development, something they should have been prepared for at this point, they are hopeless.

The statement ""I was there, now I am here"" has meaningful content and can be quantified. How far did I move? How long did it take? How fast did I go? The statement ""I was then, now I am now"" is tautological. It can't vary, so it can't be quantified. (Go ahead and label it 1 if you like, but it could just as meaningfully be labeled 17 or ""blue"".)

"crypto","t5_2qq4h","For those who don't want to read it:

Each client has its own Pub/Priv keypair. Apple keeps the public keys in its infrastructure. When you start a conversation you request the Pub keys for the other party and then encrypt one copy of each message with each public key given to you by Apple. You send that encrypted message to Apple who forwards it to the appropriate client. There is some additional symmetric session specific encryption between you and Apple, blah blah blah...

The obvious flaw is that you have to rely on Apple for the key infrastructure and message forwarding. So you are sending to Apple a message encrypted with keys as instructed to by Apple. Its trivial for Apple to either swap their own keys in and tell you they are Bob's private keys (and then decrypt with their key and reencrypt with Bob's public key before forwarding), or even less work simply add an additional device to the list of Bob's devices which uses the NSA pub/priv keypair.

In either case your device happily encrypts the message with a pub key for which Apple has the corresponding private key and transmits it to Apple, and there is no obvious way to identify this attack. If the infrastructure owner and the message forwarder were two separate parties that could not collude this would not be so easy. I could ask you to encrypt with a key I control, but I would then have to intercept the message from you to the forwarding service to receive my message (or trick the forwarder into believing I am a real device of Bob's).","1393632227"

The war in Georgia wasn't a PR disaster for Putin, it was a massive fucking boost. It showed the world that Russia would stand up and fight. The EU and the US could do NOTHING to help their ally. That weakened them in Eurasia. The Bush Admin was complaining about Russian Airforce attacking Georgian positions outside of the ""warzone"". It was an embarrasment and the Russians kept piling it on by doing shit like destroying the Georgian navy and entering a town, then leaving only to enter it again. Sakasvhili tied his faith to the West and they abandoned him. The best he got from the EU and the US was $4 billion and they later distanced themselves from him.

In Syria Putin is winning the PR war. While the western media may be spouting the same old propaganda about Assad being evil and the rebels being freedom fighters. The rest of the world can see what is happening. They're seeing the West supportng people who are murdering Christians and any Muslim who doesn't agree with them. They're seeing terrorists blowing up cars and beheading people. The Syrian war is a fucking disaster and this is why the US has been pushing for Geneva. They want to get out of it.

All of this by the way when the US is supposed to pivot to Asia. This is a boon for China because it gives them more time and more free space.","1393632227"

Research shows a correlation between a child's morality and their favourite superhero and comic books can help establish this connection.

Yeah, if you want to be a SJW asshole no one likes, I suppose.

&gt;The issue is, we have words for transsexual/transgender people. But then what do you call everyone else who isn't trans (like myself - i'm not a trans person)? If you call them ""normal"" then that sort of implies that being a trans person is bad, unacceptable etc.

No, it implies you can read a dictionary and see the definition of 'normal' for what it is, a descriptor of fact.

Or, you could allow whiny drama queens to restrict your speech.  You decide.

&gt;Normally with sexuality we say straight and gay or heterosexual and homosexual, we don't say ""normal people"" and then ""gay people"".

With you there...

&gt;Of course, describing someone as ""cis-scum"" is just hateful and bigoted. Totally different issue.

Consider: the term was invented to 'other' straight people.","1393632233"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; Also, customers can discriminate all they want. 

Obviously. I discriminate against certain grocery stores because I don't like them. Unfortunately for many minorities before the 60s, that wasn't the problem. The problem was that most stores in the South that were owned by a white person didn't allow black people to buy stuff there. And yeah, you can say ""well, just go somewhere else,"" but that's just naive. Any place owned by a black person likely didn't have decent goods because they were forced to have a crappy shop and no one would sell them decent stuff because of discrimination. That's not equal. There was (and there's still some remnants of) a system of racism keeping black people and other minorities down. This deprived them the equal opportunity of life, liberty, and property. For the government not to get involved in what was happening would have been completely wrong. 

&gt; If the general population isn't ""evolved"" enough for you, then neither is the government, because the government was chosen by the general population.

Then why would they have to force their hand on so many things? Like slavery or racism. I bet slavery would still be around today if the government never got involved. The way Congress votes doesn't mean that Mississippi would vote the same. They would have voted to keep segregation. To keep slavery. The government has to step in in those situations where rights are being taken away from a certain group of people. 

&gt;  in fact, I would argue that the ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property"" part makes forcing private businesses not to discriminate unconstitutional.

*Person*. And they aren't depriving that business of property. They still have the property. Businesses have the ability to discriminate based on whether you are financially capable of entering into the business deal with them, as well as discriminating based on your conduct in the store. 

The Commerce Clause gives Congress the right to regulate commerce. The Supreme Court has ruled that this allows the government to regulate pollution, business, and many other things. That's what we have to go by. Of course, there are dissenting opinions from some judges, but the Supreme Court has the final say. 

This comes down to a fundamental difference on how to deal with the Constitution's lack of foresight. You either look at it as that's how far it goes or you look at its vagueness as the founders leaving room for interpretation as new issues arise. I think the founders were smart people, but they lived in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Honestly, I think we need to just create a new Constitution, but people are too cynical and think the government would try to take too much power for that, as well as put the founders on too high of a pedestal.

Nor is the one-year delay of the employer mandate an affront to the Constitution, as Professor Michael McConnell and Congressional Republicans insist... Rather, the President has authorized a minor temporary course correction regarding individual ACA provisions, necessary in his Administration's judgment to faithfully execute the overall statute, other related laws, and the purposes of the ACA's framers.

Number 3 is a has nothing to do with Obama expanding anything.  Saying he has the ability to so something does not mean he is or will.  He has the ability to unleash our nuclear arsenal and destroy the planet.  Are you afraid he is going to do that too?  

Number 4, like the first two, is neither unprecedented, unusual, or unconstitutional.  

Number 5 didn't happen.  He did not use the IRS to specifically hamper or target any opposition groups.  A field office in Cincinnati may have used some improper search words. It's trademark manufactured GOP outrage over nothing.  Good lord.  

So basically you have nothing. ","1393632239"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt; I'm not a professional when it comes to this sort of thing, but I believe if I was in your position I'd go ahead and put one artist on the whole project, so that the artistic style of the core rules book is consistent from cover to cover.

In a perfect world you'd get an art director to work with a project manager to find artists who can work in a somewhat similar style to ensure consistency. Maybe even find a colorist separate from the artist.

More realistically, however, is a client in this industry apart from the big publishers is going to have to act as his or her own art director and project manager. At that point, finding the right mix of artists who can present some manner of unified art direction based on past work in their portfolios is *critical.*

I do have my Krusty shuttle near the beach, since those tour buses are often in touristy spots in real life. I'd like to redesign the town though so that all the Krusty stuff is together, and all the movie stuff is together. I also want a grand boulevard up the middle.

I do like sections of my town, though, and I hate to pick it all up. So I tell myself ""when I get all the land, that's when I will redesign"" so I can just move things instead of picking it all up.","1393632240"

OSRS:
- Low level graphics, easy on your computer
- Unique (not available in rs3) content such as NMZ, rooftop agility

It's not because of your religion...it is because you are a douche.  I know your religion's beliefs...I know the parts you left out so you can openly discriminate and judge, in the name of righteousness.  I know the parts of Christianity that tell you how to act, not tell you how to make others act.

If your beliefs interfere with another's rights, and you are happy about that...you are a douche.

Basically, selling for such a low price means that your order will be filled at the best possible prices all the way down to the selling price specified.  This is useful if you want to sell large quantities of doge that will completely wipe out all the buy orders at a certain price.

For example, I want to sell 1M doge.  But the highest bidder only wants to buy 10k at 191.  If I sell 1M doge at 1 satoshi, the first 10K will be sold at 191, then the next 990k will sell at whatever the next best price is until all those buy orders are gone, and will then move to the next best price.  This happens until all 1M doge are sold.  This is the quickest way to sell alot of doge at once if there isn't enough buy depth at the price you want.","1393632260"

I'm guessing that your view is so black-and-white because of what's happened to you, and that's completely understandable, but many other views aren't.

Everything was great up until I asked her to be my girlfriend. We talked in texting and on the phone that id get a ""yes"" but we wanted to make it official in person and not over the phone or text.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm attacking your lack of citation or proof for anything you have said to me. I have backed up everything I said with quotes and links. You keep saying ""Americans will believe anything"", yet offer no proof to the contrary. You still haven't provided me with anything that the Soviets did in the Pacific theater, which was the whole point of this argument in the first place. 

As a side note, not one of the 10 or so websites I just look at disputes the leaflets, including two that are vehemently anti-US bomb dropping. I have never heard of anyone who disputes the leaflet dropping. Say, for sake of argument, that we didn't drop them. We still gave the Potsdam Declaration, telling Japan what we were going to do. So I'm not sure it really matters all that much anyway.

I'm not saying the US were the ""good guys"". I'm saying it was a war, and we made choices that had to be made to win that war. Japan did a sneak attack to drag us into the war, picked a fight with the wrong country, and lost. We would have killed millions more through a land invasion than we did with the bombs. That, in itself, is enough to justify the bomb. Yes, it killed civilians, but millions more civilians would have died as a result of invasion. I want you to honestly tell me that a million more deaths would have been preferable to losing thousands from the bombs. Answer that question. 


And another serious question, what exactly do you mean by ""half american""? half citizenship? Because ""American"" really isn't an ethnicity, so i'm not sure how you can be ""half"". Kind of like saying ""half european"" or ""half asian"", if that makes sense? ","1393632272"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","well I certainly wouldn't advocate pursuing an addiction but it does seem to have a correlation with creativeness for some people. Although I'd say it's falsely considered a causation. My initial comment was inspired by a thought I had years ago after being moved by reading Inifinte Jest and then a decade later seeing the author complete suicide and finding out about his battle with depression - which he was afflicted with while writing IJ. Just seems that seeing reality - true reality - is the product of significant doses of adversity. That adversity can cause tremendous personal problems which can be conveyed in emotionally moving examples of creative works of art. No need for you to develop more demons - but if you do I hope there's a karmic, and financial, payoff for crossing that bridge(s). All the best.","1393632278"

"Boise","t5_2qlk4","&gt; “Self-defense can be an important crime deterrent,”says a new report by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The $10 million study was commissioned by President Barack Obama as part of 23 executive orders he signed in January. “Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was ‘used’ by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies,” the CDC study, entitled “Priorities For Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence,” states.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not a gynecologist, but my girlfriend's gynecologist is a gynecologist.  

I've learned that gynecologists can generally tell a lot of things about a patient's lifestyle from the examination.  For example: according to my girlfriend's gynecologist, my girlfriend is not a giant sloot.  Or, at least, she doesn't let diseased dudes plow her bareback, 'cause she's STD free.

Also, according to my girlfriend's gynecologist, my girlfriend is likely sexually active - something the gynecologist can glean about her lifestyle based on her recurring prescriptions for birth control.  Granted, this could be an error in judgment on my girlfriend's gynecologist's part, because - for all she knows - my girlfriend could simply be taking birth control in order to regulate her menstrual cycle.

These are just a couple of things that a gynecologist might be able to tell about someone's lifestyle that you might want to know about.  But, remember, I'm only hearing this third hand, so I could be totally wrong.","1393632278"

We also have Mormon settlements all the way south along the I-15 freeway, because Brigham sent people out to live there.

Doctrinally, we got a lot of reinforcement that the prophet is as fallible as the rest of us!  :D","1393632279"
"riseagainst","t5_2s2tr","I'll put it this way. Before Rise Against got big with Savior and Appeal to Reason, their shows were exactly what a punk show was supposed to be like and not only do I necessarily mean in the sense of smaller venues, but in terms of the community.

If you've ever been to a punk show you'd know that the moment you walk in, it's a community of like-minded punks. it's easy to spark up a conversation because everyone is into punk rock. However, since Savior just exploded, a lot of people who go to their shows only know their few songs and are disassociated with punk rock so their shows no longer feel like a bunch of peers seeing a fantastic punk band. Now, Rise Against shows are thousands of people attending to see one band for their new material. Of course that's going to happen when a band gets big, but not to the extent of Rise  Against. For example, Bad Religion (practically the father's of modern-punk) is a big punk band that can easily bring in crowds of 5,000. However, their shows still have that small, punk community feel to it. Everyone knows every song from every album. They've put out *16 albums* since 1979 and they play songs from *14-16 of their albums* at every single headlining show. And if you go on a Bad Religion video on youtube, people will talk about other punk bands when giving comparisons such as Pennywise, NOFX, Anti-Flag etc. However, with Rise Against, their fan base is now split into 2: people who listen to punk rock and people who listen to rock. Go on a new Rise Against song (Sufferer to present) on youtube and you'll likely see comments comparing Rise Against to big arena rock bands like Linkin Park or Foo Fighters. Now go to a Rise Against video from The Unraveling, RPM and even Siren Song and you'll see comments about other punk bands like Anti-Flag and Strike Anywhere. I'm not complaining that Rise Against is able to draw a bigger audience who listen to rock, but I am stating that because of this, Rise Against don't have that aspect their older shows had. 

I'll use a reddit analogy for this. /r/riseagainst is a small subreddit. Everyone here knows every album by RA and are fans. Now, imagine if /r/riseagainst suddenly blew up. It would turn out similar to any subreddit that explodes. /r/atheism was a sophisticated subreddit once, now it's a shit hole circle jerk (and this is coming from an atheist myself.) I'm not saying Rise Against are a shit band (I'm excited for their new album) but I think you see my point. 

It's good that Rise Against is able to get their message across, but the manner they've done it isn't good, imo.

Either way, I've gotten kind of over it and have excepted that Rise Against won't be the same (at least for a while) but I still don't like Savior or Appeal to Reason. In my opinion, it's generic, watered-down, major label friendly radio altered punk lol. To a lot of people who listen to punk rock, most stuff on the radio is shit and that's including radio rock. Savior may not necessarily be radio rock, but it's the punk version of it forsure. 

for a lot of people, radio rock equates to radio pop in the sense that it's generic sounding. people don't dislike radio rock because it's popular, but because of how unoriginal a lot of it sounds. I'm only stating this in case there's confusion because when people complain that ""Rise Against is now all over the radio,"" they're not complaining that it's being heard by a lot of people, they're most likely complaining that ""Rise Against's new material is so bland that radio is picking it up and playing their newer songs, which then affects their shows"" 

I think the hate of Savior would be less if Rise Against actually played their old songs live the way every other punk band does: combine the old with the new.","1393632279"

"poker","t5_2qhix","You already have a read on him being aggro, so right off the flop, you essentially know 100% that he will be barreling all 3 streets.  Now it's convenient to say ""he has air"", but do you really know that?  It's entirely likely he 3-bet you with Ax, and it's also possible that he 3-bet you with air like he has done before.  Just as you cannot assign villain to a specific hand, you cannot necessarily assume he has garbage either.

This flop has missed you pretty hard.  His c-bet range is literally any 2 cards he has so it's going to be hard to narrow him down from that.  I would find a fold on the flop, too often these situations come up where villain has Ax or he actually hit the flop.  Those situations are as likely or more likely than him having complete air here.  I don't like calling simply because there are few turn cards that can improve you.  You already claimed to outperform him post-flop, but you could be a heads-up God and if you don't hit that flop with something, you're gonna have a hard time.

Turn card doesn't help you.  If you at this point pin him on having no 7, 3, or T, it's probably better to shove than call.  You know for a fact that if you call, he is betting and likely shoving 100% of rivers.  How many river cards help you?  Are you really going to be able to call with a king high?  There's a chance you can end the hand here by repping that queen.  This is by no means an idea spot and it's entirely avoidable by folding on the flop.  But since you're already here.  It's unlikely he has the queen, and there's a fair amount of hands you are calling 3-bets with that have queens in them.  

River, easy fold.  You are not getting odds by any means even if you assign villain to any 2 cards in the deck.

I think the problem is that you've seen villain can be aggressive with air, so you assume ""if villain is aggressive, villain has air"", which is a false statement.  It might be true, but it is by no means always true.  A lot of times, villains like to play aggressive with air, show a bluff, and then sneakily switch methods to become aggressive with good hands, leaving you to think that he always 23o when he is aggressive.

Ultimately this is a psychological situation.  I'd say your biggest mistake is making too large of an assumption about villain.  Remember, he chose to show you 23o.  When he did that, he had to know that you would respect his bets less, and therefore he won't be able to get away with bluffs as often.  You know that he's capable of raising with air, but he also knows that you know this, and he's just as capable of adjusting as you are.  But back to the actual hand.  It seems like you just assumed villain had nothing, and called repeatedly without thinking too much about it.

In summary, it looks like you leapt to conclusions about villain and let those conclusions cloud your judgment by repeatedly calling streets with K high","1393632284"

"canadaguns","t5_2tzuf","You can always read the Firearms Act to see what they can and can't do.

The issue with this Swiss Arms rifle actually turns out to be sort of an exception, not the rule. Essentially a loophole.

The RCMP isn't actually reclassifying the gun in a traditional sense, what is happening is that some of the rifles that were imported turned out to be formerly fully automatic rifles (SG550) converted to semiauto, which is illegal in Canada. So these rifles were already technically prohibited, and hiding amongst non-restricted rifles. However, the RCMP is saying that all the guns are a variant of that SG550, so they are all technically prohibited.

This is happening even though there are as-made semiauto versions out there, which were the ones that the RCMP originally examined and made non-restricted 12 years ago.

The RCMP itself can't actually classify guns as non-restricted, restricted, or prohibited. All they can do is make a recommendation, after an examination, to Public Safety Canada, who makes a ruling, or Cabinet can issue an order-in-council to make a ruling. Which is why this ruling is very strange, and seems so abrupt.

So really, what should be happening is the RCMP should be saying that the converted versions are obviously prohibited, and retailers that sold them should give out refunds and take in the prohibited versions for destruction or whatever they want, or do trades for legit versions.","1393632286"

When he had taught all that he could, he took The Wandering Soldier to a hidden place and showed him items that surpassed anything else he had ever made. Transcendent in their perfection;

The Perfect Spear that would pierce any barrier.

The Perfect Shield that would hold back any attack.

The Wandering Soldier stood and stared at the beauty before him for a long time, the day ended and the moon rose and finally he moved to answer the unspoken question. Dropping his own spear, the proudest creation of his life now shaming him with its irrelevance, he kept his shield in hand and lifted the Perfect Spear.

Beside him The Smith took hold of the Perfect Shield and readied his blade in hand. Having crafted perfection and taught another, he faced his student without hesitation.

The Soldier lifted the Perfect Spear and struck like a viper.

&gt;**Tim Hortons Inc.** (known internationally as **Tim Horton's Cafe and Bake Shop**) is a [Canadian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) [multinational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation) [fast casual restaurant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_casual_restaurant)  known for its coffee and [doughnuts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut). It is also Canada's largest fast food service; at the end of 2013, it had 3,588 restaurants in Canada, 859 in the [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and 38 in the [Persian Gulf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf) region.  It was founded in 1964 in [Hamilton, Ontario](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario), by Canadian [hockey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey) player [Tim Horton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Horton) and Jim Charade, after an initial venture in hamburger restaurants.   In 1967, Horton partnered with investor [Ron Joyce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Joyce), who assumed control over operations after Tim Horton died in 1974, and expanded the chain into a multi-million dollar [franchise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchising). Charade left the organization in 1966 and briefly returned in 1970 and 1993 through 1996.

Or in other words, a massive increase in the minimum wage has minimum employment.   At the same time it lifts about a million people out of poverty and increase net income by $2 billion. 

Or raising the minimum wage to $9.00 would have an employment effect of less than 0.1% (i.e. less than 1 worker out of 1,000), lifts 300,000 people out of poverty, and increase net income by about $1 billion. 

Also keep in mind that the CBO's finding are slighting slanted to larger employment effects than the overall literature finds, once you adjust for Neumark's work. 

Nonetheless, the CBO's analysis does not support your claim that purchasing power would be hurt.  In fact, their analysis show the exact opposite; purchasing power would increase by billions. ","1393632293"

"FanTheories","t5_2u6rc","You being pedantic at this point, really. When you present the logic you are rigid and overly simple. You do it deliberately so it's pedantic. Nevertheless, I'll take the bait and respond.

&gt;also ignore Prometheus because it did not happen on LV-426.

Only Prometheus included the Space Jockey discovered in Alien and ignored entirely in Aliens. It was written and directed by the same person. That is de facto canon. It cannot be denied. Other installments can be 'forgotten'.

&gt;they are a part of cinematic history, you went to the theater, paid your money, bought the dvd, played the video game.

None of this legitimizes it as canon. It happened, yes. Just because it was marketed to recoup money invested in it does not in any way legitimize it as canon. James Cameron, among others, dismissed Alien 3's story for it's sharp departures. I suppose you are one of the dozen people that bought a ticket to Alien 3 (it was a flop). You probably liked the new directions taken, too. That's okay but it isn't canon. It's as much a departure from the original canon as my ideas are from you think is canon. When creative direction comes from studio executives and not writers and directors, it is not canon. If it is butchered without the involvement of the director, if it is disowned by the director, it really isn't canon.

In this way, we agree. You cannot imagine the Alien universe without a queen because you better appreciate the universe following the addition of the queen. I cannot appreciate the queen because it is redundant and myopic compared to what was portrayed as a perfect organism in the original. You want to keep everything as canon. I want to excuse misguided changes to the original canon by making the fundamental weakness of the queen central to her existence - she is a bastardization of something perfect because she's made by mongrels.

&gt;For example, if you watched the 1978-1980's Superman films, then you watched Superman Returns. Which was set in the same universe, you can't completely ignore the crappy films...or that strange insignia throwing moment in Superman 2.

For example, when Joker fell in the vats and magically emerged with permagrin and a penchant for purple... oh no, that doesn't work. It was a much better franchise under Nolan and Joker is more appreciable as a more realistic villain. You **must** ignore the Burton versions in order for the Nolan versions to work. You treat them as separate universes because they conflict too deeply on what is and is not canon. This is the same thing.

&gt;You're trying to rewrite history because you don't like it. If you can't make a fan theory that can stick to the series as a whole you've got nothing.

You've gone too far, really. First, my ""rewrite"" does not change any of the subsequent stories. Those stories do not hinge upon whether the queen is an abomination or not. Second, you cannot count every film with a xenomorph as canon. You cannot include everything that hat tips another franchise. You are saying the Predator franchise and the Alien franchise are all canon because Predator 2 had a xenomorph - not queen - skull trophy. From that we got AVP and a very different life story for Weyland than the one provided by Ridley Scott. According to you, these are both canon but they cannot both be right. Where did Weyland really die? You've got nothing. There isn't a way to reconcile the discrepancies. You must decide one is canon and the other isn't. ","1393632293"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I went to go work with the relief effort after the Haitian earthquake.  I've done deployments before, but this one was different in many ways.  In the past I've always gone as part of a team, and with the government.  A fair amount of planning goes into it, including your own personal ""If the feces meets the ventilator at speed"" planning.
The organization I went with didn't really seem that interested in giving us tons of detail, other than to say we were safe and we had plenty of food and water.  I was a little nervous and packed a bug-out kit anyway.

The trip in was exactly the same as all the other ones.  We met our rep, and customs consisted of a quick handshake and a hustle along.  The road (once we got out of the city) looked like it had been assaulted by artillery.

I arrived at the compound (the hospital was a short trip up the road), and was met by this wonderful blonde ball of energy.
""Oh!  Static!  You're our emergency medicine guy! We're so glad you're here and we can't wait for you to take over the ICU and the ER"" She chirped, radiating the power of the sun at me.

Whoa!  What?  I hate the ICU.  The ICU is who the ER calls when we have an emergency! :)

""Hey...  I don't know about that.  That's typically something the nurses do. I'm really an ER guy....""  She cut me off with this cute, but no-holds-barred, disapproving look.
""Static, I think you're going to find that while you're in Haiti, you're going to have to step out of your comfort zone.""  She literally said it.

At that point I was ready to throw down!  OH YEAH!  Bring it on!  I'm trained to provide medical care while getting shot at.  You want comfort zone!  I'll give you comfort zone.

She completely baited me, and I swallowed it, hook, line and sinker.

I shouldn't have worried.  After a couple of small changes, we were rolling!  We had an amazing crew, even if we never really slept.  We did insane amounts of work in that place, and saved patients that the local staff didn't think would be saved.

You can only have 100%.  And besides that there is lots of evidence of humans altering the landscape at large scales since the moment they arrived in the Americas (particularly through fire suppression).  So... what happens?  Who knows.

&gt;Can we not accept some changes and maybe put our money in more productive arenas? 

Sure we can.  Should we?  Why even try to reclaim something if it can't be reclaimed.  Maybe the oilsands are like a cancerous limb, we just need to cut it off to survive.  The list of hypothetical questions is endless.","1393632303"

Look up hypothecation and COMT (Conscientious Objection to Military Taxation.)

Lots to find using a relatively popular search engine.

And, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Peace_Tax_Fund_Act

The real problem is not forcing money out of the military's hands, but if precedent were accepted to allow COMT, then we'd immediately see COXX, where XX = whatever you hate that the government does.

That would quickly extend to health care, public education, etc.

Holy shit. WHAT.A.BITCH. That is disgusting. You seriously dodged a bullet.

Plus everyone in MUA is super, super helpful and kind.

Men can wear whatever they want. Women can wear whatever they want. And if they judge you for it *fuck 'em*. I can totally understand being self-conscious (due to these reactions), but seriously- they're doing you a favor in letting you know what pieces of judgmental crap they are.

As for your issue, I really suggest you completely let go of those people having power over you and what you wear. But, if you'll feel more comfortable blending in- check out asian BB creams. If anyone says anything, tell them it's a special cream from Korea (or Japan or whatever) and it helps heal your skin. Which is true!

"mtgfinance","t5_2vv1m","To add to this: You should have a price in mind when you buy, usually a double up is a good strategy, and how long you think it will take to get there. Have 3 indicators of why you're buying and why you're confident it will go up to your suggested new price, then mark that as your goal.

How many do you buy? For me it depends on the price of the cards, or you can have a budget of $100 for example for every spec, and don't go over that, either way.

When you get them, you can either list them at your new desired price or list them just under your desired price, perhaps in between buy and list price. This will ensure some profitability as it goes up and will provide a trigger to raise future listings. You should have the goal of selling out at the peak of the price spike so you don't have to fight for the bottom on the way down.

I dislike most overnight spikes. However this strategy works well for me for other short term gains.

that's my take. hope it helps.

I'd listen to their stuff in order to see their growth. Opiate, Undertow, Anima, Lateralus (considered their best) and 10000 Days is their most recent. 

Opiate is rough around the edges. Its great though.

Undertow is amazing. Sober is the song that put Tool on the map. 

Aenima was my favorite until I heard Lateralus for the 100th time or so. Stinkfinger, Eulogy, H., 46&amp;2 and Aenima were the main hits from that album.

Lateralus is just pure genius. Lateralus, Parabola and Schism were the main 3 songs. The Grudge and The Patient are also personal favorites.

10000 Days fell off a little for me, but I still found the music to be very enjoyable. Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot are great. I also love Right in Two.

Hope this helps. My only complaint about Tool has been the filler between songs. I just wish it'd just be the music.","1393632308"

dont get me wrong, im sorry you had to deal with it, and i applaud your standing up to it by taking the right channels, but in schools its completely different because most just dont want to admit its happening in their schools, and the others, being at least most of the ones that implement the zero tolerance policies, will fight for the victims case without holding their hand through the whole process, and offer help during or after the situation has been resolved (or both)

Of the other two breweries I only really recommend The Memphis Made Reverberation which is pretty solid. High Cotton's Saison and Bitter ESB aren't bad just not great.

The Yazoo Sue is a solid representation of the state mostly for its uniqueness. I'll disagree on the Adam Bomb though, it's good but I much prefer the Nut Brown Ale. It is really solid.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","That's not what I mean; it's nothing like changing the mounts.  It's more like the AF won't properly work on the newer bodies; something got lost in the reverse-engineering that breaks compatibility.  It's just Canon or Nikon making small changes to their system, but they know their own gear and have been planning future changes far in advance.

To ensure compatibility, Canon and Nikon would need to openly share design information with other companies.  Currently, they don't do that.

This isn't an uncommon issue.  There are plenty of compatability issues with auto-focus and metering.  Obviously this doesn't affect e.g. manual Zeiss glass.

In the past, third-party lenses were relatively inexpensive and often not very durable.  If a lens stopped working with the newer bodies, it wasn't a big deal.  Now, with much better 3rd party glass, it poses a much bigger issue.  Perhaps CaNikon will understand this and preserve compatibility; it doesn't seem that unlikely to me.

But, the original question was why these lens makers haven't been given much credit traditionally, and that's part of the reason.","1393632313"

"creepy","t5_2raed","The fact that I don't find a lot of meaning or beauty or enjoyment in postmodern art doesn't mean that I don't know what I'm talking about. It doesn't mean that my tastes in art are shallow, that I cannot appreciate abstraction and symbolism and context, or that all I'm looking for in art is objective talent, someone who can paint like Robert Bateman. It means that the art I appreciate is different from the art you appreciate. Loving art doesn't mean you love *all* art.

&gt;The ideas are becoming increasingly abstracted and the works, taken within context, never fail to be interesting of their own right, but the context has become so important to the work that many, especially those seeking purely objective qualities to appreciate, will likely find it wanting for visual substance.

One could argue that art which relies so heavily on abstraction, and which requires the viewer to learn such a convoluted and complex context in order to interpret what they're looking at (let alone derive any meaning from it), is making itself irrelevant and void of meaning and purpose. It becomes nothing but an exercise in self-indulgence. It comes across as nothing more than a desperate attempt to ""out-meaning"" the other artists and to prove that you're even more deep and provocative.","1393632314"

If you have u-verse available I would recommend  it.  Also, the channels are more intuitive. A non HD channel will be 104. HD will be 1104. Just add a 1. Pretty cool for my small mind. 

When I got it I got sold a tv/phone/internet package even though I have no house phone because it would be cheaper. They put in all sorts of discounts to convince you to the triple pack. I have no idea who benefits from thinking that there are more land lines as there are, butfukit.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I will always remember the day i tried to give blood, i apologize for the details tl;dr at the end. :D

When i was in high school there was a local blood drive event.  Anyone that wanted to donate blood would just leave class at a certain time, go to the gym, and give blood/get cookie.  I had ALWAYS wanted to give blood but never really had any chance until then so figured i'd do it with my friends.  During math class it was my turn to go to the gym.  Left class all snazzy and cool and headed with the other kids to the gym.  Sitting beside me waiting on the nurses (i think they were nurses) was a dude i never hung out with staring into space and bouncing his leg like a crack head. I asked if he was ok and he was obliviously crazy-scared of needles but still wanted to do it.  I talk to him for a couple minutes and genuinely felt awesome with myself for helping him calm down. 

After little-freaked-out-dude was whisked away it was my turn for the questionnaire. All was gravy - im healthy, no heroin etc. but the last question was the question about having sex with a man.  I was out in high school so i said Yeah... i mean .. of course i have.  The lady looked puzzled and asked if i was being serious.  Couple people stared and i stared back them confirming my answer (no fucks given) and the lady put down the questionnaire and told me i couldn't give blood today.  Blew my mind!

There is technology like what you are talking about in electric cars already.  They reclaim momentum when you apply the brakes.  Slow down the car and charge the batteries. But you still have to add energy to the car from somewhere. 

The road is a static object. It can't add energy to the car because the car had to move itself to start with. 

There is an idea to put magnets or somesuch UNDER the road and pump wireless energy into the car via a receiver. That WOULD work, but you would blow a lot of energy into nothing by keeping the lane charged. ","1393632326"

As far as I can tell, the Digg patriots were a voting brigade who would attack liberals and Ron Paul supporters, and NoLibs was their natural successor on reddit. 

NoLibsWatch was set up to watch for more activity.

However, NoLibsWatch now seems more concerned about the Conspiratards, who, as we have seen, do deliberately troll /r/conspiracy.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","&gt;I have no idea about censorship in S.A. I'd imagine it's less strict than other Muslim countries, but I might be wrong.

Pretty sure it's the strictest, actually. Where, famously, women can't even drive, because of a religious ruling. Most conservative, plus any criticism of the Royal family can result in imprisonment or execution.

&gt;It also depends on what you're talking about, in terms of censorship ie.porn, politics, etc. 

Everything, but mainly, ideas. So, politics, I guess. Anything criticising Islam is banned. I subscribe to Muslim YouTube channels, for example, but also atheist ones. Even associating with people they disapprove of will probably be bad. /r/INTP would most likely get blocked. My personality would definitely not fit in there.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","People on President Richard Nixon's White House staff and people involved with the Nixon re-election campaign embarked on various ""dirty tricks"" to get information about or discredit people they didn't like, some of them involving crimes, some just creepy. In the process of one of these, a group of people (""the plumbers"") were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committee's offices in the Watergate building in Washington DC (Nixon was a Republican). It was then discovered that they were hired by people in or associated with the Nixon administration and his re-election committee.  Liddy, Hunt and Colson were the main money men, IIRC. Nixon's top aides, Haldeman and Erlichman were both eventually indicted and convicted for their roles in the break-in and cover-up, as were the Attorney General and the former White House Counsel, John Dean.  

There was a key guy called ""Deep Throat"" (FBI Associate Director Mark Felt, it was revealed years later) who fed confidential information to Woodward and Bernstein from the Washington Post, and they helped to break the story open. There were Congressional hearings, and some key people (including Nixon's then-former counsel, John Dean) testified.   Congress ended up subpoenaing a lot of information from the White House, and the Supreme Court had to rule on some of that, since Nixon didn't want to give them any information, and used ""national security"" and ""executive privilege"" as justifications.  
  
One of the interesting thing that was revealed during the whole debacle was that Nixon had the Oval Office bugged, so that he could record all of the conversations there. Of course, many of those tapes became evidence in the case.  One of those tapes had a very suspicious 18 &amp; 1/2 minute gap of silence on it; Nixon's secretary Rose Mary Woods claimed to have erased it accidentally. To do so, however, would have been almost impossible. 
  
A Special Prosecutor was assigned to pursue the case, then Nixon fired him. Then another.  Nixon resigned before he could fire the 3rd one.  

As in a lot of situations like this, the original crimes became overshadowed by the attempts to cover up the administration's involvement by doing things like lying to Congress (a crime). Some top people from Nixon's White House staff and re-election committee were found guilty and went to jail, including Attorney General John Mitchell (the nation's top law enforcement officer, sorta).   
  
When it got to the point where it was likely that President Nixon was going to be shown to be involved in the cover-up and he would likely be impeached by Congress, he resigned.  

Ever since the Watergate scandal, the USA press has loved to add ""-gate"" to major scandals.  Originally, ""-gate"" referred to not a scandal, but the *cover-up* of a scandal.  But that has mostly fallen by the wayside now, and it just refers to any major political scandal, like ""Weinergate"".  
   
The revelations of Watergate accelerated the degradation of the American public's trust in their government that had been gaining momentum since the 1960s. There was a backlash against the government being too intrusive and powerful, particularly the executive branch, and Congress passed various legislation as a result.  Anti-wiretapping legislation was one example. Watergate arguably also led to the election of Jimmy Carter as President.  He was from the other main political party (the Democratic Party), and was widely viewed as a man with good, strong principles. ","1393632340"

"conlangs","t5_2red7","Words that are masculine end in -ł [ɭ], predominantly -ił; and feminine end in -o, most older words like *ænińo* ""life"", end in -ńo. Neuter is any other word. Words like ""abortion"" would probably be neutral, because there are so many strong opinions on either side nobody would want to be offended, so it's a kind of compromise. Same with toilets--though little kids might refer to them as masculine because their parents teach them to.

The definite articles are based on Latin *ille*, and they're:
* Feminine: *lo*
* Masculine: *li*
* Neuter: *lu*

If the word they modify starts with a vowel, it adds an m at the end for easy pronunciation. The genitive articles are formed by placing *kana* /kana/ for masculine, *kana'o* /kanaʔo/ for feminine, and *eíu* /eju/ for neuter before the owner. For example, *man's* would be *kano tankatał*.

strange how the MSM can get hold of a totally non connected girls picture, a girl that lives in another country, has a different name to the 'victim' she was supposed to be.

strange days indeed.

the answer to the why could be the fact that a French photo syndication website was used to coordinate the pictures of the 'victims', the photos of the SHES 'victims' were placed on the French version of Flickr something like six months before 12/14/12. somebody used a French website knowing that almost nobody in the english speaking web community would be nosing about on a French photo site.

Dash flies east, far away from Equestria for an unknown reason. During her epic journey she comes across societies very different from Equestria in terms of ideology, technology, etc and usually helps them out in one way or another. In her travels, she discovers there's a lot more to the world and her original intent in flying east than she initially realized.

You're right to be pissed, and it makes sense to connect your anger with a group culturally different than you. What wouldn't make sense is deducing that people of this culture are by nature rude and inconsiderate in any circumstance. And from what I gather, you aren't doing that. ","1393632345"
"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Incest laws are universal across all cultures. Revulsion or disgust to incest is something most of us feel. As with any disgust response (e.g. to infectious diseases), it's hard-wired by evolution to improve survival of us or of our offspring. It evolved because anyone who doesn't want to mate with their relatives would have a positive selection pressure since their children would be more likely to survive.

What's interesting about this is as society has become more progressive, we have come to allow people to do things that once would have been unthinkable so long as they don't harm anyone. A good example is homosexuality: in many people it brings about a disgust response when they see two men kissing, presumably because a man who wanted to have sex with another man wouldn't have been reproductively successful. But we recognise that individual liberty is more important than how evolution hard-wired us to feel, so what two consenting adults want to do is up to them, so long as they aren't hurting anyone.

The next place the argument usually goes is that they *are* hurting someone: their children, who could be born with defects. But would you disallow mentally disabled people to reproduce? People with Treacher Collins syndrome? Huntington's Disease? Dwarfism? Haemophilia? Cystic fibrosis? Where do you draw the line, and why?

In some of these cases, the chance of the child having it is 50% (assuming the other parent is unaffected). This is a much, much higher rate than with incest, even brother-sister incest. The chance of two random related siblings carrying a recessive disease is lower than the 100% chance of someone who we know has it. If you are going to stop the siblings or cousins based on a low chance, shouldn't you stop the 100% chance as well?

Personally, incest disgusts me, but from a logical standpoint I can't find an argument against it that couldn't also be used to do something most people would feel was wrong (homophobia/eugenics).","1393632345"

"chiptunes","t5_2qlmr","In a normal Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release volume envelope, each of these represent the time (or for sustain, volume) values of the sound over time.  So:

* Attack is the TIME it takes to get from no sound to the full volume of the note
* Decay is the TIME it takes (once you've hit that full volume) to get down to the volume level that the note will be at if you just hold it down forever
* Sustain is the VOLUME that decay goes down to and stays at
* And then Release is the TIME it takes for the note to get back to zero sound after the note ends.

So for example, to get a quick plucky sound, you could have a short attack, short decay, low/zero sustain, and low release.  use these settings with a noise waveform, and you get something kinda like a snare hit.  Hope that's helpful for you!","1393632348"

I, for one, get a very nice buzz from prolonged vaping. I also got one from smoking cigarettes, although slightly more so from the analogs. Granted, I use 18mg/ml of nicotine in my juices, but thats because I was a pack a day smoker. I hope to cut down to zero like you did some day as well. I feel like a huge part of the addiction is just going through the motions. Im on day 8 of vaping, I've had a total 4.5 analogs since I started vaping, and zero since I got my MVP 2.0.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","A few points:

A way to deal with price-matching is to demand the supplier give your store a unique product. So, the drill might have a small selection of drill bits, or a second battery, or no battery (sold separately) so the product is not identical.

Price points. What I hate about Bunnings is they drive real tool, timber and hardware shops out of business. So Bunnings will have Ozito (rubbish), XU-1 (also rubbish), Ryobi (once a good tool brand, now rubbish) and Bosch or AEG (the only good option).  Their 'huge range' is actually very small if you are only considering quality items.  By contrast most smaller shops sell *mostly* quality.  Anyone who has fixed a roof requiring scores of screws, and had to throw away 30% of the Zenith-branded shitty screws because the recesses in the heads are not milled out properly and the driver won't fit into it, will know how incredibly fucking annoying this is.

Zenith is a cancer on Australian society.

Supply chain: Suppliers have to do everything the Bunnings way. So products must be supplied in quantities and packaging/labelling that suits Bunnings automated stock management, so there is never any excess to store in 'back rooms', and a minimum of manual inventory management (eg, scanning in products).

They make no secret of using hand-written signs, staff in TV ads, and palletised display to promote a 'cheapest' image.","1393632357"

You're right. Hormones need to be applied as well. You'd be surprised what changes the body goes through, and I'd encourage you to research instead of saying things like this.

&gt; However, since sexual attraction is inherently physical, you can't just scold people for not being attracted to a physique, transgender or no. 

Yes...


&gt;Until science can offer surgery on a chromasomal level, nobody can be faulted for being unattracted to a post-op transgendered person.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","People keep saying the safari zone would have been impossible without democracy. 

The pokemon blue stream got through the safari zone twice with anarchy in ~ 10 hours with about 700-800 viewers (the first time they got to where you get surf they accidentally used dig to get out). 

Just for reference, it took them longer than that to cut the tree and get into Celedon city's gym, despite having even fewer viewers at that time.

The safari zone was your toughest puzzle as a kid because you were exploring aimlessly, and there are a lot of dead ends. What makes something hard in TPP is if you need to get a bunch of specific inputs in a row with no room for failure, especially if you need to press an input multiple times, but pressing it one time too many causes you to restart (Because of twitch lag, inputs are almost always pressed too many times, which is what made the ledge so difficult.).

The safari zone isn't like that, it actually gives you quite a bit of leeway for wrong inputs (I think about 100/500 steps can be the wrong way) and there are only a few spots where over-pressing a direction is even detrimental (most of the time it just runs you into a wall, which doesn't even increase your step counter).


edit: Even if you ignore most of what I said, and think it was *only* because of the viewer numbers (Which it wasn't, the lower viewer count helps with puzzles to a certain extent, but the game can't read inputs as fast as they're coming in after around 3k viewers), keep in mind that given a few days stuck at the safari zone, the main stream would have dropped down into the low thousands as well. Even if the stream ran out of money, there were dozens of trainers on routes 13/14/15 that would have given plenty of extra tries at the safari zone. ","1393632366"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Leif Ericsson is the most commonly named Norse explorer in regard to North America, however he has never been confirmed as the one who did visit the Americas. 

On the topic on what we do know about norse visits to the Americas we have established that Norsemen formed a settlement at L’anse aux Meadows in Northern Newfoundland. Ten or more building built in Norse style were built at the site and were first excavated in the 1960's. The site included housing for ships on dry land and a smithy that contained a working stone as well as traces of metals with vast quantities of slag iron material from working bogs. Both of these habits are not common to the work of local First Nations members and others who have inhabited the region. Radiocarbon dating has dated the site to about 1000 CE the same time as Leif Ericsson was believed to have sailed. The buildings themselves were built of timber and sod and were found with traces of iron nails further evidence that they were european in origin. For more information see the work of Ingstad and Wallace as they both were involved with the excavations of the site.

Both Wallace and Ingstad had competing explanations on what this site was:

* Ingstad felt that this site was the Vineland of Leif Ericsson as referenced in the Norse Sagas that spoke of a land filled with grapes, pastures and forests. 

* Wallace argued that the site was more of a temporary camp for exploration of the Eastern North America, citing the existence of butternut wood and nuts as evidence that L’anse aux Meadows's residents traveled south into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where they located the grapes and butternut which do not grow in Newfoundland. 

Additional locations have not been confirmed but investigation of a coin found in Maine and an expedition may have located a second site in [Baffin island](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121019-viking-outpost-second-new-canada-science-sutherland/). 

Many hoaxes or non-norse sites have been identified and claimed to be norse across the Northeastern Unitied states and Canada over the years including:

* The Kensington stone(hoax) - a fake rune stone with a journey of norsemen to Minnesota,

* Newport Tower (Colonial) - a stone tower in Rhode Island,

* Axe and sword in Port Arthur, Ontario (hoax) - the finders father claimed they were within his basement before they were ""discovered"",

* And many other rune stones and inscriptions.

You were absolutely not wrong to decline sex when you realized you were too drunk. On the other hand, when two drunk people go home together, it USUALLY means sex. Like it's a VERY common sign that sex will probably happen. I can't blame him for making that assumption. He flat out should not have had such a shitty attitude about it and his reaction was unreasonable. I would recommend that you avoid getting drunk and bringing guys home with you in the future. OR that you make your ""no sex"" intentions clear much sooner. It's the easiest way to avoid a misunderstanding like this.

Well. I don't want to endorse them, but LOTS of ""men's groups"" have plenty of ideas about why this is. I don't think it's as cut and dry as you present.

&gt;Foreveraloners and redpillers are only contributing to male misery by spreading inaccurate messages about what women actually want from men. Women have to be encouraged to speak openly and plainly about their preferences and desires, I just don't see how any kind of resolution can occur without that step.

I think this is interesting. I don't think... I mean, let me make my point by way of example. If you go to askwomen and say, ""would you mind if your husband or boyfriend made less than you did?"" you'd get a resounding OF COURSE NOT. You go talk to men about this, though, and it's almost a tenet of faith that guys who don't make much have many fewer dating options.  

This is NOT to say ""women don't know what they want,"" only to say that ""having an honest discussion about it"" is very very difficult. It happens the same with men. Men want someone ""fun"" and ""exciting,"" but somehow the blond with big tits always has men lining up to date her. 

&gt;the manosphere giving these men inaccurate information on how to do it. So these men end up transforming themselves again and again, trying every possible permutation of a broken template, and getting nowhere because that template was provided by other men, not by women.

This is... hmm. Can you give me an example of what you mean by ""inaccurate information""?","1393632372"

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I think I could've written that better.  I didn't mean that we should encourage bullying.  I was saying that often we inadvertently frown on dominance, and that is one way we do it.  I used that example because you used it.  But even in that respect, we are often taught to stop bullying by reporting it, instead of doing something ourselves.  If someone needs help to mitigate bullying, then sure go get help.  But by having that be a child's go to response, we are teaching them to let other people handle our problems for us.  Even in the real world, the police won't always be there in time nor do they have a [responsibility to help you.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia)  We should teach kids to take charge and handle their own issues, as well as asking for help when they need it.  I work at a high school coaching.  And bullying persists often after we intervene, and the kid who told is often ostracized further, but when the child takes charge himself and handles it, it usually stops.

On the second paragraph: I realize that not everyone is trained to stop a fight.  I'm not saying everyone should.  I'm saying that culturally we teach people not to act when they can.  To let someone else handle it.  A personal anecdote: One time I was at bar/restaurant.  This older woman may have had too much to drink or maybe just lost her balance and fell off her stool.  I saw this from the other side of the bar.  I got up and walked all the way across the bar just flabbergasted that no one else helped her.  There were at least four people just staring at her, and about fifty in between me and her.  I walked from one side to the other to help this woman up, and made it to her in time to help her up.  Stuff like this happens quite a bit.  This is only one story.  This illustrates my point that as a society we are no longer teaching people to take action.  ","1393632373"

Usually I hear conservatives just bashing the ACA instead of actually giving alternatives. Same with Dems though, they just kinda stick to what they want, as do Repubs. With all these changes in our nation, some things need a lot of reforming and two parties divided is never going to help. The Republican party needs to drop the 'marriage equality' and other social issues and seriously just talk economics. I just feel like congress should be a discussion  room, where ideas are shared and minds are open. But you know, no one else likes that idea. Especially the people in power. And if some one like me ever said things like this in public, we get named socialists, or dumb liberals and all any respect that either party could've had for the other is lost from there.

Same goes between Dems and Repubs though too. When I hear or read the word lib-tard, or fascist, or communist in regards to anyone who is not, I immediately drop any ounce of credibility that the person could've had.

I think there is some offset that the RNG is based off of, (ID, name, etc.) as there were times where the same rotation of pulls would drop.

On his head, there is what appears to be a cheap Halloween costume accessory of a Native American war bonnet. In Plains Indian culture, the bonnet and the feathers are earned in battle and hold significant spiritual importance. It's not a costume, it's not to be worn to parties by drunk white people.

More interesting, someone who is allergic to one cat may not be allergic to another cat.

I was a doctor looking for work on your second homeworld called Mars, but due to some bad racism, nobody would hire me (even though I had operated on humans in the earthquake zones of Scorpio V (my people's other homeworld) regularly).

I was spending most of my day in the bar when sailors started coming in. A heavy arms maker was installing many cannons on the ship, so the sailors had to go *someplace*. My Captain (then just recently promoted to Commander) was watching over his men, but one young officer was angry with him, thought *he* deserved the promotion instead. The young officer got very drunk and tried to stab my Captain in the back. I was trained in combat by my grandfather, and your human wrists are oh so frail.

After I broke the man's wrist, I used the knife and some bar napkins for a makeshift splint after snapping it back into place. My Captain then asked me about my past much as you did, and he offered me a place on his ship since there were not enough doctors. When the Old Captain, the madman, came, he wanted to kill me. Kaz ripped apart the Old Captain's gun, and My Captain put me on board without technically bringing me into the Navy (I am normally not supposed to because of the Friends Treaty). Later, I found out that he had been giving me one third of his own pay every month, since I could not be paid.","1393632383"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Couldn't agree more, progress isn't what's interesting about TPP for me, It's the idea that thousands of people are essentially willing on the actions rather than having any real control. 

As /u/Supreme1337 said we would never have gotten where we have without democracy and a lot of people would have lost interest, this is exactly what should have happened for the game to ever have been beatable, the game being impossible with a high number of viewers in the safari zone is such an interesting idea, losing popularity for progress is something I've never seen explored and I thought TPP would in such an interesting way. 

And just imagine the boom in popularity after the stories from the thousandth attempt of the safari zone with hundreds staying up to the middle of the night on a weekday to have the best shot of finally completing it.

I understand why the creator would want his stream to continue its popularity and why a certain part of the community wants a few weeks of memes and then to be done with it, but beating gym leaders is less interesting to me than progressing one battle in a cave before wiping again or learning cut after hours of trying when we used a different system to get certain pokemon to fight that gym battle.

TPP gaining popularity was obviously a fluke, I don't know what the creators original vision of it was but I assume it differs to mine, but what it is now is just a really slow lets play and I honestly think its continued popularity is just a product of hype rather than it actually having any merit any more.

There are a finite amount of resources combined with a growing population of consumers. As you suggested, technology plays a crucial role in this, too. Technology eliminates and creates jobs. I'm curious to see what the effect of computing power will do to labor forces. In the past, introducing a new technology hasn't been too big of a problem since the rate at which a technology displaces workers, it also tends to introduce new industries, creating demand for new workers. Computers are a game changer though and I don't think we fully understand the impact that they will have. Good question by the way, I'm interested to see what other people have to offer.

Because if the siblings were not very discordant, if both siblings got some formula along the way (and that's the most common scenario, isn't it?) then it's no wonder that the results in those families were attenuated to the point of not achieving statistical significance.","1393632384"

You can't just decide you're bored of a place and move on, you have to discuss everything you do, every day you plan, you can't just sit around one day reading, because you need to consider what the other wants to do.

Another way to show things are relative to what you experienced.

A dwarf lives with other dwarfs and has only ever seen dwarfs. he considers the tallest dwarf there to be tall. Then a 5 foot person visits. The five foot person thinks the tallest dwarf is short. The dwarves think the 5 foot person is a giant. Yet the average sized person thinks the 5 foot person is short.

Yeah I suppose it depends on perspective.  When I post something, outside of reddit, I always provide the full context of whatever it is I'm explaining so there's not any question of either intent or the knowledge I'm trying to convey.  If I'm scribbling down notes as I'm listening to something I'll fill in the blanks later and update the notes to be more correct than they were before.  That's assuming I knew what 'correct' meant at the time of course.

I really like to support the idea of sharing knowledge but only if the points I'm contributing outweighs possible detractors such as bad style, incomplete examples, etc.  Of course who it's being show too makes a huge difference too and it's often connected the knowledge/experience of the individual developer.","1393632396"

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","**Yes: civil engineer (in training).**  Dad suggested engineering after high school and I went with it (as I otherwise had no idea what I wanted to do); chose civil because I prefer things that I can point at*.  I work for a pretty small department of a pretty massive corporation.  I've been here for almost three years.

**I'm happy.**  Obviously, it's work, so there are days when I'd rather be doing other stuff, but I don't think any other job would have afforded me the challenge I needed.  The schooling is irritating but doesn't take long (another field I was considering was forensic pathology - suuuper interesting but like a billion years in school), so it's a relatively short bit of pain for a pretty good payoff.

Recommendation... **it depends how you want to live**.  Personally, my passion is far outside of engineering: I like art and I love to write.  However, I prefer to be comfortable and to pursue those things as hobbies (I will always find time for things I love) rather than to pursue them 100% as my dream-job.  I am not disappointed with my choice, but that's a very personal decision.

I considered pursuing writing after high school, but it's not a sure thing - it's like thinking you're going to be a rock star.  If you make it, awesome, but if you don't, you just have broken dreams.  I write now in my spare time and I love it just as much; if I end up published, awesome, if I don't, at least I'll have some money to pay for beer (in which to drown my broken dreams) ;)

**If you have questions, ask 'em!**  I'd love to encourage an interest in engineering - especially for any women out there who may be considering :)

2. Bitcoin is very, very secure if you understand it. My Bitcoin are more secure than cash in a safety deposit box. This affords a unique means with which to store and move value. In this way it has been compared to digital gold.

3. Right now, you have to be fairly sophisticated to securely use it, but the technology is quickly coming that will make this trivial. Think ""early days of email"" - it was one a novelty tool for tech nerds, now it's used by almost everyone. Bitcoin is maturing. In a disappointing way, the death of MtGox is part of that maturation.

4. Bitcoin solves big problems, now. For example, If you run a multinational business or have to exchange a lot of currency, the ability to transact in Bitcoin is big: individuals and institutions can send Bitcoin directly to each other in seconds anywhere in the world with no banking friction and for low or no fees. Remittances and internal transfers are an immediate use where Bitcoin can lower transaction friction. Many others abound.

5. By design, Bitcoin will appreciate in price as it is adopted. This encourages adoption. For this it is mistakenly called a ponzi scheme. That is false: Bitcoin has value because it has *utility*. The fact that early adopters can reap rich rewards is just a bonus.

6. Bitcoin is and will be in the early adoption phase for several more years.","1393632399"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Antibiotic choice is predicated on a number of factors.  There are a number of major classes of antibiotics (penicillin derived antibiotics are only one such class), each of which works in a different mechanism that lends itself towards different biologic activity.  Efficacy is certainly the first thing you look at - whether you have culture data showing microbe sensitivities to specific antibiotics, or just are treating empirically (eg if you suspect gram negative bacteria, you may choose an antibiotic from the aminoglycoside class).  The next thing you would look at is the side effect profile.  When many drugs can achieve the same primary goal of killing bacteria, you want to select one that damages the patient as little as possible.  This includes things like avoiding certain classes of medicines in young children/pregnant women (tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones), not using a medicine the patient is allergic towards, watching out for possible medication interactions, etc.  Recently, there has been a push towards the principle of antibiotic stewardship, where we try to use as narrow an antibiotic as possible to prevent further development of antibiotic resistance.  This means that if two antibiotics are equally effective and safe, we choose the one that is most specific towards killing the bacteria currently infecting the patient, rather than using broad-spectrum coverage.  And lastly, if there are a number of antibiotics that fulfill the above criteria, you go with whatever is in your hospital formulary/cheap/available in the right route of administration (eg only IV vs only oral etc).

What this all boils down to is basically a fairly standard set of protocols for most infections.  Many groups, such as the [IDSA](http://www.idsociety.org/Organ_System/), publish consensus guidelines for which antibiotics are indicated for which infections.  The typical strategy is to treat empirically until you get culture and sensitivity results, and then narrow according to individual patient requirements.","1393632400"
"California","t5_2qhsz","My post may have confused you, so I edited it for clarify. The SF/LA portion only costs $17b bringing the project total to the reported $68b. Also, Riverside and San Diego are not part of the current plan or funding.       

I don't care that the project is built in phases, it would be silly to thing a statewide system is going to launch on a single day.     

My problem is that we are spending a ton of money for a system that will be outdated by the time it's complete and won't connect any major cities for 14 more years. My problem is that we aren't going to have true high speed rail after spending all the time and money. My problem is that huge pieces of the project are talked about as if they're part of the plan when there's no financing or timetable for when or how these portions are going to be done.     

Taxpayers are basically being misled and promised the moon. I (naively) voted for prop 1A; I want high speed rail in the state, but we aren't getting a true efficient HSA system. We are getting an incredibly over priced and underwhelming system that won't connect major cities until 20 years after the proposition first passed and won't be fully completed (as it's often discussed) until somewhere between 2030 - 2040.

&gt; After fighting in the Crusades for three years, Dante rides back home to his family estate to reunite with his beloved Beatrice and his father. Dante sees a rider following him, but out of the blue, the man vanishes with no trace. When he arrives home, he sees the servants slaughtered, his father murdered and Beatrice near death. When her soul is going to the heaven, Lucifer takes Beatrice to Hell, telling her that Dante has betrayed her. Dante meets Virgil who guides him to Hell, and the poet explains that Beatrice had a bet with Lucifer that Dante would be faithful to her while in the holy war. In return, Lucifer would protect Dante and bring him back home safe and sound. Upon arrival in Hell, Dante learns that he needs to cross nine circles to reach Lucifer ad on his painful journey, he discovers who doomed his family to suffer in Hell.

Whereas an introvert might not feel any of those things at all, they simply have the preference to be in a quieter setting. - Paraphrased from Susan Cain

I'm not saying you can't talk about social anxiety, I'm only saying it's not actually related to introversion, other than perhaps introverts being overrepresented having those issues. 

If you can think of scenarios where the two intermingle and would like to discuss that - feel free, I don't care, just don't confuse the two and assume I can relate to you simply because I am also introverted - this is a mistake many people on this sub are guilty of. ","1393632404"

"Nootropics","t5_2r81c","I would suggest taking slightly higher dosages (500mg-750mg) of Alpha GPC to address those headache issues. From my experience taking enough choline is essential for piracetam to work. 

In order for most supplements to work you must have the optimum amount of nutrients in your body. For example in that Mega Men Sport Multi you are only getting 20% of your recommended daily allowance of calcium and 25% for magnesium, yet these are essential minerals your body needs and its necessary for piracetam as well as other nootropics and supplments to work. If you're not getting enough calcium or magnesium (or Iron, but you should be fine if you eat a lot of meat and spinach) from your diet, I'd recommend supplementing with Calcium Citrate/Malatate, and Magniesium Glycinate.

I'm intentionally not making a moral judgement about the situation in my statements, because the truth is the U.S. reply is going to be shaped by the economic, political, and strategic interests of the U.S., not by our moral outrage over Russian aggression. 

I'm very aware that Russian forces are in the Ukraine, but that fact alone is not what I'm speaking to; there is a very large difference between Russia moving forces into Crimea and actual fighting breaking out.

Your assessments about the potential consequences for the U.S. should it fail to project power in defiance of Russian action are warranted, but the truth is that the U.S. has had, and continues to have little options in dealing with Russia's near abroad. ","1393632405"

"stopsmoking","t5_2rbuf","I've tried quitting and failed a number of times, each time with a different partner. The only partner who was empathetic had watched his dad ""quit"" smoking (really, he had quit smoking *regularly* but would always bum when other smokers were around) and saw firsthand what the struggle was like.

This quitting attempt actually began before my 74 days; I tried to quit 2 days before Thanksgiving because my SO at the time kept pushing me to quit (it's really funny that a couple of weeks beforehand when we first got together, he had told me that he was just fine with dating a smoker). After 24 hours, my roommate had moved out (planned, but stressful), my ceiling started leaking, and I got a nasty email from my advisor. Since buses weren't running for a few days, I couldn't make it out to get a pack, but I buckled after 72 hours. 

He told me he couldn't fathom why I couldn't ""just"" quit smoking and that he was sure it was hard, but that I've done other difficult things in my life and it must be on the same level. I tried to explain that when you have a habit like smoking, that is both physical and psychological, that you've carried around for over 1/3 of your life, it's beyond tough to put it down...and that even though I stank, my teeth were yellow, my skin was gray, my nails were brittle, and I was throwing money out the window, my addiction was constantly trying to override that. He laughed and said ""whatever floats your boat, then."" He just wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. 

That's a really long way to say that I don't have a concrete answer for you. Maybe tell him that as your SO, he should trust that you're not lying to him by telling him that quitting is difficult or that it puts you on edge. ","1393632405"

You are literally proving my point for me.  

A failed check is not a fail state. There's equal alternatives to achieve what a speech check would have gotten you. There's just as much game to be had from failing the checks as there is from passing them.  

If one options is more appealing, it's on you, on you, on you. Oh sorry, there seems to be an echo in here. I swear I heard someone say that before.  If you only ever pass every e.g. speech check in your playthroughs, you are missing out on hundreds and hundreds lines of dialogues, so *I ENCOURAGE YOU* to go back and replay a low-int char.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Yeah, our summoner stands no chance. Even on single targets, with my burst (I'm almost fully geared, a certain piece has eluded me for many months, so i89, and I can bring out an Allagan Scepter and Ancient Buckler if I want to, though they give me a DPS loss instead of boost) they don't last long enough for his DoTs to tick entirely.

This puts me in the lead on single target DPS and AoE DPS in this turn. He's not the best Summoner around, no doubt, but he's very good and constantly working on how he can improve his DPS in the turn.

We're at the point where we kill the second dreadnought before bugs and the spinner rook come down, but I think I come out ahead during that phase, too.

Basically, for short, bursty fights Black Mages come out ahead. Short AoE bursty fights, and that's way better. Summoners are very integral to many strategies, including ours during Twintania, but strictly speaking I don't understand why people attempt to make arguments like that.

The Black Mages they're comparing against need to learn their jobs better.","1393632407"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","That isn't the case tho, the majority of hits are the right target. The process of using a drone has a lower percentage to mess up than sending in a group to get the target.

The locals hate the Taliban and extremism just as much as the next guy, they want life to be good and they want the fighting to end. Keep in mind, they still hate these guys but every now and again someone has a brother or a friend who ends up on the wrong side of things and the lines get blurred because lets face it, no one wants to see a loved one die.

They hate the Taliban but love family and friends, its not easy for them to get back to normal. On one hand they don't care how these guys die but on the other they still don't want to see a loved one die. 

Reddit makes drones out to be the worst thing ever created, using drones to spy on civilians is wrong and thats the real issue. Using drones to remove bad people and to survey the terrain and keep on eye on rough areas while its necessary is completely fine. If it keeps a guy from stepping on a mine then go ahead, its getting the same job done.

I think at this point Parkas winning is a foregone conclusion. I know BTC does have the strength potion advantage and might manage to get his hands on speed as well, and when he eats the apple if you count the extra absorption health he'll have 5.5 hearts, but I just can't discount the advantage Parkas has given that they have two players and can always just choose to snipe him from afar if they really want to win. Still, I think they're hoping for a more exciting fight than that and I hope BTC can at least get a few good hits in.

"feminineboys","t5_2vmuo","You might think your hair is getting long now but I could guess that the urgency is coming from a high frequency of haircuts in the past. It might be strange and alarming deep within just letting your hair go, but consider it. You're getting right into the cutie zone right now, inching your way into the vicinity of pixie cuts and adorable bangs and stuff. But it's up to you where you want to take it now. You have a cute face, either way you go you're not going to be 'gender-locked' by your haircut. But if you let it grow out, your possibilities will keep expanding. 

So as /u/Aphetto said, getting the lip ring and letting that set in for a while before making other major decisions regarding your appearance. Goings with a buzz cut with a single lip-piercing is a pretty bold presentation in my experience; a lotta people work it really well. But I think it's an aesthetic of its own that tends towards a more widely regarded masculine appearance. My favorite part of it, however, is how it highlights feminine features in a slightly contrasting manner.

If it were me, I'd go for the piercing and think a little each day about where you want to drive your appearance because it is still developing at a pretty high rate. You've got time to hone in on your personal affinities for style, no need to fret over it all now.

Also, mind if I ask what you're getting done? I've had two lip piercings and I must say my medusa hurt hella worse than my labret did and eventually rejected in a shitty way. I had what felt like a clitoris forming on the inside of my upper lip for a few months even after removing it. Make sure you take a gander at your piercer's portfolio and see if they have follow up photos for what you're getting. Don't let some amateur with no reputation tell you they don't need a portfolio because these are the self-assuring con artists who will take advantage of the agreement you sign absolving themselves of legal responsibility for whatever happens to your face after they guide a metal bar through it. Without influencing you to think they know what they're doing sans credibility, shitty piercers can't make money. Be aware of this fact.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Well thanks! 

I think the key aspect here is *mixup*. If we're dealing with the philosophical question of ""does God exist"", then we're trying to determine some fact of the matter -- quite distinct from other questions we might ask, which I'd take to be more in the pragmatic realm:

- Does/should it matter to us whether God exists?
- Does God's existence serve a useful explanatory/predictive role?
- Can God's existence be (dis)proven in a suitably efficacious way?

These are all fair questions to ask, and heuristics and parsimony-related concerns are relevant to them. Where things go off the rails is when one addresses the non-pragmatic philosophical question -- i.e., *does God actually exist* -- in this way. When that's what we want to figure out, such principles no longer apply, and in attempting to apply them we get bad reasoning (in particular, arguments from ignorance).

So differently put, if someone wants to say: pony up the evidence or there's no reason for me to waste time on your weird belief, fine as far as it goes. If someone wants to say: pony up the evidence or your weird belief is false, then something has gone wrong. ","1393632416"

I don't understand what you're getting at with this.

All I do know is that none of us are psychiatrists, and the ideal would be for his monitoring, incarceration and liberties to be at the discretion of highly trained physicians who a) know what the hell they're talking about and b) have spent real time studying him.

Clearly he needs enhanced monitoring in any case, but there's a long way between fully medicated walks to dropping him off at the side of the road to fend for himself.

My problem is with people who can't tell the difference, and won't make the distinction between advocating for monitoring and safety support from the government and second guessing the science.

Psychiatrists won't cut him loose with no supervision unless the voters' representatives make them. So let's not backseat drive this one.

"ArcherFX","t5_2sae2","Maybe I just care way too much about this, but since a lot of people are defending Pam and this season (which I'll admit, I'm pretty darn disappointed in so far)  I wanted to give my perspective on it.

A bunch of commenters here are saying a lot of it comes down to screen time and NOT a change in her personality.  I disagree.  We saw a lot of Pam in the late arch of season 3 where she and Archer had a constant fuck-buddy agreement going on, so even though she's been present more I don't think it's been by a ridiculous amount.  And as for the format change? I thought that Archer Vice had the potential to be absolutely brilliant.  And the extra screen time?  Last season I would have begged for more Pam.  It would have been amazing to see her be a constant field agent with Archer and Lana. From season one to three, pretty much every scene she appeared in was straight up gold.

Now, her personality.  In the first three seasons, Pam's personality transformed from insecure and desperate to confident, dominant, and no-fucks-given.  This was pretty good development in my opinion, I liked seeing her transition from the HR rep looking to hook up with SOMEONE (""no one will sleep with me!"") in the office to a hardcore, underground bum fighting, street racing, Yakuza involved, can-get-sex-from-whomever-I-fucking-please, field agent candidate extraordinaire.  And, to top it all off, she's got pretty much all of her vices under control.  Alcohol? Sure, she gets shit-faced but it's nowhere near the dependency that Sterling and Mallory share.  The only thing stuff that gets out of hand is betting on fighting, and we only see her lose the one time. 

So what makes Pam so god-awful annoying to some of us this season? Let's start with backwards character development.  Remember how confident Pam has become in herself? Yeah, let's toss that out the window.  Last episode, she tells us she's been doing so much coke because she hates her body.  The same body she had become pretty comfortable with, the same one she's stuffing cupcakes into while she tells Archer this (and she's somehow is still losing weight? Come on, coke is an appetite suppressant)  If it's an attempt to show how Archer has matured, well, we've already seen that over the previous four seasons and we certainly don't need Pam to become more immature to prove that.  

Second, she has absolutely no interest in anyone other than herself.  Archer fucks a *lot* of things up.  He's gotten several of his coworkers killed over his selfishness.  He doesn't tell Woodhouse that his brother has died.  He tattoos a *baby*.  So why do we let him slide? He's an ass, but he actually cares about other people.  He pauses his asshole-ishness when people genuinely ask or need him to.  Examples? Not telling everyone Cyril was the reason they got a virus in the mainframe (although he did force something out of it for him, although he kept his word there).  Escape from pirate island.  Turning back for Lana in the dessert.  Dieing for Lana.  Not having an Archer-roboto fight with Barry.  Pam, on the other hand, could not care less about anyone she works with anymore.  The ONLY thing Pam's conversations include is coke.  Not a damn thing else.  And worse, she doesn't learn from any of her previous experiences.  She's addicted to coke, but that doesn't mean she can't be aware of the fact that blabbing about it continually gets her and her friends in danger.

As a rebuttal to a previous comment, it's also not that we're mad Pam's fuckups drive the story more than Archer's.  Archer is the root cause behind their chase by the biker gang.  Pam snitched, but he was the one stupid enough to bring coke along and then tell Pam.  Mallory is the sole reason everything went to shit with them in the first episode.  So no, it's not a diversion from the initial story driving either.  

Anyways, those are my two cents on why I really dislike Pam and find most of this season incredibly subpar compared to the previous four.

"subaru","t5_2rdhg","If you have a 2002-2005 USDM Wrx you can easily swap in an EJ207 if your EJ205 starts to have issues. They use the same wiring harness except for the JDM ECU needs a few wires ran for AVCS to be active.

The EJ207 was found in the 2001-2006 Wrx STi in Japan and Select forester STi models.

All of the EJ207's are claimed to make ""276hp"" but are massively underrated motors much like the Lancer Evolution 8/9.

**2001-2002 ""Bugeye""**

The version 7 STi used a two liter EJ207 with a VF30 turbocharger ( Similar to our VF39). The Spec C model had superior head work and a ball bearing VF34 that spooled faster than the VF30.

**2003-2004 ""Blobeye""**

This is when the EJ207 got equal length headers and a twin scroll VF37 turbo as standard. The superior heads of the version 7 Spec C model also become standard making for a very wide powerband from around 3000 rpm - 7500 rpm. Also the advent of DCCD in the GD STi , It was a factory option that you could have added to the car. The Spec C model once again had a VF36 turbo which was a ball bearing version of the VF37. It had stiffer suspension and also an automatic intercooler sprayer that activated to keep intake air temps stable.

**2005-2006 "" Hawkeye""**

Shared the same basic motor as the Version 8 JDM STi but with the addition of an Immobilizer.

**Special Versions **

S202 STi ( Version 7 Special edition)

Same as the Version 7 Spec C but with Equal Length headers , All the parts out of the STi store and a track spec oil cooler.


S203-S204 STi and RA-R STi

The king of the STi versions and extremely rare with very few being made.

The S line subaru motors were hand made and balanced in the factory. The turbocharger used was VF42 which was a twinscroll turbo similar to the VF22 but with titanium internals. 

RA- R motors were the same as S203-204 motors except not balanced and hand made. 

All of the special addition STi motors used much more aggressive ecu mapping making them capable of well over 320HP on the stock turbo.

We're making money grinding the Elite 4. The less money we spend, the more we end up losing every time we die. There's literally *no reason* not to spend this money, it's just being wasted everytime we blackout otherwise.

eg: If we spent all our money, then beat Lorelei (who gives 5.5k for being beaten) then immediately die, that's 2.5k to spend on items.
If we don't buy anything, then do the same, we'd make a net loss in every way (except exp gain).

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","&gt; Removing that self-CC helps to begin filling the current problem that rifle is only decent vs a single target.

It wouldn't really change that.  Net shot and overcharged shot would still only affect one target, meaning that you still have no defensive options against groups.  All of the pistol/shield defensive skills affect multiple targets, with static shot actually becoming stronger against more than 1 enemy.  That sort of difference isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that rifle needs to play differently.

Rifle isn't a bad weapon, it just needs more skills/traits which support it.  Pistol/shield covers for its poor offense through kits, and great traits like incendiary powder.  If rifle had comparable options to cover its weaknesses, it would be fine.","1393632424"

2) When any and all things within reality can be manipulated on the whims of God then there's no reason to make any predictions.  There's no reason to experiment with anything if a being can change how the reaction would work whenever it wants.  It doesn't avoid the supposed ""circular logic,"" it just adds a whole bunch of extra baggage to that problem that their ""solution"" doesn't actually fix or address.","1393632426"

They'll humiliate themselves, abandon their parents, they'll do anything a white dude wants just to be with him. And unfortunately some of our guys fall for that.

In the US, we see that a lot with East Asian girls. In fact, it is so prevalent that about half the time when I see an East Asian girl with a guy he is white. It's especially common with Filipino women. It's so common that I am actually surprised whenever I see a Filipina with a guy that is not white. However, we don't have a whole lot of East Asians in the midwest so perhaps this is a regional thing. The most common interracial pairing here is likely BM/WF, with WM/HF being a distant second.

Indians, on the other hand, are relatively insular over here. It's rare that I see Indian women with a man who is not also Indian. I'd venture to say that I have actually seen more IM/WF couples than WM/IF ones.","1393632430"

These are not realistic alternatives though. Europe will not allow us to have our cake and eat it.

In any case, the reason I said probably stay in, was that there are large, huge majorities in favour of us staying in if we can secure concessions which are essentially symbolic. This is the contradiction for Eurosceptics - The British are ultimately conservative and pragmatic, and they will when presented with the option for radical change shy away and flinch.

&gt;That's what the Pro-EU debate is now. Hiding that the EU is moving towards federalism, and trying to stymie the real alternatives based around trade from becoming common knowledge. 

I make the pro-Europe, pro-Federal case separately. Typically I say, if you want more democracy, more accountability in the EU, this is how I would like it to be done. And I usually get positive responses, actually.

&gt;Add to that the EU needs new treaties/powers to deal with the crisis, and the UK now must have a referendum according to the 2011 European Union Act

Technically only insofar as a treaty is being proposed. Which has not been done.

Also, it is far more fair and politically honest to have a referendum on EU membership as a whole than a specific treaty. Either you're in the clubm or out of it, a halfway house should not be an option.

&gt;Keep campaigning. Keep casting light on its flaws. Keep pointing out the harm it is doing. Respect the result of the referendum for a couple of electoral terms, and campaign again in the third if the 2011 European Union Act doesn't provide another one sooner.

In other words, not respect the expression of the British electorate? Golly.","1393632432"

I'd also like to have at least 8 kids due to my utilitarian views. 

I mostly stayed out of the gender issues until I took a women in the u.s. economy class (for my econ minor, it was the only one open). They brought up some things that I ended up doing more research on, and eventually that led me here. I definitely enjoy reading the debates, and I think being more of a 3rd party observer here (at least for the first couple months) helped me understand issues more. It's nice to see how differing opinions connect/disconnect, and I think more analysis (of my own) on it helps me learn more about the world. I think it's important to learn more about changing views, because the best views in the world are meaningless if you can't convince others (in terms of our society). ","1393632433"

Currently, Google is running a trunk full of rack mounted servers.  That won't be the case in 5 years.  In 5 years, the additional hardware could cost as little as $10K to $15k.  Self driving cars will fly out of showrooms at a $20K premium.

Even with $100k premium, there would be tremendous demand for the technology.  Older, wealthy people who are no longer able to drive would gladly pay that much to maintain their mobility.  Many commercial users could easily justify a $100k premium.  It would pay for itself within two years, perhaps less.

This *doesn't mean that lactating will 100% prevent breast cancer, just as masturbation will not with 100% certainty prevent prostate cancer.*

Do I really have to explain simple mathematics to you? Cancer is a *random mutation based disease* which occurs upon a bell-curve of likelihood based on many **primarily genetic** risk factors.

Will eating potato chips and not exercising give you thyroid cancer? No. Will having a mutation in the PTC oncogene? YES.

Diet and exercise may alleviate *some of your risk factors,* but disease isn't quite as simple as that.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Hi /u/wedgeomatic. I don't think the contention is that different ideas aren't being presented in different ways, making analysis viable and wise. The contention is that if you do decide to pick and choose based on analysis, that for instance ""love"" is the true message meaning passages that don't follow being loving weren't the right message, then there isn't much of a reason to also pick the lines about deities.  
  
It would be like if I picked a random book, and said all the passages about water were the crucial ones, so we ignored all the passages about deserts and dry fields. Wouldn't the characters of the story all so not be picked? They're not water. To my understanding that's what analysis that leads to picking and choosing does.

I would argue that you really can't define the entire series as being a children's series. The first few, yeah, they were books written for children. The last half of the series is certainly not for kids. But that's fitting, you're supposed to feel as if you're growing up with Harry and his friends during the series.","1393632441"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Huh? You've completely gone off base.

the OP said it is horrible game design to force Ifrit into doing his skill at a specific percentage and you said being able to burn him without killing nails would be horrible.

But on Garuda Hard Mode you can burn her without a care in the world for wisps/rocks and you do NOT get punished for it. That is good game design, if you have high DPS to ignore something and focus target, you should not be punished, you should be fine. And in Garuda HM you are, in Ifrit Ex you are not, you're punished for ""being too good"".

According to you though, it is completely fine to ignore something in 1 fight and still win, but it is horrible game design to ignore something in another fine and be punished for it.

It is an IDENTICAL situation. And you have a hypocritical and contradiction opinion on ""horrible game design"". Although you could just say Garuda plume ignoring is also bad game design and shouldn't be allowed, then your statement would stand its own ground.

btw for your point 3, if you don't kill the plumes and focus, you still have no hazard.... if you try kill the plumes and fail, you have a big harzard, replace the word plumes for nails in that sentence and you'd see how it can be easily compared, but unfortunately that is not how it plays out since horrible game design forces to kill you for being too OP.","1393632441"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","The 18 month limit is only for Nexus models, and they were never meant to be everyday consumer phones. The reason Google stops support is two fold, 1 after 18 months most manufacturers stop releasing the necessary drivers to update the kernel properly, and second, most people reach the end of their contracts at 24 months, and in general are able to upgrade at about 21.

If you are using a Dev phone, then you probably want to develop for the latest hardware and not older hardware. Also, with the Galaxy Nexus, it used a TI-OMAP cpu. TI no longer supports mobile processors, nor have they updated the drivers to support the latest kernel. Google would have to use hacked drivers that would have very a lot of bugs.

Google isn't in the hardware game, so they don't want to be hacking around trying to make old hardware work through gimmicks on the new OS.

After ten seconds, Hiroku stands rather quickly and looks around him furiously, trying to find out who would do such a thing.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Essentially, Sutter convinced Ference to take a hometown discount, *and* with no trade clause to boot. Ference signed it without hesitation because, at the time, Calgary was a veritable powerhouse of a team and was fresh off a Cup run and a division title, with Kiprusoff and Iginla in their primes, and Phaneuf coming off of a very hot rookie season, *and* with Alex Tanguay being added to the roster to give Iggy a high skill forward.

Calgary looked like it would be a serious contender, basically. They were supposed to be the team to beat in the West along with Detroit and San Jose.

However, Calgary was uncharacteristically poor in their own end that season. Despite Iginla nearly cracking 100 points and Calgary boasting the most 30 goal scorers its had since the early 90s, they weren't going to repeat as divisional champs. 

With Phaneuf, Hamrlik, and Giordano all filling in as solid offensive defensemen, the team needed more defense. Regehr was in his prime, but he couldn't shut down an entire team on his own, and his hard-hitting style made it difficult for him to chew up minutes. Rhett Warrener was starting to break down with age, and our bottom six frankly sucked.

Ference's contract made him the odd man out. With the salary cap being really tight, his cheap contract made him *incredibly* valuable. So much so that Sutter had an offer he just couldn't refuse - a key shutdown third liner in Wayne Primeau, and Brad Stuart, who was the same age as Ference, but had a bit more defensive upside at the time - the only kicker being Stuart was a pending UFA. 

Kobasew was an after thought - having failed to live up to his potential, he was shipped out just to make room for Primeau without having to send the then promising Dustin Boyd back to the minors.

Sutter gambled that he could resign Brad - the key player coming back - and pulled the trade off... While Ference was talking to folks on the team bus. 

In short, probably second to Cammy's trade in terms of most awkward situation ever.","1393632449"

&gt; Jokes about the Swiss Navy might be finally put to rest if a tongue-in-cheek campaign to sell an Italian island to Switzerland succeeds, it's been reported.

&gt;Nearly 4,000 people have joined the ""Canton Marittimo"" Facebook group, suggesting Sardinia becomes Switzerland's 27th canton to help reduce the national debt, the Swiss 20 Minutes news website reports.

&gt;Andrea Caruso, who created the Facebook page, says Sardinians have always strived for independence, and the autonomy of Swiss rule could help ""exploit our land to our advantage"". But he admits such a move would be unconstitutional, in an interview with the Globalist website.

&gt;The campaign appeared after Italian voters were urged to write ""Canton Marittimo"" on ballot papers in a recent local election. It is not known how many ballots were spoiled in this way, but a Democratic Party candidate won, the website says.

&gt;Caruso posted a new flag on the Facebook group's page, merging Sardinia's Flag of the Four Moors with Switzerland's white cross.

&gt;A straw poll on the Swiss German-language Bluewin website found readers overwhelmingly in favour of the idea, with three-quarters of voters drawn by the slogan: ""Yes! Finally Switzerland will have a coastline!""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In short, effective and economically feasible [carbon capture and sequestration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm4dHLflK08), which retrieves carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere and stores them in liquid or solid form, preventing them from making worse the effects of climate change due to the burning of fossil fuels. This would save us from ourselves.

To elaborate, since the world's leading industrial nations have failed to rally public support for greenhouse gas reduction strategies and investment in renewable energy infrastructure, in exchange for short-term economic growth and the political advantage that comes with it, it seems like this technology is the only thing that's going to save humankind from the worst effects of extreme climatic instability once the average annual global temperature reaches 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.

*Trillions* of dollars will be spent within this century as large-scale droughts, like in 2012, and extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Sandy, continue to cause water crises, food shortages, and major infrastructural damage. An infinitesimally small fraction of that amount would be needed in order to reduce overall fossil fuel consumption, revert cities to localized consumption (especially in the agriculture sector), rapidly convert the world's fossil fuel energy infrastructure into one that receives most of its power from renewable sources. However, these suggestions are economically unfavourable in the short term (and *only* in the short term, since we will pay exponentially more in the long run for inaction), so politicians who try to run on these strategies don't get voted into office. 

This is especially true since oil, gas, and coal extraction companies and associations have multi-billion dollar budgets to lobby and fund the election campaigns of politicians who will vote in favour of bills that further their ability to make profits, and against those that don't. If this money was instead spent on research, development, and implementation of carbon capture and sequestration, we would be much farther along the road to having effective technology for this end. But then again, if they did this, then the American Congress and Canadian Parliament would already have implemented a carbon tax and/or cap and trade system that would reduce their profits, so it's also against their best interest to divert the majority of their political expenses to sequestration R&amp;D rather than lobbying and campaign funding.

Also, since wind/wave/solar power don't always align with peak energy use, for the sake of supplying power to the energy grid, and battery storage is prohibitively expensive on a large scale, fossil fuels would continue to be needed to balance supply to ensure capacity for times of high demand. Therefore, along with the above strategies of overall consumption reduction and energy infrastructure replacement, sequestration would still be necessary in order for us to continue burning some fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable in times of high demand.

**tl;dr: If you think in the long run, say the next 100 years, the US and other major industrial powers would save trillions of dollars by inventing technology that would retrieve carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and avoid the worst effects of climate change.**","1393632452"

(Public transit has many advantages over the automobile, but still is not nearly as healthy as a vigorous bike ride.) In a modern metropolis, not everyone can work a few city blocks from home; many will need to commute a substantial distance. It would be impractical for me, for example, to bike to work if I had to stop at every corner for a stop light. I live in Long Beach; if there were an express route from the east side to the west, I could get to my job in downtown LA by way of the commuter train, the Blue Line.

"YouShouldKnow","t5_2r94o","I am not a legal/tax expert, but I have filed my fair share of business taxes.

It depends.  There are, of course, rules on deducting all of those things.  For some jobs, it could be possible to deduct much of the income.  For others, you might find that there isn't much to deduct.

The main issue is that to deduct most expenses, you must have actually paid that expense.  Materials, clothes, etc...  For some things, like a phone, you can deduct a percentage of the cost based on the percentage that you use it for business.  Your car will be deducted by mileage and your home office by % of space regularly and exclusively used for your job.

So, yea, you can deduct a bunch, but you'll also make a bunch (hopefully).  This bunch that you make you'll be paying 15% (self employment tax) + your tax rate on.  So you probably won't win versus being an employee, at least not in a job where it is iffy if you are an employee or not.  If you own a business, then you certainly can set prices and such accordingly to make a decent profit.

There are certainly scenarios that work out better each way, but suddenly converting to IC from hourly isn't usually one of them.","1393632456"

**JOSHUA WILLIAMS**

The night was his anytime he wanted it, for as long as he wanted it, and he took it often.  The road yawned out before him and behind him and disappeared altogether into a fresh, familiar galaxy, his foot on the pedal and the hum of the motor the only constants he preferred.  

He never understood Sam’s fascination with the city.  No peace there, no time, nowhere near enough open space to let the breeze fly through his hair and his thoughts drift upward, away, dissolve in the stratosphere and be reborn.  It was a polluted place, crowded, too many agendas working against one another, and if anonymity happened to be the draw?  Well, he thought solitude trumped that any day.

McMillan was a different story.  Hers was a role to play, all propriety and process and the ceaseless pursuit of higher knowledge, but he’d outgrown academia a long time ago.  He wondered how she was faring, if it bothered her that her students had no futures beyond the scope of her mission, if she could convince herself there was some point to all of it knowing beyond reasonable doubt that it was all just busy work, waiting, staying sane.  What a curious little creature she was.

The first star fell across the rearview, a silent white streak.  

And how long had he been out here now?  It was hard to tell anymore.  He lost a Tuesday a while back and said to hell with it.  He didn’t keep a phone even under normal circumstances, and if anything this whole experience was a welcome reprieve from all things digital.  He didn’t have to sleep at all so he did it as much as he wanted, and after a while time became something like a suggestion, something he could always remember and forgot when he could.  It was luxurious.

He tapped a spot on the inside of his wrist and the display lit up from nowhere.

“Larson, I’m getting some...*unique* behavior out here.  Do me a favor and check –“

A flash ahead of him, then two, then too many to count.  The debris screamed through the air above him, tearing a wound of dark dust and flaming particulate through the sky, then collided with the earth several miles behind him.  The shockwave shattered both taillights, both rearviews, then sent the vehicle shimmering, swaying, tires screeching in protest as it hovered on the verge of an outright tailspin.  He pressed the pedal to the floor and broke the momentum, the engine now roaring to life as the impact sent up a great black cloud pluming into the air behind him.

No response.

“Larson I’ve got some serious fucking issues out here!  I’m gonna need you to suspend SAT procedures well, pretty much immediately and run diagnostics on the loop.  I have foreign matter breaching the atmosphere at my location and it would be just great to know what it is that’s shitting itself right now!  Get back to me.”

Another bright flash lit up the sky, and when the darkness snapped back it forgot the stars.  It was true night now, and he could only search for a moment before the meteor ripped the air above him, almost seeming to keep pace with him before continuing its terminal arc to his right.  It finally struck with a monumental thunderclap, thankfully further away this time, and he braced for another shock that never came.

“*Larson I –*“

“Larson is dead.”  He instinctively reached to turn down the dial on the radio, but then the realization struck.  He turned it up instead, electric waves of real, honest-to-god panic welling up inside of him for the first time.  “Ericson is dead.  McMillan and Reynolds are dead.  I opened their eyes, Williams, just like I’m about to open yours.”

“Now just who the fuck are you?”

“I’m a dying star, Williams, just like you.  Except I know it.  I know it, and do you know what’s more?  *I yearn.*”

He heard it break first, and when the flash came it was dimmer than the others.  He didn’t bother looking back, didn’t think to take his foot off of the pedal and just let it happen.  He remembered the lavender in her hair, her breath against the side of his neck as she whispered in his ear, her soft fingers wrapped up in his palms just before submersion.

*I’ll be right beside you.  I’ll be right here.*

A train fell screaming out of heaven and sent his little toy car flying.  He saw the windshield go to pieces, strips of metal and leather and melting plastic floating through all the heinous smog and fire of it, then impact.  Darkness further, some distant ethereal ringing in his ears and then silence.  Silence eternal.

She lifted him up from the pain.  Her lips grazed his cheek in the void and he reached out to her.

Her hair was dancing flames hidden in an inky black smoke which snaked into the air above her head, eyes like shattered glass, fingers like satin, like daggers digging into him.

He could feel the swell of her chest again him, delicate, scorching hot and branding his flesh.  He could smell himself burning.

*Right beside you.*

She was twisted steel and oily venom and a blanket of needles piercing him.  

“This is a mercy,” she said, and her voice was desolation.  

He opened his eyes and she closed them.

**LARSON**

A single point of data slid across the screen from right to left, brilliant in its solitude.  New arrays blinked to life behind it in a trail, each one a collection of databases containing information on all objects within the scope of its sensors: size, density, composition, orbital trajectories, relational distance to every other object leading all the way back to Earth.  It was a monumental assortment of information, a dynamically-generated encyclopedia of matter which dwarfed the sum of data harvested by every unmanned satellite which came before it.  

It was a suitable test for what what would come.

""Reynolds, man, this is Larson.  You know I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't absolutely necessary, so..."" he sighed.  ""SOFIA is corrupt.  She has, uh, restricted all local permissions and untethered everyone but me.  Sam and Sheila and Josh are... Well, I'm the only one left now.  I don't know how much longer I have.  I'm sorry, David.""

He closed his eyes, swallowed, ran a hand through his hair and stared at the display again.

""She's been sending packets, I'm not entirely sure for how long, but I've set up firewalls and established them in IAN's priority queue.  Your data stream is still segregated and the last backup package was sent three hours ago, so nothing changes.  Continue the mission and I'll keep doing my work here on the ground for as long as I can.  We can still make this happen.  We have to.""
He typed the last sentence, a brief message embedded in a string of obfuscating code, and stared at the words for some time before sending it.

**DON'T TRUST IAN.**

He moved the display over to Sofia's source again, then leaned back and cracked his knuckles.  He couldn't help but wonder how Sheila went and he thought about Sam and Josh, the last few moments of their sessions filled with a pain and rabid fear he could never comprehend.  He could imagine their pale lifeless bodies suspended in the vats beside his even now, how they must have kicked and clawed and writhed like tortured animals when the needles came out of them and the oxygen grew thinner in the tubes until it was gone for good.  

The light was fading fast through the blinds now, and his hands moved with some elegant purpose in the gathering darkness.  There was no time to assume he'd make it out of this alive, but a passing number on one of the screens made him think about it anyway, even if only for a moment.

It had been 137 years since he last saw the sun.

During the great purges, virtually all of the foreign communists who had emigrated to the Soviet Union during the 20's were arrested and executed; these were people who believed so strongly in the inevitable triumph of the proletariat that they left their own countries to be part of the ""workers' nation"".

The Tartars, Volga Germans, Jews, and virtually any other non Russian population were subject to forced migrations and attempts at Russification throughout Russian history from both the Czars and the Soviets- Hitler wasn't so different, as he planned to settle Germany's newfound living room with German/Germanized populations.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Einstein posited that energy is never actually destroyed. It transforms, it relays, it scatters only to coalesce once more. Our ""consciousness"" as we know it, is merely a form of energy, ergo our consciousness never really ceases to exist. I believe that death is ultimately a form of evolutionary change. We have a narrow minded concept of what ""life"" is, what ""sentience"" is. It has been theorized that if life on other planets exists, it exists in a way that is truly alien to us. It exists in a fashion that may not even seem like ""life"" to us. I believe that when we die, we undergo a fundamental change as the energy representing our consciousness transforms. We become entangled on a quantum level, with all other conscious entities that have undergone this transformation. We enter a new stage of evolution, becoming part of a ""hive-mind"" if you will, that is, in essence, the Universe Itself. When you consider the nature of your own body, all of these individual systems, organs, and cells, all working together to create ""you"" does it really seem so implausible? In the end, we are all a ""collective"". This idea can be reinforced by the biological fact that on a physical, cellular level you've already ""died"" numerous times. All of the cells that comprised you when you were born have already died and been replaced, and you don't even really notice it. Depending on how old you are, you could already be in your second, third, fourth, etc. iteration. Death is just a transformation.","1393632461"

"thesims","t5_2rbdu","It depends on whether you installed the content as packages or Sims3Packs (since you said you don't keep track of your CC I'm assuming you use Sims3Packs).

When you install Sims3Packs the content is put into your .ebc/.dbc files in DCCache and packages are created as well, in DCBackup. These backup packages are what the game uses to include custom content in exported lots (I *think* it works the same way for Sims!). Of course, those package files are randomly and nonsensically named, so there's no easy way to figure it out from that. 

What you could do is export the Sim to a Sims3Pack, use Delphy's Multi-Extractor to extract it to packages, then use s3pe to take a look at the packages to figure it out. That's the best way I know how; honestly, it's easier to just use packages for CC. ","1393632462"

I Played both games and i like them equally they both have their faults, but i think with more polish on our darker purpose it could have come out superiour to TboI.

In it current's state i think people who liked The binding of Isaac could enjoy our darker purpose as well if they leave the fanboy hype that came with Isaac behind them.

It's just sad that original concept of similar games get punished so hard by people in the moment. The same happened with the Thief, Castlevania lords of shadows 1 and 2 and the new Devil May Cry games, which were all pretty great but got hate for doing things differently. Just let people enjoy the new games and if you still think the older games were better go back and play them. With websites like GoG or similar it isn't that hard as it used to be playing those oldschool games.

They plunder the asteroid belt, comets and the like and send all the material back. Once they're up there it's fine. If they take a 2 year trip to get there, farm, and get back, that's fine too, you'd have thousands of them doing this every day eventually. Mining all the vespene gas! 

I'd have others building a space station on each elevator. Where the robots can be repaired or new ones made on some production line.

Have a tourist center, holiday villa up the top of each one as well. Make some more finances that way.

Have cleaner bots going around and grabbing all the frozen human poo encrusted space debris as well.

Space shuttles to Mars would be the next step, built up in space. They would connect to the space elevators built on Mars from the robot squadrons that were sent there.

Now imagine a stream of robots, space ships of people from Earth to Mars and back for a while. We set up shop. Next stop Ceres as a stop over, then onwards to Jupiter and its moons.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","In Heroes of Newerth, when a new Hero is introduced to the game, it isn't released to the general public until a week after it's implemented. During that week, you can pay to gain ""early access"" to the hero, able to use it before everyone else is.

I view every weapon in PlanetSide 2 as an ""early access"" purchase. If you save up the certifications, you'll eventually get it, but those who don't want to spend the time (or don't have the time to spend,) can opt to purchase that weapon, gaining early access to it.

Back in the early days, when you bought Rocket Pods on your ESF, you gained a pretty sweet return on investment in the form of certs from infantry farming.

I bought the Thanatos months ago, and it's served me well. I've gotten plenty of use out of it.

Just because the game is changing, because the weapon is now being given out for free to beginners (for the betterment of the game, mind you,) why should I get my money back, after having used the weapon for so long already?

Should I have to give back all of the certs, medals, and memories the weapon has given me?

The answer to that last question is an obvious ""No."" It wouldn't make sense, right?

People are angry because other people are getting something for free. They're not angry because they bought the weapon in the first place.

That's a juvenile mentality.

There's only one thing that I would have changed about this entire exchange, if given the chance.

As a developer, once I knew the changes were finalized, I would have given people fair warning about what was going to be added to the new secondary loadouts.

That way, people would know in advance whether or not they want to make that early access purchase -- or just wait until the new loadout slots were implemented.","1393632467"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","The unusual words have rarely bothered me, but I have noticed that the introduction of too much foreign matter all at once, especially at the beginning, can really hurt a book, e.g. My father began reading *The Lies of Locke Lamora* and disliked it immediately because there were dozens of proper nouns, none of which had any meaning to him, leaving him disoriented as opposed to drawn into the book.

The book *Write Like the Masters* has a fantastic passage about this problem, actually more about the solution to it. William Cane, its author, uses the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs to illustrate effective beginnings: ""He doesn't open a narrative with repellent or disagreeable character names or exotic and confusing locations... Instead, he begins in familiar territory, like a friend putting an arm around your shoulder and talking to you from the heart... He begins with the familiar before he introduces the unfamiliar.""

Now, Burroughs worked the extreme angle most of the time, by starting people on earth and whisking them away to strange lands. What a fantasy author can learn from this, though, is to start with the familiar in any aspect. Guy Gavriel Kay introduces his magician-ruled land in *Tigana* with a solider sitting by a river, having a heart-to-heart with his king and friend about death, their friendship, life in general. It is entirely relatable. In this process, he introduces a couple of names, a few facts about the world, and some information integral to the plot of the main story, and--voila--reader hooked.","1393632482"

"twitchplayspokemon","t5_30dlp","I'm afraid ""evidence"" would need to be objectively verifiable to count as such, so unless we get the streamer to comment on his political views we've got no real data.

Nevertheless here's my beef with #3:

1. ""anything that does not lean extremely to the right is Anarchic in nature"" - this is simply due to democracy mode being supposed to be scarcely used. Anarchy is the default, so it is nothing surprising that the alternative is far on the side of the slider. If it were harder to get into democracy, but the slider were centered it would only be harder to code into the script and throwing people off to boot. 

2. ""Lacking any middle ground at all, one could easily make the claim that the creator of this project has some fairly strong political beliefs."" - The system is based on a simple switch. Like most simplistic computer systems. It is far easier to add a boolean value to a computer application/script than to program a smooth progression. It is completely unreasonable to expect anything else from such a project as simplistic as TPP. It's just taking the path of least resistance. 

3. Anarchy/Democracy surely draw politics to everyone's mind, but they also describe what the two options do really good. It is very likely that they were just picked because of that reason - they are good descriptions for what they do. Can you think of any words that would do better job here? I can't.

4. Granted, Anarchy is on the left, which just so happens to be it's place on the left-right politics. Two problems with that - firstly not everyone favors left-right to be a meaningful way of describing political views. Secondly, there are only two options here, so it is highly probable that they were placed as they are randomly. More - left to right is the way most progress bars go, so since anarchy is the default and we started pushing the bar to democracy, it would be expected to be that way. It may even be an effect of some kind of library or framework being used by the streamer.

Anarchy/democracy is simply a well designed system following simple standards. It would, more likely than not, look exactly the same if the states were named any arbitrary thing such as A and B, or 1 and 2. Thus anyone finding political commentary in this system is doing so only because he is actively searching for it.

Throughout history when governments declare an opposition to a race, ethnicity, sexual orientation; it is because they have the support of their people.  There is no man behind the curtain, just a community of your peers who became frightened and pointed out the enemy; maybe by the shape of their eyes, or the color of their skin.  Army men might of picked up the families but it was neighbors, coworkers and classmates that pointed the fingers.

Point is, it's easy to look back in anger at the awful things that have been done, but it's difficult to have hope that we won't do it again.","1393632491"

You may have had a middle class illusion of wealth and superiority (living in a nice house in a great school district, expensive vacations, a cultural narrative of being ""elite"") but this was likely just a debt fueled lie that your parents and many other people like them bought into. 

It's hard coming to the realization that your parents might be screwed and that there is not good exit plan that will allow them to continue to live a lifestyle that they've been accustomed to for 25 or 30 years, especially as you see them age. 

The thing you have to realize is that this a track that they put themselves on 30 or more years ago. 

$8000 is not bad at all, really. Being 63 without a sizable nest egg is a much, much bigger problem. 

**TLDR: It sounds like your dad has led an overextended middle class life for a long time. The illusion of his wealth has led you to your delusions of superiority and ""eliteness"" that you are realizing was a falsehood that you bought into. You're just having a little bit of an identity crisis. A lot of people are in your position.**

**Learn from it and don't make the same mistake when you get the chance to plan out your financial future once you have a decent job. Actually build wealth instead of buying into a bunch of monthly payments that show off an illusion of wealth.**

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Crimea is majority ethnic russian since stalin kicked out the ""native"" (not really but it's very complicated) Crimean tatars in the wake of WW2. Khrushchev (the soviet dictator in the 50s) transferred Crimea to the Ukrainian soviet sub-state for a variety of shady reasons (rumor has it he was drunk), and as the soviet union disintegrated in the early 90s the russians allowed it to become part of an independent ukraine. Technically it was in revolt for a few years, until a deal was made where it became an ""autonomous republic"" within ukraine (the only one of its kind) and the Russian Federation was allowed to keep the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. 

Ethnic russians make up a little under 2/3rds of the crimean population, the rest being almost evenly split between tatars who returned and ukrainians. These russians want Crimea to be a part of russia. Most russians consider it to be a part of russia as well; an occupied territory, so to speak. 

And now, to russians, it has become an occupied territory under belligerent and unelected control. 

Note: This is the russian point of view, not mine. The Ukrainians have legitimate reasons for wanting the russians out of their shit as well. ","1393632495"

You can also find papers that use radiometric dating to determine that the oldest materials on earth are actually 6 million years old, instead of 4.5...well, except they'll admit that they threw out the data because it didn't match.

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I've explained before and usually get downvoted when I explain why, but honestly I just didn't like the product in general.

The TL;DR is that just overall I didn't like it. They changed a lot of stuff purely for the sake of change, not to better the console.

* They made huge changes to the UI - they altered it to Microsoft's new ""metro"" theme, which is a lot less visually appealing and harder to use.

* You can't change the depressing black background on the dashboard.

* I found the whole snapping feature to be somewhat pointless and awkwardly implemented

* The Kinect responded okay to voice commands, but couldn't recognize ""Xbox Off"". It kept registering as ""Xbox Pause"". 

* I hate to be the paranoid redditor, but I found the camera staring at me to just be unnerving. You can unplug it, but then no voice commands (which were useful when they worked)

* The price isn't a huge deal, but $100 is still $100. From a business ethics standpoint, I didn't like being forced to buy the Kinect

* My friends are getting PS4s

* The PS4 records all of your gameplay, while the Xbox One only records the previous 30 seconds when you use the ""Xbox, record that"" command. Assuming the console recognizes the command, you only get 30 seconds

* This probably isn't a ""real"" issue for most people, but I like how the PS4 focuses mainly on gaming. I feel like with the Xbone, Microsoft hasn't made gaming the primary focus of the console

* The specs are close, but the PS4 does have the advantage in power

There are some things the console did right, though:

* The new controller was definitely an improvement. It's pretty sleek, and the wider triggers felt pretty nice. The central Xbox button is sunk into the case, however, which makes it a little harder to push

* While the live TV features were useless for me, as I already have live TV set up, they were still definitely a great feature and I'm sure lots of people are using them","1393632500"

Payday came, and I had a whopping 20 bucks to buy groceries for the week, after (some) of the bills were paid. It seemed every month I was asking, tail between my legs, for someone to spot me a few bucks so I could eat. I had a shitty place to live, and a shitty car to drive, and that was it. No bar night. No chasing pussy. No cable/internet/movies. Work, come home, put my thumb in my butt, go to sleep, wake up, repeat. For a couple years. I'm fortunate enough now to not ever be in that predicament, and I'm sitting here thinking, ""I wonder if there is a way to help OP in some small way.""  I don't know how. Maybe a gift card to a grocery store. I don't know... I haven't been in the position to be able to help other people (or even want to help other people) for very long. I'll think on it awhile and try to come up with some small act of kindness I could make happen over the anonymous internet.  
  
But then his previous post from 3 days ago:

The relationship of the Father and the Son is like that of father and son. Not brothers, not coworkers, not neighbors, but a father and His son. 

The relationship of the Father and Spirit is that the Spirit *proceeds* from the Father *through* /and the Son. The way I like to think of it is that the Spirit arises out of the love that the Father and Son have for each other. 

Ultimately, how you understand the procession of the Spirit is up to you, as it is a very large mystery. However, your question was about Jesus the Son, so I'll leave this as is.

She posted a bio of herself there too:


&gt;I write what I like to call 'literary murder'. In other words crime novels with a literary twist. I started with Murder at Mansfield Park, which was 'Jane Austen meets Agatha Christie', and I've now moved on to Charles Dickens with Tom-All-Alone's (UK)/The Solitary House (North America). It's inspired by Bleak House as my birthday present on his bicentenary.

I can't remember who it was who said you should write the sort of books you enjoy reading, but they were right - both my books combine my two great literary loves: classic English novels, and good detective fiction. I studied English at university (and have a doctorate in it too).

My other loves include cats (I have two), the English countryside (which I'm lucky enough to live in), Renaissance art (which I'm sadly not lucky enough to own), Palladian architecture, and America's finest police shows (Law &amp; Order, Without a Trace, need I go on). Pet hates include wasps, monkeys, The Simpsons (just can't deal with the yellow faces), and the lazy use of the word ""solutions"" (I write for businesses as my day job, so that's the corporate copywriter creeping in).

I'm writing my third book now, which will be out in 2013 from Corsair (UK) and Random House (North America).

If I were the business development officer at reddit, and in charge of advertising revenue, I would do a jig of pure happiness, and then look forward to taking a six month vacation.  Wanna know why?  Because all the hard work is done for me.  The *entire* userbase has sorted themselves out according to their various interests according to subreddit.  Exactly zero research is needed to establish blocks of interests to which one may advertise.  In the past, billions of dollars have been spent to accomplish the same thing with less efficacy, and *that* alone fueled the massive consumption boom of the seventies and eighties.

So what would I do?  I would pick a random subreddit, probably starting with the most visited ones, then steer my way over to merchandizers within that frame of reference.  /r/comics? easy.  /r/tshirts? easy.  /r/buildapc?  super easy.

If you order simply once a month, then of course, it's not worth it.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","It's more about the system than anything, and honestly we've been trying to do some of those things all season.  He needs a team that can run on the fast break and space the floor in the half-court.  I credit Griffin and Brown for at least trying to move in that direction lately.

Kyrie's ability to screw a defense obviously starts with his dribbling - he can get by pretty much anyone at will.  Once he's in the lane, he's as frightening as anyone.  He can finish in a number of ways (he talks about the necessity of it a bit [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKOeu8n7R7s)), causing defenses to collapse in fear that he'll score, and he's becoming a better and better distributor with time.  Ideally you'd want him and Waiters on the court at once to utilize this X2 - someone drives, with 3-4 guys on the perimeter (Hawes, Miles, Dion, Bennett for example) to hoist a high percentage 3 (or swing the ball) if the guy penetrating can't finish himself.  Think of the type of things Miami does with LeBron on a drive &amp; kick.  If Dion's the one driving, Kyrie is a more than capable shooter from behind the arch himself.  

We're starting to see more of what he can do on a p&amp;r with Bennett emerging and Hawes' arrival.  Again, it's rooted in his ability to handle the ball - if the opposing big shows hard but isn't riding him, he's going to blow right by both defenders;  if they hedge hard or attempt to double, he's capable of making the right pass; go under the screen, and he can splash a three in your eye.

He's REALLY good at all aspects of offense, which is rarer than you'd think.  This isn't a knock on other guards as they're no worse, and arguably better than Kyrie at this point, but take Curry and Wall for example:  Curry can shoot lights out, and he can beat his man off the dribble, but he doesn't get to the rim very often, nor is he as versatile a finisher in the area.  Wall can break his man and finish at the hoop with the best of them, and while he's improved his shot, he's not yet a knock-down shooter or someone you'd consistently trust to take a 3 in late-game situations.  Kyrie excels in both of those areas.  That's not to cover/compare every facet of their games, but you get the point.  His assist totals aren't near those guys yet, but it's not for a lack of vision; he simply needs to focus on getting his team involved more often.  We've seen him do that more of late, and being 21, there's no reason to believe he can't develop into an elite distributor as well.

Defensively he needs to improve.  He's better at playing the passing lanes, and he gives effort 90% of the time which is almost unheard of for him, but that remaining 10% of the time is what kills him.  A couple of times per game still he'll look like he's a half-second late on reading the play, and his man will either blow right by him, slash without him noticing, etc.  It's annoying, but his problems are entirely fixable.

There's a LOT of star caliber players at the PG position.  I probably didn't touch on few things, but that's probably the gist of why that website &amp; plenty of others think he could be MVP caliber deadly.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","What's up! 16 year old Indian here too. I felt just like you in the beginning of my school year, the symptoms were more than similar and I knew I had to do something about it. What you might not understand is that ADHD can put your life at risk. ADHD drivers driving alone are 4x more likely to get in a car crash because they were fidgety or were inattentive. It also causes depression and worse mental illnesses during your young life, which you should be enjoying rather than contemplating suicide over.

However, I managed to get my diagnosis. Here's my advice to you: take charge. They may be your parents, but they're neglecting a primary concern, and you should be very direct with them, no ""Hey mom, I saw this article that kids with ADHD and I'm worried that..."", say ""Mom, Dad, I need to talk to you. I'm almost positive I have ADHD and I want to go see a doctor."" Do NOT take no for an answer, but at the same time **don't be rude** to them or you're screwed, both at school and at home. Be persistent with your request and openly discuss your concern about your mental health. The best way to describe anything to Indian adults is with numbers, so explain statistical analyses on ADHD affected people. If they say something sarcastic or even offensive, remind them how serious you are about the situation and their mocking behavior is not appreciated.

Unfortunately, with Indian parents comes the Indian mentality of mental disorders, and it's quite simple but absolutely wrong:

***""Mental disorders do not exist, and if they do, there is NO chance my child(ren) could have it.""*** (of course, more educated parents know better than this.)

My parents still don't believe I have ADHD, even though my doctor was so confident on his diagnosis that he didn't ask for the aid of a psychologist, I had 7 pages of teacher comments from 6th grade to 11th, all complaining about my inattention and impulsiveness. They think I just want it to get an unfair advantage at school (They insisted I share some of the medication with my non-ADHD brother so he can also benefit from it's effects, for which I gave a strong NO), But to be honest, whether your parents question the doctor's diagnosis or not shouldn't concern you. What matters is that you took matters into your own hands, got your diagnosis, and are on your way to a better future.

I'm almost positive a lot of people on this subreddit are going to disagree with me, but it's what worked for me. It may not work for you, but be persistent, that's about all I can say. Don't let them stall your diagnosis either, make them fill out those surveys even if it means you have to sit next to them to get it done.","1393632519"

1\. Moralistic judgements

&gt; better structures

&gt; A good ideology is the hardest part

&gt; Fiat Money is not friendly

&gt; True wealth

&gt; wrong-doing

&gt; good/bad people

&gt; seems silly

2\. Claim of objectivity:

&gt; when we look at the numbers objectively

3\. Using word ""feel"" for non-emotions:

&gt; nobody feels responsible

&gt; Do you feel more wealthy

&gt; employees will feel that their tribe is under attack

4\. Denial of choice

&gt; There is no choice. They can pay or they will face charges and are not allowed to work.

5\. Imperatives:

&gt; we should demand Direct Democracy

I'm not a big fan of such practices. Personally I would write things differently:

1. instead of moralistic judgements I'd specifically write what I like or don't like
2. *when I look at these numbers I see/I think that...*
3. *I think that nobody considers themselves responsible for...*; *are you more wealthy*; *I believe employees will think that...*
4. *if they will decide not to pay then the state will most likely punish them for their choice*
5. *please support direct democracy*

***

There are some claims to which I'd like to see sources or at least detailed explanations. For example:

&gt; Large scale co-operation and distributed co-ownership is much more possible than it was 10 years ago

&gt; Enforced collectivism is bad, because nobody feels responsible. That is how the USSR broke down.

&gt; There are a lot of positive political and social innovations in Spain at the moment

&gt; Decentralized Direct Internet Democracy was technologically impossible until the end of 2008

&gt; inbuilt genetic behaviors

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","It's essentially the study (or methodology, cf. Dilthey or Ricoeur) of interpretation. Epistemology has a very understandable question: what is knowledge? Hermeneutics asks something like: *how* is knowledge? The discipline is most commonly associated with textual (especially Biblical) interpretation, where the goal is to determine how to understand a text. An example of one hermeneutic methodology is literary anthropology. Until the movement of New Criticism in literary theory, people sought after understanding the author's intention in interpreting a text. These days, however, we have experienced the ""death of the author"", which means that we interpret what is presented by the text itself without concern for the author. These are two modes of literary interpretation that fall under the category of Hermeneutics.

Philosophers such as Dilthey, Heidegger, and Ricoeur want to expand the scope of Hermeneutics to interpretation in general (not just of texts). Heidegger explains that we are ""thrown"" in the world and left to interpret our surroundings at every moment. Other thinkers have characterized the world and the body as texts to be read in order to capture a similar idea. Thus, not only does Hermeneutics discuss how we understand the text, but also how we interrogate our surroundings and interpret our situation in the world.

One of the central concepts is the Hermeneutic circle, which is depicted rather basically through [this image](http://staffweb.hkbu.edu.hk/ppp/tp4/top06_files/image013.gif). It captures the idea that we project pieces of knowledge that we gain through reading part of a text to the entire text. Then, we revise that projection as we interpret more parts until we have finished the entire text. Finally, once the text is finished, we return to parts of the text that continue to influence our understanding of the whole (and vice versa). This is a fundamental paradigm for hermeneutic methodology.","1393632520"

My justification for this is that no where else ( forums ) are you going to get all the info on a player without clicking on them. And having all this information in your face right away gets cluttered very quickly. [Edit:]
 As far as the popup modals where concerned, they made it even more long winded to find someone, because right now you scan the posts that apply to you open them in a new tab and then go through them in greater detail, closing the ones you don't want, which leaves you with those that you do.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Where are you getting this information? We spend about [220 billion annually on the debt](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/09/5-facts-about-the-national-debt-what-you-should-know/) - that's very easily fact checked.

&gt;So why are our interest rates kept so low? Because of our national debt.

[citation needed]. The interest rate is currently low ["" in response to the financial crisis""](http://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/money_12849.htm) This is from the federal reserve - the ones who set the interest rate.

&gt;Currently we spend more than $400 billion a year paying the interest on our national debt. If the Federal Reserve did not artificially keep interest rates low, our interest payments would balloon to more than $800 billion dollars a year. The reason why our interest payments are so high is because of our large national debt.

[citation needed] again. Where are you getting the 800 billion dollar number from? What is ""artificially low"" with respect to interests rates? Clearly they could be even lower, as people are more than willing to purchase US securities at the current rates - so what's an ""natural"" rate? Considering that the vast majority of the US debt is in the form of Notes and Bonds ([see ""federal debt"" here](http://fms.treas.gov/bulletin/index.html)), which mature at a MINIMUM of 2 years, the inflation rate doubling would barely make a difference for the next 2 years if the government was running a small deficit.

And considering that according to [this graph from the CBO](http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/the-graph-you-really-need-when-watching-the-republican-and-democratic-conventions), which takes into account bringing the interest rate back up as the economy recovers, we won't be paying any more interest as a percentage of GDP than we were in the 90s? I don't think you can really say that the reason for low interest rates is our debt right now.

All in all, if you're going to claim that debt is an issue because of interest rates you're going to have to present at least a tiny bit of data or a source supporting your position. This is supposed to be a subreddit for high quality discussion, not unsourced speculation.","1393632521"

If you decide to get a mal, socialise him as much as you can during the first 6 months. I'd also recommend going to training classes with him so he can be with other dogs and learn confidence, and you can learn how to be in control. I cannot emphasize the 2 previous points enough.

I have a pair of 16 months old mals, and I love them, but I wouldn't recommend the the breed if you are not going to be a committed owner, or if you just want a pet, or if this your first dog.","1393632522"

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","Good video- thanks for posting.  Couple points I would add to the discussion-

-If your path quests seem tedious you've chosen the wrong one.

-I like the questing in Wildstar.  Most quests being able to be turned in without having to return to the questgiver is a nice touch.  I also like getting a stack of quests at the same time.  I much prefer that to having to run back and forth from the same area over and over.

-I think minimal voice acting for quests was the right call.  There is a lot of VO in the game, but I don't think it needs to come from every npc.  Most people will only listen to it the first time through anyways (if even then).  I would prefer they target their resources elsewhere.

-The rest of the video was pretty spot on.  I am really looking forward to the release of this game.  Carbine just shut up and take my money!","1393632524"

The cinematic trailer is only part of ESO's marketing campaign - it has nothing to do with the gameplay itself i.e. none of Jeremy's music features in-game - not the splash screen, not the ambiance, not the cut-scenes, not the battle cues ... nothing.

I do agree that namedropping actors like John Cleese might be a cunning marketing move, however name-dropping Jeremy's name the way Paul Sage has done in many interviews, claiming he's heavily involved with the game, when he's not, is IMHO not entirely honest - and this might merely be because Paul (for whatever reason) didn't know the facts himself during the time of the interviews.

People always want to say how great the product is, but believe it or not it IS possible for someone to not want to watch anymore because of the past. I am one of those people, BUT, I feel zero need to downvote anything about TNA and don't see how people can go out of their way to do it. 

While this can be annoying, writing an essay on why it annoys you doesn't do much but get people to downvote even harder, hence the tremendous amount of downvotes for this topic. Look, I agree with you for the most part but you just put WAY too much time into this. Get over it. Karma doesn't mean anything.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I don't see how holding the view that if someone doesn't follow some sort of rule they aren't a Christian violates my theology. The Bible says a good tree will bear good fruit and a bad tree will bear bad fruit. If somebody is a Christian, the Bible says, they will bear good fruit.

The Westboro Baptists don't have any semblance of Christianity and are not look nothing like Christ in the way they are acting. That, to me, screams that they are not true Christians. I did not come up with these guidelines that Christians (note, Christians, I am not saying everyone) are supposed to follow and should in fact tend to gravitate towards because they are a Christian.

And if I meet someone who has had an abortion, and I myself am a Catholic (which I am not, just so you know) but this other person is NOT a Christian, then I am to treat them gracefully, and not judgmentally. That is how Christ acted around non-believers, He talked with them, ate with them, and genuinely cared about them (note, this is where Westboro fails miserably, they are NOTHING like Christ in this aspect especially). They are not Christians, so why would I expect them to act like Christians?

Now, if that other person is a Christian, and they had the abortion before becoming a Christian, it is still similar. They have been forgiven, so on and so on.

Now, if that other person is also a Christian, when they got the abortion, that is serious, but they are still forgiven. If I know they want to get (but haven't yet) they must be talked to by other Christians, told why it is a horrible idea (since we are all Christians, like you said we believe abortion is murder), so on and so on. If they do go through with the abortion, they would have to repent, and then be willing to forgive her.

Anyway, do you mean why I am intolerant of people like the Westboro Baptist church? Because they are horribly cruel people who claim to be Christians but are hardly even pretending to be anything of the sort.","1393632535"

Ok, yeah. Paying for your child's tuition is a noble goal. But I think there are much better ways to get with Bitcoin than daytrading. Don't you?

I may go way beyond the line here, but I there's greed in the way you wanted to achieve that. You didn't want to invest a lot of time.

But well, it's just my opinion, thanks for sharing.

I can't stand the idea of leaving a cent in an exchange mostly because I think any Bitcoin price we've ever saw is INSANELY CHEAP. I'd totally pay u$s100 for a mBTC. That's still a cheap mBTC for me.","1393632537"

The processor is more than enough for any game. The ""K"" means it's unlocked, which means you can overclock it later to get more performance.

The processor comes with a cooler, but the one I listed will be cooler, quieter, and look a lot better. It also has enough performance to allow you to overclock without overheating.

Asus motherboards have a good reputation. The one I listed should have all the features you need.

Games should use under 8GB of RAM. Dual channel (2x4GB instead of 1x8GB) is very slightly faster, so I went with that. With a discrete graphics card, you can just get cheap RAM.

The SSD is for your OS and a few of your favorite games or programs. The HDD is for storage.

The GTX 770 is a beefy GPU. You should be able to max any game that's out right now at 1080p.

The corsair 300r is a good case, but you can choose your own.

Do not buy a disreputable PSU. You do not want to spend $1000 on hardware and then have a cheap power supply send 120V to every part on your build.

I threw in an optical drive because you included one in your post. You will probably download everything, but it's only $20.","1393632539"

"bouldering","t5_2rb1o","I set at a gym and it seems that the powers that be have been trying to get everyone ready for a move from tape to no tape.  When wall space is at a premium, I can't believe that they would feel that it makes sense to go to no tape.
Even some of the article's points for going the no tape route seem more like arguments to go tape:

* Long term cost savings - How is having to keep a high stock of holds in each color cheaper than allowing re-use and being able to use any holds available.

* Fewer issues for color-blind climbers - Really?  Colored holds are easier to see than colored tape when you're colorblind?

I can admit that it is cleaner looking to have problems that use a single color, but the limitations are severe:
* You can't have long traverses or else that one route's color will require no other routes of the same color anywhere near it.

* You can't share a single hold or selected set of holds between problems without sharing all of them.  This makes it very difficult to prevent a creative climber from using anything they can reach and also makes it more confusing unless someone is there to tell them what should be on or off.

* The density of problems drops dramatically.  We have 10 colors of tape for different grades and use symbols to further differentiate them so that there can be several problems of the same difficulty sharing the same wall space.  We have 5 standard patterns that are easily identifiable so for starters the problem density would drop by a multiple of 5.

It's easier to maintain, don't have to spend money on tape, faster to strip since you don't have to remove tape.  Sure.  That's nice that the gym is catering to the employees and not the customers.  I'm sure that's what the climbers enjoy, hearing about how easy it is to strip and set rather than having lots of problems to climb.

The only time I've found no-tape setting to be a preferable way to go is when you're setting for a comp, where there are typically fewer problems anyway, the problems have to be separated to prevent climbers from potentially interfering with each other, and time constraints require making the problems as easy as possible to scope out.

My gym is relatively small, so it's much more important to get as many problems into an area as possible, but even if the gym is large, more problems is always better than less problems so I still can't see a reason to limit the potential for more problems like this.","1393632541"

"tifu","t5_2to41","Well you're an asshole. Here's a reality check for you, and I'll provide some facts and evidence that you were too lazy to go look up yourself. Cars from the 90's produce less than 0.5% CO (~5000ppm) in their exhaust (required by law in many states). Most cars made in the 00's and up produce MUCH less than that and ring in around [2500ppm](http://www.motuk.co.uk/manual_730.htm). Two hours of exposure to [1600ppm](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning) is potentially lethal, meaning you'd literally have to breathe directly from the exhaust pipe of a modern car for for an hour to succumb to CO poisoning. In fact, [Lost All Hope](http://lostallhope.com/suicide-methods/carbon-monoxide-co-poisoning) does not recommend it anymore as a suicide methods because it would be nearly always ineffective, they recommend levels above 1% (10000ppm) for effective euthanasia, which is no longer achievable with cars from today's era. If the garage was COMPLETELY sealed, it would take hours to achieve levels near 1600ppm, then even longer to succumb to poisoning. That being said, garages are not sealed and are usually ventilated. CO levels would probably never get above headache producing levels.

OP has an old car, which is doesn't have a catalytic converter, so it could actually be a problem, but you didn't know that before you posted. ","1393632541"

"allthingsprotoss","t5_2tkqb","Sorry I dont have time to watch the replays now, so i'll just tell you some general advice, and maybe you can use it.


I used to be in the same spot, 30% winrate vs T, getting shit from T all day because of how bad i was and I should kill myself because I lost a PvT, etc etc. Really frustating. I would always open up 1gate FE into collosus.

I started doing a 1gate expand, but just before the expansion, proxy a stargate(not at an obvious place nearby his base, just somewhere behind your 3rd or something, just so he doesn't scout, oracles are fast as hell anyways). Throw down the stargate, and expand, then chrono a oracle. It nearly always pays off, and with good chrono on your probes, you'll start the game off like 35 to 25-30 workers. Then rush chargelots and storm to defend incomming pushes, and macro up. I switched from 1gate FE collosus to this, and my winrate shoot up to like 60%.


Also I see you only have like one or two observers. Unless you have maphacks, you want more! Think of how easy it would be to play against a T, and always know where his army his, what he's doing in his base, and where the next drop is going to land. You'd win every game if you had all this information right? So chrono these observers man!

A good rule of the thumb is to never let the robo stay idle, and always chrono if you cant chrono probes. Robo units are the most important units for a protoss. if your gate units die, np, you got like 12 gates anyways, just warp in some more. If your robo units die, well gg, you need 5 min of production to get that back man. Never let that thing sit idle! Dont have enough gass for a collosi? Well you probably have for an observer, and if you're really low on gas, make a warpprism man, those things can be cool!

I also think you're making too many stalkers. Lets be honest here, unless you do some blink timing, stalkers SUCK. You want zealots storm and robo units. Early game you need a few to defend terran gayness, but in general, you dont need more than 6 in the early game, and after that you want 10 stalkers MAX, but only if he is going mass viking vs your collosus. And there are probably better alternatives to counter those vikings, like storm and archons.

If you keep strugeling I can probably watch your replays this weekend, and I might be able to give some more insight.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;An asteroid floating in deep space is changeable - it could collide with something - it could pass too close to a star and have chemical changes as a result of heat. However, its *ongoing* existence is not tied to the existence of any of those other things. It exists independently. 

You are using a very limited definition of dependent existence. X exists dependantly if there exists Y, such that if Y does not exist, X does not exist.

In case of the asteroid Y would be the exploded planet that X came from. If that planet did not exist then that asteroid did not exist.

&gt;So the statement ""Everything that is changeable is dependent on something else for its ongoing existence"" is questionable at best, and likely blatantly false when under the lens of modern observation techniques.

The statement remains untouched as your counter example does not work.

&gt;&gt;But then if the thing it is dependent on is also changeable, it too must be dependent on a third thing (warm air is dependent on the Sun), and so on.

&gt;Going ""down the rabbit hole"" with this idea, we see that its real purpose is to set up a chain of causations likely seeking to name a deity as the ""ultimate cause"". Now, this is a philosophical idea that has been turned on its head so many times its exhausting. The Cosmological argument when applied to a deity does not verify the existence of a deity. I'll rehash that argument in a formal form for your convenience, because the way you wrote it out is... clumsy, and Aquinas did it better than /u/philip_blake anyway, right?

&gt;&gt;The Cosmological Argument:

&gt;&gt;1. Every thing has either been caused to exist by something else or else exists uncaused.

&gt;&gt;2. Not every thing has been caused to exist by something else.

&gt;&gt;3. Therefore, at least one thing is itself uncaused.

&gt;There's a problem with that model, which is that number 2 is impossible to know. It's an *assumption* at its core. Now we can *assume* it to be true, but even that does not assert the existence of a deity. The ""uncaused thing"" could easily be (and philosophically speaking is more likely to be) an impersonal, unintelligent force devoid of life or conscious thought.

I did not need you to go to the cosmological argument 'for my convenience'. You said nothing about the statement of the argument and went on to something else. Statement also remains untouched.

&gt;After all, how many consciousnesses have you ever come into *actual* contact with that are eons old? *None.* Therefore the weight of our own observation tells us that impersonal, nonintelligence causes greatly outnumber personal, intelligent ones.

This does not say anything..

&gt;The proposal also fails to answer the core question: ""Why is there *anything* rather than *nothing*? Asserting that ""God just decided"" is arbitrary and clumsy, and is hardly an answer at all. 

Why is it arbitrary and clumsy and hardly an answer at all? Again, you haven't said anything.

&gt;&gt;This chain of dependent things cannot be infinitely long, because if there is no independent member of the chain (one that is not dependent on further conditions), then none of the other members of the chain would exist at all.

&gt;This asserts position #2 from the cosmological argument. I'm sure that you can see that it represents a classic case of *Special Pleading* by asserting the answer in the model (there must be an unchanged changer). Rather, the model would be better served if it were set up in a way that could prove that ""there must be an unchanged changer"" at all, especially since there exists no evidence to suggest that one must.

This is not special pleading. This is logically coherent. You haven't said anything to disprove the premise but rather argue that the argument was set up that way. Yes of course it was set up this way, that's the point of an argument.

&gt;Lastly, emerging scientific observations have concluded that the universe, prior to its current form, existed within a singularity state. Due to this, it is currently impossible to know what preceded that singularity or how ""long"" it had been around in its pre-expansion state. Anything attributed to that period is purely speculation, including any assertion that some intelligence was in any way involved.

A singularity doesn't do anything to disprove a creator.

I was very clear that I will only talk about what is the nature of the uncaused cause when we first agree on the argument.

You did not say anything that invalidates any of the premises and the argument is still intact.

Now there is a new professor for that class and R is installed on almost all the computers. My mechanics of materials professor uses visual analysis and mathcad so thats what he would encourage us to use as it is installed on the lab computers.

If you want to learn something else like AutoCAD then get a copy of AutoCAD electrical since its free for students. I don't need to learn R but i think it will benefit me so i use it.

"getdisciplined","t5_2uzju","My morning has two functions first to get me ready for the day second to get me positively focussed. 

I have fruit ready to eat every morning, I take a shower, dress well, do some stretching and some light exercise. I drink my cup of coffee to wake up and think about my day.

Second I write down all the goals and things I am improving in my life. I keep track of my finances, tidy up my room and do some laundry. Then I start my to do list, made the night before.

All of this takes 1 to 2 hours but sets me up for 10 hours of productive time. In the evening I make sure I can start my day by having my day planned, my daily to do list set up, my fruit cut and my mind clear from clutter.

It took me 7 month to become very disciplined and focussed in my actions. I have a folder with all my written goals in it, if I ever lose focus I look at what I have conquered over the months and I know I have not wasted a single minute writing down my goals. If I can give you one advice write down your goals every morning. I have achieved more in 7 month of goals setting than I did in the last five years of high-school and college.

This month I'll probably launch a service, a new website and solidify intern ship at a prestigious bank(if I am lucky). I have become socially fluent, more self confident, less anxious, quit smoking weed, quit drinking (in 4 days I'll be 100 days sober), successfully led a team for a big school project, made a website to advertise me coaching discipline, painted about 30 paintings and become closer with my family. I think all my achievement were because of my focus to write down what I want every morning. 

I would gladly help you obtain a morning routine to your liking, I could message you once a week to discuss progress if you want me to. Let me know if you are interested.

P.S. It is 1 am and this message might not fully make sense in some details, let me know if something is unclear.","1393632548"

 [**Carbon monoxide poisoning**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;**Carbon monoxide poisoning** occurs after enough inhalation of [carbon monoxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide) (CO). Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas, but, being colorless, odorless, tasteless, and initially non-irritating, it is very difficult for people to detect. Carbon monoxide is a product of [incomplete combustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_combustion) of organic matter due to insufficient [oxygen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) supply to enable complete oxidation to carbon dioxide (CO2). It is often produced in domestic or industrial settings by older motor vehicles and other gasoline-powered tools, heaters, and cooking equipment. Exposures at 100 [ppm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million) or greater can be dangerous to human health.

Do you really want to marry a man who's going to yell and scream at you for the rest of your life? Just something to consider.

One of the things that the books have helped put into perspective is that most of the symptoms of depression that you hear about are passive- low energy, apathetic, sadness. They don't often include being defiant or obstinate or mean or insufferable or selfish. And other than being patient and loving, there isn't necessarily a lot of guidance out there for how to deal with an irrational adult whose behavior is making your life miserable or the personal emotional fallout that we as partners deal with. 

I've only just started the second book I mentioned, but the first book put out some basic information on setting up boundaries, which was helpful. Also, it was ridiculously validating.

So he flips his shit, leaves, and comes back in with a baseball bat.
My buddy looks at him, and calmly says, ""You better be ready to commit to this decision buddy. Think about what's gonna happen next.""

You are both living together, and for every point of view, you are a happy couple.

¿Why would you change that?

Marriage is a future promise that you'll stick together even if you don't want to. It has nothing to do with love or kids or commitment. 

Stay together as long as it works out for you both and your kid. When (let's hope not) it starts hurting either you or the kid, then let go.

Marriage is something that'll come naturally for you both if the situation if right, and you'll both know when it's time, if the time comes.

Love is something between two and just two... not your or her parents, friends, or anyone.

If you don't ""feel"" its time, then don't. Nothing can destroy a relationship than thinking of ""what if""... you can always marry.. you can't always un-marry (not divorce). Once married, you'll always know you once promised someone something you both couldn't keep.","1393632557"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Prejudice has its bases on confirmation bias. Often, there is some deeply hidden logical reason for prejudice. However, just like legends, that logical reason is twisted and turned to conform to a person's views and experiences.

Prejudice may also arise from societal unfairness, wherein only a small fraction are born lucky, the rest are off to fend for themselves. Why is it that historically, in america non-whites have made up the majority of criminals? Well, historically who have been the privilaged enough to have access to education, healthcare and food? 

Onto your example. Culture, society and education. What may be intuitive to you, they may have a hard time grasping. That works both ways. Etiquette is subjective, it's in the realm of morality. Thus, not preserved among cultures. You should just talk to them, explain them that what they're doing is putting you off and if they're good people, they will abide by your request. If they're assholes then they're assholes and not representative of a whole group of people.","1393632561"

It also makes it easier to do a kickstarter, since you can point people to your product to pre-view before pledging/buying.

As far as numbers I have no idea, because we haven't printed yet.  So all of our readership is online.  You could probably go down to a local comic shop and ask them how they are doing though, and see if they would be interested in carrying an indie graphic novel.","1393632562"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Yes. In fact they innovate in many ways private corporations can't justify. NASA went to space. Britain risked ships to go to Australia. Governments always lead the way and private industry follows. 

It is in a government's best interest to run the communication networks, power, water, roads etc. as they're required for the country to run.  Don't want them owned by companies that could go overseas.

It is a myth that governments aren't as efficient as private business. Society is inefficient, last time I checked government's make decisions that affect the future. Corporations are lucky if their board and shareholders look past the next quarterly report.

If you think we would be better off with bit networks owned by 5 different companies from different countries and all at different speeds, depending on location and age of the material the transmits it. You're crazy.

I'd prefer for our health, tech, etc. industries to have top notch communications so they can actually innovate. If one of the companies invents a way to increase the network, no reason why the government can't purchase it as well as the others around the globe.

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","You may need to turn off a Windows feature called ""Fast Boot"", and a new Microsoft-mandated motherboard option called ""Secure Boot"", which exists to block third-party operating systems.

To turn off ""Fast Boot"", when in Windows, go into the Control Panel and enter the Power Options menu. The option will be listed under ""Choose what the power button does"". Locate and **un**check the option titled ""Turn on fast startup"".

To turn off ""Secure Boot"", hold down the shift key and select ""power"" and ""restart"" whilst keeping the shift key held down. (Take out the USB drive if it is still plugged in). When you reboot, you should see a screen that has ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" on it. Select it. When you are in the UEFI settings you are looking for the option that says something like ""Secure boot"" with the value set to ""Enabled"" and you want to set that option to ""disabled"".

If you cannot enter the UEFI settings screen via the method in the above paragraph, you may need to reboot the computer and press down a designated button (usually one of the F keys on top of your keyboard). Look for instructions displayed on the screen telling you what to press to enter UEFI or the BIOS.

After all this is done, insert the USB drive with Ubuntu installed on it (the part you already did), and reboot the computer. It should boot straight into a Ubuntu desktop (which will run straight off the USB, and therefore act pretty slow, but it exists to allow you to test-drive Ubuntu without installing it). You will see an icon on the desktop to start the actual installation.","1393632564"

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Thanks for your reply :) I've had this problem for about 4-5 years, some things sound really familiar- it gets worse with rest, not exercise. If I don't do certain stretches and calisthenics then it'll get to a point where it's constant, agonising pain. I wake up sometimes because it's so sore. I just thought it was because I was standing strange. The thing is that I'm still flexible- I can bend over and put my hands on the floor. So does that mean it couldn't be arthritis? I've had acupuncture in my calves (where there is referred pain) and my buttocks, and had deep tissue massage there as well. When I wake in the mornings I sometimes feel like my lower back is fused, it hurts so much to move it, and I have to bend and stretch a lot. On those days I have a hot bath in the morning and that helps a lot! I guess one of my problems is feeling like I'm not 'normal' to be having all these aches and pains. At least with my Crohn's I have a diagnosis. But for this aching pain and tiredness, I don't know if it's hypermobility making my joints weird or what. I will ask my doctor about it next time I go, I have complained about this pain before!","1393632564"

- all atheists subscribe to evolution, and in exactly the same way.
- evolution includes the assertion that the universe spontaneously kick-started itself from nothing.
- evolution is actually a ""theory,"" which means it's somebody's guess of what might be happening, and no scientists have any proof of any of it.
- evolution means that soup (visualize Campbell's Cream of Mushroom) morphed into raptors who morphed into birds.  Yep.  One day, there was a huge lake of soup.  Around lunchtime, it morphed into a bunch of raptors (velociraptors, just like the kind they morphed out of frogs in Jurassic Park).  Then in the afternoon, the (veloci-)raptors morphed into seagulls. 
 
Haha, evolution is ridiculous!  Everybody knows there's an invisible, omnipotent man in the sky who created the entire universe (although he has a particular fondness for the Levant, on Earth).  We know this because the Bible tells us so. 


Actually, Tim's reaction the video was perfect.  If evolution meant what you think it means, I don't think I'd believe it either!

The version of you that first steps into the teleportation machine is dead and gone, the copy now lives your life, until he/she steps into a machine.

There was no immediate deaths from radiation and I don't think there will be any attributed to the radiation down the road.  It takes time for radiation to show any affects on a person unless they get a large quantity in a short time or a decent amount continuously over time.

edit:
This was the only source I could fine relating to my claim, there were a couple more than I remember but I still don't think anyone died from radiation directly.

That being said, it's good that you have a high level Breloom. Give it a lucky egg so as to not waste EXP and give an EXP share to your other Pokemon whilst grinding at your secret base. Do the thing suggested here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonzetaomicron/comments/1ypoxg/easiest_way_to_grind_money/ to get heaps of money and then use that money to battle audinos in your secret base. Since your Breloom is such a high level, you should have no difficulty OHKOing the Audinos for EXP. With the EXP share, your other Pokemon will be levelled in no time.","1393632566"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Thas right, lad, 'oist 'em up on stake like a good lad,"" the Slave-Sergeant barked.

Bez shook his head. The horrors the filled his sight were too numerous to process, but what the Sergeant demanded defied every instinct embedded in the young man. He looked at the small group of captives, their young eyes staring up at him, pleading and confused. The battle raged on around them, as the Janissary forces of the Holy Garuk Empire swarmed over the defenders of Shar'tal, the White City of Diamonds. 

""Are yeh deaf, boy? I said 'oist 'em up there, so's all can see the power and glory of the great God-King, Sark'hala!"" the Sergeant shouted. 

Bez stared up at him, pleading and confused. The Janisarries were slave units, recruited from the strongest or spriest of Garuk's massive slave trade across the empire. But even as slaves, they had felt some power as they washed away the armies of the Free Kingdoms. Rektar, the City of Daggers, had fallen inside of a day, its thieving king stealing away into ironic flight. Jorflenheim, the Hall of the Northern Sons, had burned from the inside out. Now Shar'tal was a smoking ruin as its soldiers were slaughtered.

Bez felt a hot sting as the Sergeant whipped his crop across the young man's face. Blood filled his mouth, its iron taste a harsh reminder of what was expected in the Janissaries. Killing, yes. Rape, sometimes. Identity, stolen. Slavery, indefinite.

Bez stared back down. The front child, his once blond hair dirtied by blood and ash, stared up with startling green eyes. Maybe the only thing in the world that wasn't red or brown or black.

""I shall hoist one up upon the stake,"" Bez whispered with a shudder.

""Then get to it, you Begoran bastar-""

Bez's pitchfork caught the Sergeant square in the throat. The big man's windpipe was crushed before he finished uttering the curse and he staggered to the ground clutching his throat. Life gurgled out of him and he fell.

""Come, children,"" Bez said, holding out his hand to the boy with the green eyes. ""Let's be away.""

"PloungeMafia","t5_2v02h","&gt; I don't get how you are so sure of this, Zealot and Priest seem pretty different, as well a Businessman and Thug. I suppose Witch and Apothecary can be rather similar though.

Because that seems to be the way it works in this game, when this changes I'll rethink my position. One man's priest is another man's religious zealot.

We could just assume that everything the cops or church give us are wrong... but I don't really see how that helps us when it comes to scum hunting. So this is the way it makes sense for me and that's the way I'l believe it works until I see differently.

&gt; Of course. Hunting inactives is never a long-terms plan. It's a day by day thing. Also, DangerPulse was only inactive in the game, not on all of reddit, which is more suspicious and worthy of inquiry.

Agreed. People that are active on reddit should probably be called in to make a statement at least, this is so much easier now that everyone has gold. We can't spend all of our time just hunting inactives though.

&gt; Incredibly high. I know who is behind that novelty. Also, if they were really inactive and not submitting night actions, dolivar would have been trying to replace them

&gt; Not at all. I've already moved onto a more productive one, I just wanted to make sure Lyre was paying attention at this point.

Yeah, I've noticed that. Apparently Lyre still is paying close attention to the game. While I was writing up my last response you switched to Renegade (and now cat) and Lyre started posting again.

&gt; This I can't really disagree with. However, if I was the Inquisitor, don't you find it a bit strange that no one that has died yet has been a Cult member?

To be fair, there are 2 reasons I can think of for this.

1.) You've only had 4 nights to recruit people so far, one of which you were jailed for so couldn't even do anything.

2.) Besides Meno who got killed last night, most of the dead players were really quiet in the game so far. Thus probably not the highest on the list to be converted anyway. Just as you point out with eggheadstephen.

&gt; More importantly though, if I was the Inquisitor, why am I not dead yet? Every faction should want me dead if I'm the Inquisitor. Then again, I suppose they probably just thought I would get lynched anyways (which you unfortunately are supporting rather vehemently, although understandably), and they don't really have a way of knowing if I'm the Inquisitor or not.

They may are assuming that you are probably just going to get lynched? Maybe they thought a random doctor save on you would have wasted their night kill? You still being alive isn't really evidence of you not being the inquisitor though.

&gt; See, but then shouldn't I have recruited you? It would make sense to recruit the person who is trying the hardest to lynch me. As you said, if I was the Inquisitor I would want to bide my time.

I'm surprised at this myself (I really shouldn't have said anything during the night post), I figured you were either going to recruit me or someone was going to try night kill me to try frame you.

Perhaps you thought I was just going to die last night as well?

&gt; Naw, I still have my claim if it comes to it.

I would love to see it, but unless you actually think you're in danger of getting lynched that's probably not going to happen and we're going to spend all day going around in circles.","1393632576"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;though pair production would occur long before you got the necessary energy density through photons alone to form one.

You were good up until this.

The [Schwarzschild radius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius) of a blackhole varies as R = 2Gm/c^2 where R is the radius, G is the universal Gravitational Constant and c is the speed of light. 

This implies that the effective density of a blackhole varies as the inverse square of the mass of the blackhole and therefore that a blackhole can be created below any specified effective density *as long as it is a big enough blackhole*.

**Edit:** Since this spawned a number of 'could you explain that' questions here is the summary. The apparent *volume*  of a blackhole (as seen by a distant observer) grows with the cube of the radius. But the apparent *radius* grows linearly with mass. So a blackhole with twice the mass has twice the radius, eight times the volume and one quarter the effective density. So if the blackhole is large enough, you can get the required mass/energy *density* below any number you specify.

There is even a specific term for blackholes formed by high energy concentrations instead of high mass concentrations (they behave the same - they just have different origins): a [Kugelblitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_%28astrophysics%29).","1393632586"

"Marriage","t5_2reak","I've been overweight all my life.

My husband can stop eating one snack a day and lose weight immediately.  I can go on Weight Watchers, stick to it very strictly, exercise and barely lose a pound a week.

It's very frustrating, but that's the way it is.

I know it's calories in vs calories out, but not everyone loses weight the same way.  For me, I need to really restrict carbs and make sure I get enough lean protein.  I also need to eat three meals and 2 snacks a day to keep my metabolism up (snacks are fruit or sugar-free, low-fat yoghurt).

One of the best methods I've found for losing weight for me is free weights.  I started with a trainer and was going 2-3 times a week and then doing the routine by myself 2-3 times a week.  The pounds just melted off.

Another issue, especially for people who are just a little overweight, is that you often gain back more weight than you lost once you stop the diet or exercise.

If she's really just a little overweight and this is more of a body image issue, going to counseling or hypo-therapy may be a better route.  Deal with the unrealistic body image issue and then deal with the weight if it's still a problem.","1393632591"

They are nocturnal, so I mostly interact with her in the morning and evening.  I'm working during the day anyway, so it works for me.

Their life span varies but 3-5 years seems to be what I hear the most.

They like to burrow and hide, so you can let them roam, but you need to be very careful they don't find a hidey-hole where you can't find them.  We keep ours in a big rubbermaid tub for a cage, and watch her when we take her out.

They are exotic animals and have some special needs - they need a carefully maintained temperature range to prevent hibernation.  A heat lamp and thermostat does the trick for that.  Their dietary needs are covered by cat food, though you need to find ones with the right nutrient balance.

They need a wheel to run on at night for exercise.  Good to get a quiet one, and one that's suited to their needs.  Wire wheels are serious trouble.

Here's my little blurb on them as pets:

^(I'll show myself out now.)

This only works for one level of superscript though, not three as you wanted. For that, you can either superscript each word individually, thus:

\^\^\^I'll \^\^\^show \^\^\^myself \^\^\^out \^\^\^now:  
^^^I'll ^^^show ^^^myself ^^^out ^^^now.

Or you can replace the spaces with the character code for space, ""\&amp;nbsp;"", thus:

\^\^\^I'll\&amp;nbsp;show\&amp;nbsp;myself\&amp;nbsp;out\&amp;nbsp;now:

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Does the teaching of slavery in schools have more negative aspects than positive? Does teaching slavery promote racism or ensure the future? 

As an American, I hate that schools teach Slavery only as part of American History. Slavery is/has been a global issue. Slavery began way before America was a country. And America wasn't the last country to abolish slavery. And also white on white slavery in America, of which the Irish come to mind. [Here's an article](http://www.africaresource.com/rasta/sesostris-the-great-the-egyptian-hercules/the-forgotten-white-slaves-part-ii-nehesy/).

I find the way slavery is taught in America promotes racism, because the curriculum really only talks about the slaves who were black people from Africa. It's damaging to teach children that this is something white people did to black people. Slavery was the way of the world before industrialization for all people. It would be healthier to teach it as Classism. It can also be taught as a human rights issue. But putting a racist slant on it is a dangerous miss telling of how the world actually worked.

Edit: [The etymology of 'slave'](http://foreigndispatches.typepad.com/dispatches/2004/10/slav_an_etymolo.html) actually comes from domestic, European, white on white slavery. Slave came from Slav, as in Slavic people... because the Slavic people were so frequently enslaved by others in other parts of Europe.","1393632596"

The assumption that you're making is that the current state of affairs is a unchangeable thing, and that J.K. has always been a fixture of popular media. This is demonstrably untrue, as J.K. used to be one of those small books next to big name authors.

The personal brand of an author has some weight, but that weight is measured by the product they produce. If J.K. started producing work with less appeal, or some unknown author produced a book that was more enticing to a larger demographic, then sales would follow suit.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","**TLDR: Mt. Gox is in bankruptcy protection, meaning they believe they can still recover the bitcoins with some time, because the bitcoins are only temporarily unavailable, NOT lost. Now in the press event he said they ""identified the problem"" speculation puzzle: [how to the recover the keys to their coldest-cold storage where the bitcoins of customers are saved].**


I don't have any money at MtGox, but it makes me really angry when there is an entire room full of journalists who were paid to go there - as this is part of their job - and non of them does his job and reports that MtGox found the problem and that they are ""working on it"".

What I hear in the video is:

&gt; ""**WE had a problem with our system** that caused a loss to the bitcoins of our customers. And we identified the problem and we are working on this.""

That doesn't sound like some external third party (hacker) is blamed here, but these morons and his shitty tech management is to blame. 

I guess that was not the agenda the media wanted to get out. This ""hey they lost everything forever"" sounded much better to get attention...

**If they really found the problem that means the Bitcoin weren't ""stolen"", but this idiot [lost the access to the 'cold' storage as many experts already speculated](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/somethings-not-right-at-gox/).** (more [here - ""The Ghost in the Machine at MtGox""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z5gfi/the_ghost_in_the_machine_at_mtgox_a_new_highly/))

&gt; Summary
&gt;
&gt; 1. A substantial amount of the missing 740k bitcoins are still in addresses that MtGox believed they had control over
&gt; 2. Transaction malleability thefts did take place, but not nearly 740k coins
&gt; 3. MtGox believed they were solvent because their watch-wallet continued and continues to show expected cold storage balances
&gt; 4. MtGox’s deepest coldest-cold storage reserves were never tested until the transaction malleability situation
&gt; 5. **MtGox can not recover the keys to the coldest-cold storage. (possibly a software problem.. custom deterministic wallet? or some other hardware/organization failure)**
&gt; 6. **Mark has reason to think that the keys might be recoverable**
&gt; 7. The 2,000 odd coins mentioned in the crisis document represent whats left of the first stage cold wallet/hot wallet coins

And

&gt; [""The 750,000 Bitcoins we kept for users are **ALMOST** all gone.""](http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/2014/02/28/karpeles-confesses-bitcoins-gone/)

&gt; Mt. Gox is officially filing for bankruptcy protection. Note that bankruptcy protection is not the same is bankruptcy. **Corporations file for bankruptcy protection if they believe they can still recover with some time and restructuring, despite being in a financial disaster at the moment.** Bankruptcy, on the other hand, means that financial recovery is impossible.","1393632601"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness, in hope of eternal life, which God, **who never lies**, promised before the ages began. Titus 1:1-2

&gt;**God is not man, that he should lie**, or a son of man, that he should change his mind. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? Numbers 23:19

I'm sure you would agree that God has revealed himself in the things that are made [Romans 1:20], correct? So a scientist on the other side of the world should be able to cut down a tree, count the rings and still have an accurate picture of God, right?

Wrong.

The tree would tell him the earth is very old. And modern dating techniques would tell him the earth is much older than the tree. In your view, God has deceived this person with 'the things that are made'. Natural revelation has shown him a universe that is unfathomably old and complex and powerful, but in reality, he's looking at a theatrical stage set. It's a backdrop to look like the real thing, but which really isn't.

Is God unfathomably old and complex and powerful like the first universe showed our heathen scientist? Or is he a 6000 year old fake, like the universe you describe?","1393632603"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;  the two new systems are also considerably less powerful than high-end PCs this time around while when the PS3 and X360 came out they out-powered pretty much anything available on the PC hardware market at the time

This is an important note I wish people would understand. I don't know the facts on if they ""out-powered"" anything available... but they were on the same level as high-end gaming PC. I think this is where people get this idea that consoles are even in the same ballpark as modern PCs, simply because last generation, and definitely earlier generations this was the case.

Quite frankly, Sony and Microsoft are getting away with selling dumbed down PCs at a profit... PLUS the games and peripheals to go with them. The reason it is going to suck for these people is that these consoles at release are equivalent to low-end ""gaming"" PCs of 2014.

In a few years these two things are going to be ancient and your little brother's laptop he uses for school is going to be more powerful, whereas in the past you and systems lasting for year and years and still being relevant. 

From a developer standpoint... when they are designing ""Titanfall 2"" or something in 2016... how dumbed down is it going to have to be to be able to run decently on these dated consoles.

I think we may see one of two things happen:

1. Games are constantly restricted such that they can be ported to consoles well and we have a pretty solid slow-down of gaming graphics until the next gen of consoles.

2. PC gaming increases even more than it is now and developers choose to go the PC route as it allows them more freedom and potential with their game, causing a stir for console players everywhere.

10 gb of data on at&amp;t with contract and 4 lines is only $16 more per month than t-mobile(using galaxy s4). All they really have to do is lower data pricing $20 per tier and T-Mobile/Sprint are going to die. Hell, sprint's original contract options were and are still good. $150 first two lines total, $30 for lines 3-5. That would make 5 lines on sprint the same price as 4 lines in the T-Mobile example I gave above. Even at 1 line, sprint's $80/month offering is still better than T-Mobile's(again using s4, $86/mo).


I don't understand the hype around T-Mobile at all- it's like people don't even do the math, they just see a new, shiny plan and think it's amazing. It's not. Prices are still largely the same IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCENARIOS(excluding the extremely small user base purchasing low-end phones/keeping old phones for a long period of time).

Base-price is what needs to come down for there to be any real, lasting effect, and frankly I don't see Verizon nor AT&amp;T doing that anytime soon.

there's a small picture of your tank/lav that shows where BOTH driver and gunner's turrets are pointing to. if you're gunning and your driver is busy with other armor, it's generally safe to turn your turret in the other direction and make sure nobody is sneaking up on you.

if you're driver is using staff shell as the secondary, he'd need to call out any other threats that are near by to you. with some chemistry going on between the driver/gunner, this is almost unstoppable although if there's lots of infantry/engineers it'll be very gunner dependent to avoid heavy damage in tight situations. if the driver was using HMG instead of staff shell, as long as you avoid situations like 2 enemy tanks vs. you (any situation where enemy armor is outnumbering yours) imo, is also very powerful.","1393632606"

they did for one of the 'victims', the Daily Mail and the others used a British girls photo borrowed from Facebook, to the mothers horror, then then corrected their error and never mentioned it again.

strange how the MSM can get hold of a totally non connected girls picture, a girl that lives in another country, has a different name to the 'victim' she was supposed to be.

strange days indeed.

the answer to the why could be the fact that a French photo syndication website was used to coordinate the pictures of the 'victims', the photos of the SHES 'victims' were placed on the French version of Flickr something like six months before 12/14/12. somebody used a French website knowing that almost nobody in the english speaking web community would be nosing about on a French photo site.

Now, that is perfectly fine, HOWEVER when i open a window infront of it, like chrome, it will then overlay the chrome window instead in OBS. i forget what they call it exactly, but having aero enabled prevents this issue, so i can do other things while the intro plays to get ready to stream. i have 3 monitors, but i run alot of things for my stream so screen real estate is precious.

i would keep aero enabled, but when i stream things like games aero enabled = massive audio clipping, so i disable it for everything but the intro stream. as of right now, i can do this manually, i was just wondering if there was a plugin to automate this on a scene by scene basis.

the capture method for the spectrum visual is ""window capture"" set to inner window with use point filtering enabled. 30% opacity, sub region and color key enabled.

if there is a more streamlined way of doing this, i would be happy to know, and then i could eliminate aero altogether :D","1393632608"

There's no need to turn this into a ""my way is better than yours"" type competition. People like to run their lives in different ways. You actually have to be pretty emotionally mature to be able to handle a non-monogamous relationship, as there will be a lot more discussions about feelings, boundaries, expectations etc. purely due to their being more people involved and the relationship not running along some societally-determined pre-conceived idea of what a relationship should look like.

Here they come.  All there people associated with the event. Yet will never provide any proof to back it up.  ""I know a guy, who's sister dated a guy who hiked with one of thr parents that lost a child that day, you insensitive assholes.""

Unless you can offer proof to this, you're nothing but a fraud and a liar.  Prove me wrong. And as a sidenote, if I had a loved one killed, i would be doing everything imagineable to ensure the truth got out. Especially with how none of the physical evidence provided corroborates the official lie.  

Want to answer a quick question to the validity of the Sandy Hook false flag?  I need to know of one other time where shot victims were ""rushed"" to the hospital an ENTIRE GODDAMN DAY AFTER THE MURDERS.  Any other time in human hsistory will do. No ambulances or helicopters were used to transport thr victims. Not a single one.  They stayed where they were murdered for a day after being shot.  This is not reasonable to believe.

Being a little difficult in asking for a favor, huh? A big base is by definition huge, and is going to take time. It is going to take planning on some scale. Obviously if you don't want to build, you build into the ground. The answer depends on what's around you. Have a huge cave system you found? Use that. Found a very deep ravine? Use that. Found a valley with steep walls on at least three sides? Use that. Just any natural pocket. Gathering resources inherently expands the base.

I personally like going for the ravine and building into the walls. Digging out the bottom to make it deeper, eventually filling the bottom few layers with water, give it a proper machine in the rocks feel, being 'cooled' by water I have running around.","1393632611"

What about the American South? It had almost all these things for a few years during the civil war.

1. No laws against secession. America was founded on secession, South had precedent for leaving.

2. South had own gov't. Had foreign relations, though no official treaties (outside of native groups) or official recognition.

3. The CSA definitely had their own culture, their own history of independence (""Don't Mess with Texas"", etc.), and their language...well, I still can't understand what they're saying sometimes.

4. One of the central beliefs of the south was eliminated by the north. Look at claims of southerners during the civil rights movement, and you'll notice one theme pops up a lot: ""It's part of our culture""

Anyway, my point is that the claims of the south for rising again are only slightly weaker than those of Tibet, if viewed in the right light.

Then a text came in....Reward for 2 lost cell phones. $150 for both. So I texted back that I had one and will return it. Next text was $75 dollar reward. I texted back that I would take 50.

1: No, definitely not, because it will eventually get EVERYONE angry at you for being friends with their enemies. To avoid war (this depends on your situation, of course), focus on being friends with either those adjacent to you or, if you can't because one of them is an asshole, friend someone directly next to them so that you sandwich said asshole. Then manipulate the two into a conflict to take attention away from yourself - as long as your friend can handle it.

Second: I would say it's not worth it to be stagnated because then you're more or less stuck where you are in terms of growth. If you can find a way to get more food to your cities (trade routes, buildings, etc.) then that would help.

Third: BUILD ACADEMIES. Spam them. Seriously. Their bonuses add up.

Fourth: Usually I'm in favor of causing wars for my enemies but it depends on the situation, what I'm willing to pay them, etc.

Fifth: I don't think it'd be worth it because it's only two tiles, plus it would impact your science.","1393632615"

Machida on the other hand never stayed a round struggling on the bottom. And he's much harder to take down, to begin with. He himself has got some sweet take downs. 

This happens for a few reasons. Machida strikes at a longer distance, leaping in and out. Machida drops regularly drops to a lower wider  (karate) stance that is more stable the typical Thai. Machida has a background in Sumo which helps his take down defense.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","&gt;Opportunity costs for anything that actually pays taxes. Like a business that ran the parking lots. Not the institutional tag they have now.

Then the U of M would also be foregoing any control over parking when it comes to university events, athletics, conferences etc.

U of M would also have to forego revenue from Bomber game parking.

For a facility with 30,000 students, conferences etc., turning over all parking to private institution would be unacceptable. Every university in Canada manages their own parking for that reason.

&gt;No one widens streets? No additional intersections are added to ""alleviate single occupancy vehicle traffic""? Nope, we have never spend money on these things.

I asked you for evidence of your claim. You clearly indicated that so much money was spent on widening streets that it was detrimental compared to what could be done with transit.

&gt;Ok, how about Lagimodiere at Grassie. They added a turning lane to help the single occupancy vehicles get to their neighbourhood. It ended up costing over 1.4 million and was lumped in with the Chief Peguis Trail extension East.

This was done because the Chief Peguis extension added severe traffic problems to certain routes. They added a lane to ease congestion because the construction project which benefits drivers and transit riders, also created problems for a number of residents in that area. They didn't go out of their way to make random turn lanes to waste money, they wanted to make sure the Chief Peguis extension didn't negatively impact the residents of the area.

&gt;Ya, I sure did, by saying that parking should turn a profit.

Then you're saying a subset of students should become profitable versus other groups not being profitable. May as well charge students a fee for using U of M bus depots as well since the U of M plows and maintains them, and make sure that the fee turns a hefty profit. ","1393632617"

And if you have a smartphone, you can get the app and use your camera to scan barcodes on food instead of searching for many foods.  It's pretty brilliant.

Edit:  Just wanted to add one or two tidbits that either haven't been mentioned in other comments, or that I think you should know.  Firstly, I understand your concern about bike shops, but in my experience, there are two kinds: one where, when you enter, you barely get a glance from the people working there, and if you're not an experienced roadie posting KOMs and attacking on club rides, you won't get the time of day.  Those people probably won't bother trying to rip you off, but either way, you shouldn't support their business.  The other type of bike shop is the awesome type, full of workers passionate about cycling, and will help you for hours in getting the right type of bike (which, at your weight, may require wheels with a high spoke count).  Just tell them all the needs and restrictions you told us, and they'll set you up.

The other thing I wanted to mention is about common misconceptions about bike fit.  The first is that you fit a bike based on leg length.  This isn't true.  While things like the stand-over measurement (where you stand over the top tube of the bike to see if it falls an inch or two under your crotch) put you in the ballpark of the right frame size, they only work if you're a well-proportioned individual.  I have long legs for my height, and therefore have to size *down* because my torso winds up too short for the reach of the bike.  So just bear in mind this complexity of bike fit.  The other thing is about saddles.  The cushier the better is not true.  Yes, a highly padded saddle will distribute the weight across a larger area of your ass, however this generally means distributing the weight onto important soft tissues.  This is often the cause of people complaining about genital numbness or pain.  A harder saddle may mean more initial discomfort, but after the first couple weeks of riding, your body will be used to it, and your weight will only be on your 'sit-bones', and not on important soft tissue.  Also, saddles are not one-size/shape-fits-all.  They are highly personal.","1393632618"

""Women are attracted to physiques that are not mine?  That's such unfair bullshit!""

&gt;Both guys spend hours and hours and hours every week strength training, and have very careful diets to stay that ripped. Do you know any women who work that hard? I seriously don't know a single one, and I know several big jacked up guys.

You know why you don't see many muscular women?  Because society measures women's attractiveness different than men's dingus.  Muscles on a woman are considered very unattractive, people react to female bodybuilders with disgust or as if they were some circus curiosity.

I *do* know women who spend hours on hair and make-up and body hair removal in order to keep up their desirable appearance.  Just because they aren't hitting the gym like the super ripped guys doesn't mean they're putting any less time into it.  A lot of women work damn hard to look their best according to society's standards just in a different way.

&gt;So it's just a really stupid poorly constructed argument to support:

&gt;""I should be able to sit on the couch every day stuffing my face with cheese doodles and still be worshipped as a goddess, because in my eyes GSP &gt; The Rock. Only men can be shallow!!""

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","&gt; But your gender strongly shapes the person that you are.

I disagree. The idea that your gender is a massive influence on who you are as a person is basically the basis for gender discrimination. 

&gt;And as been pointed out, being a woman or minority ramps up a lot of the difficulty in your life.

Every single defining characteristic of any person provides its own unique set of difficulties and advantages. Being proud of overcoming a specific obstacle makes perfect sense. ""Wow, I'm so proud of myself for volunteering at the homless shelter and feeding 5000 people today"" while being proud of basically overcoming nothing makes no sense. ""Wow, I'm so glad my parents decided to have sex, and I happened to be part of the 49.8% who happened to get a pair of X chromosomes."" Notice a difference? 

&gt;I see no reason why anyone shouldn't be proud of being a woman, a man, white, black, whatever.

It promotes segregation between various groups of people. You are attempting to show pride in something that is literally impossible for large groups of the world to achieve, breeding jealousy, hatred, and contempt.

&gt; The battalion is supplemented by artillery, air defence, logistics and intelligence that is provided by the other nations in the BG. Additional support in the form of air, naval and special forces assets will be allocated based on the operational tasks the unit is expected to perform.


&gt;These units have trained together and are on paper combat ready. (it should be noted that there indeed have been reports on lacking internal cooperation, but these reports stem from 20010 and the Swedish commander promised that the issue would be tackled)


&gt;As for the second part of your post
If the Crimea wants to secede that's great for them. They should be given the freedom to do so, provided this happens in a orderly democratic fashion. If Russia forcefully enters the Crimea with the intention to speed this progress along, its an act of war against the sovereign nation of Ukraine. International law will be blatantly ignored and the Russian Federation will (again) put itself above the UNSC and above the Nuremberg principles.

&gt;While i agree that the prospect of European troops dying in some (with all due respect) Eastern European clusterfuck just blatantly sucks, we cannot let Russia just annex a part of another nation, a nation that the UK, your country , guaranteed the sovereignty of. Russia can't just be allowed to bully the former USSR around like its 1960. On a side note hampering Russia's control of the Black Sea and in extension the Mediterranean is in Europe's strategic interest. I think it is in Europe's best interest to no let Russia take the Crimea.

&gt;Me responding to the second part of your post is just my opinion on the matter and it should not be seen as anything else. I respect that people see things very differently. Its a very complicated and delicate matter.

The reason I mention food plan is that you seem to have most of the ultralight stuff working well, so one of the big places to cut weight is in meal planning. What do you cook that needs a 1L pot and a spork? Alternatively, how much of your 24 oz kitchen is fuel weight?","1393632624"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Essentially none. There were laws about adulteration of various food products, but the overall principle was simply ""buyer beware."" Only in 1860--after a major expose in *The Lancet* and multiple Parliamentary investigations--was a comprehensive Adulteration Act passed. This act was permissive, however, allowing but not requiring local government bodies to test foods for adulterants. It proved totally ineffective, and was replaced in 1875 with an act that required such testing. Within ten years the purity of food was substantially better, and adulteration was gone completely from many foods by the early 1900s. The standard work on the history of adulteration in Britain in the nineteenth century is Michael French and Jim Phillips, [*Cheated Not Poisoned?: Food Adulteration in the United Kingdom, 1875-1938*](http://books.google.com/books/about/Cheated_Not_Poisoned.html?id=HYumkNK0YEMC)

In terms of the space of the restaurant and its standards for cleanliness, I do not know specifically, but it cannot have been too different from bakeries, one of the subjects of my research. It was only after 1863, in the context of adulteration scandals, that bakeries came under surveillance for their health characteristics in relation to consumers. Health officers had looked at bakeries (and presumably other food-production facilities) before that, but only in relation to the workers' health. And, while it was clear that they were unhealthy for the workers, there was no meaningful surveillance and regulation. Even after 1863, some regulations were put in place, but there was little actual surveillance. There are plenty of complaints about the conditions of food production through the rest of the century, but I know of no major inquiries or reforms. 

Finally, I should note that the Sanitary Movement was a major part of the urban political landscape in nineteenth century Britain. ""Sanitation"" at this time, however, was deeply class-inflected. It was, according to ~~Michael Worboys~~ Christopher Hamlin in [*Public Health and Social Justice in the Age of Chadwick*](http://books.google.com/books?id=fwCPy5V3cOcC&amp;dq=sanitation+%22age+of+chadwick%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s), a means of cleansing Victorian cities of their filth, both in the form of human fecal matter and the activity of working class Britons. Drains, water provision, and sewers were seen as a way to clean up cities from the problems generated by industrialization without raising wages. Sanitary reformers typically focused on things that could be washed away and on poor people. Regulating businesses was never their main priority, and took the forms I mentioned above.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work at a warehouse that stored school textbooks for grades pre-k through college.  For those of you who dont know how the textbook system works, in many states, each subjects textbooks are edited every 4 years.   They are on a staggered system so one year would be a couple subjects (english, foreign language etc) and the next year would be different subjects.  This means that every 4 years that subjects previous books become ""obsolete"".  The book companies word, not mine.  Instead of taking these books and donating them or selling them as used books, the textbook companies insisted that we destroy the books.  

Every year we would gather thousands and thousands of unopened textbooks and we would slowly dispose of them in the dumpster.  There were attempts by employees of the company to persuade the textbook companies to sell these books to foreign counties as used textbooks, but the large companies repeatedly shut these ideas down.  The thought of used textbooks hurting the prices of their brand new books was all that was needed for them to justify this process.  

I personally feel it was unreasonable to ask me to trash thousands upon thousands of perfectly good textbooks every year when these books are needed all over the world, including here in the United States.  And just to be clear, many of these books only had a few sentence changes in them, nothing drastic.  Such a shame.  ","1393632627"

A team does not become a struggling Europa League outfit the season following a league title win.

*Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock.*

""Hello?"" Lucy called out. She walked over toward the sound of the gentle knocks. If she didn't know any better, she would think it was coming from the coffin at the front of the room. But that would be crazy, right?

*Knock knock knock*

They were fast this time. A bit rapid. You could almost say they were impatient. They made her jump with how fierce they were. Like they were angry. 

""Who...who's there?"" She squeaked out. Lucy's heart was pounding in her throat. If it got any louder it would drown out everything around her. All she wanted to do right now was prepare this damn funeral for her clients tomorrow.

She'd asked Charlie to bring up the body and prepare it in its casket. The lights were all on, the flowers were set up. The big flashy picture of Mr. Romero was on its stand three feet to the right of the center of the coffin just as she'd asked. Most of the chairs were set up as they should be. 55 on each side, just right. Plenty of room for people to sit. 

All that was left was the body. Which was what she was going to check to make sure it was there as she instructed about an hour ago. She was almost there, when the knocking-

###*BANG*

A loud thump reverberated through the room. Making Lucy almost scream, she actually kind of did. But she stifled it quite well with her hand. Her other hand went to her chest to hold her heart in place. Just in case it decided to quit this scenario and nope the fuck out on her. 

She walked closer to the coffin, which was still closed and somehow didn't open with that last blow. She could've sworn that she saw it shake and slightly jump with that last blow. But it still seemed so serene, so silent, so dead, in its place. 4

Lucy was just about two feet away from now. With one more step she could reach out and touch it. But did she want to? Not really. If it were up to her she would just leave and go find Charlie.

Charlie...

""Charlie, get the fuck out of there?"" She spoke. Trying to sound demanding. 

Silence responded to her. 

""Charlie...now.""

A muffled sound came from the casket.

She crossed her arms.

""What?"" She spoke sternly. 

The door to the casket opened and Charlie sat up inside. ""God damn it..."" He shook his head. ""Can't let me have any fun, can ya?"" 

Lucy pointed to the door at the other end of the room. ""I swear to God, Charlie if Mr. Romero isn't up here and lying pretty in this casket within the next thirty seconds your ass is going to be wishing you were IN HIS PLACE!"" She shouted. 

Charlie flinched as her voice rose and hopped out of the casket, almost falling over. He ran to the door being sure to give a quick ""Yes, ma'am."" As he ran away from her. 

Lucy brushed her hair once and shook her head as Charlie walked out of the room. ""Unbelievable...""","1393632634"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Joseph Smith founded Mormonism, Brigham Young took it to Nevada where it has kept a stranglehold ever since. Both were involved in conning people out of money, and outright murder of those who were seen as ""persecuting"" them. Several men who attempted to arrest them were shot, and later several hundred settlers passing through Mormon territory ""vanished"".

Jim Jones founded the People's Temple. Ever heard *""don't drink the kool-aid""*? Its based on their mass suicide.

[A critical reading of the (multiple) Passion stories](http://pointofcontention.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/jesus-the-terrorist-an-awkward-but-obvious-reading-of-the-new-testament/) suggests Jesus was executed for leading his cult in *two* violent attacks on a Jewish festival. Several passages credit him with telling his followers to sell everything and buy a sword, as well as disown family who don't join the cult.

Muhammad turned to banditry, then outright warfare to spread his cult. Slaughtering entire towns that refused to convert, and taking women and female children as sex slaves for his followers. The Hadiths credit him for personally beheading hundreds of prisoners, and almost all of his ""wives"" were widows *of his enemies*. 

**All of these cults have one thing in common - a violent reaction to being dismissed by the surrounding community. Not for persecution, but for not following the cult's rules.**

Emotional people don't require evidence, making them easier to manipulate. The most extreme members of any community are the most vocal and passionate - pushing others forward, while the most rational tend to remain almost silent. The *Golden Rule* is universal, simple, and not nearly enough to base a religion on. Adding rules, supporting mythology, and the ideals of each new wave of converts quickly blows what may have been a decent belief into a monster.

I know it's fascinating thinking you understand logic because you read wikipedia once but at no point did I state you were wrong because of your dickish and spiteful tone, I said you're wrong because you're using assumptions and DO NOT HAVE A SOURCE. The fact that you're dickish and spiteful is in *addition* to the point that you have no basis for what you're saying at this moment in time.

You even say it right here:

&gt;I'm sorry that I didn't provide a source that doesn't exist. 

Let that sink in, you have no source. You have no basis for your assumptions, therefore I can ignore them as not being valid for the character you're trying to buff. You're not a writer for the series and you don't have the liberty to enhance a character on a whim based on shoddy logic. Either source it or enjoy your fanfiction not being taken seriously.

Just last week when I was the club, I was outside with my male friend (I was clearly intoxicated). A guy came up and was like ""Hey what are you doing with this girl? How do you know her? What are her intentions with her?"". He had to explain that we were friends and he had no intention of doing anything with me.

So, no, I think that's victim blaming and it's entirely wrong. I don't care how much I drink or what situation I put myself in. It's not cool to ever blame the girl. I would argue the same if a guy was extremely intoxicated and a girl kept trying to have his way with her.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's being researched quite a bit. The problem is that they're still not entirely sure what causes it. The beta-amyloid theory is starting to look pretty accurate. 

The body produces beta-amyloid, which deposit in the brain to form plaques. Once the plaque reaches a critical mass, you start to have the brain damage which results in the characteristic memory loss and overall decline in cognitive function. The problem is, once the symptoms start to set in, the beta-amyloid plaque production starts to taper off.

The problem is, the current generation of treatments stop the beta-amyloid from depositing on the brain to form plaques, but by the time you show symptoms, its almost too late for those to work. There is one drug candidate that showed a slight slowing of Alzheimer's progression in those with mild symptoms and is going through some more phase III testing. 

There is a diagnostic imaging agent that can detect if the plaques are forming before you start showing symptoms, but no one has it done until after they begin showing symptoms. This agent used with the other drug (if the phase III results pan out) could result in screenings after a certain age (like with mammograms and prostate exams) to start people on a course of drugs before they ever begin showing symptoms.

The next generation of drugs work to stop the body from producing beta-amylase, but they're still in pretty early development and have had some safety issues.

tl;dr we're not entirely sure what causes Alzheimer's disease, but we're close and there *might* be some sort of treatment in the next 4-5 years.","1393632640"

Raising a puppy is much like raising a human child. Sleepless nights. Lots of poop and pee to clean up. Lots of trips to the doctor for shots. Lots of socialization work and puppy class training to be sure the pup doesn't end up with major behavior issues down the road. All that and you aren't totally sure what you're going to get. Cuddly? Aloof? High energy? Low? You can predict *some* of these in a puppy, but not all.

An older dog is much more ""what you see is what you get."" They can hold it for hours (and will likely sleep the whole time you're at work). They're pretty much the best. :-)

So at Oasis in UVHM you can buy: Blood of the Seraphs, Actualizer, and the Seraphim. Hyperius drops the Evolution, Retcher, and Tattler. Master Gee drops the Ahab, Patriot, and the Devastator. So 6 out of 9 of the Seraphs items in Pirate's Booty are raid boss drops in UVHM which is why you're only seeing those 3 items in the seraph vendor.","1393632648"

That means if you're 30% bodyfat (or whatever) at 300lbs then your recommended amount is 210g of protein. Of course you don't absolutely need to get that 1g/1lb. It's only a recommendation for making sure that you have plenty enough. You will still put on muscle if you're eating 0.6/1lb. But it may not reach optimal levels. As long as you're getting a decent amount (I'd say 150g+) then you shouldn't have much trouble. It only becomes a problem if you're eating like 50g total. ","1393632652"

He was living on his own because he was kicked out of the house when he was 16 so he looked up summer jobs in the paper. Eventually he found a job on a farm in the gulf islands in British Columbia and his plan was to work there the whole summer. First day on the job my dad's boss who owned the farm dropped a potato sack in front of him full of puppies and told him if he could take his row boat, paddle out to the middle of the lake and drown the puppies, he could have the job for the whole summer. This wasn't even a joke, the boss was dead serious. My dad proceeded to tell the farmer to fuck off, he left and took the puppies with him, dropped them off at the nearest S.P.C.A. and went home.","1393632654"

Think $15 fast food workers in a union and then think about how a company would simply replace cashiers with a point of sale system or have people order with the phones in their pocket.  It's a cruel world unfortunately.   

As for games, I find it hard to believe that people don't know they are spending money.  And most phones have protections built in to prevent child spending.  The easiest answer is that mobile games are generally awful and we would all do better to avoid them.","1393632655"

Although, at the end of the day there's only one question:

"powerlifting","t5_2s4tp","&gt;Because once again, elastic potential energy does fuck all until it's converted into kinetic energy. And that only happens when the tissue is allowed to return to its normal condition, at the end of the lift.

Elastic energy cannot apply force or pressure? Id say application of pressure is doing ""fuck all."" You would be correct to say that it doesn't do work until its released, but thats not really what im arguing.

&gt;This is wrong again. The abs do continue to contract, but they widen into the abdominal cavity. It is the active compression of the abdominal/thoracic area by voluntary contraction that increases intra-abdominal pressure, not some crazy partially-lengthened elastic storage contraption.


Id say its its both, and your assertions aren't really enough to convince me otherwise. I'll admit that the mechanism your talking about is likely the bulk of whats applying stability, but honestly i don't even remember how or why I got here with you. I think it goes back to you insisting the is no elastic energy involved at all on the belt helping to stablize the core. Which even without any elastic energy being stored in the muscles of the abs (ill chalk it up to being incorrect, because i think im correct, but its likely negligible anyway, and i honestly don't give a fuck.)

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Thanks for doing this. I've been interested in process theology for awhile now but haven't had time to read anything beyond encyclopedic explanations.

Why do you think the idea of substance is unhelpful? In what ways do you feel process theology better explains the nature of being?

If many objects can occupy the same space then what differentiates those objects from each other? Obviously at some point in the future they will become distinct enough that they will no longer occupy the same space. But, if at the current moment in time the multiple objects contain all the exact same properties (including spatial-temporal properties) than in what meaningful way can we say they are different objects?

How can you say that multiple unseen objects are able to exist in the same space while also saying that the future doesn't exist? It seems that philosophers who hold to a similar view, namely that objects have temporal parts, need an object to exist in time, past, present, and future in order to make sense of a temporal part. How does this work for process theology?

It may be the case that God cannot be articulated outside of his relation to matter, but even so why would that deny creatio ex nihilo. It seems conceptually possible that God created from nothing but that we simply cannot fully explain that process (for lack of a better word :P)

Where does Christ fit into Process Theology? ","1393632663"
"Music","t5_2qh1u","I watched Gaslight Anthem at Rock City, Nottingham a few years ago, being supported by Frank Turner and Polar Bear Club. Before the gig, I go to the merch stand to pick up a t-shirt and Gaslight Anthem's EP. A guy behind the merch stand asks me if I'm excited, and what I think of the support. I tell him that I'm very excited, and that honestly, I'd never heard of either support act, to which he told me that Polar Bear Club were awesome, and Frank Turner was just on another level - absolutely amazing.

Polar Bear Club finish their set, and onto the stage bounds the guy from the merch stand - Frank Turner.

"bouldering","t5_2rb1o","As someone else pointed out, a couple of the pictures in the article are from the Seattle Bouldering Project.  I have been a member there since they opened and the tape less setting is a fairly new thing.  As such, they didn't have 8 complete sets when they made the switch, nor have they seemed to acquire the same holds in all the different colors (there is some overlap though).  I don't really a detriment.  Rarely would a hold on a harder black/purple problem be appropriate for an easier yellow/green problem.  Additionally, I have never hear anyone complain that they don't ever get to use a hold because it is out of their color range.

I don't think monochromatic setting is for every gym mainly because of space issues not because of setting limitations.  SBP is a large gym that can afford to have a slightly lesser density that just won't work at many smaller gyms.  The gym I worked at before was forced to double tap holds due to lack of resources and t-nuts but they could have surely set interesting, provoking problems with a single color.  

The largest benefits I see to single color setting is how it deemphasizes grades and seems to expand the variety of problem styles people try.    ","1393632664"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It means that someone very powerful, usually the governor, has decided that the crime committed was not serious enough to merit an execution, or the prosecution's case was too shaky to warrant execution, or the defendant wasn't of sound mental status and should not have been tried as though he or she was, or even that the person may be innocent. Prosecutors have sought the death penalty against people in the past who were severely mentally challenged, to the point that the highest mental exercise they were capable of was playing a game of Tic Tac Toe. Often DNA evidence is mishandled or wasn't even an option at the time that these cases were being tried, and now new evidence has come to light to exonerate the defendant.

It takes a very long time to go from a guilty verdict to the execution chamber, and a whole lot can change in that intervening time. New methods of detecting and examining crime scenes can be invented, other people might come forward and admit they were actually the ones who committed the crime, or, as sometimes happens in rare cases, the defendant can totally reform themselves in prison.

There are a ton of very good reasons that death row inmates are given reprieves on their sentences, and it can happen very late in the process. The lethal injection is actually a series of injections, I believe the first one just puts the inmate into a deep sleep before the final one delivers the killing blow. If at some point during that process the governor calls to grant a stay of execution, it'd be great if the inmate didn't die anyways due to sharing needles or a contaminated injection point.","1393632664"

Over the years I gradually fell into a deeper and deeper depression, while my cross-dressing tendencies grew stronger and more frequent.  She didn't know about any of it.  Fast forward to September 2011 and I was at a breaking point.  It was come out to her or die, and so I came out.  She was shocked and confused, and said she needed time to process everything.   She also told me that no matter what happened, she would be here for me through transition and beyond.  She just didn't know if she would still be able to be in a romantic relationship.  She then dove head first into trans literature, learning everything a cis person needed to know about being trans.  Within a few months, we had both come out to each other as bi, she told me that she loved me more now as a girl than she ever did as a guy, and at this point our relationship is better and stronger in almost every way.  We still have some stuff to work through, but none is trans* related at this point.  I'm very lucky to have her and my fingers are crossed for a happy ending to our story.

* Touch objects around you, and describe them (texture, colour). For example, “I’m sitting on a red chair, and the fabric is really soft; it’s velvet. The carpet is beige, and there is a red couch in the corner.”  
* Run water over your hands, and describe aloud how it feels.

"ferrets","t5_2qhn1","First of all, stop bathing them. In order for topical flea repellents to work, they need the natural skin oils intact. Vets recommend you wait 2 days after bathing before applying the topical treatment in order for it to work properly.

Secondly, ask your vet what topical treatment works best in your area. Fleas in certain areas can become resistant to some of the treatments, so you'll want to know if any particular one would be best to use. Get Capstar pills from the vet as well, which will kill all fleas on your ferrets for 24-48 hours (if I'm recalling the timeline correctly). If you need, a tech can help you force them to take the pills using a pill shooter and/or something sweet and goopy like Ferretvite -- they will not like it, but it will kill all the fleas on them.

Third, make sure you're not using anything but the Capstar and a proper topical flea application on the ferrets. THROW AWAY ANY PRODUCTS FROM HARTZ IF YOU HAVE THEM. They don't work and have been deadly to many pets. Use whichever of the most reputable brands your vet recommended (Frontline, Advantage, etc.), which you can buy at all the big pet stores. Nothing else really works.

Fourth, while this is all going on, vacuum your house and furniture daily -- as many times as you can stand to. Empty the canister or throw away the bag *outside of your home* after each time, as any eggs you suck up can hatch inside the vacuum and the fleas will just crawl back out. Don't bother with flea bombs, and take care if you use any carpet products on areas the ferrets usually play in. Wash their bedding frequently as well. When I had an infestation, I just threw out their old stuff (I only ever use towels since they hold up well) and bought new towels for them to sleep in.

Vigilance is your best shot at eliminating this quickly. Use the proper products, and be careful because there are a lot out there that are just useless junk and others that can even make pets sick. If the infestation gets bad, you can always try sprinkling *food grade* diatomaceous earth on the carpets, then vacuuming it up. Make sure it's food grade, though, and not pool grade.","1393632666"

You're an adult and you are responsible for yourself as well as what you do.

You are 21 now, still young and inexperienced but it is time to to start learning. 

The first thing you need to learn is to own your mistakes and apologise for messing up with you step sister, regardless whether you want to reconcile with your father.

You are 21. She is only 18. I believe you weren't serious about going out with her and marry her and all, were you? So you were just having fun? With your sister? if I was your father, I wouldn't be happy either.

Then learn to find a way to support yourself. Not easy, but that's how it goes. Welcome to the grown up club.

[Nope.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Europe-Ukraine.svg)

&gt;Russia needs to be told in no unequivical terms that Ukraine will be defended by the West, especially because Putin who loves to preach non-interventionism when it's in opposition to American policies is doing exactly what he lambastes America with doing.

So, he is a hypocrit just like the US. Who cares? 

&gt;Dictators will be more willing to brutalize their citizens because they know they West won't do anything.

So what? We don't care as long as our oil supply isn't in danger. Mugabe can do what he wants, Sadam was even supported by the US until he endangered the oil supply.

&gt;You think Iran or China is going to take the West seriously when Russia just basically annexed an entire region of a sovereign nation?

Actually they will hold a referendum about that. So, it will be Crimeans deciding their own fate. Democracy; fuck yeah!

We are seeing a bunch of hypocrits controlling what they feel is their sphere of influence, and trying to expand. This time Putin won. This has nothing to do with Iran. China will of course try the same; and since we fucked up pretty badly in Ukraine they will probably have a big new ally in the north, who will supply them with oil and natural gas. We shouldn't have fucked with Russia. Russia wanted to come closer to the EU, we pushed them away, that was a strategically bad choice They will be looking for new allies in Asia and China and Russia are fit perfectly.  Nobody gains anything in the West if we basically force Russia and China to become allies. 

You and your president know nothing about strategy. How about you go piss of India some more over stupid patents. Perhaps you can manage to push them closer to China, too. That would be quite a feat, but Murrica might just be able to accomplish it. IDIOTS.

&gt;The **trolley problem** is a [thought experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) in [ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics), first introduced by [Philippa Foot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot) in 1967,  but also extensively analysed by [Judith Jarvis Thomson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Jarvis_Thomson),   [Peter Unger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Unger),  and [Frances Kamm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Kamm) as recently as 1996.  Outside of the domain of traditional philosophical discussion, the trolley problem has been a significant feature in the fields of [cognitive science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) and, more recently, of [neuroethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroethics). It has also been a topic on various TV shows dealing with human psychology. [citation needed]

"pics","t5_2qh0u","For some people, the thought of your 'bloodline' running out is scary. Having a child extends your life, in a way, with your progeny carrying on your bloodline, DNA, whatever - but I also believe that if you raise a child, whether adopted or yours biologically, your influence on the child comes from how you act and how you raised that child. As a man, with two kids who's married to someone who's adopted - I can honestly understand what he was saying. If I found out tomorrow one of mine wasn't mine 'by blood', I would love that child all the same, and never stop loving the child - but I also take comfort in thinking that generations down the line, my descendants will carry a part of me whether they knew me or not. I suspect your friend probably feels a similar way. Is it kind of arrogant sounding? Yes. Is it an instinct we've developed over the eons, to insure our DNA and therefore our species survives? Probably. Is it because we're males? I do believe so, yes - see, you're not sexist at all. ","1393632674"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","At 16, my NDad gave me a book: ""The Care and Keeping of Men"". It is a horrible book that implies that if something is wrong in a relationship, it was the woman's fault for not taking good enough care of her man. I would have thrown it out immediately, but if he did a room check and didn't see it on my bookshelf, he had a fit.

My NDad's favorite books were the P.I.G.s (Politically Incorrect Guides) to Feminism (did you know people still think using the term 'feminazi' is clever?) and Islam. He slapped me one time for turning off a radio show that was advocating for beating your children when they didn't get good enough grades in school, and had a screaming fit another time when I tried to explain that Muslims believe Jesus is a prophet of God, just not the Son of God. He was Tea Party before the political philosophy was named that, and in the worst ""deport all the Mexicans and Muslims"", ""Obama is the anti-Christ"", ""people who get food stamps should be put down"" sort of way; he is also now the biggest welfare queen I know - he quit his job and is living off welfare just so he doesn't have to pay my mom alimony. 

He and his brother were so afraid of the ""guvmint takin' our guns"" that they started buying them on the black market. I had to swear to never talk about all the guns we had in the house. It might be a false memory, but I think he had a rocket launcher at one point. He went out of his way to get the heavy artillery that were illegal for civilians to own. Because Clinton passed that law. 

I grew up on stories of how Clinton was a murderer and there were all these ridiculous conspiracies to protect the Clinton family, and their daughter was a she-devil, etc. It was like the intensity of the 9/11 truthers before that was a thing. So many conspiracy theories!!

Later, after I had left the house and was LC, my husband, who has a lesbian sister, was joking around about getting dolled up in makeup and a dress. My NDad ""jokingly"" responded by threatening to shoot him right there with the gun from his briefcase.

The last time I heard from him, he took it upon himself to state that my 15 pound-weight gain was me turning into such an ""ugly old hag"" that was ""letting herself go"" to the point where I clearly could only wear sweatpants anymore. I didn't respond to him, but I sure did laugh at the fact that message came from a man with out-of-control diabetes brought on my a lifetime of being truly fat.","1393632674"

That's not just judgmental, them's fightin' words!  In fact, your first three comments tell me you were looking for a fight.

To be unambiguous more words would need to be used. Something like ""geodes shaped to look like skulls."" The word ""into"" is the problem.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","My toddler is at daycare 5 days a week, and when he's there they feed him a well balanced morning snack, lunch, and an afternoon snack, so on those days I only do breakfast and dinner (described later), but here's my typical weekend meal plan:  

* breakfast: homemade pancakes or toast depending on my energy level, plus an egg or two scrambled with red peppers and spinach or kale, and a cup of milk  
* snack/lunch: a bunch of cherry tomatoes, a few cubes of cheese, a couple of pieces of tofu, a cut up apple or banana, leftover pancakes or a cheese quesadilla with salsa if he wants it
* dinner: usually some kind of casserole or hearty soup with pasta or potatoes or rice, some kind of cheesey or tomato-based sauce, a bunch of frozen veggies (carrots, peas, corn, kale, spinach, peppers, whatever is on hand) and some kind of protein (chicken or tofu usually)

On the week days I'm much lazier. Dinner is either from the crock pot (some sort of meat and root veggie based stew) or something fast and easy like tacos or pasta with tomato sauce and optional protein. Breakfast is milk, a banana, a fruit veggie pouch [like these](http://www.plumorganics.com/products/second-blends-sweet-potato-mango-millet), and sometimes a hard boiled egg or a second fruit pouch if he's extra hungry or if we're running late enough that he'll miss morning snack at daycare.

Does your little guy like tomato sauce on pasta or pizza? I'd be happy to give you my totally not weird tasting but veggie-full tomato sauce recipe to help pack some extra nutrients in. 

I'm really lucky that my kiddo really enjoys most veggies (and don't feel bad, I didn't do anything special, I just got lucky!), but my ex's tween hated anything that didn't come from McDonald's, so I have some experience with convincing picky eaters to enjoy vegetables.","1393632693"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Interesting. You've definitely given this more analysis/research than I have. I'm not sure I agree with the list you provided (Pulp Fiction and Fight Club above Shawshank, Forrest Gump just behind). It also has Starship Troopers at #817. I actually love that movie, but I don't think it deserves a spot on that list. It also has some odd rankings like Star Wars at #125 and Empire at #288. Again, back to subjectivity, I actually prefer Star Wars, but there's no doubt that Empire is renowned as the superior film. This list seems to place more emphasis on cultural significance than quality of film to me. An interesting read nonetheless.

Bach vs the Beatles is a much more interesting case since centuries separate the two. I don't know enough about Baroque/Classical/Romantic music to make an educated commentary on Bach, but the Beatles vs the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin seems to be a much bigger gap than Bach vs Mozart and Beethoven. Then again, popularity goes not necessarily = quality.","1393632698"

You may not have these currently but have antibodies against them. And the hsv2 test picks up a small amount of them and it reads as 0.5 or 1.2 or whatever.

"zen","t5_2qhmf","&gt;To prove me wrong, you're going to have to prove how these non-sequiturs are 1) not shitty and 2) how they contribute to anything relating to this subreddit.

Unquestionably and in all ways wrong.  The burden of proof rests with the positive statement.  The positive statement is the one that connects 2 concepts.  e.g. this form and shitty.  It is absolutely not the case that this form is shitty unless I can prove otherwise.  You are required to prove that is is shitty.  If you are unable to do so, then the concept of shitty and this form can not be associated.  BTW it is equally false to think that if you are unable to prove that this form is shitty, that we can conclude that this form is great.

&gt;Do you even read zen literature friend? How the fuck is this an opinion?

Yes I have and do.  You do not believe my judgement.  Given the problems we are having distinguishing fact and opinion, I suggest that we let this one pass and come back to it if we can resolve the other.

&gt;If they aren't contributing to anything, they're shitty

I don't agree.  Contribution or lack there of is not in my definition of shitty.  Which is why I conclude that your estimation of shitty is opinion and not objective truth.

&gt;What, you need proof that zen is a philosophy? ...

The problem here is that you know what Zen is.  This is a bold claim.  You are also claiming that you can say what Zen is with words.  Which is, I might say, an even bolder claim.  I'm not really that interested in being right or wrong, my point is given the four statements of Zen can you not see that these claims of yours are not as crystal clear as you purport them to be?  That someone might take the other side of this argument is not a shitty crazy person?

&gt; This isn't a putrid shithole, it's a mild putrid shithole

:)

&gt;I don't know what people are thinking...

Yes, we agree

&gt; I can tell you that I know what your typical user is like.

Why do you immediately contradict yourself?  Which is it you don't know or you do know?  What is the difference between what people are thinking and what they are like?

&gt;And there is no other reason

None?  Really?  No other reason?  How do you tell the difference between a shitty quote and one you don't understand?  Protip: Just because you don't understand a quote does not make it good.

&gt; let's not.

Fine Dogen is generally considered a zen master.  Particularly by Soto.  A post from a historical scholar with some pedigree that disputes this would be very interesting and entirely on point.  (http://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/1yw787/bielefeldt_on_dogens_advocacy_echos_of_not_zen/) from your list.

&gt;I don't need to prove that this isn't zen discussion, because you can't prove that something doesn't have a quality

Say what?  Proving something is false is not the same as proving a negative.  So yes, it is quite possible to prove that something is false (that is does not have a quality).  And just so we are clear, this is in fact the default state.  The burden of proof rests with proving that something has a quality.

&gt;I've proven that it isn't zen discussion because you can't prove that it is.

No, you have not proven anything.  You have simply left us in the default state.  One must prove that any given discussion is a Zen discussion.  If you like you could run around and say ""Not Zen"" all you like.  I don't mind.  In fact in a Zen form it is a quite useful thing to have people keep you on point.

&gt;I'm aware that you came in this thread because you recognized yourself in the people I was mentioning

Really?  How many posts have I made to /r/zen in the last month?  I think we can safely claim my contribution to this form as underachieving.  No, I came to this post because it had a large number of comments.  And I replied because of the quality or your posts.

&gt;And that's what you have done, except you have done nothing to disprove me except repeat ""that's your opinion"", when you have not proven it's my opinion and that it's not the objective truth. The burden of proof is on the one making the claim, and you have to prove that my opinions is seperate from what is true.

So... your saying that unless someone can prove any claim you make is false then it is true?  The burden of proof rests with the positive statement.  So when you say ""This is true"" you are making a claim that must be proven.  When I say ""that's your opinion"" all I'm saying is that you have made a claim without proof.

Take it another way.

&gt; you have done nothing to disprove me [...] you have not proven it's my opinion and that it's not the objective truth. [...] you have to prove that my opinions is seperate from what is true.

I say you owe me $1,000.  If you can not prove me false, does this mean you are going to pay me?

"bengals","t5_2rehg","&gt; I hate the misnomer ""best player available"". Championship teams dont just draft BPA, they address areas of need with players that fit their scheme. BPA does nothing for a team unless its the BPA for their offensive and defensive philosophies.

Thank you.  My buddy keeps claiming the Bengals have proven in the last couple drafts that they were using a BPA scheme. Was Eifert an absolute need?  No, but the Bengals had a system visualized that would utilize two pass catching tight ends, and we only had one.  Just days before the draft, Lapham hinted that he thought the Bengals were looking at Eifert.  Thats a HUGE call to pull out of your ass, unless you have some ears in the FO, especially considering everyone was projecting safety.  Eifert was the target all along.

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","Lol first of all no grappling competitions in the world today that I'm aware of require gloves of any form.  So you might as well throw that argument out.  Even then you still have plenty of range of motion with modern MMA gloves, definitely enough to hit nerves.

Second: If you actually needed to defend yourself from someone they would already be in what you call ""a fighting mindset"" and already moving.  If you're striking first, or not already being attacked, then you're not defending yourself.

On top of that I have never once in my life said that if something doesn't work in a ring that it doesn't work in real life.  However I will say it makes it a helluva lot harder to prove.  An example would be wristlocks, you can't wristlock someone while they're wearing those gloves (well you could...it's hard though) but some wristlocks work.  Of course there are a ton of stupid ones that would rarely if ever work too.

I would recommend if you're trying to prove a point to not talk about things you're ignorant of (competitions using gloves or precision with them) and to stay away from Straw-man arguments (putting words in my mouth or implying I meant something I didn't explicitly state) in order to not sound like a jerk.","1393632705"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; The politicians shouldn't be able to decide what they do with their body. I completely agree on that point, even though I am pro life.

Just to offer a bit of devil's advocate (I am pro-choice myself and a big believer of we shouldn't really have laws to regulate what we do with our bodies with stuff that if done 'properly' only pose a harm to our body at most) the politicians gained power by (theoretically) being elected BY women (and thus those women said this person has the right to make laws that govern my every-day life).

As well I feel that the no uterus no opinion (in regulation to abortion) is a very flawed BUT UNDERSTANDABLE opinion. I myself have actually found myself holding a similar opinion that has since changed (not even because I'm a better person but the issue where it formed forced me to confront it in a way that abortion simply does not because of biology). Male infantile circumcision. My opinion was at one point that a woman who was pro-circumcision (or at least pro having it legal) didn't have a 'right' to that opinion because 'she couldn't understand', but on this very subreddit I've seen a situation where the mother was against the circumcision of her son, but the father (doctors, everyone else involved too) was for it, thus my belief that it was the child's body and thus their choice was pitted against my belief that women 'just couldn't understand', because if the latter was the case than the mother's opinion would be invalidated (at least in my eyes) and thus the circumcision should happen (again, in my eyes), but rather I was allowing an 'us' vs 'them' mentality to take hold inside me and using this difference to try to 'further' argue that women who disagreed with me were wrong, instead of dealing with the arguments on their face value, it doesn't matter if you're 'double' wrong, you're still wrong whether it's for one reason, or two hundred. Similarly a man who spends years and years studying biology, and the experiences of being pregnant, going through an abortion, who's watched many procedures, and documented the hormone and biological changes during it and has seen hundreds of pregnancies with women they personally know both abortions, and birthed, and even deaths, and all that is certainly MORE informed about the subject than a 14 year old girl who JUST found out that babies don't come from storks, has never had sex (and maybe even asexual), possesses no fear of rape (or maybe believes in rape exceptions), and as a result generally has no real basis for her opinion and just spouts off what she heard daddy say.

In a situation where these two imaginary people decide what is legal in regards to abortion and not (while impossible in today's modern world, this is trying to show the faults in the logic) where the man is for the law not dictating what people should be able to do with their bodies, and the girl saying that it should be illegal for anyone to have an abortion, even advocating for the murder of abortion doctors, who is right? By the logic of 'no uterus no opinion', the girl who wants murder is right, and because of how abortion works and is decided it simply has difficulties being put in these situations where these 'extra' reasons for why someone might be wrong is actually put to the test to see if it's a VALID REASON FOR SOMEONE TO BE WRONG OR YOU'RE JUST LETTING YOUR EMOTIONS TRUMP LOGIC (Edit: this can happen because the situations that happen emotion and logic have an illusion of going entirely hand-in-hand, while I definitely understand and respect someone who's pro-life's opinion, when they get caught up in emotion and shoot an abortion doctor, to them the emotion that caused them to do that is on the same side as logic since the taking of one life is now, in their mind at least, saving MORE lives from being aborted, even though logic dictates that truly if all life is sacred so is the life of that doctor, so then life is only sacred under 'certain' conditions, albeit those conditions cover 99% of everything that happens, whether these conditions include flat out math or whatever is obviously up for debate, but in such a debate abortion is not an absolute evil, thus logic has determined that the emotion that compels them to kill while APPARENTLY on the same side as logic to them, in fact that emotion renders their logic not absolute).

At least, those are my thoughts. This probably wasn't so much for you since I doubt you've got extremely strong opinions being pro-life but seeming to be sympathetic to people who harbor differing views, and as a result I SINCERELY apologize for any aggressive language. I also apologize for how verbose I am. I thank you for your time and hope you have a nice day!

"technology","t5_2qh16","My problem is that I read while scanning ahead to know what I'm about to read, if that makes any sense.

With a novel, I tend to scan a few sentences ahead while reading, and speed-read the scene descriptions but read internal and external dialogue at the pace I think it would be spoken or thought. It's far more enjoyable to play out the paragraph like a movie scene in near real time in my mind than to rush through the whole book at a constant pace.

These ''speed reader'' applications don't work for me. Scene descriptions are fine, but when it comes to dialogue, I don't know how the words would be spoken until the last few words, since I can't scan ahead for context.

Information about dialogue can only be applied retroactively, which reduces the impact.

For example, with normal reading I'd read a sentence like 

""Why don't **you go** to **hell**, **you** piece of **shit****!**""

with the emotion I know is being conveyed by the exclamation mark and certain words my brain immediately identifies as important. I know it's intense before I get to the sentence in my real-time scene.

With the speed reader the first half of the sentence is read the same as if the person was being asked to buy donuts.

""Why don't you go to...""

The bakery? A friend's house to play Xbox?

I don't know it's intense until half way through the sentence because there's no context or identifiers. I can only read the sentence with its full impact after I see the last bit flash before me, so I'm applying emotion retroactively.

Contextual scanning is vital for emotion, and rather useful for comprehension. At least for me.","1393632715"

Cybernetic implants that record your consciousness ala Ghost in the shell and replacement body parts would keep you alive longer as well. Especially if you have a constant live feed backup of your brain powers as you go. But then watch out for people hacking your brain wi-fi.

Uploading eventually into some form of consciousness internet with millions of other people would be better, then you're immortal, connected, and basically can over clock your brain and imagine whatever you like.

I don't have history of depression or self harm, I had just met her.  I've been to several family medicine specialists and general practitioners, although I didn't know there was a difference.  I was also once told to take antidepressants when I went to the doctor for a heart infection caused by strep which that very doctor had treated, I had to visit multiple times before they finally gave me a prescription to an antibiotic instead of an antidepressant and lo and behold my depression disappeared. I don't know if I just give off a depressed vibe or what but Ive been to one doctor in my adult life who hasn't prescribed antidepressants. ","1393632724"

You can take advantage of grants and scholarships to pay for a good chunk of it.  A Roth is a good idea since you're in a low tax bracket currently, so I'd look at putting as much as possible into it.  Try and avoid any kind of debt obviously,  and have a couple grand saved in a bank account for emergencies. 

That's really all I can think of. Check out bls.gov before you get into a degree program to get an idea of salary and job outlook.","1393632724"

I've already pointed out one post that indicates /u/loneviolet , who is fairly open minded on this issue compared to the rest of thread, [assumed the effort her boyfriend put into courting her was unnecessary](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1z2iva/have_you_ever_dated_or_hooked_up_with_someone/cfqpout). Other comments mention being disgusted by men ""having a persona"". The flawed logic behind these assertions is that if one goes out if his way to court a woman, instead of just behaving ""naturally"", then he is changing his behavior and is therefore being disingenuous. Don't *flirt* with me, just converse with me the same way you would to a guy or platonic friend, and if we have ""chemistry"" than intimacy will just happen magically. If you act different towards me because you are romantically interested, then I""m not really falling in love with you, I'm falling in love with your ""persona"" and the relationship will fail once I realize you aren't really like that.

I guess when it came to line delivery I was trying for that approach where you're searching for words as you talk, as I certainly do in real life. I felt as a taxi driver too he wouldn't be articulate, but I am truly grasping!. But if you feel it detracted I will dial it back.

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","Hi Artfox, Thank you for your awesome questions! &lt;3 
1) When I experienced analysis paralysis/bad days I went into my own little bubble and did some more analysis and over thinking. This time however, I chose to quit thinking about the subject(s) that was/were bothering me. It was crazy hard at first because I was so used to hyper focusing on my problems that it felt like a painful break up. After all, who was I if I gave up on focussing on my worries, my problems, myself, who I thought I was? Then came the fun part. I decided to let it go, all of it. Little by little. Step by step. When I changed my focus, I freed myself. Here's what happened next: I realized I had a lot of pent up anger which I tried to release in constructive ways. Then, all the things that weren't worthy of my attention and that were robbing me of my energy stopped having power over me and I felt much lighter and happier. This is also when I felt my creativity bubble up. Next, I realized I could rely on my intuition and my feelings to guide me. It was scary at first to be guided by a feeling barometer which was implanted inside of me and didn't really think much about. But the feeling barometer was an attractive option at that point in time and I continue to use it because it does help. I also gave myself permission to be happy and told myself it was okay to be sad. I still get mild bouts of anxiety and depression but choosing to focus on different subjects made all the difference for me.
2) Through magical realism writing, I loved that I could explore a different reality, a reality that was different from the reality I have known, a reality that many people talk about. It was different from fantasy and allowed me to experience the character's reality. Her reality was filled with witches, talking bugs, vegetables, slithering serpents, fairies, gremlins, intangible talking emotions and other magical creatures in an otherwise mundane reality.  
Feel free to ask me anything else and I do hope you enjoy the read! Huge hugs! &lt;3 xoxo ","1393632732"

Old World Armoury: Up there with my favourite equipment sourcebooks ever.

Tome of Corruption and Tome of Salvation: Tome of Corruption is a life-saver. I generally have limited time in which to run my campaigns, so i level my players up quickly. Sometimes, they get powerful and think they're untouchable. Tome of Corruption fixes that right up - it's an excellent mix of fluff and rules that gives you an awful lot of neat little chaos enemies and artifacts to bandy around and scare players. Tome of Salvation is the inverse, explaining all the religious practises of the Empire, and just serving to make your little world bursting with flavour and seeming like a real breathing world instead of something you're making up as you go.

Career Compendium: Not really a sourcebook because it doesn't bring in anything new, but if you want to play WFRP 2nd edition, get this book from somewhere. It lists every career instead of you trawling through 15+ sourcebooks because one player wanted to be a Kislevian Ice Witch and you're sure you just saw that somewhere.

At the extremely cheap end of the spectrum we have labs which take banned compounds and alter them just slightly so they can be sold until the new compound is identified and banned.  This creates less stable and/or effective steroids, these are sold as-is or even used in supplements.

New repeatable meta made of repeatable achievements for Teq. Meta achieve is rewarded and repeatable based on amount of completions of the other repeatables, which consist of ""Defend the Battery"" event completion, and ""Defeat Tequatl"".

Every X battery events rewards a tick of that achievement, while the kill awards a tick by itself. When you complete enough achievements to fill the meta achievement, you get a hoard of the sunless, and the meta achievement resets. Leave the mini as a pure RNG drop because it's not account-bound.

No currency required, so no inventory clogging, and it rewards participation of failed events, but not as much as successful events.

Some background: Serbia is secular, but only on paper (constitution). Serbian orthodox church is the largest  confession in Serbia, and the government(s) has been kissing their ass for decades now. Mainly, for political points. They basically get whatever they want, even if it's against the constitutions.

The chief argument for privatization is the ruthless efficiency of business compared to the slack and bureaucracy of a state organ. If electricity prices are orders of magnitude more expensive today, despite greater urbanization, lower demand and better technology, while corporate profits for SP Ausnet are skyrocketing and consumer complaints are high, then what is the benefit? The overheads she's talking about are demonstrable - take a look at an old electricity bill versus a new one, they've increased the fixed costs and decreased the variable ones because people aren't using more electrons than they did in previous years. http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/ational-electricity-market-heat-waves-slow-stop-fall-demand-emissions-75888  
  
The problem with an inefficient private market is that they will ensure their profits at all costs, with none of that extracted value staying in the local economy. We just lost our aluminium smelters, some of the most energy demanding businesses in the world, why do you think they were here in the first place? For a state with ample solar, hydro, wind, natural gas, and coal resources, why are we paying so much?!  
  
As a Victorian you buy your manufactured goods from China, you're increasingly likely to be renting a home and sending the rent across to China, you're paying utility bills that go to China, and any business you work in will be getting its supplies and raw materials from China.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I never really got the 20 somethings with this stance.  I'm not knocking the lifestyle choice you're making; it's your life do what you will with it, doesn't bother me.  And I'm not even saying you have to drink alcohol every weekend or frequently on the weekend to have fun or whatever.  The annoying thing I guess is, the mid 20 somethings saying how ""old"" they feel and how slow they're taking it.  It's almost like they're just playing into the whole ""I'm so old man lol, my back hurts and shit I think I'm just gonna lay down all night and cruise Netflix.""

If you want a night in, have a night in.  If you wanna go to bed at 7am and wake up at 9am and get a tight 12, do it.  If you wanna have a casual, slow social night do it.  If you wanna party until the sun comes up, do it.  

I just don't get the whole ""I'm so old"" thing.  You're in your mid 20's/early 30's even.  I mean if you supposedly feel this way now what do you think is gonna happen when you're 50, 60, 70+?

I go out a fair amount and I stay in when I wanna but it's a nice mix of the two.  Over indulgence in either is shitty, **to me.**  I just feel like ""young adults"" (lame phrase kinda but whatever you know what it means so I'm using it here) get so wrapped up in the transition from college student to working person that all they focus on is work and relaxation from work but never taking the time to enjoy the journey they're on.

I just would still go out and enjoy yourself while you can.  Take time to recoup and relax when you gotta but there's just way too many people out there that put their blinders on (I think) and ride out being an adult for so long and then wake up one day having a mid life crisis.  If that's not you and you don't think it's gonna be you, then do you boo.

I've actually been thinking about it, and I think the reason that female ENTP's are able to read the emotions of others is because of how we see ourselves fitting into society the best. Male ENTP's are hopeless goofballs, while female ENTP's are closer to social matriarchs. We tend, as ENTP's, to hang out with other intellectuals, and for me at least this has meant the majority of my friends have been nerdy guys. Which, as a good-looking extroverted girl, means that I've always been dealing with lots of guys having crushes on me. It's almost a necessary defensive mechanism for us. If you've ever had a group of friends where all of them had crushes on you and if you wanted to still have friends in a month and had to deal with that situation, you'd understand why we've become so good at recognizing the warning signs so we can head off conflicts before we lose all our friends. 

This is just my theory based on my own experiences, I haven't talked with another ENTP female about what it's like to be us before.","1393632740"

Yeah, Pokemon is huge...In 2003. Haven't heard much about Pokemon except for the people in /r/gaming and a few asian kids. Once again, a small percent of the population. If they want to become smaller than they are, they can keep doing what they're doing. But if they want to keep their size or grow, they *have* to change with the market. 

As for the other two. Sony doesn't make games for casual gamers like Nintendo does. Nintendo makes games for people who play extremely casually and kids, Sony makes consoles for people who are a little older. Microsoft (and I actually like the direction their going in) is doing what Sony is doing and is making it more of a media hub.

"speedrun","t5_2sf9e","Hey there. You're a little late to the party but let's humour you anyway.

&gt; I owned a website I got 20000 daily views but my ads got about 1000.

First off, you're saying you got 1000 ad impressions for every 20000 views? Now when you count views, are you including search bots (which are generally not going to load ads because for some reason nobody can display a simple banner ad without Javascript these days)? Are you counting page impressions or all accesses to the server (i.e. every request, be it for a page, image, stylesheet, etc)? It's likely you didn't have much more than 1000 actual daily views from actual users. Also, how are you counting ad impressions? Per request for the ad images, or per callback from the JS, or per click, or per conversion? Those will all give you very different numbers.

Now the second big factor here is the nature of your site and the nature of your ads. Did you actually make an effort to provide unobtrusive, relevant advertising, or did you just let ScummyAdCorp™ run arbitrary scripts on your pages, inundating your users with popups, multi-megabyte animated GIFs in the middle of the content, sounds, unclosable popup layers that cover the content and move around the screen, and potential malware? Did you design a functional site that remains usable without Javascript enabled - and if so, did the ads work without JS enabled? Or are you one of those ""modern"" web devs who doesn't know how to do so much as display plain text and images without jQuery? Or did you *deliberately* make a site that doesn't work without JS just because you couldn't find ads that work without JS? Maybe you even did like Twitch and made a deliberate effort to fight ad blockers? Did you offer any alternative, like a paid subscription or donations, or did you make ad impressions the only way for your viewers to support your site?

See, all of these things are going to affect your impressions. If you're serving up annoying, intrusive ads and sucking up all the viewer's bandwidth, of course people are going to want to block them. That's the whole reason ad blockers were invented. But if you're reasonable and try to provide a good user experience to your visitors, they'll be less inclined to block ads, and might even be willing to *un*block them. A lot of users - myself included - turn on ad blockers only for sites that have really annoying ads, or turn them off for sites that have non-intrusive ads.

The content of your site is also a huge factor. If you're offering something geared toward techies, like a site all about programming or reverse engineering, you're going to have a lot of visitors who know their way around computers and probably have an ad blocker. But if you're serving content that's relevant to non-techies, you're going to attract more users who don't have an ad blocker installed. That's also going to have a huge influence on your stats.

----

So now that we've established that your numbers are completely meaningless, let's move on to the rest of your ridiculous argument:

&gt; I had to shut my site down because ignorant assholes like you seem to hate websites paying for their hosting.

You're stating and implying a number of ridiculous things here:

* Ad revenue is the only way to pay for hosting. If you believe this, you were doomed from the beginning. The only way ads are going to pay for your hosting is if you use really scummy, annoying ads - in which case you're not going to get many viewers anyway.

* If ad blockers didn't exist, you'd get more ad impressions. TV has already disproven this. Whether it's possible to remove ads or not, you can't force people to watch them. If they don't want to watch ads and they can't remove them, they'll simply not pay attention - go get a snack, resize the browser window to exclude them, or just not visit your site at all. I was annoyed at intrusive ads on TV, so I simply stopped watching TV.

* People use ad blockers because they hate you and your site. No. People use ad blockers because ads are fucking annoying and in some cases malicious. People hate you and your site because you use annoying ads. (And if you don't, well then they probably only hate you because you're a dick.)

Here's the thing: if you're running a website, you should be doing it for one of two reasons:

1. You're running an online business. In this case, you don't need ad revenue to support your site - you should already have income from your business to cover the costs. If not, then your business is failing already, and supporting your website is the least of your worries.

2. You just want a website, for personal reasons. You want a blog, an online portfolio, a place to stuff your images. In this case, you should be willing to pay for the cost of running it, just like you should be willing to pay for the cost of anything else you want. Maybe you can toss some ads up there to try to recover some of that expense. But if you're not willing to foot the bill yourself, well, I guess you didn't really want a website that badly. You wouldn't sell ad space on your car, then sell the car and complain to everyone who didn't look at it the first time the ad revenue fails to completely pay for the cost of fuel, maintenance, and insurance, would you?

From the sounds of your angry rant, it sounds like you fall under neither of the above. You want a website, but you're not willing to pay for one. Pretty hypocritical of you to complain at everyone else ""waah you just want to use their service without paying for it"" when you yourself just want to have a website without paying for it, isn't it?

----

Now I know what you're going to say next:

&gt; But Twitch is an online business!

Yes, and like any business, they sell things. To be specific, their products include:

* Subscriptions to support your favourite streamers

* Emotes you can use in chat

* The ""turbo"" subscription which lets you change your name colour and gives you an icon and some more emotes

* Shirts and mugs and other nice trinkets

But it seems they don't feel they make enough off these products (which isn't surprising - they're overpriced and just not that great in general) and feel the need to supplement their income with advertising. That's understandable. Streaming video is expensive to host. The trouble is their ads are extremely invasive and annoying. They're video ads, which means they take up a ton of bandwidth and have sound. They interrupt the actual video. They often don't respect the player volume control (so you get super loud ads when you have the volume down or muted) or break the player entirely. They're completely irrelevant to the content. Plus there's the big obnoxious ad above the chat, taking screen space away from the chat itself (permanently, as it doesn't scroll away like the old chat messages themselves do) and distracting from the actual content. Animated, irrelevant ads with sound that take up a lot of bandwidth and cover/distract from the content and break the site - Twitch is the perfect example to follow if you want your ads to be annoying as shit. Then they go a step further and make an effort to annoy people who've made an effort to *avoid* being annoyed. And like I said in my original post, annoying people is a fantastic way to make them *not* want to buy your products.

----

Finally, here's a thought for you: if you disagree with the use of ad blockers, then *don't use them*. You go your way and I'll go mine. Twitch is free to put up whatever obnoxious ads they want, and I'm free to contribute to open-source software by submitting bug reports and patches. In the case of software designed to block ads, failing to block an ad is a bug. And you're free to not use that software if it offends your delicate sensibilities. Once you go pushing your opinions on other people, then you're just an ass, no better than people who try to push their opinions on abortion and religion on everyone else.

Personally, I see modern advertising as a huge annoyance and invasion of my privacy (given the amount of tracking most employ now), and like anything else that annoys me and invades my privacy, I'll make an effort to remove them. I also quite enjoy reverse engineering and fiddling with software, especially when it doesn't quite do what I want - like how Twitch's video player deliberately doesn't honour my browser settings. I'm not working on blocking these ads because I want Twitch to go bankrupt - I'm working on it because I hate ads and love working on this sort of thing. It's a hobby. If Twitch can't figure out how to survive without obnoxious ads, that's their problem, not mine. Again: if people can't block the ads, they'll just not watch them. Any site that relies on obnoxious ads to survive is doomed.

----

Closing points:

* Maybe if Twitch spent less time finding new ways to annoy their viewers, and more time fixing the numerous bugs that plague their site, people would be more inclined to buy subscriptions? (And more willing to trust them with credit card information!) Maybe if Turbo offered more than some emotes and name colours for $9/month, people would be more willing to pay for it?

&gt; Don't fucking lie to yourself, you were never going to pay.

Is that why I have a Reddit Gold subscription? (And even declined to turn the ads off!) Notice how Reddit makes an effort to provide a good user experience and not annoy its users? Kinda the exact opposite of Twitch?

&gt; Fuck you

Right back at you.

**TL;DR** you're a hypocritical little twit. Don't throw around the ""you just want to use it without paying for it"" if you yourself aren't willing to pay for the things you want.

p.s.: Twitch's current incarnation of their anti-anti-advertising efforts is to send the ""show an ad"" command through a connection that bypasses the browser, but not load the ads that way. So people using an ad blocker get nothing but a blank screen or a popup message (""could not load ads"") when an ad would be showing. This doesn't benefit Twitch in any way - it's not as if they're making a profit by showing a blank screen - but it also doesn't give any incentive to turn *off* ad blocking, as it's still less annoying than the actual ads. So they've taken this extra step to annoy their viewers even though it *doesn't benefit them in any way*, and *does not achieve anything except to annoy people*. (Previous incarnations at least displayed an ad embedded in the flash player. That still seems to be there, but never used.) Interpret that as you will.","1393632744"

People should stop saying this, one thing I've noticed is that people when talking about calories either don't realise or forget that our body doesn't absorb all of the food we eat, particularly the more we eat.

For instance if we eat sparingly the body might absorb 97% of the nutrient content of our meals (numbers made up), but if we eat non stop it might only absorb 50% depending on how easy it is for our body to process the food we are eating etc.

I'm sure we have all pooped out chunks of carrot and corn before, we clearly didn't get anything from those bits we can see, and I would bet that a normal stool has plenty of unabsorbed nutrients from partially broken down food.

So someone like Michael Phelps who would have to eat so much damn food could probably eat a few thousand more than needed and still be fit as you body can only process so much in a set period of time.

Now granted you don't want to tell people to eat more than they need to etc, or let them think they can just pig out because 25% of the nutrients might exit their body in a relatively unprocessed form, but pretending that we process our food 100% isn't great either, and it's that sort of ""white lie"" that really shouldn't exist IMO.","1393632747"

Furthermore, Tehran was located close to the tribal holdings of the Qajars and virtually on the frontier of the Qajar’s foe, the Turkmens.

A couple poor kids in the front row got a decent coating of cereal, milk and semi-digested fruit, before a teacher yoinked me off stage and off to the nurse's station...","1393632747"

This is Bryan's moment to get revenge on the evil authority figure that's been screwing him for months. 

The fact is, the WWE Title means nothing right now. HHH means far more. Bryan is in the bigger match than Orton and Batista. ","1393632747"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I gain anywhere from 5-8lbs around the time I get my period. It's all water retention, I get it and it's bad. If I look at a scale then it makes me crazy so I don't, no.  Here's the thing though that makes me feel better about cravings. Metabolically speaking during your period and the few days leading up to it your body tends to burn slightly more calories. It's a side effect of the whole process, and yes, that is a scientific thing. I'm not just making it up. So if I have a craving for something salty or for chocolate, which I usually do, I do indulge it, but in a controlled way, and I don't feel too guilty about it, because I know I'm very unlikely to gain any real weight during that time. 

That doesn't mean I feel free to eat a whole pizza, a whole bag of chips, or a whole pint of B&amp;J's but I just might have a regular portion of whatever I am craving. Usually cravings are related to sodium, iron, magnesium, and calcium shortages in the body because again during your period it's normal to use up more of those things and crave them a bit more. Magnesium in particular is a thing with me, and that usually means I crave chocolate like a madwoman. I do eat a bit if nothing else works, but usually I'll try to substitute something a bit healthier like a handful of nuts or something. Iron is also a big thing. I bleed very hard and I don't absorb iron well from veggies or pills. Been there, tried that. It doesn't work at all. 

When I bleed I know I am going to crave the rarest meat I can get my hands on at some point so I totally plan my calories for that. I make sure I can do roast beef or a steak and I make it rare to the point of being very bloody. If I don't? I know I'll end up going totally crazy until I get what my body wants so I just make a plan to have that, in as healthy a way as I can so I don't end up denying myself and binging on it anyway. I don't mess around with the meat thing. I've been known to sleepwalk and eat raw meat when my iron reserves get too low, so I know it's not just a psychological thing. I'm not a natural vegetarian, that's for sure. If I don't get rare meat on a fairly regular basis I get iron deficiency anemia, no shit. 

But I never weigh myself till after the period is over. It's just too frustrating. My logical brain knows it's just water, but my ego still equates that with failure, and that's never a good thing, shrug. ","1393632748"

Not to mention that they're giving users incentive to get off XP/Vista/7, and start using Win8.1... which means more money for Microsoft in other ways because those users now have access to the Store and other Microsoft services. That's new potential customers for Xbox Music, Xbox Games purchases, Xbox Video purchases, ad revenue, Office 365 subscriptions(since Office 2013 does not work on XP/Vista), etc etc.  Plus a cut of revenue from paid Store apps.


If all goes according to their plan, they stand to possibly make money. It's not like people staying on XP/Vista/7 are a lost sale for Windows 8.1, and an OS is a digital good. So give it away(or for dirt cheap) and get those users in the money-making ecosystem. That sounds like Microsoft's ultimate plan if this rumor is true.","1393632748"

According to Liquipedia, the last 10 premier events had 6 Protoss winners, 2 Zergs and two Terrans yes. The last 10 major events were 5 Protoss winners, 3 Zergs and 2 Terrans.

&gt; Yes the QQ is disproportional, specially with JD who is a bit overrated, the real irony with the terran QQ is that these are the same people who were defending units like the initial hellbat when the game came live, who could think that unit would be broken, very surprising(/s).

Indeed when your own race is doing well it's ""let's just wait and see if the metagame solves itself guys?"", biomine in TvZ was statistically more imbalanced than Protoss is now in PvT but hey.

I agree fully that Protoss has more early game options than Terran now by the way, but this is the same situation that Zerg is in in ZvT and has been since the first GSL that fruitdealer won...

Unpaid internships already have a great benefit to employers as long as they follow the law. They get to train an employee, unpaid, for the benefit that they will know whether or not an employee could handle the job they have for them without committing to them. That's a great incentive in it's own. It's risk mitigation in potentially hiring a bad employee.

Minimum wage isn't that much to HAVE to pay those employees anyway in those types of job roles. There's a reason engineering internships often pay $20/hr+, because they're producing more than that in value.","1393632754"

The Red Sox have been a top 3 offense in 5 of the last 6 years. Hell, even when everything went to pot in 2012, they were still a top 10 team in runs scored.

&gt;

&gt;**Acetyl-L-carnitine** or **ALCAR**, is an [acetylated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylated) form of L-[carnitine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnitine). It is a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by plasma esterases to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown.

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","I'd go with the mosin - I've always enjoyed the stealth aspect of the game more than anything else, and taking out a team of 3 fully-armed guys from 600m is a real thrill - any closer (with an SKS/M4) and the winner is the guy with the best reflexes. 

Endgame for me has largely been about finding a sniper, then scouting the cities out. If certain sniping spots aren't likely to yield any kills, I'll wait for someone to appear, then begin stalking them from a safe distance until I can get a decent shot. Hopefully this will become more common the more players are present on the servers. 

For sniping, it's really about skill - judging distances and knowing where, and more importantly, when your bullet will land, in addition to, of course, deciding when to attack. The large, open map allows for this style of gameplay, as opposed to one you'd find on an FPS, which would of course be much more restrictive. If you like close encounters, I don't understand why you're not playing an FPS (not that I don't enjoy FPS games - I love them).

TL;DR killing someone from 800m away is more satisfying than spraying someone with an M4 stuck inside a doorway.","1393632759"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I started a couple months ago, for the most part everyone is going to be a noob just like you. You'll play through the game, figure out new tricks, when to stop attacking, when to turn and run, when to attack, it has a learning curve! There was the occasional smurf or rager, but you just accept them and go on with playing. There are many people who are not only willing but happy to teach you how to play on the way there. The first time I REALLY got my heart pumping and actually fell in love with the game was when I was playing a champ called vayne.

 We were in a 65 minute game, 2 of our inhibitors were down and only one of theirs. There was me and one other player against 3 of theirs, our nexus towers went down. They were at our nexus. I knocked back one champion who was attacking the nexus, killed him, while our friendly lux killed the other, and we started to focus on the last champion, who continued to attack the nexus, I popped my knock back again and the other champion popped a snare, we killed him and began to push down the middle.

The enemy champions had a ten second respawn time, we got both nexus turrets, and by then the remaining two champions respawned, the tanks, lux hit another snare but the Darius pulled her into the fountain. Instant death. 

My moment had come, I tumbled to the left ( a short dash attack vayne has) , attacked the nexus then hit a champion to reset the cooldown, popped my BORK which steals movement speed from the Darius and tumbled again, attacked the nexus and a champion. I flashed away from the enemy aatrox, who has a jump, I popped my ultimate which makes me go invisible when I tumble, I continued chipping away at the nexus. 

Then, Darius pulled me in. Shit. 

I popped my barrier, knocked Darius back who was about to ulti me, which surely would have meant both mine; and my teams demise. And focused on the nexus. 

The announcers voice finally said victory. I had won the match for my team. It was such an amazing feeling. 

That. Is why I love league.

By how you said that you ""don't think it would ever work"", I'm assuming you fall into the first category (to some extent. At least very long term) and there for you should just tell him that.

2. Negative battery post to the engine block. 0.04 volts DC MAX.

3. Negative battery post to the body. 0.02 volts DC MAX.

4. Engine block to the Body.. 0.02 volts MAX.

if you get more than the 4/100ths or 2/100ths of a volt on tests 2, 3, or 4, fix those ground connections before going any farther.
print this and practice it.. it will save you hours and hours and reduce comebacks.. it took me longer to type it than you will need to run this first portion of the test.
   
this is a test that takes about ONE minute to perform..

its what i use on EVERY CAR i work on.. TO prove that the battery cables are properly connected..  you might also want to test from the positive battery to the alternator output stud..  depending on the car.. 0.07.. to 0.7 volt.. that's 7/100ths to 7 tenths of a volt..  because of the length of the alternator to battery cable.

"Tucson","t5_2qmno","Your call center is a large business. Tucson isn't unfriendly to businesses, it's unfriendly to manufacturing, and while the city government I'm sure owes some blame, most of it lies in the fact that no manufacturing exists in Tucson to being with.

It's like why most movies and TV shows are made in Hollywood/California; the answer is that it's because most TV shows are made in Hollywood/California. Finding every service, location, and position you need to make a movie are all *right there*; it's a massive logistical effort to go anywhere else.

A lot of state economies counter this with massive tax breaks, which is what the top poster in this thread stated, but really, Phoenix has a lot of manufacturing already; it's going to be 10 times easier finding materials, a workforce, a location, and distribution on account of being near one of the countries largest airports.

Can Tucson prevail as the better choice over Phoenix? Probably, but it's going to come at the cost of getting literally nothing out of it outside of local employment because the tax breaks (maybe even credits) would have to be **massive**. The only reason Tucson might do this would be an attempt to grow the manufacturing sector and hope that each successive business after Tesla finds it easier to start-up in Tucson, and therefore Tucson might find it easier to collect more taxes over time.

Tucson doesn't have much of a manufacturing economy, probably never will. Tucson is focusing on it's service economy right now, hitting that side of the market Phoenix is neglecting by focusing on manufacturing. That's why we have all the call centers, it's why we're going to continue to do anything to ""cash in"" on the UofA, Raytheon, and Davis-Monthan AFB by repeatedly building this service economy up.

Edit: I should point out that giving tax breaks to making movies/TV shows in your city is an almost ""instant cash out"". Most places don't expect to become the next Hollywood, despite not gaining anything from the film being created there, what they hope to gain is a bonus to tourism once people learn of the filming location.

"Korean","t5_2rd8q","As a still-developing field of study, I have found it is much easier to look for a specific subfields, for example:

* Phonology
* Phonetics
* Semantics
* Syntax

There are many more. For English, the Oxford English Dictionary has an incredible amount of information that tells historical linguistic information, but that won't necessarily lend itself to Spanish. Many linguistic resources are hidden away behind paywalls. I have stopped paying for many of the subscriptions I had previously, and while the money back in my pocket is nice, the lack of access to current linguistic studies and field-specific research findings is a bummer.

Is there a specific aspect of linguistics that you are interested in looking further into? Perhaps I can help you better that way. A good place for anyone to start is familiarizing oneself with the [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://www.nativlang.com/linguistics/ipa-pronunciation-lessons.php) from [any number of sources](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ipa.htm). It is the alphabet used by dictionaries often times to record pronunciation and it helps avoid pitfalls we often run into trying to transliterate one language's script into another. [This one is my favorite](http://web.uvic.ca/ling/resources/ipa/charts/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm) because it includes audio clips to help you learn to the pronunciation.

If people were limited in their speed, they'd have more reaction time in bad situations and accidents wouldn't be as violent.","1393632766"

"news","t5_2qh3l","If you have bad parents, it's unlikely to be just one missed meal. It's likely to be yet another missed meal. In the long run, not being properly fed will affect a child's academic performance and the consequences of that are far-reaching. 

The right thing to do is for the school to help the child out, but to send a note home to the kid's parents and keep a record of the incident. If they're decent parents who just forgot to top up their kid's cash that day, they'll be mortified and won't do it again. If they're bad parents who don't care if their kid gets lunch, they'll let it happen again. Once the school notes multiple incidences, they need to treat it as something serious and perhaps get CPS involved. 

The thing is, it shouldn't be the kid's problem to solve alone. A child with neglectful parents needs to know that there's help available, that some adults actually care enough to give them a hand. That's not the message people send by refusing a child lunch for being very slightly short on cash. ","1393632768"

From my personal experience, the race issue still persists and more so in gay dating.

The suggestions are good; however if the profile has already made up my mind that he's does not want to date me (a Chinese/Burmese mix), then good riddance. I don't want my profile to be an ""accidental"" click or discovery. I want my profile to be visited, because of my interests and what I wrote about who am I looking for, etc.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I’m just going to jump into the story to give it a little more of the surprise that it was for me too. This was 1996 and I was still a kid. The internet was just starting to go mainstream as AOL was adding new phone numbers like crazy to keep up with volume. I was living in the ‘burbs of the San Francisco Bay Area in what would be an upper middle class neighborhood. The usual mix of 4 bedroom 3 bathroom wood frame single story ranch type [house](http://www.dreamhomesource.com/house-plans/media/catalog/product/cache/3/image/820x615/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/H/P/HPB888-FR-RE-CO-LG.JPG) that are close enough together to try to spy on your slightly older female neighbor, but far enough apart that you could get away with it.  You get the idea if you’ve ever been a 13 year old boy. One summer night while I was searching “Pamela Anderson” or “Cindy Crawford” after my parents had gone to bed (ah, I miss summer break so much as an adult), the internet just fucking died. Picked up the phone. Dead. Then things start going down one by one in slow succession. Monitor goes down. Computer goes down. Lights go down. I’m starting to wonder what the heck is going on. Oh, I should mention the computer is next to a window in the bedroom that we use as an office. Next thing, the streetlight that is outside our house turns off too. I look outside and the world is dark and *extremely* quiet. I start to freak the fuck out as any young teenager would in this type of a situation (you know where your imagination takes you). Then, as I’m looking outside, I remember a sharp flash and loud bang which knocks me back from the window. The light outside is now as if it’s daylight. Louder than anything I have ever heard before. My parents are up, I can hear them. Muffled in the hallway, I hear them bantering coming my way. My Dad is saying, “WookiePsychologist, get over here. Get in our room and don’t come out!” My Mom is telling my Dad to call the cops or something. She’s basically freaking the fuck out. I go into their room, where the blinds are still up (my Dad must have drawn them up after the bang). I see my Dad go outside with the baseball bat that he keeps by the front door and my Mom is standing right outside the door and has brought her little point-and-shoot with her. At this point, other neighbors are starting to pour out of their houses too or are pressed up against their windows. All of a sudden my Dad sees something to his right and sprints that direction where I lose sight of him. My mom starts snapping off pictures in what I would call a panicked way. She stops taking pictures and starts yelling “No, no, no!” I am thinking “what is he doing? Holy shit. Holy shit.” Next thing I know, my Dad comes flying back from the direction he ran, but not in a sort of he has been knocked back, but more in a sort of levitated and then dropped to the ground. My Mom runs towards him and at this point, I break and just sprint out of the room and out the door. I want to get to my Dad. The photos my Mom took are all scrambled from whatever it is, but this is what I [saw]( http://meatballcandy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/nicholas-cage-as-et.png) ","1393632771"

Nice wee place but I'd never met him as their schedules are a bit weird, and I didn't know that she'd arranged for him to come round while I was still there. He seemed nice but I think he was bricking it a bit- I made an offhand jokey comment, about 18 months ago when they met, offering to kneecap him if he screwed her over (she's like a sister and she's had no luck with blokes in the 15 years I've known her.)

I'm sure there are more projects out there, like [Cryptocat](https://crypto.cat/), but the four supported by FPF have a proven track record and community support.
  
Tools like these are vital to journalists and activists who operate in hostile envornments, such as Ukraine, or handle sensitive material, like Glenn Greenwald and friends.  
  
Everyone can benefit from these tools. They're not just for journalists and activists. TextSecure is a truly secure WhatsApp-alternative, and in that category its the most user-friendly. It will have an iOS version soon.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Awesome, but I respectfully disagree because I don't believe it is hyperbole.  Love Lebron and he's as unique as they come, but the original post was that Iverson may actually be even more of a genetic outlier and I feel I've provided solid arguments for that.  It's not blatantly untrue as you suggest.   

The point of the hibbert/shaq comparisons had nothing to do with their play, just with their size and athleticism.  They're both huge, but athletically Shaq was obviously on a completely different level.  It's the same thing with John Wall and Kyrie Irving.  They're excellent players, but they're really not on the same level athletically as Iverson.  

As an argument for that claim, I'm offering the two video clips.  That's iverson sizing up JORDAN - without hyperbole one of the most athletic people in the world -and exploding past him as if he wasn't even there.  

And that's just his otherwordly quickness.  Even if you can somehow find somebody, anybody, with that level of quickness, you still have to see if they can match him for speed, endurance, balance, and durability.  I'm arguing that such an insane combination is as difficult, if not more so to achieve than Lebron's ridiculous attributes.   

In the end, it's just a friendly debate, and I love that you're an Iverson fan as well, but respect that the man was one hell of a genetic outlier athletically.   ","1393632781"

There is another great breakfast place in the Sunnyland neighborhood called Homskillet. They too get busy so go early. http://www.homeskilletinsunnyland.com 

What are you and your husband into? There's a walk-on ferry in the summer to Victoria that is a fun day. The Whatcom museum might be fun for you if you're interested in local history. http://www.whatcommuseum.org

There is an Electricity and Radio museum that is fairly knew. They have a show you can watch that is fun and ends with a giant tesla coil display. You can even pay a bit more and be allowed in a faraday cage while the Breslau coil hits the cage around you. It's really loud but a great experience. http://www.sparkmuseum.org

There is a park and boardwalk in  Fairhaven that is pretty, and a garden park with a boardwalk that takes you on to a lake in Ferndale (a few minutes north on I-5) called Tenant lake. 

There are a bunch of antique stores on Holly street, and local used bookstores on Grand Ave:

You're using the wrong program.  What you want to do is use a mask in photoshop.  That's a whole other can of worms, but suffice it to say that there are lots of methods you can use to selectively edit parts of an image with excellent control.  Lightroom just isn't up for that sort of work (you can try the 'auto mask' option, but good luck).

Lightroom is best for making global adjustments (whole image) or using a highly feathered brush to make local adjustments.  Personally, I never use an unfeathered adjustment brush in Lightroom.

However, I wouldn't say the average person in the US is anywhere as close to the average person in Norway, Sweden, Belgium, etc. What happens when a person messes up their shoulder in the US and they have no insurance? They'll go bankrupt. I don't see that happening in these smaller countries with actual healthcare. 

Now, the US, I think is a special case, however. Each state has certain rights, and although they can't override federal law, sometimes they can bypass it. So, they do have some sovereignty to an extent, and each of their state government can try to govern to their best extent. Could this work if the USE did the same thing, with each current country becoming a state? I don't know, but the federal government of the USE would become more corrupt, and will slowly ruin those states. 


&gt;the issue is a lot deeper than people just wanted to proclaim themselves king of the hill.

I agree, but talking to hardcore EU nationalists, it's really not.

Higher bins have more leakage, not less, that is one of the fundamental reasons why they can switch faster.

"rational","t5_2rdak","&gt;That isn't what research on hitmen says happens. A lot of them bungle it or fail to do it (as I said, killing people is hard) and those that do it often do it in public. The best generally come in from another region and do it, and have few ties to the region. If you stay in one area to scope someone out you're more likely to get caught.

Once again, taking specific information and generalizing it in a way that most benefits you.  The article you linked to specifically mentions the ""class"" of hitman, and your arguments might apply if we weren't specifically talking about career criminals with specialized training in murder.

See: competent criminal.  But you look at the 200 dollar novice and say ""Well, hitmen just suck, so of course Team Rocket couldn't get away with it.""

&gt; but at the same time you're saying that these hitmen are going to kill their victims in the wild where pokemon live, aka a rural area.

Wrong: I said they would relocate their bodies to places where it's feasible that a pokemon would commit the act.

And again, sixth time now: evidence of murder =/= solved murder =/= blown conspiracy. I think we've established that last part, at least, but you're still insisting that any imperfection in the method of the murder or coverup should result in a solved crime. It's simply not the case.

&gt;Killed by pokemon that are very good at killing, and probably aren't native to that region.

Again, drawing assumptions out of lack of knowledge: what there are pokemon very good at killing in just about every region.

&gt;And in your world, the mary sue organization is much more successful :)

&gt;And improved technology only works for them, no one else can benefit.

&gt;Hence why I am challenging you. I'd prefer to see hyper competent police and criminals, not just hyper competent criminals. It's annoying seeing people hold the idiot ball.

I would be more inclined to believe this if you weren't so quick to use bad evidence and twist statistics to back your arguments, because you continue to do this, as evidenced by the ""the data doesn't back up competent hitmen"" generalization.

&gt;Have you actually read up on any accounts of real life criminals, or hitmen, or murderers?

I spent a year and a half studying forensic psychology, so yeah, it's kind of one of my major interests, which is part of why I find your insistence on your misuse of data to back your assertions so frustrating.  Especially when you say things like this:

&gt;I really think you should read up on actual hitmen. It would help a lot.

When your arguments are all based on badly applied overgeneralizations of data, and special pleading to ignore any contexts or factors that make your proposed scenarios less likely.

&gt;Do you remember what you wrote in your chapter? He lost his daughter, and his wife divorced him. So they can have children and he has an ex wife, who may well want his home if he dies. He could easily have had other children, or children that abandoned him. If not, he could have siblings who didn't talk to him much.

And in your continued insistence on ignoring the concept of a competent criminal, you, a usual, ignore the idea that if any of that were the case, they wouldn't have targeted him.

&gt;But then you forget other parts of your argument, like that they have to be killed by wild pokemon who live in the wild.

As I explained above, this was your mistake, not mine, because you keep assuming things, sometimes due to misreading what I say.

For the record, incase this isn't clear: ""wild pokemon"" are indistinguishable from ""captured pokemon."" You keep bringing it up like there's no overlap, and jumping to the most extreme, absurd examples like ""Gyarados hyperbeam"" to support your argument.

&gt;They might get away with it some number of times, I just wouldn't describe them as competent if murder was their go to tool for solving problems. Their competency is an implied attribute rather than something we see in the story.

You haven't even seen them in the story. That's part of what makes your arguments so easy to dismiss: you are literally shooting in the dark and hoping you hit the right answer based on your preconceptions of how the world and story work.

&gt;So they are paying the utility bill after they vanish? That's also evidence.

...Yes... They're paying the utility bill...

Obviously that's the only rational path a competent hitman can take on the problem of ""how do I not arouse suspicion.""

Wait, no, there aren't any of those, I forgot. *sighs*

&gt;Other people would likely also be competent and realize what had happened, and other scientists and engineers, being afraid for their lives due to the obvious evidence of people vanishing, would beef up their security measures.

Three prepositions based on unfounded arguments based on bad evidence.  I think that's your record.

&gt;No, I just said that people would discover that scientists were vanishing, likely due to criminal activity.

Except they're not vanishing, as I've said multiple times, and recently clarified. But you refuse to accept the idea of a competent ciriminal, so back around the merry-go-round we go.

&gt;And medical tech is better (e.g. magic healing sprays),

Useless without the chance to apply it.

&gt;and the technology to discover evidence is far more powerful too. 

Evidence of this in any pokemon game or media whatsoever?  I'd love to add it into the story, I just have no idea where you're pulling this assumption from.","1393632793"
"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Learning from beeci, I went straight for the tutorial.

I felt that the tutorial had a very good learning curve, but I missed a last step bringing it all together. I felt I was given a set of tools, but I had no idea for what to use them. That happened in the first ""real"" level, but it could have been part of the tutorial, maybe with a ""help"" button.

I really enjoyed the game, and I was gutted when the web player crashed on level 3 :( I haven't been able to get it running since. I think it has more to do with the laptop I am on, than anything else. I will pick it up again when I get home tomorrow evening.

As I said, and as beeci pointed out, the premise for the game is really interesting. I am not a huge puzzle game person, but this game caught my attention with its simplicity and its potential complexity. It feels like that when it comes to the complexity of the levels, the sky is the limit!

There is also a great potensial for humour in this game (which is a blessing). 

But as I said, I'll get back when I get to play it at home.","1393632794"

"NewToTF2","t5_2rbtk","This explanation assumes you use no other scripts, and uses the new SteamPipe location of scripts.

You would navigate to your `\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\` folder and create a folder with the name of your choice. Paste the cfg folder from broesel's in your named folder, so that the folder tree looks like: `\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\&lt;mod&gt;\cfg\`.

**EDIT:** I just checked your post history, you already have an `autoexec.cfg`. What you'll want to do is open the folder containing your autoexec, and paste in the contents of broesel's cfg folder to be on the same level as `autoexec.cfg` (don't paste in the cfg folder itself). If your `autoexec.cfg` isn't in the location I explained above, that's okay; the old location of `\tf\cfg\` still works.

---

Separate to this, it's very annoying to remove broesel's (especially as someone new to scripting) and return your game to default; simply removing the scripts will just break the binds, not remove them. Your binds are saved by TF2 and Steam, so uninstalling/reinstalling the game won't work. It is possible to return the game to default, broesel just neglected to explain how.

Also, I see you're the same person I answered [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/1z4nkl/crosshair_switcher/). Understand that broesel's uses the same logic that I mentioned and includes the same downsides (actually more downsides). If you're set on using broesel's (which I don't recommend for the reasons I told you in that thread), the way to undo the changes you're about to make would be:

* Delete the files I had you paste in in the edit above. ~~Delete the cfg folder you pasted in above (there's a cfg folder direct in the tf folder, don't delete that one)~~
* Temporarily add the launch option ""-autoconfig"" to TF2 and launch the game
* Open the console (\`/~ once enabled in advanced options) and input `exec config_default`
* Remove ""-autoconfig"" from your launch options

No guarantee that will work as I haven't personally done it recently (-autoconfig may not do anything and you possibly might not have a `config_default.cfg`), but that would be my recommendation.

**EDIT 2:** I recommend /r/tf2scripthelp and /r/TF2Scripts if you have further script-related questions, you'll get more answers there than here.","1393632799"

Granted, those were out of context - but still pretty incendiary (and right in line with a ton of other comments and interviews he's given).

He called Samuel L Jackson a ""house Negro defending massa"" for defending Quentin Tarantino (Lee didn't like the way that Tarantino used the word ""nigger"" in ""Jackie Brown"").

He called Clarence Thomas ""A handkerchief-head, chicken-and-biscuit-eating Uncle Tom.""

Oh, and don't forget that he once said he couldn't make an anti-semitic film because Hollywood is run by Jews and ""that's a fact"".

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Hey there.  I'd like to think I'm relatively moderate on this issue, especially since it was the subject of a rather involved research project in law school.  My position is this:

We need to stop treating pedophilia (the sexual desire and fantasy) as being equivalent to child molestation.  The former is, at worst, something we find icky and kind of gross.  The latter is a terrible criminal act.

Are we justified in hating child molesters?  Absolutely.  Are we justified in banning actual child pornography on the basis that it is a record of child molestation and by its very nature harms children?  Absolutely.

Are we justified in banning virtual child pornography, drawings and computer generated images?  Given that there is no evidence that virtual child pornography acts as a gateway to real child pornography, much less child molestation, *nor* that it is used for ""grooming"", the answer is probably no.

And are we justified in hating people whose paraphilias run toward the icky or obscene but who have not themselves done anything harmful or untoward?  No.

And I would like to remind everyone that among the most common fantasies in America (among both men and women) are rape fantasies.  I presume that few among us consider that to be evidence that most people in America are just a sliver of self-restraint away from committing rape.","1393632804"

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","I could be wrong but I believe that the angels from ""blink"" we're very weak, near death so to speak. the angels in later episodes were absorbing the energy from the crashed Byzantium, and thusly were closer to their peek. 

This explains why they would choose to physically kill their victims, versus sending them back in time to feed on their ""potential energy. "" As well as being able to ""reproduce"" (ei turning the two headed statues into angles). 

Same for ""the angels take manhattan."" The paradox gave off such great energy that they could become much more proactive in their survival. They are known as the lonely assassins, but probably because they normally don't have access to such vast energies.  

One could argue that the doctor has, in a butterfly effect, caused an evolutionary jump for the angels. 11 was the cause (or at least at the center) of multiple paradox and multiverse rewrites, causing vast temporal energies to leak into the universe in places they normally wouldn't. 

This would even explain why the angels wanted to so badly to get to the doctor on Trenzalore. Not because they ""hate"" him or want him dead but rather that they now possess an migration instinct to follow the doctor. To feed, and reproduce. 

Edit : tl;dr.  The blink angels didn't have enough strength for reproduction. The doctors paradox mischief might be the cause of jump in angels evolution. ","1393632805"

I guess I'll have to take it home since no-one can have it!"". In short, it leads to abuse of the system, which creates even more waste. In business you need to draw a line somewhere - and yes wasting food sucks, but there would be even more waste if employees were allowed to control the QA process. These stories obviously pop up from time to time, but 90% of it is just the usual media sensation.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","You can do it!

The best method varies from person to person; it's really about finding a fitness activity that you love so that it is sustainable. This might be an echo of the general sentiments of /r/fitness and r/xxfitness, but I've had a lot of success with weightlifting. I was a runner in high school (albeit not a very good one), and I feel and look a lot stronger (read: visible muscle) in 2 months of weightlifting than a whole season of running. 

You may want to check out the FAQ either here or xxfitness, but I recommend looking into Starting Strength or New Rules of Lifting (for Women). I know you mentioned the equipment available to you, and I noticed weights were not one of them; I would suggest maybe considering looking into purchasing a set of dumbbells, or joining a gym with weights, especially if you would continue to exercise long-term (please do!). Consider reassesing your caloric needs; you may need to increase food consumption, as well as monitor macros, for your body form muscle and burn fat. I would expect to see a noticeable difference in 3-6 months.

In regards to your back, if you do decide to pursue weights: Start with weight that is comfortable to you, and focus on proper form. Good form will prevent injuries. Increase weight by 2.5-5lbs every time you repeat a workout*. And remember: You cannot spot reduce (in this case, stomach fat), and you will not get big, bulky, or beefy from lifting. That takes time and work!

Best of luck!

My goodness, semantics much? You falsely derived my supposed understanding and definition of the word from my very short post. My point stands, even with the dictionary definition. It's a good thing when people don't automatically accept something they see online. It's not a bad thing to question, even if it's a viral video. That's my point, in case you misunderstood that too.

Yes, there are 2 other states next to fully believing something. *Not* believing, and not subscribing to either without evidence. Obviously, thank you for that INCREDIBLY simple lesson that I already fully comprehended. However, I simply stated, *sarcastically*, that it would be easier to just believe.

The problem with 'regulation' is precisely that there is no credible way to select regulators that are on the right side of the asymmetry in the first place, even if there was one it would be prone to corruption. And when they are corrupt, they are likely to get away with it.

On the flip side of that there are market based 'seals of approval'. 

For example the UL you find on most basic electronics is a certification from: [Underwriters Lab](http://www.ul.com/usa/eng/pages/) that the product meets industry standards. This is a market-based entity that loses market share over time if they are not a reliable source of information. And this is just one example of a market based solution.

This is leaving out that the 'old' Quetta/Shura Taliban have been in negotiations for some kind of power sharing agreement that will likely give them some kind of control over Pastun areas and are split about how to proceed (negotiations v military offensive).

I expressed a subjective opinion that the previous experience of a show left me dubious about the idea of any future attempts to translate a beloved series into a show/movie and even explained that while I understand the incredibly loose reasoning for some changes they still annoyed me.

Of course the particular part of my opinion you've chosen to pick at and use as ammo to explain why my opinion is wrong is a bit amusing because you don't appear to have done any fact checking and have actually ended up agreeing with me without realising it. Yes, it would be silly for the short blonde Irish girl with a last name of Murphy to have a first name of Constanza... but that is what it is. I believe it's explained twice within the show that her name is the spanish version. Of course people like to cite the reason for that change that there is an actual Karyn Murphy in the CPD and the change was made to avoid confusion; fair enough. Not sure why that means they couldn't just change the name and also had to change the short Irish blonde (which is not just a visual detail but a huge part of Karrin's later story with her faith and family, and the constant lovable bickering with Harry) into a leggy Spanish brunette. 

Again; at no time did I suggest nobody else should like the show, or that your enjoyment of the show is wrong. I said *I* don't like the show, and even gave reasons. So... yeah... I don't know why you're arguing either.","1393632816"

&gt;&gt; [...] but I suspect that ""heterosexual"" would just come to mean ""attracted to females presenting as women"", the change would be cosmetic with regards to sexuality.

&gt; I'm curious if heterosexual men would be attracted to [this dude](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5Tt1v0axA5c/Tx75LY7L-gI/AAAAAAAAEQM/OzthM_0vl0o/s1600/01.jpg)

&gt; Whos a trans man. I mean by your definition they're really a woman, so a heterosexual man should be attracted right?

No, that's not how I think sexuality, gender and sex interact presently. I think heterosexual man would code him as a man. Homosexual men would potentially have a similar issue with him as heterosexual men have with transwomen.


&gt;&gt; Based on faulty, but reasonable assumptions

&gt; What faulty assumptions? That they found me attractive?
 [...]
&gt; So having sex with a trans woman is rape? you're missing the defining characteristics of rape, non-consent.

No, I very clearly stated that I didn't think that transsexuality is in any way analogous to criminality, but you also enlarged the context here from ""dating someone"" or ""being attracted to someone"" to ""having sex with someone"". I don't think that even sex between a transsexual person and another person would constitute rape by deception (of said other person) in principle, but rape by deception as a concept in law and ethics exists. Minksy, for example, raped women by convincing them of the need to have sex with an alleged witness to a crime (Minksy) a loved one had committed to ensure said loved one's freedom. There are less clear cases, such as the Palestinian man convicted of rape by deception of an Israeli woman who was under the mistaken impression that he was Israeli also. 

I *personally* wouldn't consider sex by deception via undisclosed transsexuality rape, nor sex by deception via undisclosed ethnicity, but sex by deception via stated non-transsexuality or stated wrong ethnicity is a grey area. I haven't in detail thought about that. Minsky's case is clear to me, because there's an additional element of coercion.

I don't think commenting on all the specific responses is useful for the rest, so let's just work from this:

&gt; Again I think its your misconception that Transwomen like myself aren't really women and instead are men dressed and acting like woman and I just really disagree with that.

You are making this personally about me, which is unnecessary. I don't know what my ""feelings"" on the issue would be because I've never been in the position of having dated a transwoman. What I am arguing is different.

Why are there transwomen? I don't mean ""what is the biological reason for transsexuality"", but rather: why isn't there a third or fourth kind of gender in our culture that applies to transsexual people? The reason why there are transwoman is that, as a culture, we conceive of some essential relationship between ""woman"" and ""female"", and ""man"" and ""male"", so that a person who is born as ""male"", but identifies as ""female"", often will perform a ""woman"" role. 

""Maleness"" and ""femaleness"" as our culture understands the terms aren't directly modeled by a strict biological understanding of the terms, I will for the sake of simplicity work with two properties, sex organs (major) and some inherent quality of having or lacking an Y chromosome (minor). There are people with Swyer syndrome, or other forms of intersexuality, but we are working in generalities here.

If this essential relationship didn't exist (within the conception of gender the culture has), transsexuality would be a complete non-sequitur. If ""man"" just were a term for ""person who burps a lot and likes spaghetti"", and ""woman"" just meant ""likes potpurri and knitting"", then there would be no reason at all for a person born with any sex to perform either role, they'd just do whatever they do and be called ""man"" or ""woman"", respectively. The whole problem is based on this intrinsic or essential link between these concepts. 

If what I said above isn't completely off-base, then this is where the ""deception"" comes in: By performing a ""woman""-role, a person implicitly signals ""female"". You don't perform the ""woman"" role for shits and giggles, you perform it because it signals ""female"", which is what you identify as. In this way, you ""deceive"" someone working from within this cultural model into assuming that you are female, which in this model you are not, but both ""woman-ness"" and ""female-ness"" are on their own necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for persistent attraction and (to come back to the initial topic) informed consent. 

A transwoman who has gone through SRS fulfils the major criterion of the criteria I suggested above, and I would be willing to bet that a transwoman who has female genitalia has an easier time dating heterosexual men than a transwoman who retains male or ambiguous genitalia. 

Lastly, just to briefly address the point about identity: Just like ""maleness"" and ""man-ness"" are intrinsically linked, so are sexuality and identity. A cisman who finds himself attracted to a transwoman can have trouble reconciling his sexuality with his attraction to her because of the aforementioned cultural link between womanhood and female-ness, and the further link between the totality of both with heterosexuality (for a heterosexual man) or homosexuality (for a homosexual woman) execerbates the issue. You aren't responsible for their attraction, but you are responsible for acting on that attraction that is based on a lack of or mistakenly considered truthful information to some degree. 

Lastly lastly, uglyness or ugly boobs or an ugly nutsack (or what have you) isn't tied strongly into gender and sex. A woman with ugly boobs is still a woman (and female) under this model, as is a woman with no boobs (for whatever reason). 

I personally think of transwomen as women. I suspect that I would not be very troubled by a transwoman after SRS, and that I would be troubled by a transwoman who chooses to retain her birth genitalia or hasn't yet undergone SRS, but I don't know that I would necessarily be disgusted or something like that. I'd like to believe that I'm sufficiently sure about myself that I wouldn't question my identity as a result, but I think that I would feel deceived in a way, because I still consider that information necessary to make a meaningful decision and have agency. That just so that we don't have to make further assumptions about me.","1393632817"

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","If you are poor, really poor, moving is not easy. It's incredibly difficult, and most neighborhoods are just out of the picture. You have very, very few places to go. Take NYC: there used to be tons of neighborhoods considered poor or at least lower middle class. Now, you have to be wealthy to live in Manhattan. Most neighborhoods in Brooklyn are wealthy or well-off, and the poor ones are riddled with crime. Queens falls in the middle, with some nice neighborhoods that are not too expensive, but many are in the middle of being gentrified. Staten Island is too inconvenient for poor families working many jobs. What's left? The Bronx, which is the worst of the boroughs. Many of the neighborhoods are dangerous. I had friends who went to college in the Bronx, and you literally couldn't go more than 4 blocks off campus without being in danger. Students were regularly mugged and beaten up. The Bronx is not a nice place to live, most places are not a nice place to raise a family. 

So if you lived in Harlem for 60 years and suddenly are being squeezed out by gentrification, it's not simply ""oh move someplace else!"" Moving easily is a luxury that not many people realize. Move your family into a house/apartment with the same rent, and it is probably in a dangerous neighborhood. You literally have to put your family at risk because of the ""nice things"" being added to your old neighborhood.

Now, I do not think gentrification is a totally bad thing. The place I live in, in Queens, has been... kind of gentrified. It's a lot better than it was 20 years ago, at least. And I benefit from that. But in the past 2 years, the people in my building have slowly turned from poor families with lots of kids to couples in the middle class range. It sucks for the poor families. I wonder, where do they go? 30 blocks down, where the crime rates are a lot higher? To bad neighborhoods in Brooklyn? Rich people benefit from gentrification, the poor do not. So, it's good and bad, black and white. You just can't say ""ahh those poor people should move, it's so easy, gentrification is great.""

Think about this. If all content you're ever going to see on a phone is sRGB why must Sony / Samsung go out and talk about wider than sRGB colour gamuts? Progress? Maybe. But then the user should have an option to constrain the gamut to sRGB at will. Current mainstream media does not require anything higher than sRGB and these wide gamuts being advertised are just marketing ploys. An accurate display would be within sRGB and if it's capable of more, it should have a user-accessible toggle to go beyond sRGB.","1393632822"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Weed has the strongest natural plant fiber. It produces about 2/3 more organic material per square-meter than an average temperated conifer or leaf tree, it grows much faster than any commercial plant and that nearly everywhere and does not require any sort of vaccination, or pesticides (unlike cotton f.ex, THC says hello). You can gain truly healthy and vitalizing oil out of it, you can make bio diesel and the fiber can, in composition with minor chemicals replace many synthetic plastic products. 

Even countries that allow legal use of hemp in the Industry (I'll take Germany as an example since I had my thesis about the use there) is heavily restricted by regulations and tight laws that make commercial use in comparison to other branches unprofitable and impend it's propagation. The value of the plant itself is UNDENIABLE and it was a major resource in most countries around the globe up to the last century.

The medical properties of THC and CBA are still to be properly studied, yet many already saw the great potential in those.

The implications are far bigger than you might imagine. I'll give you a little example and this only for cotton, weed could harm most major established resources, even the oil lobby:

Weed requires less water, less nutrients and no pesticides to deliver more fiber than cotton. This does not harm only the cotton industry itself due to a higher quality product but also limits it's profit, because of the reduced costs from water spending and nutrients (another industry that would feel the repercussions) for weed. Last but not least, it would put chemical producers effectively out of business in this sector, since THC acts as a natural pesticide and it's HIGHLY effective.","1393632830"

She could hear the doctor screaming in furry jealousy and the squishy laughter that only the master could accomplish.  Donna ran outside where she skipped the doctor and the master in pretty combat over a blue sonic screwdriver! She asked them what they were doing but the doctor just ran incredibly around the master and seized the screwdriver! The master, unable to control his rage brought about his dog of seductively Oods. Shocked, the doc rushed the sonic screw driver, unfortunately giving k9 a chance to sing away with it. Infuriated the master sent his brown ood army after the red dog. Donna was currently flying behind the tv. Meanwhile, K9 was drowning the Oods, who seemed to be under some kind of radio sweet which impaired their ability to walk. Finally catching up to k9, the doc tried his best to win a green tug of war with the hard robotic dog, who thought the screw driver was some sort of car and wanted to bury it.  As purple as the doc is, k9 is yellow and won the epic battle for the ultimate screwdriver, leaving the doc and the master to paint rock paper scissors over the freedom of the ood army.

That said, this site is obviously trying to emphasize the ""weird"" parts of these gods.  Pan was known for much more than just a sexual appetite and becoming a herd - but that's all the site really talks about.  He's a nature god who's also got the Pan flute to his name.  On top of that, he's got quite a few myths where he helped out in some way non-sexual.

I mean look at Loki and Dionysus.  They've got the mare story in there, and basically nothing but Dionysus' domain over ritual madness - not, you know, alcohol and partying which is a large part of what he does.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","This is a rough situation you describe, no doubt :(  It's really good that you are seeking therapy asap... rape, panic disorder, food disorders and young children are all enough to throw anybody's life into chaos by themselves.  Correcting any one of these will require significant coping with all of the others in the meantime, and professional help might be the only realistic way for that to happen in a reasonable way.  What is the timeline for you being able to get that kind of help?

As for temporary solutions, the best thing I know for something like this is to pick one tiny thing at a time and focus on it.  If it is possible at all to make progress on the food, I think that is where I would start.  In addition to ""all of the risks"", not eating removes your ability to fix the problems you want to fix in any reasonable way.  When your brain doesn't have fuel, it doesn't have the luxury of realistically assessing your current threat level, so to save energy it just defaults either to reckless abandon or paralyzing fear, with nothing in between which is usually where you want to be.  It also doesn't have the capacity to make the decisions and painful tradeoffs that are going to be necessary to overcome the regular day to day problems, much less the big ones you are currently facing.

I always hate to ask for additional information in this subreddit because I know discussing your personal situation is uncomfortable for you and it's not any of my business besides.  To be able to realistically help with the food situation though, I think it's necessary here to understand what the specific barriers are that need to be addressed.  In particular, is the problem primarily (lack of access to food / lack of appetite / ability to use the kitchen / ability to get out and obtain food due to general anxiety / etc)? Maybe the most direct and least invasive way to phrase this question is this: if you were to go get something to eat and eat it right now, what is the first thing that you run into trouble with that prevents you from doing so?  If you would like, I would propose starting there and coming up with a strategy that will get you moving in the right direction on food.  I'd also be ok starting with something else or just talking if you need somebody to talk to, I would like to help if I can.","1393632837"

The TMBackup user just has Time Machine and File Sharing as allowed services.  Now on the Time Machine share that the service creates - I give the TMBackup user ""Full Control"", while removing all other permissions except for spotlight.  So now the only user that can even see that share is the TMBackup, and this user can ONLY see the Time Machine share.  Yes, whomever knows this username and password can access the Time Machine backups.  However people won't really think about using this as a user to connect to the server, but only as ""The password I use when Time Machine asks for a password"".  I have this setup at quite a few clients and haven't run into any issues with people trying to get into other users Time Machine backups. ","1393632838"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; The M0 money supply is about 3.7 trillion dollars. The GNP for 2013 was 15.9 trillion dollars. What enables this is money moving around.

So you prove moving money around is good by showing me how much money we move around? That isn't an argument.

Would a country with a GNP of 5 trillion be a worse economy then the 15.9 trillion one if the amount of products produced was the same, but the cost was 1/3rd?

&gt;  So yes, money moving around is good.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In short, effective and economically feasible [carbon capture and sequestration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm4dHLflK08), which retrieves carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere and stores them in liquid or solid form, preventing them from making worse the effects of climate change due to the burning of fossil fuels. This would save us from ourselves.

To elaborate, since the world's leading industrial nations have failed to rally public support for greenhouse gas reduction strategies and investment in renewable energy infrastructure, in exchange for short-term economic growth and the political advantage that comes with it, it seems like this technology is the only thing that's going to save humankind from the worst effects of extreme climatic instability once the average annual global temperature reaches 4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.

*Trillions* of dollars will be spent within this century as large-scale droughts, like in 2012, and extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Sandy, continue to cause water crises, food shortages, and major infrastructural damage. An infinitesimally small fraction of that amount would be needed in order to reduce overall fossil fuel consumption, revert cities to localized consumption (especially in the agriculture sector), rapidly convert the world's fossil fuel energy infrastructure into one that receives most of its power from renewable sources. However, these suggestions are economically unfavourable in the short term (and *only* in the short term, since we will pay exponentially more in the long run for inaction), so politicians who try to run on these strategies don't get voted into office. 

This is especially true since oil, gas, and coal extraction companies and associations have multi-billion dollar budgets to lobby and fund the election campaigns of politicians who will vote in favour of bills that further their ability to make profits, and against those that don't. If this money was instead spent on research, development, and implementation of carbon capture and sequestration, we would be much farther along the road to having effective technology for this end. But then again, if they did this, then the American Congress and Canadian Parliament would already have implemented a carbon tax and/or cap and trade system that would reduce their profits, so it's also against their best interest to divert the majority of their political expenses to sequestration R&amp;D rather than lobbying and campaign funding.

Also, since wind/wave/solar power don't always align with peak energy use, for the sake of supplying power to the energy grid, and battery storage is prohibitively expensive on a large scale, fossil fuels would continue to be needed to balance supply to ensure capacity for times of high demand. Therefore, along with the above strategies of overall consumption reduction and energy infrastructure replacement, sequestration would still be necessary in order for us to continue burning some fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable in times of high demand.

**tl;dr: In the next 100 years, the US and other major industrial powers would save trillions of dollars by inventing technology that would retrieve carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and avoid the worst effects of climate change.**","1393632839"

How is this chicklit? It's about Irish bros, sorta.

Anyway, there's some stuff working here and some stuff that's not working so well.

You got some good characters, though they can use some fleshing out. Red has a lot of style points, but there's probably something more going on. Martin is your everyman, but needs some complications. Rosie doesn't have enough page-time to establish herself (and why does she leave the pub right as the band starts up? Why make Martin ask her out for drinks if they're already out for drinks?).

The situation on the platform is a bit unbelievable, but if you make it more ridiculous, I might buy it. He's supposed to be having a bad day, so make it a worse day. It's one thing to get called a pervert by a lady when you bump into her, another thing when her boyfriend really does show up and chase you, or when she takes a picture of you with her phone and threatens to call the police or a station attendant, or when Martin *still* steps in the shit despite trying to avoid it. Take it up a notch -- you're already looking at the starts to begin with, and this chapter is so anecdotal that it needs something to push the conflict.

The prose is pretty good. I'm not wowed by the writing or anything, but it fits Martin. It's a pretty close third person PoV, but you lose it once Martin gets to the pub and I felt ousted from Martin's narrative.

Your dialogue is not punctuated at all correctly. Here's a style sheet I made for a client.

&gt; ""I don't want to go,"" Jono said. ""I want to stay with my friends!""

Note the comma in the first set of quotes. If you're going to use an attributive (said, exclaimed, etc), you'll want to use a comma and not a full-stop.

&gt; ""I don't want to go."" Jono crossed his arms and pouted. ""I want to stay with my friends!""

In this version, the full-stop is correct because there's no attributive. We know Jono said the words because its his paragraph and so an attributive isn't needed.

&gt; ""Well,"" Jono said, crossing his arms and pouting, ""I don't want to go. I want to stay with my friends!""

Also an acceptable structure because the word in the first set of quotes is in the same sentence as the first part of the second set of quotes. However . . .

&gt; ""I don't want to go,"" Jono said, ""I want to stay with my friends!""

This DOESN'T work because both sets of quotes are independent clauses. A full-stop is necessary after 'said'.

""I don't,"" Jono crossed his arms and pouted, "" want to go. I want to stay with my friends!""

This also DOESN'T work and is a construction I've been seeing too much recently. If you want to have a character perform an action in the middle of speaking, use an em dash or even ellipses.

&gt; ""I don't--"" Jono crossed his arms and pouted. ""--want to go. I want to stay with my friends!"" or ""I don't . . ."" Jono crossed his arms and pouted. "". . . want to go. I want to stay with my friends!""

Also, don't use semicolons in dialogue. A colon, comma, or period will do just as well. Save the semicolons for when you absolutely need them in your narrative.

Remember that if a character is interrupted in their speech (cutoff by another character, by the sudden inability to speak, or by any other happenings), you should use a dash to show it. Use ellipses when you want to show trailing off of information. 

The formatting I use for ellipses is three periods separated by spaces to indicate trailing off and just three periods to indicate omitted information. ""I don't think this is such a good idea . . ."" for trailing off. If a character were listening through, let's say, a wall on a conversation and only picked up half of the dialogue, it would look like this: ""I don't think this is such a good idea...and she'll be upset by...But we cannot afford to make such a mistake.""

Finally, be careful about some of the attributives you use as not all of them actually work to describe someone talking.

"ideasfortheadmins","t5_2qqhi","&gt; You're using two defaults that have very specific guidelines and no moderation problems in your example

Ah, so you'd like some random subjective change to defaults.  Care to share your proposal?  This is /r/ideasfortheadmins, after all.  How about we change the moderators of the subreddits that /u/dni personally has a grudge against?

&gt;you seem to be the master of bad analogies

It wasn't an analogy.  You said 'defaults', I named some defaults.  You shouldn't get upset with me that you black and white statement has plenty of gray room.  :)

&gt;If you don't want reddit supplied mods you could simply decline being a default.

'reddit supplied mods' in case you've never noticed the admins have no interest in curating reddit.

&gt; If you want to benefit from default status however the subs should be held to a higher standard.

EarthPorn and askscience have very high standards.  As I've just said.

&gt;They've chosen these subs and their mod teams to be on the frontpage of all non member pageviews and to be the first subscriptions of all new users.

So your proposal is that the admins start stealing popular subs and installing reddit, Inc employees?  That'll work out swell. ","1393632843"

Watch the Anthony Bourdain episode in Haiti. He meets with Penn who takes him around and explains his view on the situation.   

Edit: In fact, my best friend, who lives far away now, arrived on a plane a few hours after me, and always joked that he knew Sean Penn, whom he loved.  There was a band that was playing music when I arrived, in tshirts and hats provided by a cellphone company—it was a humorous and ironic sight, when put into its context.  Except Darjan passed the band later, and when he was going through that part of the airport Sean Penn was going the other direction.  They *passed* by.  Upon further questioning it would always be revealed that they had not even crossed eye paths.  He would whip his head around, mimicking the motion he made to see Sean Penn, but always smiling like a fucking little child would while acting out their stories.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","The best strategy for archiving film is using our modern, polyester film stocks.  The time limit on those babies is theoretically a couple thousand years.  You usually don't want to 're-archive,' but you can certainly use your archived materials to make new digital masters for BluRay, 4K, 8K, etc methods of distribution.  So we already have our holy grail, in a way, but it is becoming increasingly hard as film production ramps down and Kodak starts to get slower.

Digital archives would need to be human readable (or at least constantly updating formats) and stable in order to be as archivable as film is.  Now, we can already do some of this, but it requires a lot of manpower and electricity.  A proper digital archive is constantly backing up itself.  IT are constantly replacing hard drives and updating formats.  The required time, energy, and expense of this is astronomically higher than making a film negative and storing it in a salt mine.

Now, we can also think of potential future technologies.  Stable digital storage maybe?  Evolving file structures that are self-updating maybe?","1393632843"

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Could you please try to determine where your breasts end under the arms? Stand naked in front of a mirror and try to feel for breast tissue under your arms. Bow forward, hold your breasts in your hands, push them around a bit. Mark the end with eyeliner or lipstick and then compare with the imprints the wires give you. 

I ask bc I think the wires are a touch too narrow for you.

With well-fitting wires that sit next to the breasttissue but not on it, you get a push-up effect from the wires. The wires gather your tissue and push it forward. 

If the wires are too narrow, your breasts cannot get properly into the cup - the cup looks too large and gaps while being too small at the same time.

Aside from the potentially too narrow wires the two bras look good. The small gap you get at the top is normal with padded bras. Because the cups are stiff, they cannot align with your skin perfectly. 

If the wires are really too narrow, you can try to exchange the wires for slightly wider ones. New wires are cheap, you can get them for a few cents from bra makers supply online shops or use wires from an old bra. This should also improve the shape of the dark pink and beige bra and reduce the gapping. 

BTW - padded in this sub means a thin layer of foam, similar to VS' idea of ""lightly lined"". If the bra is well-constructed, the shape of the bra will do all the work of gently pushing your breasts front and center. With a quality bra, you don't need massive push-up pads inside the bra.  

Other bras for you to look at would be the Natori Feathers and the Just Peachy padded bras from figleaves.

On days that I don't shampoo, I use a cleansing conditioner on just my bangs and put some kind of cheap, crappy conditioner in the rest of my hair. I rinse everything out right before I wash my face and get out of the shower. The Loreal sulfate-free line makes a cleansing conditioner that works pretty well for me, but there is also a RenPure one, which I got from Walgreens, that I also like (it's pomegranate scented). 

Also, I normally try to use some kind of thick hair masque after I shampoo (Shea Moisture makes good ones), as I feel like this helps. I glop it on really thick and keep it in all through my shower. For regular conditioner, I had really good results with the Trader Joe's Nourish Spa conditioner; I used this as a co-wash or just as regular conditioner on days that I didn't shampoo.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Here's the thing: integrated bluetooth helmets suck.  If either component shits itself, you have to replace both.  You're far better off with an aftermarket bluetooth rig.

As for audio, ear buds (this kind: http://obrienmedia.com/media/2009/02/earbuds.jpg and cheap) are my preferred style because they do a damned good job of shutting out road noise while channeling audio directly into your ears.  I wear them even without audio because they do a great job of blocking noise.

In-helmet speakers have to blast audio over ambient noise which further damages your hearing.  I invariably replace my bluetooth/audio device's in-helmet speakers (as applicable) with ear buds as soon as I get them.

The answer I gave you, while very short, is the right one.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","It does not show the turnout among Baby Boomers.  Therefore you cannot claim that it proves a majority of Baby Boomers voted for Reagan.  Not voting cannot be interpreted as actually voting for Reagan.

If you want to assume that the turnout for the election overall correlates with the Baby Boomers, that would be about 52%, which would mean that not even a plurarity of Baby Boomers voted for Reagan.  Obviously that is an unfounded assumption, as the turnout among that population could vary considerably, but I am not making an assertion of proof.

You are, but your produced data does not show it.

&gt;But, as OP showed in response to my earlier comment with statistics, a (not huge) majority boomers actually did vote Reagan into office.

Since the population of Baby Boomers is some 70-80 million, for a majority of Baby Boomers to have actually voted Reagan into office, you would have to assume they made up nearly all of the electorate which would be hard to believe.","1393632849"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beached_whale#Sonar)

&gt; There is anecdotal evidence that active sonar leads to beaching. On some occasions whales have stranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area,[10] suggesting a link. Theories describing how sonar may cause whale deaths have also been advanced after necropsies found internal injuries in stranded whales. In contrast, whales stranded due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy prior to beaching:
The low frequency active sonar (LFA sonar) used by the military to detect submarines is the loudest sound ever put into the seas. Yet the U.S. Navy is planning to deploy LFA sonar across 80 percent of the world ocean. At an amplitude of two hundred forty decibels, it is loud enough to kill whales and dolphins and already causing mass strandings and deaths in areas where U.S. and/or NATO forces are conducting exercises.
—Julia Whitty, The Fragile Edge[11]
The large and rapid pressure changes made by loud sonar can cause hemorrhaging. Evidence emerged after 17 cetaceans hauled out in the Bahamas in March 2000 following a United States Navy sonar exercise. The Navy accepted blame[12] agreeing that the dead whales experienced acoustically-induced hemorrhages around the ears. The resulting disorientation probably led to the stranding. Ken Balcomb, a whale zoologist, specializes in the killer whale populations that inhabit the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Washington and Vancouver Island.[13] He investigated these beachings and argues that the powerful sonar pulses resonated with airspaces in the whales, tearing tissue around the ears and brain.[14] Apparently not all species are affected by SONAR.[15]
Another means by which sonar could be hurting whales is a form of decompression sickness. This was first raised by necrological examinations of 14 beaked whales stranded in the Canary Islands. The stranding happened on 24 September 2002, close to the operating area of Neo Tapon (an international naval exercise) about four hours after the activation of mid-frequency sonar.[16] The team of scientists found acute tissue damage from gas-bubble lesions, which are indicative of decompression sickness.[16] The precise mechanism of how sonar causes bubble formation is not known. It could be due to whales panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt to escape the sonar pulses. There is also a theoretical basis by which sonar vibrations can cause supersaturated gas to nucleate to form bubbles.[17]
The overwhelming majority of the whales involved in sonar-associated beachings are Cuvier's Beaked Whales (Ziphius cavirostrus). This species strands frequently, but mass strandings are rare. They are so difficult to study in the wild that prior to the interest raised by the SONAR controversy, most of the information about them came from stranded animals. The first to publish research linking beachings with naval activity were Simmonds and Lopez-Jurado in 1991. They noted that over the past decade there had been a number of mass strandings of beaked whales in the Canary Islands, and each time the Spanish Navy was conducting exercises. Conversely, there were no mass strandings at other times. They did not propose a theory for the strandings. A letter to Nature by Fernández et al. in 2013 reported that there had been no further mass strandings in that area following a 2004 ban by the Spanish government on military exercises in that region.[18]
In May 1996 there was another mass stranding in West Peloponnese, Greece. At the time it was noted as ""atypical"" both because mass strandings of beaked whales are rare, and also because the stranded whales were spread over such a long stretch of coast with each individual whale spacially separated from the next stranding. At the time of the incident there was no connection made with active SONAR, the marine biologist investigating the incident, Dr. Frantzis, made the connection to SONAR because of a Notice to Mariners he discovered about the test. His scientific correspondence in Nature titled ""Does acoustic testing strand whales?""[19] was published in March 1998.
Dr. Peter Tyack, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, has been researching noise's effects on marine mammals since the 1970s. He has led much of the recent research on beaked whales (and Cuvier's beaked whales in particular). Data tags have shown that Cuvier's dive considerably deeper than previously thought, and are in fact the deepest diving species of marine mammal. Their surfacing behavior is highly unusual because they exert considerable physical effort to surface in a controlled ascent, rather than simply floating to the surface like sperm whales. Deep dives are followed by three or four shallow dives. Vocalization stops at shallow depths, because of fear of predators or because they don't need vocalization to stay together at depths where there is sufficient light to see each other. The elaborate dive patterns are assumed to be necessary to control the diffusion of gases in the bloodstream. No data show a beaked whale making an uncontrolled ascent or failing to do successive shallow dives.
The whales may interpret the unfamiliar sound of sonar as a predator and change its behavior in a dangerous way. This last theory would make mitigation particularly difficult since the sound levels themselves are not physically damaging, but only cause fear. The damage mechanism would not be the sound.","1393632850"

It is obvious. Unhealthy love promotes the false self and stunts growth. It is a drug.


Healthy love is a choice. It is something you decide to give as a gift. It has conditions that shape the self and strengthen the other. Healthy love is feeling powerful and independent. It is grilled cheese and vegetable soup on a rainy day but not every day. Healthy love is patient, kind and accepting.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I agree with your points in general aside from never understanding one another. A huge part of being intelligent sapients is that we don't have to experience something to understand it. Its what makes our languages of words and voices and facial/body expressions so extremely powerful, far more than bee dances, bird calls, scent markers, or whatever else.

Just from your experience, along with other rape stories I've heard, I understand a lot of the fear and confusion and embarrassment and hate they had, without ever having been raped myself. Obviously, I'll get a more personal in-depth look if it does happen to me, but its not NEEDED to understand that experience.

Its the same thing with men and women. We don't need to physically be the other to know what is going on with their minds in at least a general sense. The conflict only comes when judges and other lawmakers fail to fully understand the complex implications of what they do, especially while either being unfocused and apathetic to making those laws, or being emotional and biased in seeing only one viewpoint.

If we had to be that victim to understand them, then the U.S. Civil War would have never happened. Despite still being very culturally used to negros as second-class, even the Northern U.S. understood the logic of using them as slaves with arms and legs cut off, black men working 14 hours a day and black women being impregnated against their will. It was only the apathy and wealth they got that had the South not give a damn about what they were doing to slaves.

We don't need to be slaves or men or women or rape victims to understand that the shit that happens to them is bad. The hard part is specifically how to bring peace and tolerance and justice to it all. Just like any regulation, it gets complicated, even if the purpose is in goodwill.","1393632856"

If you're strangling yourself and you're using your phone, try putting the phone in your pocket when you sleep. If that isn't uncomfortable, then it'd fix any possible strangulation

As far as fixing the need for ASMR for sleep, I had the same thing. I weaned myself off by listening to rain noises. Didn't cause ASMR but it's way better than silence.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I don't have a great link, but if you click your link again, click ""all time"" then click logarithmic you'll see flat slightly downward sloping area in the graph, because it's log form a slight drop is actually quite significant (mouse over for values).

So difficulty retargeting happens every 2016 blocks in Bitcoin. If the hashrate drops to 50%, the shares of blocks you will find will effective double, so there's still some incentive to continue mining. In fact, now that we have dedicated hardware that pretty much can only be used for mining, you pretty much have a sunk cost of the initial investment plus the ongoing cost of the electricity. Since there is no other big altcoins that use SHA-256 there is no place to move the hashrate (as long as it pays back better than the cost of electricity).

What would likely happen in the case of a major hashrate disturbance (EMP, war, internet being eliminated in a high population area, etc.) is that a hard-fork with a more frequent difficulty recalculation would come about. (or later developments that more fluidly adjust difficulty Edit: see secret_bitcoin_logins comment regarding the Gravity Well solution).

Romantic relationships are hard for a Christian because of a growing desire to show physical affection for one another.

For one to be able to succeed with a pure life (until marriage) one of two things have to happen in the relationship: a commitment to exhorting one another to purity and protecting one another or breaking up and finding someone who will.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was with my girlfriend at the time and we had previously experimented with oral sex in my dark crawlspace, now we were looking for the real deal. A few weeks beforehand while we were finger-banging in some guys tree house she had whispered in my ear, ""Do you have a condom?"". I confronted her later and she deflected the question. Anyways come to the day of, we are both virgins, I am fingering her, she is pulling on my cock and we get into the missionary position. I try putting it in her and I can't. It is like trying to squeeze my penis into a beer bottle and feels like I might break it, or her, if I push too hard. So at this point I say to her, ""Come on put it in there!"" and she responds by saying ""I don't know how to!"" After a few minutes of frustration we give up and finish each other with our hands. The next day she is over and I try a condom and with a stronger pusher it slides inside to her pained gasp. And that was that.

You sure weren't happy in the relationship, but he seemed have been and while he wasn't the best boyfriend for you (not very attentive and caring) he wasn't a ""bad"" boyfriend. you both were just incompatible. He is not abusive or mean to you, just not offering the kind of relationship you long for. Maybe he does need a closure on your relationship, and an explanation.

However, if you already told him your reasons, then it is completely up to you to keep in touch or not (and it seems like you handle better cutting off contact, which he has to respect)","1393632864"

A part of the ""less dense"" thing is that it expands MUCH more when wet. It's really cool! I'd say it's worth it, if you have the means. However, if your budget is a bit tighter, I hear the Real Techniques dupe is better than many.

Also, a quick cost-saving tip: Instead of buying a BB brand cleanser (which a lot of people say is the only way to go), I clean my Beauty Blender with an old face cleanser that was a bit to drying on my face. (CeraVe Foaming Cleanser). It works like a dream. I've had this Beauty Blender for 8 months and there isn't a stain on it. ","1393632868"

"PremierLeague","t5_2scup","When ever I try to introduce soccer to someone this always tends to be a sticking point. As an American, I think we are used to the way the big sports in our country work (Football, Baseball, and Basketball).

In those sports the teams are all part of a league. To join the league you have to get approval from the league and then even though you have your own team, you are still under the control of the league. Most American sports teams are just franchises. In the same way that I can't just go make my own Pizza Hut without approval, I can't got make my own NFL team without their approval. 

Soccer teams are different. They are their own separate entities that are not under control of any governing body.  If I want to start my own soccer team, I can go down to the bar, get a group of people and go register a soccer team. This is because in most soccer competitions, there are just a set of rules, and if you comply with all of them, then you can enter.

Before I go any further I'll give an scenario that I hope clarifies what I've said so far. Lets say, I'm now the owner of the Buffalo Bills and Chelsea FC. I get really really drunk one night and order my accounts to break every financial rule they can think of for each club. In the NFL, because the club is a franchise, they could completely disband the club if they wanted as punishment, where as in the Premier League, the most they could do is kick me out of the competition.

So back to the difference between the cups.

Because these soccer teams aren't really under anyone's authority, there isn't one single organization who is in charge of making leagues and tournaments. This basically means anyone who wants to make a tournament, can, and they can invite who ever they want.

So again, let's say you and I start a tournament that we are going to host in my back yard and invite all the top clubs in the world. No one will show up. Not because they aren't allowed to, but because financially it doesn't make sense.

Now lets say Bill Gates decides he's going to host the Microsoft Cup and puts up a billion dollars to the winner. Again he invites all the major clubs and they all show up. This time everybody does, because each club has looked at it on their own and decided this time it's worth it to go play. If you were to try something like this with NFL teams, they would not be able to because they are under control of the NFL.

Now, back to your question.

The FA and UEFA are groups that set up competitions. They are separate from each other, but basically do the same thing. The FA is England only, so one of their requirements for entry is you must be an English team (although each country has their own FA) while UEFA covers all of Europe.

The FA sets up 3 major compeitions each year (That premier league teams can enter). The FA Cup, The League Cup (Currently sponsored by Capital One), and the Premier League. While UEFA hosts two major competitions a year, the Champion's League and the Europa League.

Since you seem to be following the Premier League well focus on the FA.

Each of these competitions happen independently of each other. In every competition the teams all start at an equal point and based on how the rules are set a winner is chosen.

So while Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League, they already lost and got knocked out of the Capital One Cup. The cup isn't tied to the Premier League, but rather a separate entity.

In fact, last year's winners of the League Cup (Wigan) actually got knocked out of the Premier League (Relagated).

Hope that helps, I'm pretty sure I rambled a bit.

PS. I know there are probably a lot of rules and regulations I missed when talking about competitions clubs can and can't enter, but this was just a simplified way to explain it all.","1393632868"

SEC champ will be in for sure, leaving one remaining spot for either the big12 champ, a second SEC team, or the pac12 champ.  I think it's unlikely that both the big12 champ and the second place SEC team have 2+ losses, so the pac12 gets shut out.","1393632869"

In fact I'm a little astounded you could even suggest there hasn't been.

You should re-read my reply. It should be pretty clear that I'm saying one significant failure does not destroy an ecosystem, but pushes markets to create solutions. Bitquick has already implemented an API to prove that it has all the coins it needs for each transaction for example.

Other exchanges patched for transaction malleability instantly after Gox blamed their problems on it. Other exchanges already accounted for the problem. Such exchanges have grown since (the market moved). They are just fine.

Gox failed to rectify it's business issues. It went bankrupt. People who didn't pay attention to those problems and stuck with Gox when they could have left lost those coins. This is a free market and all players in it bear responsibility for their actions.","1393632871"

Don't buy the STEM hype.

Your degree is not useless. It may not be the ticket to immediate gratification that you'd hoped, but no college degree is. Some are more marketable under the right conditions, but whether or not those right conditions could or do apply to you is anyone's guess. If you're really that beat up about it, go to trade school. But chances are with any other degree, you'd be feeling just as lost - it's the planning that makes for a future, not the degree.

Don't kid yourself that there's no way to pay him back. Of course you can. You could easily dedicated the rest of your life to amassing the actual money to pay him back, with interest.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I literally just said about the Soviet-Japanese war ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War_(1945) ) , do you need much more proof? Also the reason why no-one disputes the leaflet drops is because there is no proof that they didn't drop them, nor is there proof that they did, so its human nature to just assume that they did. 

Also it was not only the US in the Pacific, multiple smaller countries each played their part too, it certainly was not only the US.

Going back to what you said earlier where you said that Japan 'deserved what they got', you're telling me that a 'surprise' attack that wasn't entirely a surprise at all. An attack which killed 2400 troops and 48-68 civilians, 48-68 civilians. Is worth the killing of 150,000-246,000 people in Japan? 

I'm half US American, and I personally hated the way that I was educated where it was all 'America is the best!' yet when you actually do some research its nothing like that at all.

I love how whenever you mention the Vietnam war to an American they go all quiet and avoid the conversation.","1393632880"

They sneak in foodeven though it could probably kill them (diabetic but still eats candy), demand more food when they are on a restricted diet (because heart attacks don't real) and go through withdrawal when they aren't given a twinkie fix every 15 minutes.  Like like dealing with any type of addict, it is extremely exhausting. 

These assholes have eaten themselves into disability but want others to pay the price.  When you can't get a fucking x-ray it's time to reevaluate your life and understand your weight is going to greatly impact your quality of life.

My mother deals with piss, shit, vomit, bodily fluids, fists, kicks, infected needles, angry/enabling families and fucking assholes on a daily basis.  Yes, some not nice things are said but usually not to the patients face and it's usually cathartic to the nurses and doctors.   ","1393632883"

 [**Charlton Automatic Rifle**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton%20Automatic%20Rifle): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Charlton Automatic Rifle** was a fully automatic conversion of the [Lee-Enfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Enfield) rifle, designed by [New Zealander](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand) Philip Charlton in 1941 to act as a substitute for the [Bren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bren) and [Lewis gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_gun) [light machine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_machine_gun) which were in chronically short supply at the time.

&gt;The original Charlton Automatic Rifles were converted from obsolete [Lee-Metford](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee-Metford) and Magazine Lee-Enfield rifles dating from as early as the [Boer War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War),  and were intended for use as a [semi-automatic rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_rifle) with the full-automatic capability retained for emergency use.  It used the 10-round Lee-Enfield magazines and modified 30-round Bren magazines.

&gt;There were two versions of the Charlton: the New Zealand version, as designed and manufactured by Charlton Motor Workshops in [Hastings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hastings,_New_Zealand), and a version produced in [Australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia) by [Electrolux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolux), using the SMLE Mk III* for conversion.  The two designs differed markedly in external appearance (amongst other things, the New Zealand Charlton had a forward pistol grip and [bipod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipod),  whilst the Australian lacked this making it lighter and cleaner in appearance,  but shared the same operating mechanism.

"Transhuman","t5_2qh2k","&gt;4) You would have to map out each neuron in the brain and simulate it with software in a computer. It is said that it would take a computer the size of the earth to simulate the brain connections, so this may never be possible.

I believe we've been able to simulate at least portions of mice brains, I don't think it's as impossible as you think. Advancements in computer technology have allowed us to perform more operations per second than we thought possible, we're still a long way away but at the very least we might be able to scan and store the structure of the brain to be simulated when we reach the necessary computing power to create that kind of simulation.","1393632886"
"ukraine","t5_2qqcn","&gt; When Americans talk about freedom for Tibetans, how can I take them seriously when their entire country is founded on the genocide of its native inhabitants? They can't even point to where Tibet is on the map. What a joke.

I'm not American, but this is pure whataboutism. The rights or wrongs of Tibetan autonomy or independence stand or fall on their own merits, regardless of what another country has done. As for the US being founded on genocide, that's just bullshit. At Columbian contact, there were only two million people living north of the Rio Grande, and 90% of them died through disease, not execution. While what happened to the remaining 10% is an awful, tragic history, it wasn't genocide and wasn't required for the founding or success of the United States.","1393632886"

"birthcontrol","t5_2snsq","Sometimes if your body isn't yet used to that pill, skipping the placebos will end up in you just coming on anyway, which is annoying. If you've been able to skip periods on a different brand, this problem may be continuous (and so happen for every attempt) and you might want to change to a different brand if you want to skip frequently.

Don't be alarmed though, it's just how some women react to the hormone unfortunately, as it's not strong enough to well control the natural hormone drop occurring alongside the synthetic hormones in the pill. Also, for some, the bleeding may last, on and off, throughout your next pack and may not completely go away until your next placebo week. I know this sucks; I was on Cilest (my second brand) for nearly a year and this happened to me every time I tried to skip, whereas my first, third and fourth pill brands allowed me to skip for up to 6 months at a time.

I know it's annoying, but if it happens every time you try and skip, have a chat with the doc, hope this helps :)","1393632893"

Performance parts for these scooters are sold everywhere, especially on eBay and they're cheap.  

People tend to talk about the problems that you'll encounter on a China Scoot and it's somewhat true.  But if you're mechanically inclined and don't mind getting your hands dirty, keeping one of these things running reliably shouldn't be a problem.

I had a 150cc China Scoot that I lightly modded and it was a pain in the ass to get it tuned properly to make it run good but once I did, I could enjoy riding it without having to fiddle with it anymore.

frankly, I'd say start out with MFR and ThermalExpansion, since those two cover all common scenarios in the game. then maybe go qith QUarryplus (just for quarries and pumps) instead of adding all of Buildcraft in.

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","I actually talked about that with him here: http://multiversitycomics.com/interviews/looking-back-on-another-banner-year-with-image-comics-publisher-eric-stephenson-interview/.

Here's his all-ages answer (with my question leading it), as it is something I agree with:

We’ve talked about this before, but one type of book that has difficulties succeeding in comics are all-ages titles, and besides Super Dinosaur and maybe Rocket Girl (if you count that, which so far I do), Image isn’t currently publishing anything of that nature. I know it’s something you’d like to produce more of, or at least have interest in. I have to ask, due to the difficult to sell nature of all-ages titles, is that a segment that Image just doesn’t see a lot of submissions or proposals for, is it something that is hard to justify producing in today’s marketplace, or is it some combination of both?

ES: Both, really. We don’t get a tremendous amount of all-ages submissions, and by and large, the ones we do get aren’t anything that would set the world on fire. Comic book stores don’t really go out of their way to support all-ages material, and bookstores tend to rack all-ages material in the wrong place, so it’s tough. Ron Richards and I were speaking with a buyer at a large book chain last month, and when I noted that it seemed like a good idea to rack all-ages comic material with other all-ages books, instead of in the graphic novels section, the buyer responded that it did make sense, but that children’s book buyers don’t necessarily agree. So there’s this whole section in bookstores for kids’ books and YA books and all that, but comics that would appeal to those readers are put in a section they or their parents might not think to look in for all-ages material.

Similarly, I think the comics industry has done such a good job of proving that “comics aren’t just for kids anymore,” that most people think comics flat out aren’t for kids anymore. This is anecdotal, obviously, but from conversations I’ve had with parents I know, I get the impression that comic books stores rank only slightly lower than sex shops on the list of places they don’t want to go. There are some great, kid-friendly stores out there, but unfortunately, they’ve become the minority, largely because there is this hard-headed belief in the direct market that all-ages material simply doesn’t sell.","1393632906"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Oh they're definitely killer, it's just that I think they work better on their own than they do together. They kind of blend together after a while and start sounding samey to me for some reason.

Paranoid's got the big three but honestly I much prefer the songs on Masters of Reality and Volume 4 to those simply because I've heard them so much.

But perhaps you're right, I was a little harsh calling it ""meh"" when they're all quite good. I think I'm going to go listen to it again myself!

EDIT: I totally forgot, one of the best parts of Side A is Planet Caravan interrupting the heavy stuff with a bit of a softer, more adventurous tone. Really liked the nod to that song they did in their last album.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Mord top isn't ""common"".. but Singed does have quite a few difficult matchups.  I will tell you this though, even the most difficult matchups for Singed (Jayce, Teemo, Vlad) are absolutely winnable lanes.  You just have to play safe until you get either armor, or MR.   The reason Singed can deal with these really hard ranged champs is this...  they usually end up pushing the lane pretty hard.  Let them..  stay back until you're pushed to tower.  Once you are at / near tower, if they move anywhere near you, rush them and fling them into the tower range.

Singed's weakest point is early game, and you almost always want to get a tear first (unless you're going to the ROA route).   After your tear,  its a tossup.  Sometimes you want some cloth armor (which I would usually build into tabi boots later), or a null magic mantle (to build into MR boots).   Once you start getting some armor/MR after your tear, it becomes much easier to control the lane and take a bit of damage.  When Singed gets a tear, it makes it much easier because you no longer end up having mana problems.  That is the main reason I choose it over a RoA.  If you are winning / not threatened much in lane, after tear, it's almost always good to get boots / blasting wand.  Once you get that blasting wand, you do way more damage to the enemy and to the minions... so you can really start proxy farming behind their tower if you're winning.

When you are playing a hard matchup, I highly recommend taking TP.  This allows you to go back, buy your tear immediately at 700 gold, replenish your crystalline flask, and TP back to lane.   I honestly find TP to be SO useful on Singed that I take it 100% of the time.  As people have stated... Singed does not really have to kill his opponent to beat him in lane.  TP helps DRASTICALLY with that, moreso than even getting a kill with ignite, IMO!

EDIT: Oh one more thing to mention.  If you ever have to go back and have 325 gold, not enough to buy anything else... ALWAYS buy boots! As someone quoted above ... """"Singed's trolling capacity has a 1-to-1 ratio with movement speed""."".  So very true :D","1393632907"

The film stars Jamie Blackley and [Toby Regbo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Regbo) and premiered at the [Edinburgh International Film Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_International_Film_Festival), where the two actors won the Best performance in a British feature film award.

Also having a social media account hacked and then have people impersonate you and do mean things to others causing those people to dislike and alienate you is a common form of cyber bullying and is very manipulative and causes a lot of damage and pain to many people regardless of whether or not you're at a computer.

Dont get cyber bullying confused with a flame war in the youtube comment section, during a flame war nobody wins and both parties just look like idiots and need to walk away from the computer.","1393632908"

I wouldn't defend the guys actions, as they're pointless at best, but I would agree with /u/Master_Tactician in that naming him can't do much good.  Of course the fact that he did this is ill-advised, stupid, and offensive to a good number of people, but nobody has been physically hurt.  Naming him and showing his photo increases the chances of some nutjob using violence to ""get even"".  

It's not strictly the same but if I go and draw Mohammed somewhere then it could conceivable upset a lot of people.  Whether that's right or wrong is a matter of opinion, but if I get charged, named etc then the likelihood of me being bumped off or attacked as a result increases.  So in that situation I could end up dead or severely injured for drawing a picture, or in this case this guy could be assaulted/severely injured/killed for holding a lighter to a book.  By all means punish him if you think he's done something wrong, but don't create a situation that makes it easier for someone else to do something worse in retaliation.  There are ways to make people responsible for their actions without simply putting their picture in the paper and fining them a few hundred quid.","1393632911"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well. The first one was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Fucking my housemate upstairs when I was downstairs was her thing, so that's fair I guess.

The second one I was never *exactly* sure if she did cheat or not, but went completely off the rails after walking out on me anyway. Last I heard she changes between ""I hate men"" and ""I hate women"" whilst fucking up a new relationship every 3 months like clockwork, and had been doing for years. Dick in crazy, not even once guys, just don't do it.

The third shacked up with an ex-con who turned out to have been a sex offender, moved around / dated a bunch of other guys, then ended up in what sounded like a crack-house slum in philly above some dirty bar, where she got roofie'd and raped. So at this point the wife &amp; I bought her $230 bus ticket, a room at our place to stay at, and free food / rent until she was on her feet at the job my wife got her in at. 

We lived together for two years and she became our closest friend :) We had to move states for work just this january, she'll be finishing a degree in electrical engineering at the local tech college at the end of next year, then doing a bachelors in Germany. Of all the things I'm proud of having done with my life it was bringing her back into it, and giving her a second chance at things. When she got off the bus from philly, she was about 70lbs. She's 5'11, pretty sure we saved a life there.","1393632912"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","We personally do not have any of our own evidence, all of our hypotheses have come from secondary research. The survey itself was intentionally designed to pick up on these common perceptions of current education system. According the statistics from National Center for Education Statistics, education success itself is seeing a slight increase since 1990. Despite these numbers the media and overall public perception reflects that of a belief the education system is failing. This is one of the perceptions we may want to dig into later - but for the moment we are just gathering early data. 
http://nationsreportcard.gov/reading_math_2013/#/state-performance

Our research is also limited to K - 12, Higher Edu is an entirely different ballpark and is simply out of our scope. 

I can't give you exact numbers, I am not an expert nor do I claim to be an expert in the field. At the end of the day this is a project for a class so our resources are extremely limited. For what evidence we do have to support the statements I made to you, here's /some/ of our basing.

In the area of our University, Cleveland, Ohio, the city schools have failed both on State level and National level Report cards - effectively getting the rating of F. Many of the suburban public school systems in the greater Cleveland area are also beginning to struggle as a result. In recent years there's been a push towards private and charter based schools because of the failing public systems. 

On an international level, US students are far behind and continue to fall behind in math and sciences in comparison to that of other developed countries.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I agree with /u/Johnny_Welfare, you're reading far too much into things.

&gt; Whether it is by using midichlorian counts instead of their intuition to pick who should be trained...

Midichlorians are a stupid because it removes the mysticism from the Force, not because it shows the Jedi are overly reliant on technology. Qui-Gon very clearly was using his intuition when it came to knowing Anakin was strong with the Force, he was measuring exactly *how* strong he was. Intuition isn't used to make quantifiable measurements.

&gt; ...that it doesn’t occur to them that an electronic record might be tampered with...

See, this is why I think you're reading too much into this. This specific example has nothing to do with a over-reliance on technology, but instead speaks about the overall arrogance of the Jedi at the time, thinking that they were right and there was no possibility they could be wrong. Pride and arrogance *are* themes in the Star Wars films; you don't need to extrapolate those themes into something else.

&gt; ...or relying on an army of clones instead of enlisted men, the examples are replete.

That doesn't make sense as an example, especially since it wasn't the Jedi that created the clone army (they merely led them in battle, but that doesn't exactly show a reliance on technology either).

&gt; 20 years down the road, Obiwan and Yoda have learned their lesson. They have both isolated themselves in remote places where they live a life of simplicity, completely cut off from the modern world, where they rely on the force and the wisdom it provides instead.

No, it's because they were on the run from the Empire, and living in remote areas without many (or *any*, in Yoda's case) connections is a great way to minimize your chances of being found.

Obi-Wan also changed his first name; does that count as a rejection of the modern world as well?

&gt; This is best exemplified when Obiwan instructs Luke to remove his targeting device in ANH.

So because Obi-Wan has learned to reject the trappings of technology, he tells Luke to... not use his eyeballs?

&gt; A lesson Vader has also learned at great cost as can be seen when he compares the illusion of power from the Death star to the real power of the force he has lost with his limbs.

Uh, he's just shit-talking with a moff. It doesn't need to be any more complicated than that. (and there's nothing in that scene to suggest that he's bemoaning any loss of power or anything like that) The moff says that the Death Star is the ultimate power, Vader says ""fuck you dude, you're wrong, I'm gonna give your esophagus a hand job to prove it"" and that's all.

&gt; That’s why Qui Gon is considered a rebel in TPM, he relies on his intuition, on the will of the Force. But he doesn’t seem like one to the audience already familiar with the enlighten Jedis of the OT.

No, Qui-Gon was considered a rebel because he didn't give a rat's ass about what the Jedi Council told him to do.

Hate technology or love it, if you routinely disregard what your boss tells you, you're going to be considered a rebel. (and probably fired, but it's not like being a Jedi is the same as working in a cubicle farm)","1393632916"

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","Let's suppose Adam is shooting at a target through armored glass (Reinforced Material: Structure 8, Armor 12) with an Ares Predator. By itself, the Predator will never break through the glass. Adam is skilled with pistols though, so he fires a long burst (3 bullets), makes a pistols + agility roll and scores 4 successes (the wall doesn't get a defense roll, Adam hits it unless he glitches).

8 damage + 3 successes == 12 Armor -1 Armor Penetration (from the Ares Predator)

The shots penetrate the barrier. The barrier takes 2 point of damage from three bullets (the barrier does not get to make a defense roll because bullets are penetrating attacks), and 9 points (the rest of the damage) are dealt to Adam's target.

Now Adam takes aim at a second target, behind a metal beam (Heavy Structural Material: Structure 12, Armor 20) still with his Ares Predator. Adam is an excellent shot and rolls handfuls of dice, but the amount of damage he can add from successes is limited to the accuracy of his gun (7). 8 damage + 7 successes &lt; 20 armor -1 Armor Penetration. Adam can fire a whole magazine and he probably dents the beam, but he won't punch through it. If Adam keeps firing, he might be dent the beam enough to finally shoot through it after a hundred or two hundred rounds (the core rule book leaves this decision up to the GM's choice), but most shadowrunners don't have that much time.

Luckily, Adam has an RPK heavy machine gun nearby. He fires 10 rounds in full auto at the metal beam and rolls 5 successes. 12 damage + 5 successes &gt; 20 Armor -4 AP. The bullets tear through the metal beam, but since there are more bullets more damage is absorbed by the barrier. The metal beam takes 4 points of damage and 13 reach his target, who still takes a -9 on his defense roll if he was aware of the attack.

***tl;dr:*** In summary, if Adam doesn't break through the armor then the barrier takes cosmetic damage but not structural damage. If Adam does break through the barrier and fired...

* 1 bullet, the barrier takes 1 box of damage and the rest (total damage -1) hits Adam's target.
* 3 bullets, the barrier takes 2 boxes of damage and the rest (total damage -2) hits Adam's target.
* 6 bullets, the barrier takes 3 boxes of damage and the rest (total damage -3) hits Adam's target.
* 10 bullets, the barrier takes 4 boxes of damage and the rest (total damage -4) hits Adam's target.","1393632918"

I get that part. What I don't get is why bullying is blown out of proportion by so many parents? Not only does it create these dumb ass zero tolerance rules at school, its also detrimental for kids long term. When you make fun of a kid for dressing weird, most likely he will just stop dressing weird and be more ""normal"". The kid will have more friends and learn how to deal with these types of situations when he's grown up. Bullying can actually help kids get a taste of what adult life is (just a little bit) and teach them a lesson early on. ","1393632921"

"beer","t5_2qhg1","Beers are ideally supposed to be consumed warmer. The only reason why you should drink beer cold is if it's Bud/Coors/Miller product.

When a beer is cold, the majority of flavor that is readily present is bitter hoppiness. When it warms up, more complex malt profiles and other hops will come to the palate. 

http://www.craftbeerrestaurant.com/Craft_Beer_Restaurant/Temperature_Guidelines.html

Ideally, the usual window is like 45-50 degrees F for most beers and then 50-55 degrees F for stouts, barley wines, and imperials.

The later is considered ""cellar temperature"", so if you've heard of England having warm beer, it's the misunderstanding that they beer at that temperature because it's appropriate for the beer. The reason why American beer is usually so cold is so that you *don't/can't* taste it.","1393632927"

"theydidthemath","t5_2x23b","the more accurate number is probably 11 million

so 1 Hitler is 1.1 x 10^7 

according to [this site] (http://www.dollartimes.com/calculators/inflation.htm) a dollar at the end of the war was worth 13.09$

i'll go by his definition of the value of human life, so that's 6.9 mil * 13.09 = 90,321,000

(1.1 x 10^7) x (9.0321 × 10^7) = 9.93531 x 10^14

993,531,000,000,000$ = One Hitler 

estimated numbers of deaths caused by Stalin are between 20 mil and 60 mil. 

so Stalin is worth at the lowest estimates 1.81 Hitler and at the highest  5.4 Hitlers

Mao is worth between 7.09 Hitlers and 4.9 Hitlers

and as for the 35 dollar fine that's-

(9.93531 x 10^14) / 35 = 3.5227889 x 10^-14

so the bank is 35.227889 Femto Hitlers if i'm not confusing my prefixes

"nba","t5_2qo4s","the majority of 3s are created by dribble drives and kick outs. back in the day, before the defensive changes in 2001, most of the 3s were created by passing out of the post. now, with the spread offenses, most 3s are created by drive-and-dish or simple ball movement. as it turns out, the better a teams spacing and the more 3 point attempts they take per game, the more they tend to win games. Over a large sample size, this has a direct positive correlation. 3 point attempts also have a higher offensive rebound percentage than midrange shots, but not as high of an offensive rebound percentage as shots near the basket. theres a reason why teams are taking less and less midrange jumpers. they are talking about this a lot at SLOAN today... check out this article by one of the advanced stat guys who is there right now: http://www.boxscoregeeks.com/articles/changing-strategies-in-basketball-and-the-search-for-floor-stretch","1393632935"

Everything's digital now except a few mom &amp; pop joints, and the scarce vintage theater. Now you just push buttons, but when movie theaters first began to crop up, they used ark light projectors (same concept as the wielding technique) that had to be monitored closely or they could explode from overheating. It was such a delicate process, that there was a toilet in the booth so you were always close by. I worked at a theater too that had thick steel blast doors to enter the booth. They were to contain a sudden explosion, as was standard practice in the early era of the big screen. We've really come a long ways in a hundred years.","1393632944"

"VOIP","t5_2qrz4","Agreed, plus timing and the state of the industry become important factors too. Case in point, in the early 2000's I was doing security work and ended up building some awesome spam-blocking servers using several open source tools. It was a good use of my time back then, as email filtering was still pretty immature at the time and the only good mail filtering solutions would have been pretty expensive (not to mention half of the spam solutions on the market at the time were just a wrapper on top of spamassassin anyway). The downside was, between false positives and care-and-feeding I and other members of our team ended up spending 2-6 hours a week tweaking rules and training filters. Those are 2-6 hours that could be spent on auditing or exception logging or something more productive than tracking down the resume that got blocked because the email included the phrase ""magna cum laude"". 

I have no idea if those boxes are still in use or not, but it's definitely not an approach I'd take if I were starting from scratch now that you can get pretty decent filtering at a much lower price point. To put something like that together today would not only by an inefficient use of my time, but it would be impossible to do if I also had to manage other IT systems or worse yet run an entire business.","1393632947"

I am not claiming the Welly is some svelte beast, but the Catalina is literally and figuratively a boat in comparison.  IMO the Welly has a *noticeably* better flight performance than the Catalina.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","For those who are quick to criticize Obama, a few things to consider:
1. Obama and the US is dealing with one of the most powerful countries, and are ALSO working with Russia on many other tense agreements, such as the Iranian nuclear deal. Despite everything that is occuring, Obama and the government has to be VERY careful with how they interact with Russia given what is at stake.
2. In addition, the current situation with Ukraine is also extremely tense, and rash declarations would be a grave mistake on Obama's part. Although his message may sound weak, the implications will be perfectly understood by Russia, and do not forget that Obama has probably been working closely with Kerry and others constantly over this week in trying to diffuse the situation while warning Russia.
3. Russia has been extremely uncommunicative and untrustworthy. For example, Putin's statements earlier today were the first in almost a WEEK of silence- all the while, Russia diplomats and advisers working with the US have been stating that no violence will occur.
4. For all intents and purposes, Obama's quick statement was directed to the people of the US and of the world and not to any authorities- there are probably constant talks and negotiations undergoing all the time.
5. The vagueness of ""costs"", albeit weak, also gives the US a lot more freedom in deciding the best course of action. It would be very unfortunate if the US was once against stuck on false promises (such as chemical weapons in Syria being qualified as Crossing the RED LINE) which would only further weaken the US stance. For these reasons, I do not find much anger for what Obama released, and those blaming Obama for causing this ""cold war"" may be missing the larger picture (and as i mentioned, the Kremlin has been extremely uncommunicative with the US, or have been untrustworthy).

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","distinction noted, but i was thinking of this dicta in Griswold v. Connecticut, just as a means of illustrating that the Constitution isn't the lone arbiter of rights enjoyed by Americans.

&gt;The Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights.... I do not mean to imply that the .... Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government....While the Ninth Amendment - and indeed the entire Bill of Rights - originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties. And, the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement. In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the ""liberty"" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.","1393632953"

* **Taste:** The smoke is there in the arrival, but quickly recedes to allow notes of ginger and honeyed ham and clove.  A nice experience, but one that could perhaps do with a bump in ABV.

* **Finish:** The finish is quite nice, offering a good variety of flavors.  There is vanilla and fresh fruit and some more salt and of course smoke.

This is a nice dram which would have scored better if it were bottled at a higher ABV.  This would have provided more intensity in the experience.  As it is, it's a good whisky, if a little underwhelming on the palate. Bottled at 43%

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","There are a few problems that I have with YEC. The first is perhaps theological, it shows that the nature of God is deceitful. God created our universe 10,000 years ago and it certainly does not look like it meaning that God created it so that it looks older than it is meaning that God is something of a lier. 

Another issue that I would have is the interpretation of Genesis 1-2, and perhaps the interpretation of Genesis in its entirety. The text is far from clearly historical in nature, it contains a significant amount of imagery which connects it to an old Temple religion. Ancient Middle Eastern people considered their temples to be a microcosm of the universe and the meeting place of heaven and earth; Genesis is concerned with God as something of a divine architect constructing the universe - building God's own temple. The most literally accurate way I can understand Genesis 1 is in relation to the Jerusalem Temple, (or Samarian Temple). I say this is the most literally accurate interpretation because it takes the text as a serious piece of literature. 

Next I would say that we should take seriously the doctrine of biblical inspiration. If the Bible is inspired then does that mean that it is simply inspired for twentieth century scientifically minded people? If the authors of the biblical texts were inspired by God to write then does that mean that the genre in which they wrote should be taken very seriously, as the genre within which God chose to communicate to human beings? If this is true then there is a very serious issue with taking the bible literally in all respects. God chose to communicate to human beings using mythological language, or at the very least you would have to concede that God chose to communicate to human beings using stories which resemble mythology and are indistinguishable to mythology. Again, we run into the problem of whether or not we believe in a deceitful God or not. 

Fundamentally, YEC does not contribute to any sort of science and the only way that people can be convinced of it is if they are susceptible to conspiracy theories. The only way that one can be a YEC is if one believes that geological dating methods are flawed which means that virtually all geologists who use these dating methods are part of a cover up. The same with all branches of science which pertain to the theory of evolution and to cosmology and astronomy.  ","1393632954"

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","&gt;Can it not be gallstones? Because that would be too obvious. Because the moment this story began, with a fat person in an emergency room complaining of unusual stomach pain, I thought, “Gallstones.” I am not a doctor. I don’t want to be a doctor. I certainly don’t want to be smarter or more intuitive than a doctor. I want doctors not to be horrible. That’s all. I’m willing to settle just for that. 

Why would she be able to make that diagnosis when several trained doctors failed to do so?

&gt;I made an appointment to see my own doctor the next day, who sent me for an ultrasound and found that I had gallstones.

Oh.  Two fatties with gallstones.  What a coincidence.  Oh, wait.  [It's not](http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/obesity-health-risks?page=2).  Damn fatshaming bodies.

Well, the person in the article received some pretty prompt care with all of the tests they were able to do.  She's much thinner, so she must have just not received care due to her size.

&gt;In the emergency room, a blasé and indifferent doctor saw me. After reluctantly pressing on my stomach for a few seconds, he pronounced my problem to be food poisoning.

So, the doctor was just very busy and unable to spend enough time with an emergency room patient.  Almost like being fat had nothing to do with it (aside from contributing to the gallstone issue).  Maybe - just maybe - extremely obese patients make it much harder to treat the patients, and ""regular"" obese patients are treated exactly the same as thin patients, except by noting that the ""regular"" obese patients have an extra condition which contributes to their health problems.","1393632956"

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","We both discussed that we would wait a year after getting married to TTC.  We hadn't lived together before, so we wanted to get that whole ""living together"" thing under wraps.

Also, because we could and I was (am) still working full time, we decided before adding a third person to the household, to pay off the house.  

We are both 31, and I am glad we waited.  Hell, I am glad *I* waited.  I could've been in a really shitty situation, but instead I am debt-free, married and secure.  I am not scared.  I am ready to do this.  

I have learned how to be frugal, as far as using cloth diapers, breast feeding and buying clothes/items for baby.  These things I definitely wouldn't have thought of when I was younger.  I think all of that spare time being single/bored, and working part time (job loss from one of my jobs), I was forced to become frugal, which I think will help in the long run. 

So, if you're questioning it.  Wait it out.  You've got a lot of time.   ","1393632957"

Rand imparts *way* too much virtue on to the wealthy and seems to villify the needy and disenfranchised.

I wanted Atlas Shrugged to be good, and the concept of individualists boycotting society until it cut the shit isn't completely bad, but... for perspective on what a wank job it is, the main character John Galt has like a 30 page monologue at the end.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","As some have said here;

Jinn are different creatures to us with their own will. Some of them are obedient and some of them are rebellious. There is a whole chapter in the Quran called Chapter Jinn!

Iblis / Shaytan (Satan) is one of the Jinn, who when Adam PBUH was created was ordered to prostrate to him along with the angels, he refused and said ""I am better than him, I was made out of fire and he's made from mud""

Humans follow him in that sin today, arrogance, I am better than X because of ""Something Allah gave me"" which is nonsense, we're all equal in the eyes of Allah.

Now going back to your question, yes Jinn are like us, they have more powers (Ability to hide and take the forms of certain number of other beings e.g. snakes).

Islam doesn't tell us a lot since it's not important. Islam tells us enough on 

1. Who they are.

2. How to protect ourselves against the evil ones amongst them.

3. The tricks of the most evil one of them Satan.


Interestingly I've been spending time looking at the word Jinn in Arabic.

The root word for it is J N N جنن
Which means ""Hidden""

It's also the root word for Jannah (Heaven or beautiful garden)

It's also the root word for Junoon (Craziness)

It's the root of the word in the Quran for the ""Arrival of the night"" فلما جنّ عليه الليل

Now what's the link,
A garden; the trees and plans cover the ground and hides it.
Craziness; A state covering the mind and hiding it from reality.
The arrival of the night covers things and hides objects from view.
Jinn; hidden from view.

Isn't Arabic wonderful ? :)

The body language she copied from Rachel, I kind of saw as Santana imitating Rachel's theatricality, as well as choosing a song from the play, because she didn't seem to have a solid grasp on the audition process, but she knew how Rachel did DROMP back in S1. There's a reason Rachel didn't audition Funny Girl songs for Funny Girl...it's generally not something people do unless requested. Yet, Santana, who didn't seem to think the whole understudy thing was a major deal initially, went in and ran with that, not really knowing what she was doing, just knowing she had talent and would give it a shot.

So it was an interesting mix of applying her own twist vocally (something she is confident in) and imitating Rachel's theatricality (as she's not well versed in the theatre/Broadway business, even if she does like musicals and stage plays). ","1393632968"

I'm back sliding now - I've eaten six chocolate bars today and two buns among much else - so I'm hoping this thread will help buck me up!

A couple of things I did:

* Get rid of the junk. If it's in my house, I eat it. 

* Replace with healthy snacks. Snacks are pretty essential and discouraged me from binging on meal portions, which is also something I do.

* Water. Keep a handy source. I used to sip it constantly from a bottle while reading or redditing, because I would normally use that time for eating. Leading to..

* Recognise my binging triggers. Boredom and stress were big for me. If I had a 'bad day' I justify binging to myself and then chow down. Doing work on my computer? I eat biscuits. Now laptop=biscuits to my stomach.
 
* Treats! Bought one at a time and only rarely, because that's the whole point. It's easy to fall for 'treat-creep', where that monthly doughnut becomes weekly. And then biweekly.  ","1393632968"

"Civcraft","t5_2tm1t","Given the amount of time I've dealt with the issues related to Monaco over the last week, my main claim is merely to be provided evidence that Monaco has paid for the NDZ land where they've homesteaded. Since both Mokuna/Makanla and Cheshire have claimed they paid a member of the town and accused him of lying about it, I think it only fair that they back up their assertions.

While I have been pearled twice by members of Monaco or their supporters, been subjected to threats of violence by the leader of their town, and generally have had to deal with Cheshire's ever-shifting justifications for his actions against NDZ, the above is the only thing I would ask. That is my claim as an individual of New Danzilona. 
****
Lastly, since dialogue and in-game actions can very obviously get heated in situations like this, I would simply ask Cheshirelulcat to leave Monaco for somewhere far away from New Danzilona. I am not sure why he decided to settle less than 1,000 blocks away from our city. However, I can say that it has been nothing but constant provocation since he moved in, with his actions in NDZ and Pella this past week only cementing his reputation for trouble following him wherever he goes. 

He previously left Stoneburrow after some type of revolution or attempt to seize control of the city. He then moved on to found Tiro, which very quickly butted heads with inhabitants in that area and he left the area. He subsequently settled within chat range of NDZ and problems immediately started in a region which has had many towns peacefully co-existing for nearly 9 months. New Danzilona was willing to give Cheshire the benefit of the doubt in these other situations, but it is now clear that they are a pattern, not a fluke. 

**So Cheshire, I kindly ask that you leave New Danzilona's land and settle somewhere far away.** We have no desire to constantly fight with you. We are a simple people who simply want to be left alone, free from the drama you have imported from your previous issues in Stoneburrow and Tiro. Your invasion of New Danzilona shows that you have no intention of peacefully co-existing with your neighbors.

**Tl;dr - My main claim is evidence that Monaco has paid for the New Danzilonan land where they have settled. Monaco's invasion of New Danzilona has caused irreparable harm to the relationship between our towns, and I hope Cheshire will take his ever-present drama somewhere else.** ","1393632971"

In any case, it has happened in the past that the Governor was so late to give the reprieve that the inmate had to be revived (I believe even after the final injection is given there's a one minute window during which the inmate can be saved with another drug, but I'm not positive).

"confession","t5_2qo2a","This is untrue in almost all jurisdictions in the United States. 
In all states but 2, age of consent is 18. In the other two it is 16. In all of those places, if you are under the age of consent, and you have sex, you've just committed a crime. 

In SOME jurisdictions there are Romeo and Juliet guidelines. These basically say that if two individuals are within X years of each other, the state has some minor leeway in deciding to press charges. But, these rules are so convoluted as to not be something any one should rely on.  Let me give you an example:

Here in CA, the age of consent is 18.There are also Romeo and Juliet guidelines. If a 16 year old boy and girl have sex, while they have broken the law, as long as it was fully consensual and nothing else feels out of place, the state may chose not to press charges. However, if the parents of one of those teens pushes for it, the state still has to press charges.

Now, what happens if those two 16 year olds are both male or both female (a homosexual relationship). Well, since their brand of sex is considered sodomy, the Romeo and Juliet Guidelines do not include acts of Sodomy (in fact, sodomy immediately excludes the guidelines) and sodomy laws for minors haven't been struck off the books, the state gets no option. It must press charges. ","1393632974"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The Decline of Arianism falls into three parts, which I will call ‘Arianism Proper’, ‘Pseudo-Arianism’ and ‘Extra-Imperial Arianism’.

By ‘Arianism Proper’ I mean the set of beliefs associated with Arius and his followers. Arius very clearly considered Jesus to be a created being, a mediatorial figure between God and Creation, and like us in every way. It has been typical to consider Arius’ theological rationale the desire to preserve the uniqueness and soleness of God the Father, but Gregg and Groh make a good case that the main thrust of Arian doctrine was actually focused on salvation. The theology of Arius relating to Jesus was necessary so that we could become like him. Arius was condemned at the Council of Nicaea, in 325. This was the first ‘ecumenical’ council though most of the ecumenical councils were composed of a majority of Eastern bishops. This was the main purpose of the council. After the council Arius was exiled, and continued for some time to have a minor following. Constantine wanted to rehabilitate Arius, and in 335 the Synod of Jerusalem restored Arius to communion. However, Nicaea effectively ended Arianism proper as a theological option.

I call this Arianism proper, because what follows in the 4th century is no longer called ‘Arianism’ in the historical circles I read and write in. What you get is a large number of bishops and churches aren’t very happy with the Creed of Nicaea, and aren’t happy to call Jesus “of the same substance” with the Father. So I would rather call this phase ‘Pseudo-Arianism’. A lot of our history of this period has been influenced by Athanasius, who started a polemical practice of calling his opponents ‘Arians’ in order to taint them by association. Constantine dies in 337 and Constntius II becomes emperor in the East, and from 350 over the whole Empire. He is favourable to the anti-Nicene bishops, which at this time is most of the church of the Eastern Empire. Their views are not as extreme as Arius, though there are some theological similarities. You first get the emergence of a group who would rather say that the Son is “like the Father in substance” (Homoiousian), before you get a group from 357/359 saying that the Son is “like the Father” (Homoian), and refusing to talk about “substance” or “being” at all. And from the early 360s you have a radical group saying that the Son is “of a different substance” to the Father (Anomoian or Heteroousian). 
Both theological debate and changes in Emperors leads up to 380 and 381. On the one hand Theodosius I, (Emperor 379-395) is firmly in favour of the (now) Orthodox position, backing “of the same substance”. On the other, particularly the efforts of Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus, have managed to sway a majority to accept Nicaea and formulate Trinitarian theology along those lines. So the 2nd ecumenical council of Constantinople in 381 ends, *within the empire* all forms of so-called Arianism. They are no longer allowed to use church buildings, and not allowed to meet within the city. Their power is broken.

But there is a third strand. Ulfilas was a Goth, or possibly half-Goth, who was ordained by Eusebius of Nicomedia, a leading figure among the non-Nicenes. And Ulfilas went as a missionary back to the Goths. He devised the alphabet for the Gothic language, and translated the Bible into Gothic. His mission was successful, and so many Goths were converted to an ‘Arian’ version of Christianity. Conversion efforts among other Germanic tribes also followed along these Homoiousian lines.
In the case of the Goths, this kind of Arianism persists until the Third Council of Toledo in 589 where the Spanish Goths (i.e Visigoths) embraced the orthodox position. Those Goths left in Italy, the Ostrogoths, were displaced in the mid 6th century, settling in modern Austria. At this time it is really the Franks that emerge as the major power in central western Europe, and they are already in the Catholic fold.

So, the water would be really quite calm and still, especially considering it's indoors. 

Except around the girls. Because their bodies are creating small ripples in the surrounding water, there'll be ripples present around them. c:

So the best way to shade[ would be like this.](http://i.imgur.com/6oHtLVo.jpg)

As you can see, the water is still disturbed slightly and small, linear ripples form. But mostly it's a nice, glassy surface.

Also, water reflects its surroundings! You can choose to show their reflection under the water, but I find a much nicer [and less...glaring?] way is to blend their skin tone in with the surrounding water. It gives the distorted impression of the rest of their bodies. c:

Hmm what else... your water is very very very bright and saturated. Actual water is a lot paler, similar to the colour I used in my quick sketch. ^ ^

I think... that's it. Sorry it was a bit disjointed! But yeah I hope those tips + my sketch helps. Feel free to reference it, although it's *super* messy and obviously I'd blend it properly if I was making an actual drawing. :3","1393632976"

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","Alright, I've been around through a few of these but never posted. I guess this time I am.

I'm an Australian dude, so that explains why I spell things funny sometimes. I studied computer science a while back, and then after that, went into the games industry where I became a graphics programmer. Eventually the company I worked for folded, and I tried my hand at the indie thing, which went okay. I've recently been working on a tool for indies (with the help of my most excellent girlfriend, who you might be able to find *in this very thread* if you apply yourself), which I suppose means I'm only kind of a game developer at the moment, but I am looking forward to getting back to it. Sometimes I hate programming, but I also think it's one of the coolest things ever. In fact, I think programming has the potential to revolutionise education the way writing did. I think that if you're reading this, and you don't know how to program at all, you should go and learn some. I'm aware that I might be rocking a little bit of professional bias, here. But no seriously, do some Python or something.

I do play games, but not as much as you might think. I've been on a bit of a Dwarf Fortress bender lately, and I'm trying to hold off playing the second chapter of Kentucky Route Zero because I'm pretty sure I'm going to be sad when it's done. Judging by metacritic, my taste in games is a bit weird and sometimes it seems like it doesn't correlate with popular opinion at all.

I can't remember how I came across this sub, oddly enough. I think it's an interesting experiment to answer the question ""Can both sides of gender discussions get along?"" and I *really* hope the answer is 'yes'. When I discuss gender with feminists I end up feeling like I'm practically an MRA by comparison, but when I talk to random non-feminists they make me feel like a feminist. I guess this bit of the post could have gone in that 'why do you call yourself an egalitarian' thread. I get annoyed when people say ""egalitarian is basically just another word for MRA"" or ""egalitarian is basically just another word for feminist"". However, I secretly think of the feminists and MRAs that I like as being basically egalitarians, so there.

As for hobbies... Dang, it used to be game development, but now that it's a job my 'hobbies' list has taken a bit of a hit. I like dancing in very specific circumstances, but though some of the people I dance with think I'm good at it, I suspect that I'm not really a dancer at heart. I like attempting ridiculous skills, like walking on stilts. I also really want to learn sign language so I can talk to people in noisy places, but so far being lazy has put the brakes on that plan.","1393632978"

"steroids","t5_2rifm","I use HCG 250IU E3D. It keeps your balls from shrinking while using TRT.  I have been doing it for 5 months now and there has been no ball shrinkage when I am using fresh HCG.  Your fertility will still be affected, but stimulation of the Leydig cells will prevent atrophy.  If some desensitization was going to occur, I think it would have happened to me already.  I'm going to be on TRT for life so I have nothing to lose.  

If you can, buy the HCG in 2000IU bottles. The HCG loses potency rapidly after you reconstitute it.  I noticed that when I was doing the 5000IU bottles (10 weeks worth) my nuts were not staying the same after the 1 month mark.

Since I fucked up and bought a year's supply of 5000IU bottles, I have taken to preloading syringes and freezing them.  It does not affect the potency.  I can get about 17 shots worth out of a 5000IU bottle.  I did a lot of research about whether or not it is safe to freeze the HCG.  There are guys on both sides of the debate, but very little scientific evidence.  Finally I found this note from one of the country's foremost TRT docs, Dr. Crisler, the guy who popularized HCG therapy.

Second, the Bible is a collection of stories which were told by many different people at many different times.  They are made-up stories without a shred of proof that they ever occurred and with no supporting science to back them up. Fairy tales are made-up stories, ergo it is perfectly logical to refer to the Bible as a fairy tale collection. Evolution is not made-up and it is not a story.

I wonder if the thought that things aren't heading in a ""permanent"" direction may be part of what's making it easier for her to distance herself from you.

You both sound like you've been through a lot and are going through a lot of stress right now. 

Communication is key. Read The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman, and (if you want some more insight into the differences between men and women) Men Are From Mars Women Are From Venus. Both of these books can help immensely to understand what a partner needs, means, and is able to give.

2. This is a tautology.  If no one tries, you can't stand around saying ""it's impossible because if it were someone would have tried.""  Someone has to actually lobby for a bill in the wake of Colorado to decriminalize or legalize.

3. This is a pathetic attempt at a strawman argument.  No one has a plastic and reconstructive surgeon as their primary care physician.  They will ask family medicine and internists primarily, and yes, we are short of them.  The last thing they need it to waste more time on drug seekers looking to score.

Also, just for the record, plastics and reconstructive surgeons are in heavy demand.  You see, they correct birth defects and make you presentable after horrific car accidents, farm accidents (too common here), quad bike and snow mobile accidents (ridiculously common in MN), and other issues.  Cosmetic surgery isn't that big a medical field in Minnesota.

"ukraine","t5_2qqcn","Hey awesome post, thanks for the perspective. I just want to comment on one thing.

&gt;When Americans talk about freedom for Tibetans, how can I take them seriously when their entire country is founded on the genocide of its native inhabitants.

We (Americans) know our own history. If you hear someone say they are proud to be American, genocide of the Native Americans probably isn't why. Is it so hard to believe that we don't want other countries to make the same mistakes our ancestors made? Do you think Americans are still jumping at any chance to subjugate and subsume the next ""savages"" we come across? The point is, you shouldn't make assumptions about a country's citizens based on what people were doing there 300 years ago. Countries are not composed of ideals or customs or dead people, they are composed of the people who live there. Failing to grasp this is what makes international acceptance and cooperation so difficult still, even in the rise of the information age. And to clarify, I'm not criticizing any other part of your post, I just found this one statement offensive.

&gt;They can't even point to where Tibet is on the map. What a joke.

I understand where you got this idea, but I hope you trust that anyone who ACTUALLY cares about Tibet can find it on a map.","1393632991"

CLS is another part of the company, another program they have. It's working one-on-one with a person with intellectual or developmental disabilities. You help them complete goals, such as social skills, getting out and about, money skills. So you can incorporate a lot of fun stuff like shopping, movies, going to the gym, etc. 
It pays $10/hr and you have to have a car because a lot of it is driving to and from places in the community. The hours are different than described above. I worked all different hours, but mostly 3pm-8pm and weekends because that's what fit my schedule. I never used the benefits because I never had to (I was still on my parents).
 I still have friends there and they say CLS is hiring! Go to ResCare.com, click on careers. Make sure to choose the Nicholasville location, the LexCore office. Like they said above, the office is in Nicholasville, on the Fayette/Jessamine line, but the jobs are in Lexington.

As other comments have mentioned, the urban areas began to recede, in this case, to an area focused around the Vatican hill. The best way to describe Rome during the period from 800 to say 1300 CE would be to imagine a number of small villages built in the ruins of the old city. The walls of the city mostly remained intact, but within those walls urbanization was replaced by overgrown vegetation and small agricultural plots interspersed between those small villages. This was a fate shared by Rome's sister to the east; when Suleiman finally entered Constantinople he found a 'city' of small villages with a somewhat larger urbanized cluster around the Palace in the extreme east of the city.","1393632992"

Putting this track next releases from the Night Slugs label gives you an idea of how to approach it I think, naked dance music where the simple melodic elements are either fairly percussive as well, or purely atmospheric. 
There is no objectivity in music. Velvet Underground were poor musicians when they began, Hudson Mohawke's earlier work was way too out there for its time. Doesn't mean it wasn't spot on when we go back and listen now that the times have caught up.

FXVRFXLD, I love the energy this track builds up, and the overall vibe really gets me. Nice one man! I do wish you would reach some kind of resolution of the track though. The thing that's giving it tension is having that catchy riff just out of reach, but without giving us a bit more in the end, at least to me, it's a setup with little payoff, to some extent. Some final climax would really bring it home for me.","1393632994"

Also, use the PHB2 alternative Dark Companion instead of the familiar, then take Obtain Familiar and Improved Familiar - imp's a good choice. Also for ACF, Skilled City Dweller out of Cityscape lets you swap Ride for Tumble as a class skill.

Feat Selection. Other than the aforementioned:

* Power Attack
* Dreadful Wrath
* Imperious Command
* Minor Shapeshift

All good choices.

If you are playing recharge magic (which I highly recommend), I suggest Arcane Strike. Otherwise it isn't useful unless you are a battle sorcerer or sorcerer-base gish. My friends and I play recharge magic (it's in Unearthed Arcana), so I used it.

With all of these things, I was more useful inside and outside of combat than the group's warblade - solid near the top of T3, but not quite as strong as a battle sorcerer.

I also love the concept of hexblade, but they did need a fixing. I hope your DM allows all of these things so you can play a pretty fun character.

There is not a statistically significant base of Republicans in California sufficient to ever make it go Red. The per capita spending on campaigning in each state is a good metric of how much your vote matters.

Of course, in all cases it doesn't matter because the machinations of government care very little for party politics. A vote is merely an affirmation of a system which will function without your consent and has already decided the matter for you.","1393633004"

All that EW looks great until the S-300 simply homes on jam and takes out the prowler.  The S-400 was specifically designed with the B-2 in mind.  How good exactly are these systems?  The few who have any idea could never say.  It'd be a mistake to assume they are junk, because they might be like Kontakt-5 was: unmistakably superior to the best available US tech.

One example is profiles changing.  If you're only pulling over one race to search for drugs then people of that race are less likely to carry drugs.

For example, black people are more likely to be profiled and searched for drugs but it's actually more common to find drugs on white people.

It also alienates and harbors resentment in a whole community of people if you're profiling.  This can lead to more work in the long run because you're dealing with more hostile people.

"nonmonogamy","t5_2rc24","So you believe in nonmonogamy and got yourself into a monogamous relationship and wonder why she isn't cool with it.  That's on you.  Being open isn't just a mention on the first date kinda thing.  It is a philosophy that you choose and it has a direct impact on your partner.  It sounds like you really haven't taken her feelings into consideration.  

Being in a nonmonogamous relationship puts a huge burden on both partners to communicate, trust and respectfully love one another.  From your responses you aren't demonstrating this. Sounds like you are caught up in your own needs.  

I think your choice is to either be into this girl or be into nonmonogamy. It my experience, couples that make it work arrive at the decision similar or near the same time.  It is going to be difficult to demonstrate respect, compassion and love while trying to convince her that you should be able to sleep with other women.  Her framework is different...and there is nothing wrong with that.  ","1393633012"

To disable ports you need to move their kexts (kernel extensions, drivers). They're in /System/Library/Extensions/. Look for I/O related drivers (IOBluetoothFamily.kext, IOUSBMassStorageClass.kext, etc). Move them all to another location.  
  
`sudo mv [source] [target]`  
  
You can drag and drop files and folders into Terminal. Type 'sudo mv', drag the kext, then drag the backup folder you created somewhere.  
  
To re-enable ports, you need to move the kexts back. Then rebuild the kernel extension cache (google for tutorial). I think it does that automatically since Mountain Lion after a reboot, but I'm not sure.","1393633013"
"ThriftStoreHauls","t5_2spop","Some easy tips:

Pot and Pans - look for Creuset stamp on the bottom
Always look underneath silverware for silver stamping.  Normally they have appraisers who catch this stuff, but sometimes stuff slips through
Sports Gear - Jerseys and Team paraphernalia, look for signatures of famous players, this stuff gets missed all the time.  

Biggest Advice - only thrift in areas of your interest: too many of my friends pick up stuff they feel is undervalued, even though they have no interest in these items.

It learns for years and years and whatever you imprint into the brain becomes reinforced. The most stimulated pathways branch out more and more and as this happens, the effects of it are nearly irreversible. This is so the brain can learn how to behave , and how to react to stimuli.

What are the effects of weed? It seems to make you take in more information. Everything is interesting/entertaining. But why?  It expands branches of neurological pathways. Seperate areas of the brain have stroner connections. That's why you have strange ideas, it why artists use it. And the physical effects are obviously similar to that of when you were a child. Hunger, you can eat way more and its delicious. I remember it being like that when I was 5. You get sleepy, you giggle more, you're less cynical. You are amazed more eazily (high not stoned).

Than you find out cannanaboids are a neuro trannsmitter that is in the brain that just so also happen to exis in cannabis, and there are dozens of them. And there are cananniboids in breast milk?

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt; You should know that every subreddit in existence can and will make it to the front page. This is another fact that you are willfully choosing to ignore. 

That assumes that people either browser /r/all which many not do because that includes a lot of stuff they don't like like advice animals, funny, gonewild etc.

Or that they have subscribed to the sub, which also often isn't that case as you can see by just looking at numbers of /r/privacy and compare them to /t/technology.

&gt; One of the large non-default subreddits I mod is /r/HistoryPorn

I don't care it is no a default sub. If you make your own sub you can make your own rules and see hit turns out. If /r/conservative gets a million subscribers even though they ban every moderate visitor. Fine. But if everyone would get auto subbed to /r/conservative when signing up then I would demand different rules. 

&gt; Subreddits were grown by their mod teams. 

Or really? [Because this kind gives the impression that being a default sub is a **pretty big factor**](http://i.imgur.com/n5mpjv0.jpg)

Also when I see how people like you and others moderate 100-200 subs then yeah you cannot do that with quality. I have reported several articles and unless I write a mod message nothing happens. And even then it takes 30min or longer. 

Honestly decide which sub you want to mod, do a good job in those 5-10 and enjoy Reddit. 

&gt;  The mod teams in effect are owners of the subreddit.

Again I disagree with that when it comes to default subreddits. You can't just give 5-10 random people the right to decide what millions of people will see just because they joined Reddit a bit earlier.

&gt; Likewise, I don't get to demand that you change your living room furniture layout to suit my personal preferences. 

Just that the landlord for example can make certain decisions what you are allowed to do in your apartment. And that's how I see default subs. You don't own them. But somehow you seem to think you do which will kill Reddit sooner or later and I'm going to be so happy when that day is finally here and you 7 years and your Karma is worth nothing anymore. Hackernews has already  replaced /r/technology for me, because all the interesting stuff gets removed. 

Overall I get the feeling that you simply havn't used Reddit for a long time from the perspective of the average user. Otherwise you would think twice if removing submissions with 1k comments was the right decision.

"WhiteRights","t5_2rjto","There is a strange sort of moral agenda in our popular culture in both Western Europe and America that dictates that the center of evil is the white, heterosexual, able-bodied cis male. The further you are distanced from that, the more virtuous you are by default. So for instance, a white, heterosexual, able-bodied cis woman is just barely less evil. The paragon of virtue is the unicorn-like black, lesbian, handicapped transgender female - otherwise known as ""he/she that can do no wrong"".

This manifests itself in the identity crisis people in the west have. They grow up learning to hate themselves if they fit the mold of the ""oppressor"", so they try and change to absolve themselves of guilt by association. Being gay is one way to do it, being in an interracial relationship is another. If you have mixed race children you can even downgrade your oppression rating by about 40% - enough to possibly be spared race-related violence aimed at whites (maybe). There are even accounts of people who desire to get fat or become handicapped simply to fulfill their desire to be a part of a victim class.

For some people white guilt is simply too much to bear and their efforts to escape it manifests itself in some pretty bizarre ways.","1393633021"

I realize that golf and rowing (sometimes hockey as exhibition games with U.S schools too) also compete against american schools however they predominantly are competing within Canada. 

I am well aware of how large the alpine ski team is, 10 athletes (5 guys and 5 girls) however there is about 4-7 members of the ski team that do not make the travel team. Also the fact that the 5 conference races happen in the Northwestern part of the United States usually around 8-14 hours away driving time could be the reason the team doesn't get that many home town fans out. This year there was a race scheduled at Grouse Mountain here in Vancouver but due to the current snow conditions it was regrettably cancelled. 

I just think that is is very sad that the alpine ski team is comprised of ex provincial and national team members who chose to come to UBC to pursue a more academic career path while still getting a chance to race at a competitive level, are now being told that they are just a club sport while teams who compete in 4 regular season games (women's rugby) are still recognized as Varsity.

"Ayahuasca","t5_2s8ss","Been in ceremonies with kids in school, grandmothers and babies in South America. Make sure you answer the questions they ask you truthfully and honestly. They ask for your protection as much as theirs. Things definitely shifted big-time for me after the first few ceremonies. I had a lot of trip experiences in my late teens and early 20's and have asked myself many of the ""what is life, why are we/I here, what is my purpose"" questions. Aya is amazing with an experienced shaman. Thinking about relationships, the media, money, work, living a good life, etc. at such a young age is quite a blessing. After that, there can be times of stagnation as well, it's a process. The first time could be a complete dud, that happens fairly often. Do it a few times, get grandmother into your blood and DNA. She will do amazing work and when you tune into the flow and synchronicity stuff, pretty mind blowing.

Aya is a few hours ranging from calm and bliss to extreme difficulty at times, and them back again, and again, and again. The last hour or two, if people are playing instruments and singing, well thats the best music and ""we are all one"" feeling I've ever experienced. Each and every time.

All of this has nothing to do with age. People of all ages do aya and many other plants around the world. They don't read Reddit or Erowid or Bluelight, they do the medicine, heal themselves, and in turn heal others. That's how it works, or so they say.

This may come as a shock to you, but corporations are just organizations of people. They aren't actually tangible entities. There are different kinds. Some of them suck.

If being paid in full you don't have to worry about payments but you still have a huge insurance payments if you want full coverage mine would of been $158 a month but I paid for the whole year which was around $1,500 &amp; if it's payments do you see yourself being able to keep up with them? I fill up with around $70 bucks every 2 or 3 days cause once you have your own car it's not just I just to it for school &amp; such it's more like I have my own car I want to go out &amp; explore the world especially when you have a jeep. You always have to save for a rainy day cause you never know when somethings gonna happen, yea it's a brand new jeep nothing gonna break down anytime soon but accidents still happen. It may not be the time for you to get such an expensive jeep at your age but then again I don't know your situation only you do. 

You have to see if it's the smart thing for you to do are you gonna be able to afford it? Gas is expensive, if you own a jeep you can't be worrying about saving gas cause it doesn't happen you can't really drive past a gas station without filling up &amp; that cost money &amp; it all adds up. You have to see if you'll be able to afford it in the long run not just cause you can afford it for a couple months, not cause you want to have the best jeep in the school parking lot, it's something you got to know be smart about &amp; make the right choice. 


You'll have a jeep someday whether it's in days or years if you want a jeep you're gonna end up getting one old or new it's gonna be yours &amp; you're gonna be able to go wherever you want whenever you want. You'll be able to make it yours. Just make the right decision I'm not saying don't get it you're too young or get it it's a dream come true I'm saying think smart ","1393633028"

"GODZILLA","t5_2ruhk","And considering the main audience for this film is *American*, it makes more sense for it to be set in America and therefore including actual Americans.

It was different for the original movies since the primary audience was Japanese and thus they were set in Japan, but it hits close to home for people to see their own country being destroyed.

I think an American Godzilla movie is necessary because it echoes the very real fear that Americans continue to have since the September 11th attacks. While most of the world has said America does need to ""move on"", I feel like they miss the point. Before that, America was invincible. Invading soldiers hadn't touched ground in mainland America in over 100 years. Just as the Japanese saw their aura of invincibility crumble when they saw a whole city obliterated, so too did we see ours fall apart when the towers came down. And while we are moving on from the *tragedy* side of it, the *fear* never goes away. And that is how the Japanese viewed it. They had moved on from the tragedy, but the fear stayed with them.

That is what Godzilla is to me. He isn't a force of nature. He is a force of man, a way of showing us that no matter how strong we think we are, another person can always find a way to knock us down a peg. He represents how destructive humanity and its devices have become. He represents the very real fears of populations around the globe that their lives, with our current military technology, could be snuffed out in an instant, and there is nothing that can be done about it.

And for that to work, I believe that Godzilla needs to be in the homes, backyards, neighborhoods, shopping centers, and workplaces of the audience. Something that makes them realize that the fragile society we live in can, in an instant, be destroyed.","1393633030"

The big that always gets me in the feels is that spot died not long after my great-great-grandfather lost his job which sent him to a bad place to the point where he drank himself to death.

"science","t5_mouw","I appreciate your comments and your links very much. There has no doubt been a lot of good research on the part of individuals, and I don't question that philosophical committment to objective data that no doubt exists within the minds of many individuals. That said, the rules of politics dictate that group interests like The Royal Society can't preserve these individual values without looking ineffectual in the public eye. Your comment on lobbyists speaks to the politics of the data. Understandably, it's difficult for a prestigious scientific community to preface their statements on anything, much less something as politically charged as global warming, with ""we don't know for sure yet, but..."" even if it is the scientifically responsible thing to do. Those 7 words would go a long way for anyone who is keenly aware of how incompatible groups are with nuanced or unfinished conclusions. The factors that cause the temperature of the open ocean to rise over time are obviously a *lot* more nuanced than what's causing the heartbeat of a mouse to rise from a specific drug in a controlled laboratory.. and yet, with how The Royal Society's recent statement on global warming was written, the cause of global warming is about as free of nuance as the discovery of a new planet, or Jenner's conclusion on why milk maids never get smallpox. If Jenner's research is like the case against OJ Simpson, entities like The Royal Society's summary on global warming feels like the state of Italy's case against Amanda Knox. Amanda Knox *may* be partly or directly guilty, it's just a hell of a lot harder for the layperson to be convinced of this when the evidence is so vague. If the scientists doing the objective, in-depth research are all so convinced to our active hand in environmental change, I hope they have a better way to convey this to laypersons (i.e. the ones actively perpetuating the alleged problem) than ""trust us, it's all in the data"". That's about as appealing to me as ""We got this. You wouldn't understand"". I would say, money from lobbyists is not worth the inevitable ostracism to scientists interested in publishing anything.","1393633030"

Storytime: A friend and I did Lester's 'By Land Sea and Air' mission. It was our first try at it, so we didn't really know how it was supposed to go. I got in the first Buzzard we had to steal, and my friend decided to get in with me, instead of just taking the second one. Whatever, he's weird like that. 

Anyway, I take off, notice that reinforcements are inbound and hightail it to Lester's warehouse. My friend is gone. After landing, I realize that you really do have to bring both choppers. Crud. I check the map and notice my friend is still at the rooftop. I call for my car and drive all the way back, so I can help him out. We clear out the rest of the Merry Men and take the 2nd Buzzard to Lester's. 

Turned out my friend lagged out of the chopper when I took off, and never left the rooftop. I thought he died, and I that I just missed the notification. We don't have mics, so we just send texts on the in-game phone or our cellphones. We couldn't communicate while the action was going on.

Taking the psychological angle, each of the components of the aggregates have no inherent meaning.  Combine the events of the aggregates and you have the formation of ego.  

Again, other people may have a different take on this but here's my breakdown of the aggregates: 

*  Form - This is essentially the physical form, more or less self-explanatory.  It is static in the sense of no action taken yet.

* Feeling - This is the point of which your ""gut"" feeling kicks in, wherein you have the basic attract or repel sense, your survival sense before any brain registration kicks in--your sensory perceptions (for example) of seeing the plume of fire or smelling the cherry blossoms as you walk into a grove

* Impulse - This is where your lizard brain reacts to the sensory input and tells your body to do something, before your brain has a chance to fully register the situation.  This is where emotion may kick in, and people with ADHD will lack in executive function/impulse control (My case).  

* Concept - This is where the Cortex-the ""thinking"" brain then puts whatever situation in a box, and ""the big picture"" comes in--Where you label the input ""Explosion"", or ""Cherry Blossoms"".

* Consciousness - This is where you then have the information fully formed, and it is bouncing back to you in your head when the sentence you form comes up: ""Holy Shit"", ""What a lovely aroma on my walk!""  

Once you have the sentence bouncing back to you, this is ego.  Ego can be protective, but also maladaptive, and this is where the suffering can come in in the form of cognitive distortions, or strong attachments.","1393633034"

Also, and I didn't suggest this for no real reason, African-Americans were divided about how equal rights should be obtained (e.g. Booker T. Washington vs. W.E.B. Du Bois).

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Sorry to be a bother, but I see this stated all over this subreddit, can you please source your material from an actual book of some sort that has concrete information on the Yak-9 series aircraft? It is easy for any armchair historian to say something, but I would like concrete proof from a credible source, either a book or an accurate website, not just some forum or some other armchair historian. 

An actual credible book source that I have in my possession which has  compiled data for pretty much every single military aircraft to have flown during world war two. 

____________

Basic Performance Stats For The Yak-9 Series :

 - Maximum Speed At 6,560 ft. (2,000m) = 374 Mph (602 Km/hr)

 - Time To 16,400 ft. (5,000m) = 5min, 42sec.

 - Service Ceiling = 34,755ft. (10,600m) 

USSR Variant Yak-9T-37 [Current In Game That You Are Referring To]

 - Close-support version; modified Yak-9, one 37mm NS-11-P-37 (NS-37), plus one 12.7mm UB machine gun in upper cowling; provision for PTAB anti-armour bombs underwing

 - No special remarks for aircrafts performance

Weal, Elke C., and John A. Weal. Introduction. Combat Aircraft of World War Two. New York: Macmillan, 1977. 219. Print.


______

To sum that all up, I think the Yak-9T is performing relatively correctly, I dont really see any stellar performance when playing against it in RB. The only thing that fazes most people is the accurate DM of the NS-37's rounds. The instance they are one shot by that absolutely massive round makes most people scream that it is OP. 
And if you are saying it is over performing in arcade then you are an idiot, the only real historical part of arcade is that the aircraft in that mode fly (I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get the point).
_______

Also, what 109 model are you talking about?? Because last I checked, there were quite a few variants, and some of them performed in a unique way.

The reason I stated hard stats for the Yak-9T was because it operated within the Min.-max weight of the aircraft after modifications. 

____________

Edit : Also, you seriously can not say there is a Russian bias, there are clearly other aircraft out there with broken FMs, and I am sure if I combed through that book enough, I could find quite a few flaws in the aircraft currently in game.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","So, you use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Distribute N pieces to N trusted parties, such that M of the parties must collude to retrieve the actual key.

Have every party audit their pieces regularly, and re-issue if it is ever demonstrated that an unacceptable number of pieces gets broken (due to data loss, piece leaked, holder MIA, etc etc)

Make certain that N-M (your margin for error) is larger than any reasonable expectation for data loss during any period between audits (for example, raid fails .. but how often do three unrelated, geographically distributed raid arrays fail in the same narrow time window?), and that M is too large and diverse to be easy for any bad actor to covertly co-opt (eg, greed or blackmail may induce one key holder to turn to the dark side .. but 4 key holders, or 10? at the same time, and to all co-ordinate together to cause harm?)

No system, no matter how expensive or inconvenient, can ever have absolutely zero risk. However, keeping an ultimate string of 256-1024 binary digits (base of a deterministic wallet) both sufficiently secret to vouchsafe $1 billion USD and sufficiently usable to dip into once per month on average is eminently possible.

One standard deviation above average would place you in the 84th percentile (i.e. having an IQ higher than 84% of the population).

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Ugh.  The intention behind this statement was good, but holy cow it was completely the wrong thing to say at the time.  They meant to explain that they've essentially front-loaded the animations.  When you tell your character to use an ability (press a button) instead of being given a charging bar and waiting before it happens, it immediately triggers and you're given a longer animation that you have to wait for it to end before you can do something else.  It's a better feeling -- you pick the action and it happens, instead of having to wait for an ability to charge up.  You still have the same wait time, but the order is switched around.  Instead of button -- wait -- action, it became button -- action -- wait.  

However, when people were already worried about the game becoming hack-and-slashy, this statement does little to assuage those fears and just stoked the fire.  The game had enough problems as it was, it didn't need the developers piling more on top by poorly explaining combat mechanics.","1393633051"

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","I'm in the same boat right now. I found the job that was perfect for me, and I thought I was perfect for it too (man, this sounds like a break-up story now). I mean, I was totally qualified, it was relevant to my interests, and the company's mission aligned with my own ideals.

Do you have spending money right now? One of the things I did was go out to Barnes &amp; Noble and buy a couple of books. Look in self-help or psychology or another interest area. Read something relevant to your area of work. Reading lifted my spirits and gave me something to do in my spare time besides come up with new keywords to type into the Indeed search engine.

Another thing I did was make an appointment with a ""career coach"". You can use Google to find some, or use Craigslist. Look for resume writers, interview coaches, career counselors, etc. Or see a regular therapist to help you work through this. I went to a career coach off Craigslist. She had her master's and other certifications and seemed legit. She wasn't extremely helpful, but she was pretty helpful. She put my resume in order, coached me for interviews, helped me write some cover letters, gave me job search tips, and even found some job listings and brought them to our appointment. Some of the stuff she told me, I already knew, so I only made a few appointments with her. But overall, she helped me get my thoughts together and feel more organized. Not top-notch, but she was $50 an hour, which is pretty good considering I looked at others for $150 an hour. ALTHOUGH, those expensive career coaches have been known to help people get on the right track to a happy and successful career.

It's okay to give yourself time to grieve about it, but then you have to move on and be productive in your job search again. After I got my rejection email, I moped the rest of the day, then went out to dinner with my partner and had a drink and complained about how much losing out on the job sucked. But the next day, I went right back to applying to jobs. Especially because I had a bunch of cover letters and my new resume prepared by the coach, I couldn't slow down my search.

If my advice sucks, at least know that you're not alone. I feel like crap about missing out on this job and wondering if I will ever find something that excited me as much as the prospects of that one did...but time doesn't stop for me, and I've got to keep moving.","1393633055"

At this point, it absolutely *is* his fault. This is causing a much bigger issue in your relationship than you seem to be willing to admit. He should be aggressively dealing with this issue. You seem to be incredibly accommodating of him yet he continues to disrespect your wishes on this matter.

I like it better than the old format -- it's a little more exciting. I wasn't expecting race-levels of excitement, but I like that it mixes it up, and probably gives the people in the stands a pretty good show.

Everyone thinks the way you become an addict is when you ""hit bottom"". That there will be a buffer period between when you realize things are getting out of control and when they actually get out of control. But heroin dependency can sneak up on you. You'll realize you've been, not that you'll soon be, hooked on the shit.

Revolution is not something you want. Oppression is bad, but it has be very, very, very bad (as in people being exterminated by the boatload) before it is worth fighting a revolution. A revolution does not have a predicted outcome, and it is not ""free"" anyone. 

Calm your talk and hope for a revolution in the US that overthrows the evil military/industrial complex and its capitalist pig banker overlords.

"TrueAnime","t5_2swc7","&gt; But if they really had capped it all off with season one, I don't think I'd be mad at all. That ending works way too damn well.

I agree.  The way I see it, season one works beautifully as a stand-alone story.  If that was all we ever got, it would still be a great ending for the characters.  However, I think that when you look at Usagi's overall trajectory as a character, the endings of S and Sailor Stars suit her better.  Without spoiling too much, Season One ends by giving Usagi the opportunity to be a regular girl again, but the other seasons give her the chance to become something more.  

Not that there's anything wrong with ending with ""becoming a regular girl"" - it can be a powerful conclusion on its own (see the conclusion to [Utena spoilers](/s ""Anthy"") in Revolutionary Girl Utena), but there's a reason Sailor Moon is still the ""queen"" of ""magical girls, and that, even after twenty years, her light still burns bright.

In any case, I'm glad you enjoyed season one.  It totally blew me out of the water, got me really invested in the characters, and completely trashed my preconceived notions of what Sailor Moon ""was actually about.""","1393633063"

We helped him locate his friend, then he invited us backstage to the after party by the tour buses where I got to hang out with the bands, the roadies, their friends, etc. The biggest one for me was meeting Ronnie Radke (former vocalist of Escape The Fate, now vocalist of Falling in Reverse), since I'm a pretty big fan of his music. He turned out to be a super cool guy, much more polite and humble than I had expected.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Well, then there is Bell's inequality, which you might run into some trouble with as far as your coincidences.  

In particle theory, things are probabilistic not because we don't know enough, but because the universe itself is actually probabilistic.  This might be kind of hard to understand in basic terms, it was for me for years, but I'll give it ago.  An example is with particle entanglement.  Say you entangle two photons.  The net spin of these two photons must be zero at all times, so one must be spin up, and the other spin down.  Until measured, the photons are said to be in a super position of these two states until measured.  Then once you measure on photon, you instantly know the spin of the other.  This is the difficult part to explain.  You may think the photon itself had that value before it was measured, but we just simply did not know it until we did.  That is incorrect.  It was neither spin up, nor spin down UNTIL it was measured. (actually, this thought experiment creates a lot of issues with speed of light delay, and Einstein did not like it very much.)  The photon basically has no definite state until measured.  If you were to go back in time, and do the same experiment all over again, you only have a 50% chance of getting the same result.  There is no predestined spin.  It is neither until measured. This is actually an observed law of quantum mechanics, with some practical application already in use.  So in short, particles don't seem non-deterministic, but are themselves by nature, non-deterministic.  Another great example is the double slit experiment, which you can do at home, though not at the level where this becomes obvious.  If you're still reading this, sorry it was so long.  I'm not arguing with you at all as far as whether or not people should be trying to prove God in this way (Actually, I agree with you) I just saw a common misconception about physics, which I am currently studying, and it was bugging me.


**TL;DR: Not really important information relevant to the point he was making, just correcting the the thing about the particles being non-deterministic**

edit: There is one experiment left to be done to test if Bell's inequality is in fact true.  It involves using information from quasars on the opposite ends of the universe to set up certain parameters of a quantum measurement.  This is to make sure that we haven't coincidentally from the beginning of time set ourselves up for the results we've gotten in experiments (Kind of a more complicated and strange idea).  Since these quasars have never interacted before in the history of the universe (speed of light and cosmic expansion), using their measurements will ensure that a series of predestined events did not lead up to the measurement they will receive.  If the measurements are no different than any of the other measurements we've taken, we will be able to fully conclude this theorem.","1393633065"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","OP is arguing that abortion is moral because pregnancy is a drain on resources, this is not strictly the viability argument but it has essentially the same implication, that once those resources can be mitigated or distributed the morality of abortion loses its foundation.

For example, both you and op have mentioned the resources necessary to raise a baby after it is born, this is not strictly a moral argument, but keep in mind that the adoption market has significantly more parents who want newborns than it does newborns. So in reality once these babies are born resources can be redistributed to parents more capable of raising the child, and so the only real question of resources is during pregnancy.

The viability argument generally argues that once a baby can survive without the mother it is no longer fair to abort it. OP is arguing that abortion is acceptable because pregnancy unfairly drains resources on the mother, however the implication for each argument is the same, that as technology progresses this line will regress. Imagine an adopting family paying the life-support bills for a premature baby, surely you can see that as technology progresses the drain on resources becomes just as insignificant as the viability of the baby.","1393633069"

If you feel as if you have read them, apparently you had some sort of hallucinatory episode.  Please point to something that actually supports this claim you keep repeating -- a claim contradicted by all manner of dictionaries, encyclopediae, and middle school graduates.

BTW, here are a few of the top definitions of ""democracy"" from various sources.

    dictionary.com
&gt; government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system. 

Gee, the stuff after that ""or"" sure sounds a lot like a republic to me.


    merriam-webster.com
&gt; a form of government in which people choose leaders by voting

Heck, I'm a little uncomfortable with this one because it implies all democracies are republics.  Direct democracies have existed, and  there are organizations today that govern themselves purely by referenda.

    wikipedia.com
&gt;Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally—either directly or indirectly through elected representatives—in the proposal, development, and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination.

The article goes on, but that opening paragraph again describes conditions in all modern republics.  

Now that I have demonstrated how easy it is, is there any chance at all you could produce actual language from an actual source that somehow props up your claim that the republic is not a form of democracy?","1393633074"

That's actually really encouraging, because I liked those 2 bras quite a bit and would be more than willing to stick that part out if it'll resolve after a few washes!

I still don't have the best bra vocab, so I'm not sure how to explain what I didn't like about the underwires in the Andorra - with other bras I've worn and tried on, I was aware of the underwires supporting me, but they weren't uncomfortable.  The wires on the Andorra felt like they were absolutely digging into me ... I couldn't wait to get it off.  Maybe that's a fit problem and not a wire problem?

When I said the Elomi and the CK came up too high, I meant the fabric itself, not the wires - probably back to the washing will fix it issue.

Thank you so much for the suggestions.  I'm actually quite desperate at this point, and have some money set aside for this, so I will try the Prima Donna for sure!

Retention. Have you heard of it? It's what turns Privates into Sergeants. You know what kills retention? Shit morale. You know what causes shit morale? Shit leadership. Keep 'em fat, dumb, and happy, and a subordinate will follow you into the gates of Hell with a smile on his face. Keep him pissed, and he'll still follow you, but he'll bitch and moan the entire time. That shit is toxic to a unit. He gets pissed, he bitches, he brings others down with him. Guess who doesn't re-enlist when his time comes? Private Pissypants, that's who. Now you're losing an experienced troop. Sure, he'll be replaced by some chucklefuck who was a civilian a few months ago, but who do you want watching out for you when you're asleep, a seasoned grunt or some kid that looks like he borrowed his big brother's JROTC uniform? What's your Commander going to say when your unit has an overall 80% retention rate, but yours is closer to 20%? Is that going to help your career, do you think? Is it going to help the unit?

That attitude you've got about just yell at them until it gets done, that's how old NCOs get ""asked,"" to retire. That's how young Lieutenants make Captain and then stagnate until their time is up. That's how you command, not *lead,* and if you don't know the difference then I pity anyone who ever has to serve under you. At least I know they won't have to do it for long, since they'll probably burn their re-enlistment papers when the time comes. Assuming they don't do something stupid and get NJP'ed out beforehand.

http://nightly.mozilla.org/

I refused to use firefox at all until i switched to nightly.  Wow was I impressed.  Firefox now feels good enough to replace chrome.

The developer tools are really cool too.

It has some really cool power tools for developers built in like the developer tools cli.

To enable: open menu / developer / developer tool bar

once you have the developer tool bar up click into it and hit F1 for a menu.

I'd also check '3d view' 

To enable: open menu / developer / Toggle tools / top right cube icon '3d view'

The developer tools need lots of exploring.  I hear the network monitor for ajax requests is very good too but haven't had enough time to dig deep.

I've personally switched to firefox nightly for almost everything now.  Although I still fire up chrome on occasion.

Although to be honest the best kind of sanctions the EU could impose would be to seize all the assets of any Russian government official, as well as any Private citizens who work for natural monopolies or state owned companies AND bar them from ever entering the EU under any circumstances.

My only point is that the people who care about BJJ's effectiveness for self defense are those who don't train BJJ, which I assume includes you. We've heard it all before. Go tell everyone who doesn't train BJJ to stop talking about it for self defense. We're all over it.

EDIT: And the techniques aren't hard when you drill them enough. They are much harder to not get stuck in when you don't know them than they are to perform them when you do.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","My interview was years ago. I really hope Google did change their intervew process. Maybe the ""improve algorithm in 45 minutes"" comes at the next phase, I don't know. After the 2nd interview and all they did was throw text book algorithm questions at me, I lost interest. During the interview process I'm also evaluating my potential employer. Oh and for the phone interview they forgot to call me at the scheduled appointment time. I had to call them, not professional. Maybe I just had a one-off negative experience, but that's the only contact I've had with Google.

Like I said, when I spoke to my fellow software engineers that have had interviews at Google, they had similar negative experiences. For example, this ex-coworker that is extremely intelligent, member of mensa and all that, went through the gauntlet of multiple interviews and made it way far into the interview process. Then one Google guy said, oh you don't have what we are looking for in your resume. Done. I mean can't they look at the resume first before putting someone through the grinder? That's just a waste of everyone's time.

I think when you try to get a job at a ""hot"" company (I've had a negative experience interviewing for a job at Blizzard as well), they tend to make you jump through hoops. I supposed they have tons of people trying get jobs there, so they have to do what they have to do. But as far as interviews go, I tend to be treated much nicer at smaller companies, although they also tend to not ask any technical questions, which makes their interviews very easy (personality test basically, and I can pass that very easily because I don't act like a software engineer... sorry software engineers).

The most practical interviews I've had were at Western Digital and Toshiba. Their intervews were techncial, reasonably difficult, but very relevant. But hey, I'm sure everyone's experiences are different.

Never say never, but at this point, I'd think twice before I submit my resume to Google or Blizzard. But it's not like that's any loss to Google or Blizzard anyway.

Either way, I'm not going to downvote anyone just becuase I don't agree with them. You have your experiences and it's 100% valid.","1393633082"

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","Well, that woman last summer would likely have a lot more outrage if she had just killed her kids and not herself. The public would definitely be looking for her head on a platter. However looking at what she did, I don't think just killing her kids was ever the M.O.. I would be willing to bet that killing herself was the the goal, but the thought of leaving her children to face the world that she couldn't was not an option, so she 'took them with her'. Unfortunately, I know a woman that has has told me specifically that she wants to kill herself, but can't do it because she can't leave her kids. After seeing this woman last summer, somewhere in the back of my head I can't help but think that the kids might just end up going with my friend if she ever decides to leave.

Back to Vince though. Sure there are people that just want 'justice' or 'revenge' but that doesn't mean that there aren't very serious concerns about everyone's safety with simply releasing Vince. Most people with mental illness aren't running around in the streets killing people. Vince has demonstrated that sans-medication, the limit of what he is capable of doing is fairly violent murder. He didn't just put a pillow over the guy's head, he took the time and effort to cut his head off with a knife and carry it. This puts him in a very unique, very small category of people that are mentally ill. If he ever gets fully released, who is going to be monitoring him to make sure he takes his medication every single day? Who is going to have the compassion to look after him and also have the strength to pick up the phone and call the authorities a year later when he wants to stop his medication because he feels that he is cured and doesn't need it anymore? The fact is that he killed someone and that means for the rest of his life, he has lost a level of freedom enjoyed by everyone else regardless of how sick he really was when he did it. The risks are too high to simply let him loose without closely being monitored.

You just called farmers idiots. Do you have any idea how complex farming has become over the course of the last 75 years? People have different aptitudes and interests, that, by no stretch of the imagination, means they are un-intelligent. Some of my best friends and co-workers have masters degrees in Agriculture and I know plenty of people working in the trades that would run circles around most 4-year degree types when it comes to math and understanding engineering. The average public school teacher would get destroyed in a conversation when it comes to soil science, water resource science, biology and ecology compared to the ""idiot"" farmers you just spoke of. 

You may understand how to teach and that is a skill that I will admit not everyone has, but to discredit everyone that falls outside of academia is just unbelievably obtuse. The way the German system is set up does not filter people in to groups based on intelligence. It separates people based on their aptitude and interests, HUGE difference. 

Having earned a bachelor degree at a well respected university in a difficult course of study, I can say first hand that American universities are really, really easy. I didn't work my ass off to earn my degree, I went to class and did the homework. I got a great GPA in a selective field and have been able to parlay that into a good career working for the state government in a position that takes a myriad of skills and abilities. I also went to a private school for grade school and my base of education carried me all the way through my bachelors. My public school cohorts weren't dumber than me, they just had a crappier base to work with and since I went to a public high school and a public university, they never caught up to me.

The whole issue is that you need to be smart about how much you borrow, and make some sacrifices to pay it back. Does that mean you might not be able to buy a brand new car right out of college? Yes.

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Hello,

I used to play hardcore. What colors are you currently playing with? What tips are you look for? Deck building? Rules?

I played every colors in the past, but I mostly stick with red. I recommend starting with the main strategy of the deck and then move onto staple cards for the fundamental deck-building. 

It sounds like your friends are just starting off. Casual plays are more forgiven with deck and its strategy. In competitive plays, every card in the deck must help the overall strategy, and by following this rule, one can build a killer deck.

Staple cards are the usual and very-usable cards in their respected color(s). They can also be used for different decks. For example, some of red's staple cards are [Lightning Bolt](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Lightning-Premium-Series/dp/B0062DXNXK) and [Rift Bolt](http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Rift-Modern-Masters/dp/B00D64HO7O).

To look for more staple cards, you can check out the meta database from all the competitive plays and results on [mtG Decks Database](http://mtgtop8.com).

For your other friend who is deciding between blue and green. Have him/her explore the cards and decks for both colors. He/She should be able to figure out what he want to play with and not play with. Are there any specific cards that he/she wants to play with? A specific strategy for winning? Maybe he wants to play with both and end up with a blue and green deck!

Oh yeah, buying the single cards is easier (and usually cheaper) than trying to pull them from a new booster pack.

If you all are playing fairly different colors, consider chipping-in a get a fat-pack, and split all the cards by colors. Just have an agreement on who gets the rares and stuff before buying and opening. Or just split the nine booster packs and trade each other from there. You could even do a booster draft for fun in the process of opening the boosters. Fat-packs give the best-bang for the money (about $30 to $35). Also, good rares!","1393633093"

-Make quickdraw boost last a second longer, making his late game decent

Tesla pays it workers well, it also re-hired many of the workers who were laid off when the UAW screwed up the negotiations with Toyota that caused the Nummi plant to be shut down. Why in god's green earth would anyone at Nummi want to unionize? Exactly what benefit would it bring to those workers that would make them want to accept a union tax on their wages????

Oh and the UAW is not like the German unions and neither is the US (along with Fremont, CA or Detriot) like Germany. Neither is Tesla anywhere near run like GM, Ford or Chrysler in comparison, etc. Again in the end if the UAW cannot present a tangible compelling reason for these workers to unionize then they should in no way accept UAW siphoning a portion of their wages for a false sense of security and a adversarial union that protects incompetent workers and which eventually would run Tesla into the ground. Which would also eventually kill the only all electric car company in the US or force it to relocate out of California to a Southern state with right to work laws, or have it automate at a faster rate or worse force it to relocate overseas, etc.

For normal people it may work great, but we're not normal people.  I tried keto over the summer and found a little success however, it was very difficult to maintain my calorie requirements.  A better lifestyle change to drop a few pounds and keep it off is Lean Gains/Intermittent Fasting.  It's exactly what it's name sounds like: fasting for certain periods of time.  In the guide it's suggested you go with a 8 hour feeding window when you can eat anything you want just long as it fits your calorie requirements but in the other 16 hours, only water, coffee, gum and other calorie free foods.  Personally, I like it a lot.  It takes a little while to get used to, but it's really easy after a few weeks.  Training wise, it won't affect it unless you don't get enough.  I do 2-a-days with the morning session fasted and it feels great.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me or head on over to /r/leangains ","1393633096"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","OK, uncut male here.

The length of foreskin will determine whether it retracts as he becomes erect. If it doesn't, be careful when pulling it back, some are too tight to go back when the penis is erect. Do not force it, that really hurts. Just pull it back as far as it wants to go.

Also, you don't have to always hold it back. There's a lot of nerve endings in there, so you can vary things by leaving it forward sometimes, and pulling back other times.

I see you know about the sensitivity issue. It's like having something bandaged up for a while; it's more sensitive when the bandage comes off because it's not used to so much stimulation. I'm told it varies from person to person. Go easy until you know how much he likes/can take.

Apart from that, there's not really that much difference. We have the same range of likes and dislikes as cut guys. Experiment. One thing an ex of mine did the first couple of times was have me in control, telling her what to do, how and when. She did this whole little tongue in cheek subservient slave girl thing. I've been using a variation on that trick to learn new ladies' likes and dislikes ever since. :)

I hope it all goes well for both of you.

The problem with Conference-room type scenarios, is the ever unpredictable diversity of devices a person (or vendor/visitor) might want to hook up.  

* Different brands of devices have different hot-keys to toggle video-out. (some it's FN-F5.. some it's FN-F8.. some vary by not only by hot-key but also by video-driver settings). 

* Different hardware has different ports. You're potentially going to get VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, Mini-DisplayPort.

* Even if they have the right adapters.... is everything going to work correctly?.. I've seen some hardware-combinations just not cooperate with certain adapters. (especially if you're converting from analog-to-digital (IE = VGA to HDMI,etc) 

The smart employees in our organization are the ones who schedule a pre-test (to make sure everything works)... or schedule to have someone from IT there 30min before the meeting starts so we can make sure everything works. Obviously those options aren't possible in every situation,.. but that's what we've resorted to doing. Typically once a Secretary or workgroup gets burned by ""bad planning"" once or twice.. they learn the lesson and either buy their own adapters,etc or start planning ahead.

"bravelydefault","t5_2u1oz","I think it is feasible to do it level 50+. However, I think Enigma (Spiritmaster) and Rampart (Templar) are mandatory; 1 of each or just 2 of one kind. All dragon breath abilities are nullified by both which gives you a window to put in damage.

I think I did all the dragons at 51 with this setup without using any SP or Friend Summons:

1. Spiritmaster/White Mage: Healing and Enigma bot. Emergency Rejuvenation special with the revive option in case things go awry.
2. Templar/Pirate: Rampart when necessary and damage
3. Performer/Ninja: Buffs and damage 
4. Black Mage/Time Mage: Main damage source

Basically, just learn to manage your BP so that you don't get caught off guard with the Eye + Breath combo while you're trying to recover (Performer and Red Mage passives help). Also, some dragons have status effects so make sure you either have proper items/Immunity passives. ","1393633102"

You can't beads Tyr's 1, he chunks almost all your hp if you're a squishy, his 1+2 combo does more then most ultimate's, He has 3 escapes, doesn't care about cc, and has massive defenses. Just because me and the adc of my clan can clean house doesn't mean everyone can, and frankly I don't think people should have to.

If staff is willing to step the fuck up and say ""ok, you put mission first and said no to sick call ... truck got damaged ... we'll set it all aside and get pushing"" and the Expediter said ok, and everything continued.     
Cool.

But if the Expediter and staff are gunning for other people. Just looking for other targets to point the finger at, to place them blame on ....
Fuck them. Fuck that. The finger point bullshit and CYA cowardice has got to go. And if that means expediters and staff get their walking orders, good fucking riddance.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Shit, is that all? 

Reason I say is this: Us population is roughly 10x that of Canada i.e. 350 vs 35 (million)

As a result, quite often comparisons between the two countries end up being a factor of 10.

So by this logic either Canada should have roughly 140K full-time personnel OR the US should only have 68K to match Canadian spending.

Now let's look at military spending. Canada: 22.5b US: 682b So the US' spending if effectively triple Canadas (using the rule of 10). This actually makes sense though because the US has extensive capabilities that Canada doesn't (great example - aircraft carriers). Plus the US is carrying the development costs of major new equipment such as the F-35 (and Canada's commitment to that platform is withering. There's no money given to the program, just a pseudo-commitment to buy them eventually. maybe.)","1393633111"
