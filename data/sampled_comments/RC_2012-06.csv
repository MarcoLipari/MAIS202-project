"pics","t5_2qh0u","Once again, as an American, it's a very skewed and media-heavy relationship I have. My mother woke up incredibly early (6AM our time, I believe) to watch Charles and Diana's, and did the same with William and Kates. I caught the actually vows, and I noticed that THIS is what a King and Queen should look like. William is a man of his people, I feel. He went to a college like a normal human being, spent time in the military like a commoner, and it seems he has many friends that are not royal. As someone that doesn't know him, but can simply just view it from across an ocean, I hope he becomes the ruler some day. He, unlike his idiot of a father, seems brilliant. 

I have to agree that his mother played a massive role in this, but realize, those children were small when Diana died, but damn it, she was fantastic, and I think that, IIRC, Diana herself was a commoner. 

While many traditionalists would say this is bad, every few generations NEEDS a commoner to the throne, in my opinion. What better way to know exactly how you, the figurehead of a HUGE country, can connect to your people, then having someone who lived outside a palace in your court?

All in all, as an American, I find British royality to be fascinating. The family, short of Charles for being an idiot, a bigot, and generally related to a tick (A bloodsucking leech, with no use), seems brilliant, and almost normal, like, the kind of person that would invite you over for a spot of tea.","1338508802"

"MECoOp","t5_2tkk1","I haven't played too much today, but from what I've seen I think this rumored ""N7 filter"" is true. Earlier I ended up in a game with three people, the lowest of which at N7 900-some. Moments ago, I ended up with two people within 20 N7 of me and an inability to find a fourth teammate.

This strikes me as a horrible, horrible idea and may honestly drive me away from the game. I don't understand how filtering matchmaking by rank, with no option on the player's end to remove that filter, effectively fragmenting the player base could be seen by anyone as a good idea. I don't care what level my teammates are, whether they are rank 5000 or rank 50; as long as they are playing and have a basic understanding of what to do, I'm fine. But apparently the game believes I should be playing with people near to my level (N7 1154 at the moment) and that doing so is more important than getting a lobby filled up in a timely manner. If I wanted to be picky about my teammates, I'd make some friends instead of playing randoms.

Pro-tip, guys who just shove their hands down your pants are disgusting, and not worth your time.

Second, if a relationship leads with sex, don't be surprised if it ends there too.  If you are looking for more than that, lead with more than that.  If a guys bolts when you don't put out, he was going to bolt afterwards anyway.

The best sex is had between two people who mutually respect each other, and like each others company regardless.  Tell anyone who pushed you to fuck off.

Kaalia's strategy is very aggro heavy and it doesn't really always jive with the diplomatic nature of edh. (Or rather, it does, but it requires a lot more thinking and talking than other decks)

Stigles is right though.. you can win edh without ever bothering to build a great deck.. just a playable one.

I don't really suggest purchasing a top that won't fit you correctly... but if you insist...

If you're actively swimming in the ocean, I might go for a 32C, because a tight band is really important to battle the waves. If you're lounging, I'd go for a 34C, because it is technically a ... *sigh*.... ""sister size"" (Add one size to your band/cup and subtract it from the other). They don't tend to fit well, because they aren't your size, but they're sort of equivalent (if, say, your bras are a bit tight you may have a 33"" rib cage, putting you between sizes.

Any time you buy a top that's not your size, however, you will find that it won't fit as well and you may end up returning it or hating it. The best choice would be to find a bathing suit elsewhere.

It helps soften abrasions from a pipes finish if they have been scratched, dropped, dented or otherwise damaged in some way, and it helps bring luster back to a dulled finish just like a rubbing compound does for a car finish when being detailed. It also helps on rusticated pipes if you've gotten some kind of foreign substances lodged or etched into the rustication pattern. I've been smoking a pipe since I was 18 and I am 46 now, and it's always worked for me in the past.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;The economy is man made, we made it to ensure to ourselves a decent quality of life.

I don't have a background in economics or economic history, but this sounds a bit like a just-so story.  I don't think economic systems were put in place explicitly for human-flourishing in an idealized sense.  At best, I think you can say that the economy allows for individuals or groups to trade goods/services/labour for goods/services/labour they would not have had originally.  It aims at well-being, but only in an attenuated sense.

&gt;But by asking such a question, it seems like he's putting the economy above everything else... (...) It bothers me since he doesn't see that ""the economy"" is just an instrument, an invention to improve our lives... it's not an end.

But that's entirely the point of the boss's position.  Boss (I'll just use ""Boss"" as a proper noun here because typing he/she is getting cumbersome) isn't asking what liberal arts can do for politics; Boss is asking what it can do for the economy, as a national benefit.  People working and producing/consuming/trading is a part of the economy, and they function as instruments within the economy.  Let's put it another way: what good is studying philosophy if it doesn't lead to a job directly?  Why go tens of thousands of dollars into debt on somethings that probably won't have direct returns on the investment?  This is why liberal arts get's such a bad wrap - training in the sciences and trades is seen as more useful because there is a more explicit end-game.  How many people go to tertiary education in the liberal arts and then get employment in their field?  This is further compounded by there being no explicit ""philosophy"" jobs.  And you can't make the comparison with famous thinkers like Locke, Smith, Newton, etc.  Those thinkers lived in a time where there wasn't a demarcation between philosophy and science (political, economic, physical, etc).  Those sub-disciplines broke off from philosophy and started getting their own funding.  

There is a comment elsewhere in this thread that references that knowledge not shared or useful outside of the academy is not very good knowledge (practically speaking).  At the end of the day, you can think about well-being, metaphysics, or even ethics all you want.  But unless you are privately wealthy, have a patron, or also work for wages, you probably won't live very long without working within the economy.  If you do not possess skills and abilities that are demanded by someone else, you are of no use to anybody.  This is not to say philosophy students can't be of use, or their skills/abilities/knowledge isn't in demand; but it does seriously call into their question to directly adapt them into modern time.

I feel like I should mention that I disagree with Boss's assertion; I just think the response above doesn't give an adequate response that would satisfy their objections.  I'm playing devil's advocate.","1338508847"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You cannot let your parents dictate such large decisions in your life. You're an adult and if you allow them to sway you in this, you're giving them power over you and your happiness. That's something you can't give to them, and it's not fair for them to expect it. You need to simply tell them that this is how it's going to be, and they can love and accept their son for who he is or not. **Do not let them make you feel guilty.** If they decide they can't ""live with it"" and will ""have to"" cut you out of their life **that is on them**, **not you.** Parents have an amazing talent for making their kids feel guilty about things like this and it is completely their own doing. 

Obviously you have to make the decision that is right for you, but that's how I see it. I think if a person is willing to disown their own child for the sake of anything like this (religion, race, sexuality, etc.) they deserve to be cut off. I don't believe in this type of ""conditional love"" when it comes to your kids and I think it's completely abhorrent of your dad to treat you this way. But as I haven't had it happen to me, I can't know how it feels. I really can't say ""Tell your dad to screw off"" because I know how hard that would be. It really boils down to what you're willing to lose. 

**One piece of advice I will give you: you should tell your girlfriend.** It'll definitely wound her, but I think this issue is probably too big to keep from her for very long. It might hurt her more if you keep it a secret until the breaking point, while she is obliviously thinking everything is hunky dory. This goes double if you're thinking about leaving her for this. It's not really fair to blindside her. At least give her an idea of the issue since it effects you both. Besides, she might have some great insight on this. Good luck, man. This is a shitty situation all around and I hope you can work it out.

He's a grown man and a professional sportsman. I think he can handle it, we aren't here to mollycoddle him. I'm sure he wouldn't like the criticism too much, but all the ""you're the best!"" spirit in the world won't help him improve. If he's shit, we're calling it.




Why shouldn't they be upset at the inclusion of Henderson? He's not good enough. No offence but England is a footballing nation, we expect more than the USA and so don't share the same carefree attitude. I'm a bit at a loss for your mention of the group thing, it seems a bit selective memory. I don't mean to be rude, but the whole go yankees attitude thing hasn't really helped you in the last 100 years of being a vastly inferior footballing nation. England has incredibly passionate fans, but like I said, they are also very critical. This is not a bad thing, but when the media jumps on it and starts killing them it does get out of hand and is certainly not a good thing for team morale or performance. I do put a lot of blame on recent performance on the media and how they handled it.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95","&gt; That almost sounds like something Microsoft would do!

Well... yeah. Though to be fair, Microsoft does come up with some cool prototypes and ideas before they scrap them and disappoint us all.

&gt; That monstrosity has five buttons right below the screen, and the ring might even be a directional pad. Would I be wrong if I assumed that those weren't just there for show?

I used to have the Dell Axim X30. They're mostly for show. They're supposed to be useful, but completely unnecessary.

&gt; You answered my question with ""Windows Mobile"" when the correct answer would have been ""none"".

Probably. I'm sure Windows Mobile isn't that unique either and it's built off work that other companies and people have done. When it comes to large ass corporate suit douche companies like Apple, they DO NOT INVENT. They do not have the ability to invent. They do not have the environment to allow people to be creative and invent. They do not attract inventive people. THEY DO have money, and can buy up (or muscle out with legal warfare) the naive and optimistic tiny companies made of creative and energized people before they suck them dry.

There are very few corporations that are ""human"" and usually it's because of the CEO and the leadership. Strong and compassionate people at the top of the foodchain means a human and decent company. There are very few.","1338508879"

"science","t5_mouw","No, but your ad hominem attack on Jenny McCarthy smacked of someone defending the pharmaceutical firms—as if they were the good guys and we should never, ever question their judgment.

Well, many smart people question their judgment. Harvard University questions their judgment. Yale questions their judgment. The prestigious medical journal JAMA questions their judgment.

So it's not ""random loons"". Talk about straw men arguments.

""Anyone who questions 38 vaccines versus 11 is a loon! So what if if that's what we had in the 1990s and no mass extinction occurred? 38? Why not 48? 58? 108? The pharmaceutical corporations need to make more money. So keep the shots coming.""

Talk about lunacy.

It's all about moderation. A little potassium is good for you. A *lot* pf potassium will kill you. A little aspirin will help your headache, a *lot* of aspirin will cause death.

This ridiculous premise that if a few shots is okay, than 58 will be even better is childlike. It's the logic of a simpleton.

If there were no mass extinctions back in the 1990s, then no one should be reviled, or held up to public excoriation for suggesting that we revisit that regimen.

It's not unreasonable.

If it's true what that article said--talking about the University of Pittsburgh's study of autism on monkeys--then we should all be shocked: No prior testing of the auto-immune response to a baby (with its weak immune system) being exposed to 8 pathogens in a single day had been done?

WTF!

No animal testing???

The FDA and the pharmaceutical corporations just pushed the new drugs under the brilliant reasoning that if a little is good, a whole lot could only be better?

As I said: That's a simpleton's logic.

And it's uttered in the accents of greed and corruption.

You take it about an hour before the speech and all it does is stop your body from reacting to adrenaline. No shaky voice, no pounding heart, no butterflies, nothing. I couldn't believe how well it worked.

Of course, the only way to really overcome a fear of public speaking is to do it over and over again. But this drug can definitely be a huge help in that endeavor.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;As your formula shows, natural selection is a lot messier and is very unlikely to make a good choice except when the change in fitness is very drastic.

This formula shows what happens in large scales and over long periods of time. Natural selection is actually incredibly clean over those periods- it's only when you try to look at things at the individual level that it becomes messy. On the timescales and population levels for human populations, the equations clearly show that small changes in fitness have large effects and are much more likely to go to fixation. So absolutely not: those equations clearly show how small changes persist and have an effect over a long period of time. 

&gt;They're so rare that it's not going to make a difference. 

The concept of a [selective sweep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_sweep) would be good for you to see. Rare beneficial mutations *zoom* through the gene pool. Common deleterious ones trudge, and have to compete against the far more common neutral alleles, and usually wither and die. Think in terms of populations, not individuals. Even though beneficial mutations are rare, they are extremely important.

&gt;plant geneticist John Sanford

Given that he's a creationist and his theories are pretty roundly rejected by his peers, you're going to have to do better than a quote from that guy. What source is that from?

Anyway, even accepting that statement, note that this is about *crop improvement*, not an increase in fitness. These two things are pretty much in no way related. In fact, when it comes to domesticated crops, ""fitness"" really doesn't even apply anymore. Domesticated crops are already way at the edge of what's possible; they've had thousands of years of selective pressure from humans applied already. Even if mutations didn't increase crop yields, all that seems to show is that crops are as highly optimized for yield as you're going to get.

Try the same thing with, say, bacteria. Guess what happens every time we come up with new antibiotics? They evolve, and the beneficial mutations of antibiotic resistance explode throughout local populations. This is how drug resistance works.

&gt;Bergman (2004) has studied the topic of beneficial mutations. Among other things, he did a simple literature search via Biological Abstracts and Medline. He found 453,732 ‘mutation’ hits, but among these only 186 mentioned the word ‘beneficial’ (about 4 in 10,000). When those 186 references were reviewed, almost all the presumed ‘beneficial mutations’ were only beneficial in a very narrow sense.

You don't think this might be because, say, most studies are done on genetic diseases and other harmful mutations because they're more interesting to us? Again, note what I said earlier: *everything that works in us was a beneficial mutation at one point.* Try looking up a paper that measures rates of beneficial spontaneous mutation or something similar. [Here's a random one that I found with 5 seconds of google](http://www.genetics.org/content/185/4/1397.full.pdf). In that Google search, I also turned up [this](http://letterstocreationists.wordpress.com/stan-3-3/) website, which seems to say a lot of what I want to about the definition of ""fitness"" and ""beneficial"" and what it means for mutations and evolution.

&gt;Wikipedia [1] provides a list of those that have achieved enough fixation to be noted in medical journals.

""Fixation"" is a technical term. It means that an allele has so dominated as population that no other alleles exist. Not a single one of these mutations are fixed in any relevant sense, except perhaps in extremely specific populations of humans.

&gt;I await your response with the tally of entries in the database of human superpowers

If you want superhuman powers, I can list several people. Lance Armstrong, for example, or Michael Phelps. Examine their bodies, and you find things like massive hearts. Albert Einstein's brain also has certain features that are presumably genetic. I'm not sure how much those increased fitness, though- fitness is not measured by ability, but by reproductive success. Einstein, as intelligent as he was, was probably less fit than the average individual.

&gt;But, the problem is that even the fittest members are accumulating deleterious mutations, and everyone suffers in a different way.

Once again, that's not a problem. If you argument is that mutational load increases indefinitely until a population collapses, I've already explained why that's simply not true. With math. Everybody has deleterious mutations, a few of them are fixed, and that's just peachy. Other evolutionary forces balance it out.

&gt;This is a circular argument. We're debating whether humans evolved from apes, and you're using ""since we evolved from apes"" in your premise.

What you're doing is saying ""evolution can't explain X,"" and I'm saying ""yeah, it can."" That means I get to use stuff in evolutionary theory. You're trying to attack a perceived weakness in evolutionary theory- I can use other parts of it to explain why this isn't a weakness.","1338508900"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The point, as I interpret it, was that certain elements of our societies and institutions have shifted to be dangerously hostile to men, and that *this is not OK.* The fact that men used to get away with abusing women was horrible. The fact that men used to be able to leave women penniless in a separation was horrible. The fact that women can now drop a police hammer on innocent men is horrible. The fact that women can now leave men bankrupt and childless in a divorce is horrible.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Others have written really good responses here, so just a quick note.  

The question you've asked here is the reason that [Herodotus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus) is simultaneously called the ""Father of history"" and more derisively the ""Father of lies."" He took pains -- or so he says -- to try to separate fact from fiction in the stories he was told concerning distant lands, people, and important political successions. If a story seemed too outlandish, he commented and said so, and yet at the same time it's become obvious that other things he was willing to accept as factual were not in fact the truth. We are actually still making archaeological discoveries right now that both add to and detract from Herodotus' reliability, so -- regardless of whether you believe him or not -- you can't count him out.

At the same time, how and what he wrote, regardless of whether it was true, is an important clue concerning what an educated Greek might have known of the world during his time. No matter how unreliable *any* writer is, they're still a product of their culture and their time, and sometimes it's just as interesting to see what someone is tempted to lie about and why.

Herodotus and his time aren't my area of specialty, but he's often used as a quick introduction to budding historians as an example of the fundamental problems we have writing history.","1338508902"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","First, your parents marriage is their own to deal with.  You should not feel at all swayed by their transparent attempt to manipulate you with them remaining together.  

Second, ask yourself **HONESTLY** are you prepared to live without your family members who are opposed to this relationship for the rest of the time you're seeing this woman?  

You can only control your half of the relationship with your family.  

You've said it yourself you will not change your fathers mind or the family's position on this.  So that leaves it to you to make the decision as to which is more important to you: being with your GF or having a relationship with your family.  

Fuck what everyone else says you have to go with how **YOU FEEL** here.  Its easy for Reddit to armchair this and say ""Fuck your family, your dad is a racist prick, you don't need him"" because we do not have to deal with the consequences.  

It doesn't make you racist or an asshole if you choose your family and it doesn't make you better than anyone if you choose her over your family.  Either way you lose.  

So do what will make you happy and ignore everyone else.","1338508909"

Colloquial language tends to 'progress'--not in terms of academic value or intelligence level but rather pertaining to a language's users' need for something new--but many people, especially with swear words, get tired of the same old same old. This is why many people find unique or creative ways to swear to be hilarious (talking more about film right here). The word 'cunt' does imply degradation towards women, but so too does the word 'bitch', and yet one is considered more severe than the other. The more a swear word is used, the less intense its meaning and/or connotation becomes. Words, like fashion trends, go in and out of style, and swear words are no different. ","1338508913"

I have known people that know that they can't have extensive exercise or any at all and for that reason they control how much they eat and what they eat so they don't get heavy which will make their condition much worse. There is also cases in which medication makes almost imposible not to gain weight even if they take care.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Natural talent exists, this is a point aside from the OP really, I have no opinions regarding Jinro being mediocre, I think he's a good player.

but what really bothers me is people thinking that Natural talent doesn't exist. even in the thread of my root sculpture people say stuff like ""well he has a degree in art"" the truth is I won a drawing contest when I was 4 and I won a bicycle, truth is I had -1- sculpting class and I was better than everyone with materials none of us had ever used. Truth is Stephano has less background and less time played than a lot of people who are in bronze and silver. Minigun with ZERO RTS experience got placed into GOLD the first time he picked up sc2 and then within a few months he had archieved top 1-5 in grandmaster plenty of times. in elementary, middle and highschool, me and 90% of my class (160 people) played soccer every break, but there were people who were SIGNIFICANTLY better than others regardless of shape or amount of time put into it. there were kids in soccer academies not as good as lazy kids who'd never want to play. truth is I LOVE music as you can see im always singing and stuff, but as much as I tried, I SUCK SHIT at music instruments, while 2 of my friends really got into playing guitar and they played together all the time, one of them became incredibly good, the other one was so far behind he switched to playing the bass even though he played as much or more guitar as my other friend, who was significantly better. some people are just faster, some people can never be too fast, some people are smarter, there are different types of intelligence, don't say natural talent doesn't exist because im sure everyone has different talents in different areas. is talent everything? ABSOLUTELY NOT, but it certainly is a HUGE asset, anyone who says natural talent doesn't exist is retarded. When I first played stephano before he got 'famous' I told coL to pick him up, because he didn't just mechanically outplay me, but because his thought process and decision making and understanding of the game were amazing, because I felt helpless when I first played against him and when I watched the replay and talked to him it showed how talented he was and how much potential he had. at the time compLexity was trying to pickup Naniwa, who is a fantastic player, obviously more expensive than stephano and also incredibly talented, but I said, go make the same offer to stephano, it'll pay off. I never talked to stephano to see how much practice or how many hours a day he was gonna play to see if he was gonna be one of the best, just saw a ton of potential and raw talent, period. Same shit for everyone we invited to ROOT, of course commitment is incredibly important as well, but we scouted for talent, got a group of UNKNOWNS back in the day: qxc, CauthonLuck, KiWiKaKi, Sheth, drewbie, Slush, Minigun, Destiny, etc sorry if im skipping anyone. now KiWiKaKi was big in wc3, which i didn't know at the time. Sheth had some bw background as chosen nothing gigantic, the rest are all relative unknowns and all went onto become some of the best players in NA. sure we practiced, sure we had similar goals, but that doesn't mean that I could've picked anyone at random and had the best team in NA as an outcome a few months later, with 0 budget. go check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKhmFSV-XB0 she sings better than formally trained singers at what? 10? there have been people training their voices for longer than that girl has been alive and they can't do that shit. Denying the existence of NATURAL TALENT is just really stupid, go acknowledge that, identify YOUR OWN strengths and talents and exploit them, if your dad told you ""natural talent doesn't exist son!"" its probably cause you SUCKED SHIT at baseball and he wanted to encourage you somehow, dont be dumb. sorry huge wall of text, this shit pops out more often than i'd like and irritates me.","1338508928"

"funny","t5_2qh33","In my senior year of high school my final project in World Literature was a group project.  We were to make a video project based around one of the books we read during the year.  Easy enough, except our groups were selected at random. 

This would turn out to be a disaster.

Of everyone in our group not a single person owned a video camera.
So, I spent the first of our three weeks begging people to borrow a video camera.  

I spent the second week trying to get the other three people to meet to film the video and discuss the project. One kept delaying, one wouldn't respond, and the third wouldn't meet without everyone.

On the first day of our third and final week, I managed to get the group to meet at one of their homes.  I prepared a script and write up for our video project, brought a costume.  
We met during the day, but they couldn't get it together to start filming until it was dark, so we lost our light.
We filmed anyway.

After filming a small fraction of our video, one group member demands a break, so we went inside.  Inside we all sat on her couch while she went to grab something from upstairs.  What she grabbed was a pillowcase of weed.  I've never seen so much in one location, and I stared in horror as my group descended on it like animals.  

I stood up and left.  

I didn't even show up for the final presentation.  

During the graduation ceremony I sat directly next to my World Lit teacher.  He leaned over and told me that he understands exactly why I wasn't there and that I didn't have to worry about it, and that was that.  

I hate group projects, but I love smart teachers. ","1338508934"

"AfterEffects","t5_2rc1h","I'm more of a 3D guy specializing in modeling with the occasional render (and texture/lighting work that goes with it), so I'm not the most qualified guy out there for this, but I'll try and offer some advice.  I'm also not going to be able to cover ever single shot shown in the video, but I'll try and cover as much as I can.


First of all, this stuff, as has already sort of been said, but this stuff is on the far end of beginner level.  But that's okay, everyone has to start somewhere and sometime.  Very few people are going to be masters right off the bat (and even if they have a natural talent for it, they'll obviously have to come grips with the particular software, etc). 


If you're the kid in the lightning example, that's great, because you're off to a decent start for being so young.  Age doesn't necessarily make a *huge* difference, but the younger you are, the better off you'll be, simply because you'll have more time to hone your skills before you look to really go pro.  That said, even if you are 30 years old, or however old, it won't necessarily bar you from realizing your goals, it just means you've got less of a head start.  

Now with that in mind, like I said, this is really beginner level stuff at best.  As such, I wouldn't even entertain the notion of showing this off for any other reason than to get feedback to learn from.  In other words, I wouldn't even consider showing this to anyone as a demo reel in order to try and obtain a job.  

Now that said, **lose the music**.  Whether it's for critique or a demo reel, you have absolutely no need for that music.  This is probably the number one thing you'll hear the most when showing your own stuff, or looking at other people's demo reels or WIPs.  There's a reason for that, and it's because no one gives a shit about your taste in music.  To me, it's the equivalent of pointing your speakers out your window to show off your taste in music, or if in a car, rolling the windows down and blaring the music so others can hear what you like.  The vast majority of demo reels in a professional environment are viewed with the sound muted.  If they haven't already muted it, you can be sure they will once they hear your music.  Even if they like your music, that is not going to influence anyone into hiring you or impressing them.  Really, just about the only exception for music is when it's integral to what you're actually showing.  And I don't mean that in a ""hey, check out this song, it goes really well with the video"".  I mean that the music should only be used if it's actually part of the video.  So if you  were trying to show off a music video, made especially for a specific song, you'd naturally want to include the music.  But you're not showing a music video, you're showing a demo reel.  As such, you're showcasing your visual skills.  Or, if you're showing off something like lip syncing, then obviously you'll want to include the audio track.  If you're for example, taking a sample off a movie, TV show, etc, of an actor/actress speaking, and there's background music, that's fine.  Or, if you're showing off something with sound FX, depending on the circumstances, that can be perfectly acceptable as well.  I guess what I'm saying in this big long ramble is that you should not add any necessary sound.  


Okay, sorry about that ramble.  But if you'll forgive me another ramble, I'll get to your actual work in the process of rambling.

**So, on to the lightning part:**  It's okay.  Well, it's a bit more than okay, but it's nothing particularly noteworthy. (Here begins the ramble)  This is perfectly acceptable for showing for the purpose of critiquing and learning. But one thing to consider in the future, when you are ready to prepare a demo reel, is that you should only show your very best.  Do not add filler to make it longer.  It's better to have a very short real of amazing work, than it is to have a longer reel that's been padded with your mundane work.  Also, you want to show your best stuff first.  A lot of people like to build up to their best work, but really, you want to wow them right off the bat.  You need to catch their attention immediately.  A lot of time, those who will be watching your demo reel will be watching a lot of them.  You can't afford to bore them right off the bat, as they'll be very quick to hit stop and move on to the next reel.  Never assume they'll watch the whole thing.  

Okay, now is where I'll really try to focus on the specific work at hand.  So what do I mean by the lightning part being just OK?  Well, for starters, lightning, from my admittedly limited experience in watching these kind of demo/critique reels, lightning is probably one of the most common subject matters I've encountered.  That's fine, but you'll want to really make it stand out because of the ""cliche"" nature of it.  For starters, the lightning looks very clearly as being FX instead of looking real or natural.  Now of course, it's not natural for someone to have lightning coming from their hands.  But the point of VFX is to make it look it like is actually natural and real.  The problem I have with this particular instance is that the lightning doesn't generate any actual light.  The lightning should be casting some kind of light.  When he first casts the lightning, the room lightens a bit, but it's clear that this not a result of the lightning casting light, but rather just the camera automatically adjusting exposure settings and such (the room doesn't darken again when the lightning goes away) Fortunately, the lightning is not a point light source, so you can get away with faking some general ambient light.  Try masking out the kid and applying some lighting to him that's generated from the lightning.  It doesn't have to be a lot, but just a little bit would go a long ways.  In fact, you could probably just mask out a small area around the kid's chest/torso and by his hands and such, instead of tediously masking out every single part of him.  Furthermore, and maybe it's just because it's sort of washed out in the relative brightness of the mirror, but I see no reflection in the mirror of the lightning, even though the kid's hand is visible at times in the mirror.   






**The bump map shot:**  I honestly don't really see the point of this exercise.  Well, I get the point of doing it in general, but not really showing it off.  It's just that basic.  But to try and help a little bit:  At least lose the lens flare, or lessen it dramatically.  The focus is the bump mapping and how it is affected by the changing lighting.  Now, the lens flare can be useful in showing the direction of the light, but it's a bit too much.  In regards to the simplicity of it all, instead of just showing such a basic idea, try showing it in a practical application of the technique.  Give us an example of how it can be used in a real world application.  


**The clock shot:** Again, this is just so simple I'm not even really sure where to begin.  Sometimes things are just so simple and basic, that's it's hard to know what to even say about it.  It's like if someone posted to a fine art subreddit and asked for critiques and advice on a stick figure.  But for one thing, if you didn't specifically say that it's a clock, it's kind of hard to make out exactly what it is.  The poor resolution of the video clip doesn't help, but for example, I can barely make out any numbers (and can't even read them) and can only just barely make out the hands of the clock and even then only in a small window of frames can you even see some semblance of a clock's hands.  Even at fullscreen, the low resolution and simplicity of it all makes it difficult to make anything out.  ","1338508944"

"redorchestra","t5_2rr0a","The best way to counter the people that are picking you off is to stay low and in cap zones until your team has captured right up to their base. Keep an eye for enemies that are nearby and shoot them, but you should never really be visible to the enemy buildings unless your are doing a short bound to the next bit of cover (preferably only do this when you are still in friendly territory). 

If you feel that you have infiltrated unseen and are in a safe enough position to pick someone off that is in the windows of the enemy building, then do so. But make sure to stay low and only expose yourself  little by little, so that you are 100% sure that the portion of your body that is visible is not in the direct line of sight of any combat effective enemies.

I usually take the sewers into the middle of the map and stay low and try to move past enemy lines unnoticed. You will be surprised how many kills you can get if you are in a place that the enemy does not expect you to be. It is well worth the time it takes to get into such a position and you can really reek havoc on the guys that were sniping you previously.","1338508949"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","First of all, thank you for even taking the time to ask about Christianity in a non-argumentative way. I have respect for non-believers and I wish most atheists would share that same respect. We're not all the same. Now as for your questions:

-Why do you believe?
I believe in the Word of God and a relationship with Christ above all else.

-Your thoughts on gay marriage?
It is a constitutional right but needs to stay out of a church. That's all I ask.

-Thoughts on abortion?
Against it. Adoption is always an option. Every baby needs a chance...

-Thoughts on Atheists?
Intelligent individuals with logical reasoning. That's why there is so much confusion when it comes to the bible, though. It is not interpreted by logical reasoning, it is interpreted by the guidance of the Holy Spirit. That is why Jesus spoke primarily in parables.

-What is Christianity to you?
The following of Christ regardless of cultural influence.

-Why do bad things happen to good people?
We live in a physical world with disease and pain. Christians are not exempt from these things. We are even the cause of them sometimes because we are a fallen man. 

-Did God create disease? And why?
Yes. We do not live in the Eden that was meant for us. We live in a world that is damaged and disease is part of that damage. 

-What happens after you die? Or what do you hope to happen?
We spend eternity free from pain or sorrow, worshiping the very God that created the Universe and chose each and every one of us before He created anything else. 

I hope this helps in your search for answers. Please have an open mind to what Christianity really is and not what you see on TV. We're not all hateful, ignorant people. We try our best to love everyone because we are overwhelmed with an unconditional love that consumes us. God bless you TheUnfinishedStory =)","1338508951"

Depending on how skilled your opponents are, your fire can bring a lot of chaos. Many players will lose focus and look for the nearest health pack the second they start burning. Never make them feel safe, fire helps with that. And if a soldier/demo tries to shoot at you in panic, you can get a reflect and destroy the offense alone if you flank and catch them off guard.

The important thing is to be useful to your team and objective, if your roaming does nothing, go back and find a more safe way to be useful. Just experiment with both as a beginner, to get a feel for it and train in different areas. 

The rule often is: If the enemy sees you coming, you will lose. Surprise is your element.","1338508959"

(Oh God I wanted to see Team Dresch, fuck I am still angry) He promptly bought us both wristbands on our 2nd date. His kids cock blocked the show and I felt guilty going alone.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","Tips for maintaining aluminum stove top espresso makers

When you buy a new Moka pot you should throw the first two or three batches of coffee away. To season the new pot well it's best if you leave the brewed coffee in it for one whole day before you discard it.


Wash the Moka pot by hand with plain water. Do not use any detergents and do not scrub it.
Dry the parts with soft cloth. 

Aluminum will corrode if you leave it wet for prolonged periods of time.


Do not store the Moka pot assembled. The reason? If some water gets trapped in the filter and you keep the pot assembled, then the moisture has nowhere to escape and it may cause corrosion.


When you leave your Moka pot unused for a long time, the oily layer may become rancid. If that happens just put in water with a bit of detergent and boil it on the stove top for a while. Then wash it thoroughly. This should remove the rancid oils.

Then I imagined, say, if we can only go on white once, I imagined the black spots as land (bearing in mind you can never go 3 blacks in a row, much as you might like to), with the white spots the bridges. If say, we have to go on black twice, I view the white spots as land as the black spots as longer bridges. If that makes sense.

Viewing the game this way made it much simpler for me.","1338508977"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am not implying that all abortions are abortions of convenience.  If you really didn't get my meaning, allow me to explain:

I consider there to be four kinds of abortions.  They are: abortions medically relevant to the mother's continuing health, abortions for fetuses that can not sustain a minimum quality of life, abortions from pregnancies as a result of rape (or incest), and abortions of convenience.

Abortions of convenience cover reasons like, ""I'm just not ready to be a mother right now,"" ""I'm not ready to shift my focus from me,"" or ""I'm not ready to stop partying and living the good life to settle down and be a mom.""

Medically relevant abortions are totally legit.  When it comes to one life or the other, choosing the one that's already proven it can be healthy seems like the obvious choice.  The others are more muddled.  I can offer a pass for a child that won't ever be able to function well, take care of itself, or who would live in constant pain.  I can also relate to any child that comes as a result of rape, haven't those women suffered enough?

But to end a life because of a completely selfish reason is abhorrent and wrong.  Someone screwed around and created a life.  They *should* do everything they can to help sustain that life at least until birth.  I think it's morally wrong to do otherwise.

That said, I am not in favor of taking personal dominion rights away from women.  I think women have an inalienable right to choose, but I think their pretty shitty people to make that choice for bad reasons.","1338508977"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I would seek a referral to a neurosurgeon or back pain specialist. My PCP and MS neuro had no idea of how to diagnose my DDD. There are several different scenarios that can play out. It can always be a source of irritation, but PT could help with that. Your next steps would be limiting what does irritate it. If that's not an option, steroid injections would be the first step of corrective medicine. When those end up not lasting more than a month, the next step is surgery. DDD can progress slowly or quickly, hardly ever is there a middle ground. DDD often causes bone spurs, hairline fractures, disc protrusions which all can lead to affecting the spinal cord. Once the spinal cord is affected, loss of feeling in the limbs, pain, spasms, all the way to the extreme of losing the use of a limb. My mother's condition worsened so much that she was just made to 'feel comfortable'. Surgery is just too risky, of course, what surgery isn't?

"AfterEffects","t5_2rc1h","**The matte painting shot (of the A-4 Skyhawk jet):**  Unfortunately, this is a pretty poor example of matte painting.  Fortunately, I can offer a bit more of solid advice on this than some of the other shots.  For starters, the clouds don't really match with what should be expected of such a shot of the aircraft.   It's kind of hard to explain for me, but the problem I have with it is that generally, aircraft in flight would be shot with a zoom/telephoto lens.  The clouds on the other hand look like a shot taken with a wide angle lens.  The clouds look like a zoomed out version of a shot that encompasses a much greater portion of the sky.  On the other hand, the aircraft, as I said, would normally be taken with a telephoto lens.  Essentially, the background should be represented by a “smaller” patch of sky.  I hope that makes sense, but if not, I'll try and show some actual examples of images of what I mean.  In the meantime, I suggest you just do some Google image searches of aircraft in flight to see what I mean.  And when you do, **really** pay attention to, and study, what you see.

Secondly, the aircraft is sort of “washed out” (not in an overexposed sense, but more so in terms of saturation) slightly.  The background doesn't really match with this.

Furthermore, I have absolutely no idea what's going on with the added yellowish tinting of what I can only presume is supposed to be from the sun?  Again, this is where you *really need to study* what you're looking at.  You can't just add another light source that doesn't match up with the source image.  If there were actual sun light coming from that direction, it'd be shown on the aircraft with highlights and shadows matching up.  Right now, it simply doesn't.  And the tinting and all that is just off.  I can't put into words exactly what I mean, but this yellowish tint just looks horribly unnatural.  Or maybe I'm wrong and that isn't even supposed to be the sun, but if it's **not** the sun, I can't for the life of me figure out what the heck it is supposed to be.  

Beyond all that, is that supposed to be the afterburner?  Or is that some kind of battle damage that has lead to a fire on the aircraft?  If its the former, that's not really how afterburning engines look in action.  Some of the earlier jet engines might have *sort* of spit fire out like that, but that's still way off.  And while the A-4 is indeed an aging platform, it's not *that* old so as to be represented by the “style” of earlier jet engines.  Once again, you *really need to look at real examples and study them.*  I simply can't stress that enough.  And on that note, the A-4 simply did not even have afterburning engines.  So in this case, you should also familiarize yourself with your subject matter.  That's not a truly crucial thing, since I don't think anyone but people like me (airplane nerds) are going to care, but it's just something to think about.  And of course, since VFX is often about depicting that which is not real (or depicting something real but not necessarily easily possible in the source footage), that makes the whole A-4 lacking an afterburner an even more moot of a point.  

So if it's not an afterburner in action, it must be battle (or other form of) damage.  But again, it just doesn't really look natural.  The positioning and nature of it right now makes it look like it's **supposed** to be an afterburner, even if it's not.  So you'd want to add some other cues to show that's from battle damage or something, such as maybe some damage to the rest of the aircraft.  Or moving the placement of the fire itself.  Of course, if it was a mechanical failure unrelated to battle damage, bullet holes or other damage wouldn't really make sense, but again I'm just throwing out ideas to consider.  

As for the visual look of the fire, I don't really know how to explain it in a proper way.  Again, the best I can suggest is to do a Google image search and look and study what you see.  I know I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but it's an important point.  If you're going to try and depict reality, you have to study reality.  Do not try and depict what you **think or expect** something ought to look like – depict it as it **actually** looks.  One thing I can address is that the expansion/dispersion of the smoke looks kind of unnatural.  In such a fast moving object (even if the aircraft is “only” going 150-200mph, it shouldn't be dispersing like that).  Specifically, there's a little splotch of smoke right by the aircraft's left horizontal stabilizer that just looks out of place.  I don't know why, but that little bit really stands out to me and bothers me.

Now, be it afterburner, mechanical damage, battle damage, or whatever, the angle of the fire is sort of off.  

Finally, in regards to this particular shot, I'm not sure you'd even want to call it a matte painting.  Compositing maybe, since the background could be considered a matte painting, but the rest of it falls more under compositing.  Calling the overall shot a matte painting implies that it'd be used as, well, a matte painting.  And you generally wouldn't use such an action shot as a matte painting/background plate for something.  Certainly not for video/film at least.


**Light Streak:** Not much to say here.  It looks pretty good.  I'd suggest maybe taking it further though.  Well, maybe not this exact shot, but the same idea – you could, for a random example, have someone spinning a sword/staff/whatever and have the tip tracing the light streak.  This would allow you to practice not just the light streak idea itself, but also compositing.  


**Rain shot:**  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't actually see any rain.  I see some water drops forming on the lens, but that's it.  So again, I'd take this a bit further.  Right not you're only really showing water drops on the lens, and very little actual rain.  Which is fine, but it's just another really simple technique/idea you're demonstrating.   Maybe it's just the nature of the source image, but right now the only rain I actually see raining/streaking down is towards the bottom-left of the frame, where the rain contrasts a bit better with the grass.  I'd suggest maybe using a different source image to illustrate the effect better.  For example, the further an object is away from the camera, the more it'll be “masked” by the rain.  Another way of thinking of this is that at further distances, the rain will almost act like fog.  I hope you'll excuse the absolute **terrible** quality of this very quick 2 minute mock up, but [here I've quickly demonstrated what I mean](http://i.imgur.com/51iyP.jpg).  Again, that is a very terrible example, I've blown the color and intensity of the rain way out of proportion, and the masking is very quick and dirty just to illustrate the point.  Now maybe you've already done this in your example in the video, and are already aware of all this, so if so, I apologize.  But this also shows why the low resolution of your video makes it really hard to critique some things.  It also shows why you should really consider your source material when deciding to try certain techniques.  

What's more, the rain drops aren't behaving like actual rain drops.  What's happening in your example is more like little water drops appearing on the lens out of nowhere and growing and slowly moving downwards.  I'd expect them to streak slightly more, and deform as they move along the lens.  Right now they just appear out of nowhere and slowly grow.  A real rain drop wouldn't slowly grow on the lens, but rather, the full mass of the rain drop would hit the lens mostly at once.  Of course, as multiple drops hit the lens, they'll combine and form as you have sort of shown, but the issue is the way the drops initially hit the lens and slowly grow.

Most of them will be okay with this, and some may even admit to being forgetful as well. 

The added bonus: if you do manage to remember the name next time around, they are going to feel special because you, the forgetful one, took special care in remembering their name. (Works great if you are trying to impress)

I know this might not actually help you remember, but it should minimize the negative impact.

Depending on the state (or country I suppose) he will probably be expelled. In my state we have no choice but to expel a kid for distribution, even when ""distribution"" amounts to passing a joint to a friend.

This is actually a good thing. There will be conditions placed on the kid while he's out of school which he must comply with. The state still has to educate him so he'll probably be required to go for mandatory counselling, drug testing, and alternative education program. For a kid as unrestrained as your brother that's a good thing.

The expulsion hearing is very much like a trial. The board will have an attorney and the administration will have one too. Your parents can also get one but I only recommend it if you're going to fight the expulsion which I wouldn't even attempt if I were you.

This is an opportunity for your parents to tell the district what you think he needs. ""Please make drug testing or rehab part of the agreement"" will be met with enthusiastic agreement. Nobody wants your brother to go uneducated, in fact it's cheaper to not expel him. But they have to protect the other kids and the state laws I'm aware of are unyielding on the decsion - he *will* be expelled, now let's talk about conditions for his return.

Good luck. View this as an early opportunity for him. PM me with any further questions.","1338508995"

"AfterEffects","t5_2rc1h","**The second matte painting shot:**  I have no idea what this is supposed to show.  As such, I can't really critique it.  I also have no idea how this fits into the category of matte painting.  Is it supposed to show/illustrate splattering paint drops or something?  If so, it doesn't really make sense, because with the exception of color, the splattered drops are all exactly the same.


**Reflection shot:** Again, this is such a simple thing, I don't even know what to say about it.  I'm not really sure there's any point in really even showing it to be honest.  If you're going to try and show reflections, I'd suggest doing it in a more ambitious manner.  Maybe show something reflecting on the water of a lake.  

I'm also curious how you did the reflection shot?  Is it even a true reflection?  Or did you just copy the text and adjust it to look like a reflection?  I only ask because it doesn't look like a true reflection.  Maybe it's the camera settings and such, but it just strikes me as being off.

[I tried to mimic the reflection scene in modo very quickly as you can see in this album.](http://imgur.com/a/zQgEh)   If you look at the images in that album, you can see the differences between a true, 3D, “physically correct” reflection compared to just copying the text and rotating/adjusting it to fake a reflection.  Now, most people wouldn't really notice the differences, but they exist, and if you're going for accurate reflections, it may be worth taking note of.  This would especially be important if, for example, you're compositing an object onto a backdrop where the object has to be reflected in the backdrop.  

If it is a “real” and “physically accurate” reflection, please accept my apologies for wasting your time.


**The spheres:** Looks good, nothing to really say.

**The bass:** Again, not really sure what there is to critique here.  I guess maybe just play around a bit, experiment a bit more, etc.

As you can see, this has been a rather long post.  For now, I must be off though (I'm sure you're breathing a sigh of relief at that, if you made it this far).  I'll try and address the rest if I can get around to it.

But some parting words for now:  I may have focused a lot on the “negatives”, but like I said, everyone has to start somewhere.  Don't get discouraged.  Just keep at it.  You'll get better every time, and even though I may have focused a lot on the negatives, there's a lot that shows promise (and I'll try and cover some of that when I come back to this all).  I hope that you found this post to be helpful though, and best of luck.

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","Sparring is one of those things that you can do at any level as far as my experience goes. As long as you are paired up with someone who is willing to go light and also has as much experience than you. From my own experiences I've learned a lot more through getting hit and what not to do and how to avoid those situations through sparring. Others may disagree but before you even think about sparring its important that you and the person your sparring with have the self control not to hurt one another.

However i do recommend at least 6 months experience before you start throwing elbows and knees while sparring as they can cause some real damage if you don't know how to control them properly, which you won't after only a couple of months. Sometimes it worth just throwing light kicks and punches and have someone on the outside telling you where you're going wrong as it easy to throw them against a bag but when it comes to a moving opponent your technique will end up changing.

Edit:what i'm recommending is sparring but using it as a tool to improve your weaknesses, technique and self control. Instead of trying to better your sparring partner.

Anything that you own must be given up to serve in an elected capacity.

You will live in an access controlled  ""Capital City"" where everything you want (within reason) will be provided to you free of charge for the rest of your life.

Everything you do will be subject to recording and constant monitoring.

Any breach of ""public trust"" will be punished by immediate execution.

Well I better stop rambling and seeming insane. The point is we need harsh rules that make people **not** want to be leaders. Those who still go through with it are probably the best choice.

You need a badge to scan in, a handprint scanner, and the front lobby had a man trap.

But the fire exit back door could be opened straight from the computer area to a secluded area of the parking lot covered by trees.  The door was wide enough to just roll a whole cabinet out and run off with it in an awaiting pickup truck.  The security cameras were in place and working, but the center was manned by one person, the camera footage was not recorded (a licensing issue with the camera software).  All of these were eventually fixed, but until then, someone authorized could have gotten in, opened the back door for a buddy, and gotten away with tens of thousands of dollars worth of equipment in one go.  Not to mention security.

Oh, and if the fire alarm was tripped, the magnetic release on all the doors defaulted to off.  So, pull the fire alarm somewhere else in the building, and you know the rest.","1338509026"

**""hinders clever use of pearls,""**: ""Using them to buy time to resupply your hotbar with potions is very difficult when you are low on health and the pearl may kill you.""

**""difficult doenst not mean an inprovement in skill based play.""**: ""To give an example of difficulty not necessarily adding to the allure: Starcraft Brood War is an immensely popular and skill intensive game. One of the mechanics was building workers for resource gathering and building. When you made a worker, it would spawn near your main structure and you had to tell it what to do. This forced players to have to continuously manually send their workers to mine. Blizzard realized that, while skill intensive and good in terms of weeding out the good from the bad, that this was unnecessary for core gameplay. In the sequel, they allowed for rally points to mineral patches so your worker mines automatically. My point is that difficulty doesn't always necessarily mean an improvement in skill based play.""

Would I stop playing LOL if they stopped doing these nice things for us?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in ""Career and Life Management"" during the drug research portion of the course. You know, research the effects of drugs and whatnot. Anyway, I am researching drugs, dreaming of the day I will be able to try them all when I see the ""For Parents"" section. Probably a good idea to brush up on what my parents will know (so I know how to foil them), and I see a section about HOMEMADE DRUGS! I've always been trying to get high, and this is awesome.

So I read that you can take Gravol (motion sickness drug) to get high, and it warns parents to lock that shit up. I read about hallucinations, tripping out, seeing shit. I've been wanting to try mushrooms since forever but could never afford them, and this seems like a decent substitute. So I head over to Erowid and check it out. It seems like legit, so after school I head home and open the drug cabinet, finding the Gravol. There's 21 pills. I find that a strong dose is 15. I considered splitting the pills into 2 trips, but I wanted to feel it, so I decide it's necessary to take all 21 pills. On the way to school.

I start walking there, meet up with my friends on the way, and let them know. They think this is awesome, and we keep walking. I start flying before I even hit the school, and I think this is gonna be an awesome day. I really start feeling it on the way into class, and I'm finding that I'm moving really strangely, but it's a good time. I sit down, and we start a movie (ironically, an anti-drug movie), and next thing I know, the teacher is asking me to hand out papers, since the movie has just ended. I realize I blacked out for, like, 45 minutes. Now I'm scared and high as fuck. I mumble that I'll hand them out, and stand up to do so while he leaves to go take care of something. I am soooo fucked up at this point, I can barely comprehend what was going on. I was so high my big baggy pants fell down and I didn't even notice until I noticed I couldn't walk too well. I end up giving the rest to someone and sit down, and notice pretty much everyone is just staring at me. Now I'm really paranoid. Luckily, the bell rings and I get the fuck out of there.

I spent the next 10 hours like this. I meet up with my friend for second period, and he ends up guiding me to each class since I can't even find where the bathroom is, let alone my class. Everything I try to write is just a mess, skipping between English, then I start writing in fake French, then in numbers, all while I'm in social. Every time I stand up, my vision goes black until the blood returns to my head. Every time I sit down and stop concentrating really hard, I just black out. Huge gaps in my memory, no clue where I am or what I'm supposed to be doing.

Finally, the day ends and I am able to go home, still messed up, and hang out in my room until I can come out without freaking out.","1338509038"

Also, I cut up an apple and put it in a tupperware dish beside my bed at night. I tried soda crackers (and baby cookies, and graham crackers) but my mouth always felt too dry to eat them comfortably. Apples worked really well for me, and cutting them up just made it easier (and less likely to get juice on my hands). Whenever I wake up to pee at night (sigh) I have a couple slices, and then finish the apple before I get out of bed in the morning. Helps to keep my stomach from getting empty at night.

For example:
Controlling the rover from earth, the lag between signals is about 5-20 minutes.
For the new rover, Curiosity, its maximum speed is [slower than a garden snail](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=90+meters%2Fhour) while Spirit was much faster at 5 cm/s.

If you are there, in a space suit, you can access more rugged terrain, you won't get stuck in martian dust, you can control the rover in real-time, and more. Instead of taking 1 day to decide your next step, it could take 5 seconds.

But the best way I've found is to flat out tell your players, ""Hey, I want to play a role play oriented game instead of the rule oriented ones we have been playing. I see the game working like this..."" 

Now if your players are into that then great. But like what Blazfeem seemed to be saying that they might not want to play a game like that. And if that's the case maybe a middle ground. 

Though one of the things I would do is tell them flat out that they can't do something, like intimidate, until they give you something to work with.

I think it was probably carried via oral tradition until written down and thing were updated to fit the time it was written. For an interesting take on this story, read the Skystone by Jack Whyte which is a series that follows the withdrawal of Rome from Britain and the eventual Saxon invasion and the Rise of Arthur. The series takes place over several generations and is probably similar to what happened. It is the best book series I have ever read. If you haven't yet been convinced, on this book rating site, users have rated it better than Moby Dick, the Great Gatsby and 1984. http://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=skystone&amp;search_type=books","1338509073"

And yes, time spent getting the ID also has to be considered.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Men are not angels. Men are not devils. Men are men. Mostly good. 9% bad apples. What you do, is you construct a system where the bad apples get crushed, and the reasonable people that are left, are subtly pushed to act in the common good. This is ordinarily done by 'the invisible hand of the market', aligning efficiency with self-interest.

Yes but instead you are glorifying a system in which a person can gain control of an incredibly powerful weapon against his fellow man, a system meant to be a force for good but which has pretty much free reign to do whatever it wants (thanks to the modern interpretations of the Constitution).

&gt; The solution to trade is a private blacklist? Who maintains it? How much to bribe my name off it?

It's created and maintained by the merchants in a sort of alliance. They have an interest in keeping it well maintained and free of corruption, because if it becomes apparent that the list has been compromised by corruption, people won't trust it, and they won't trust the merchants who are supposed to be in charge of it. You don't gain anything from being in the alliance and you aren't robbed of anything by not being in it, it's to help consumers and businesses interact honestly. They also had systems of arbitration to handle disputes.

&gt; Before any government agency regulated commerce, there was commerce between England and Scandinavia. Monodirectional commerce, enforced by axes to the head. The merchants went along with this, because, in the lack of any military power to answer it, they were rightly terrified for their lives.

Not sure what the relevance of this is, sorry.

&gt; As for my statement? I guess James Madison was laughable. So too, Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington, their system shall only last two centuries, replaced by a Chinese Oligarchy.

What? The founding fathers believed exactly what I'm saying, which is why they designed the Constitution the way they did. They *specifically avoided* direct democracy, and designed a system in which the only powers of government were listed in the Constitution, and any expansion of federal power was supposed to require a Constitutional amendment. Unfortunately they failed.

&gt; Though I should expect the view that the ideal government is the merger of state and corporate power from someone named Luftwaffle.

I didn't even come close to suggesting as such. I am pretty much completely against the government. Merchant law wasn't backed up by any government, which is why the worst punishment possible was to be blacklisted, not imprisoned.","1338509084"

"self","t5_2qh96","I understand pinching pennies, but that is not what I am attacking here.  I used to work three part time minimum wage jobs while paying through the nose to go to college.  The government was willing to pay for my kid to be watched while I worked minimum wage and never paid taxes for the rest of my life, but it wasn't willing to pay for a baby sitter while I took classes so that someday I might get a job and pay into the system.  I know what it is like to buy the formula, and then hope you can make a couple packs of ramen and some eggs last you the rest of the month.

Here are some exact details of what I am talking about: at SAMs I was once held up behind a frat boy who was buying every item individually on his platinum citi preferred card.  He said that most of the items were bought ""on a rotation"" so he would hand the proper receipt to the proper person and get reimbursed.  Worst of all, he said he was a member of the Phi Theta Kappa honor society.  As a member of the Alpha Mu Zeta chapter, I know PTKers can do basic math, so I have my doubts there. Post the receipt, do the math, and people will either pay you or they can go to the store themselves next time!

At Wal*Mart: Behind the family of three previously mentioned in my post: They paid all the orders out of the same huge envelope of 20s the man was holding.  I assure you that it was barely dented by their purchases that day.  

I also would have understood arguing a price or two.  I still argue price if the price that rings up does not match the price on the shelf because I do believe some stores purposefully charge more than is marked knowing some people just won't pay attention.

These people argued EVERY price on the order of 5 cents to $5.  If they weren't doing it intentionally to see if they could strangle the will to live out of everyone around them, then they weren't paying attention to the price on the shelf EVER when they picked the items up.  If you aren't paying attention to the price on the shelf then buying that item is clearly more improtant that what it costs.  

I understand haggling too; at a garage sale, this was wal-mart! What they were doing didn't seem like haggling to me either, but an elaborate scheme to wear down the cashier's patience and either be expelled or get everything marked down so she could just get them out of her lane.  I swear that poor girl looked a little too longingly at my knife set.

The family was very well dressed, and was still loading their orders into a brand new Ford Explorer SUV when I went rolling past them to my 2006 Honda Accord.  I somehow seriously doubt they were hurting for money.  ","1338509088"

I recently had one student who genuinely thought that his reason for not doing his homework (I fell asleep and when I woke up, I didn't have enough time) didn't result in me apologizing for inconveniencing him and giving him another chance to do the work. (It was group work - kind of impossible to recreate for one student). 

This is of course not the norm, but there are at least 3-5 students every class with this attitude to an extreme measure, and many more who expect marks just for keeping a chair warm in the room.

There are plenty of legit criticisms to make of the Heat -the haters just don't make them, they instead choose to focus on a bunch of made up bullshit, because those false criticisms feed into their own delusions about who the Heat/Lebron/Wade are - you want to think they are dirty and dishonest players because that validates your hate, while the more legit criticisms don't justify your negative views of them.  

Third:
Claiming someone jumped on a bandwagon is a sign that you are jealous because their team is better than yours.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Step one, try to keep your employees out of unions (usually only possible for really really small companies). Step two, discuss EVERY action you take regarding your employees with the unions instead of employees directly. As soon as you start firing people in Sweden you take a huge risk. The same goes when someone becomes long time sick (you cant fire them and you have to pay for their absence :-)). 

The unions job is basically to act as lawyers and sometimes more like mobsters. If you havn't broken a law and still do something they dont like, they can call in their pals and refuse to clean your office, not fetch your trash, picket your entrance etc etc. They know every rule there is, you as a business owner probably don't know much about it. 

The sums this guy is talking about, 150k sek is probably not worth fighting over. It's around 23k usd. A lawyer easily bills $150/h. The union is probably ""right"", and I don't think a court would think ""being nice"" counts as a mitigating issue.

As a side story, my gf works for a state (län) organization, they have this guy that's consistently late to everything, even meetings with clients. His clients don't like him and he's ""hard to communicate with"". They went out of their way to accommodate him and even replaced him for some assignments with people that are on time. They still cant fire him, why? Because he's an immigrant. The people in HR refuse to sign off on firing him on grounds of race/being scared of the eventual pr backlash. It doesn't have much to do with unions, but the same thing would probably happen if he was a pregnant woman, a handicapped person, had a depression, a drinking problem etc etc. Employee protection laws are _crazy_ here.","1338509091"

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","&gt; Sigh, another one who has no clue.. The 10 million number is and isn't active subscriptions. When you purchase the game in China, Korea, Taiwan, you purchase a lifetime subscription. Each expansion you purchase comes with a lifetime subscription. So if 6 million copies of Cataclysm were sold in those countries, Blizz really only has 4 million active subscribers. Still a great number mind you, but not 10 million people paying a monthly fee.

Sure, fair. At the same time, that means that 25%, not 10%, of WoW's paying subscribers have agreed to pay for another year.

&gt; They are making sure it works flawlessly.... Before they open up the RMAH. It's just impossible to give a real test to those systems under live load until the game is released.

That accounts for some of the instability, maybe. It does not account for all of the ways in which the AH itself is just baseline terrible. Examples include the lack of comparison tooltips with recommended items, the inability to sort recommended items, the lack of direct comparisons on tooltips in search results (you know, like how when you're in the game it'll tell you the effect an item would have on your DPS and your health?), the fact that some but not all commodity searches default to a quantity of ""1"" (meaning you can just click ""search""), the fact that some but not all parts of the AH UI allow you to hit ""enter"" to submit - while other parts allow ""enter"" to bring up the chat (definitely accidentally gave away some items for near-free trying to respond to a friend in chat, this way!), the fact that the sell tab resets if you switch to a different tab, the fact that you can't see the stats on your gear if it needs to be repaired, the fact that the ""legendary or set item"" box isn't a search box but rather requires you to select one item at a time, the fact that you can't search for stats on gear while using said box.... the list goes on and on and on. These are not stress-testing problems; these are ""we didn't spend enough time on the AH to make sure it was actually good"" problems.

&gt; The hacking and the ""grey-market out-of-game RMT gold-and-item selling"" are 2 separate issues. The hacking they solved by making the game server-side and forcing players to be online, the other issue? Only in video games is it somehow acceptable for the producer of a product to be the only one allowed to directly profit from it. Imagine if Budweiser could only be purchased from the breweries, Pepsi only directly from the plants the bottle it, food only purchased from farmers, you get the idea.

By ""hacking"", I mean ""of accounts"", not ""of the game"". Grey-market RMT sites are the #1 source of hacked accounts in WoW, for example - and vice-versa: those hacked accounts are in turn the #1 source of the things the RMT sites sell.

It's interesting that you'd claim that ""it's only acceptable for the producer of a product to directly profit from it"", too, when the RMAH allows players to directly profit from the things they sell, in monetary terms. Or rather, it will, if it ever goes live.

&gt; Not really. Run the imprisoned angel quest 20 or so times, you'll know the minute you zone into a dungeon where the exit will be.

Guess I'm not to that point yet. You're right, though, the dungeons aren't as random as they could be - and for example Yahtzee in his Zero Punctuation episode on the game fairly reasonably makes the point that you're looking at a collection of rooms stapled together in different ways. Just to cite one example, they could've added more possible dungeon features, and more things that either could or could not show up in any given version of a dungeon. Still, while there's a lot of room for it to be better, that feature isn't not there, either: this isn't like a Final Fantasy game or something, where every dungeon is mapped out in advance and there is one route through it, with the same things in the same places every time.","1338509093"

X has a mysterious shooting leg pain after screwing the pooch on a deadlift attempt.

X asks /r/fitness what they think about it.

X receives many replies saying ""Oh that sounds like condition Y, which frequently happens when you screw the pooch on a deadlift attempt.""

X now is able to google condition Y in order to decide what is going on herself, or similarly to ask her doctor about condition Y.

In the real world, people don't go to the doctor for absolutely every ache and pain that you can't explain. I'm sure you don't do so. You decide whether it's serious enough to warrant going to a doctor. This goes double if you live in a place like the US where a doctor's visit can involve significant expense. Sometimes that process of deciding how serious it is involves talking to your peers. And even if you do go to the doctor for every ache and pain, it's still nice to get some ideas from talking with your peers.

If your architecture is proper which I believe Blizzard has then easiest way is to buy more servers. It is not cost effective if you expect demand to go down in near future so they are reluctant to use money.

Reason why Blizzard always has too little capacity at launch is that too little capacity only get little grumbling while too much capacity means wasted millions. They plan their servers for cautious sale figures. After all it is easy to buy more servers while selling overcapacity is impossible. They also try to estimate future usage. Since Diablo III usage will go down over time it is bad investment to buy capacity to handle absolute peak so they are very reluctant to use money for more servers.

In some (necessarily hermetic -- isolated) society in which white people were *not* the beneficiaries of power structures, then racism *could* affect them. There is nothing *naturally* 'in whiteness' that determines that white people cannot be the subject of racism. It's patently relational, not absolute.

That said, here is what I object to: (for those following along, wow! I can't believe anyone even read these pseudo-intellectual thoughts -- thanks) it is the reductionist move of asserting that the determination of an act *as racist* should depend upon *only* the race of the actors, in exclusion of the symbolic meaning the act has given the relational system of meaning that is society. Given our society, a white man attacking a black man is *clearly* qualitatively different than its opposite. blah

This folk-reductionism seems part-and-parcel with reactionary ideology. It's like, some necessary overlooking of undoubtedly present symbolic meaning. a class consciousness or something, meant to shield the mind from reprehensible truths that his/her existence is predicated upon. ","1338509103"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","This is an editorial comment but I think you should not say ""up and coming"" and just cut right to the chase. You built a website and so you are a web designer. In my experience I think it turned off potential clients when I mentioned that I was newer to the game. I'm honest in my resume etc. But tried not to make it very obvious.

The site is very good I think and agree with most people here. The logo is really neat, it reminded me a lot of the WordPress logo. ","1338509106"
"pics","t5_2qh0u","With all due respect, I think that over the course of the hour or so since I originally posted here, I have made it fairly clear that I am very much aware of the fact that people aren't equal and never will be. I appreciate that you have better things to do than sift through my reddit comments, but in nearly every reply I have made in this thread, I have pointed out that while I am morally opposed to the idea of a monarchy, I understand that it will not change, and that practically speaking, the benefits of removing the system would likely be outweighed by those of keeping it.

&gt; By your logic it is equally distasteful for us to have been lucky enough to be born in a first world country when there are so many less fortunate people that haven't.

That's not really the same though. The superiority of the queen over her subjects is not the same as the higher quality of life we enjoy as compared to those born in wartorn third-world countries. Of course, in both situations, the better off party (the royal family and the first worlders) have been born into a socio-economic situation which gives them access to luxuries (and indeed necessities) which others are, by chance, denied. But neither the third world nor the first world believes that we, by virtue of being born in a first world country, are inherently superior to those who aren't. I, as a beneficiary of being born in the first world, am not considered deserving of a bow or curtsey from a Somali orphan.

I am not complaining about the Queen being born into money (that's a whole different argument, and one I refuse to become involved in at 1am), I am complaining about her supposedly deserving my respect, loyalty and deference on the basis of her birth. ","1338509106"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","you didnt say if your new to tf2, or just new to pyro.

your team shield, yin to medics yang, prevent damage and sources of damage, dont focus on kills. play more conservatively than you think you should. keep track of the big picture and go where you think your or the other team is weak. harass with shotgun or flare, even a 3 damage from a shotgun resets their heal rate, making their medics work harder and their team get less total healing. a flare puts most classes on defense instantly, particularly if they've seen you hit a lot of flares.

weaponwise, attendant set is fun, but your playing AoE scout(less 1v1 in exchange for way better in 1v2+), not so much pyro.

degreaser should be your default, backburner has its uses though, and phlog is good for silly fun, but should never be anything close to your default.

shotgun flare are the best choices for secondary, detonator is okay, destroys stickies if you blow it near them, good for edging snipers, jump is rarely ever worth it. reserve shooter looks better on paper and 1v1's, but unless you use the ground exploit its sustained power is just worse than shotgun. manmelter can be good if your team gets set on fire a lot, its easier to hit distant targets than regular flare and guaranteed 90's on first hit are nice. i generally go flare, lets me keep snipers busy, get the occasional medic hit and reach out and touch distant spies and heavies. shotgun is better for resetting healrate and vs smart scouts.

melee, its axstinguisher unless you have a good reason to use something else. maul/homewrecker are good if engie is having spy issues. powerjack isnt very useful outside of the set since its nerf. rake is okay for roamers, but if your in melee range just axstinguish em, its just better. if your not, well then your just making your medics life harder.","1338509116"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i"," This is the 4th time I had to post this.

I'm going to speak on the assumption that you're used to the whole idea of dubstep being robot noises shitting everywhere to kick, snare, kick kick, snare. It used to be more like garage, complicated drum rhythms and etc., if you define what makes it good it's like how a lot of people into instrumental music view their music- the complexity and individuality of the synths and the drums in this kind of EDM, along with the rolling melodies of the sub bass (basically general technique) show skill or finesse. I'm from a city in the UK where dubstep was pioneered/originated and I absolutely hate what it has become, generally after becoming Americanised and now everyone's a Skrillex imitator. Generally, you have to get it in full quality (320kbps mp3 as a minimum, FLAC/Vinyl is ideal) otherwise the frequencies are lost. Dubstep is primarily about emphasis of the sub-bass.

Sorry if you're already aware of it but do you know much about audio quality? Do you own a good sub or headphones? They're pretty essential for listening to it how was intended. A lot of people with no interest in electronic music have absolutely no idea about music quality. Here are some examples, even if it is youtube quality. These are the 2008-2009 style ones that initially got me hooked. If they're not your cup of tea, fair enough:

Jordan is the best basketball player ever and Kobe came straight out of high school to become one of the best ever.  My point was their insane work ethics and hyper competitiveness allowed them to reach a height that those who ride along on pure talent cannot attain.  

Also, I pointed out Lebron's post game weakness because that is literally the only weakness in his offense game these days.  If he developed one on the level of say Wade (not even going to approach the madness of Kobe's post game at this point), there literally wouldn't be a point on the floor he could not score from.  You saw what happened when Bosh first went down and the Heat tried to slide Lebron into the 4.  He simply looked uncomfortable working from the block.  As of right now, that's literally the only place on the court where if I'm a defender, I think I have a chance of stopping him.  If I'm him, that is literally all I work on in the off season, but it took him years to develop a jumpshot which was the other weakness in his offensive game so I don't really expect to see Lebron with a competent post game any time soon.

Granted Dwight Howard absolutely highlights my point better than Lebron does, especially given Lebron's new-found jumpshot.","1338509131"

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","&gt;  Could this ONE little capacitor really cause the back light to not work though? 

Yes. CCFL backlights are carefully monitored by the controlling IC, if it detects a problem it will shut down. Can't quite see if this is the backlight or general power circuitry we're looking at here, doesn't look like the backlight to me.

Ah, [confirmed](http://i.imgur.com/XMQL9.jpg), this is general power supply for the inverters, of which you appear to have two (the top half of the PCB).

Incidentally, that image is from a [repair kit](http://www.ccl-la.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=138&amp;osCsid=pd4m39bb589h2sf9iikej6ref7) containing replacement caps for your display.

If that cap doesn't fix the issue then we need to look at other components on the backlight's inverter . It doesn't *sound* like the transformers are gone, as that would tend to fail short, tripping the protective circuitry and killing the backlight fairly reliably within several seconds. Does the display seem unevenly lit when it's on? ","1338509132"

In video games like LoL, viable doesn't mean capable of being successful. Of course everything is. Viable means capable of being successful when against players of nearly equal skill level. Of course, if you beg to differ then I'll just edit my post, I don't really care. Again, you fail to understand that evelynn is nearly on par with jungle kass; capable of beating players of much lesser skill than your own. The difference of course is that you can play kass seriously and win games. You can do whatever your dating analogy was on every champion by using unorthodox builds or by using unorthodox playstyles, but you literally cannot consistently win games against players of your own skill level by playing eve, regardless of how you play her. I played ap eve mid last night and was 4-1, of course I lost the game because the equally skilled ahri used her more powerful skillset to press her advantage, even though I was a few items above her. Evelynn is not even slightly underpowered, she is at a tier in which she most completely outskill every player on the opposing team to win, and the statistics SHOW that. You would have to be mentally unstable to argue that a 38% win ratio constitutes an even slightly competitive choice.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Okay, just checking, because you're really good at it.

Thanks, you do a good job of attempting to remain intellectually honest while presenting the christain position.

&gt; Having faith in God means believing that the experiments will not, in the long run, give good evidence for his non-existence. If it seems like the experiments lead to his non-existence, then either the evidence has been tampered with, or else future evidence will reveal that the evidence does not really support His non-existence.

No, this is having faith AND being intellectually dishonest. You can have faith that is destroyed by evidence. If I tell you that I can fly by flapping my arms, and you have a strong *faith* that this is not true, if I start flying by flapping my arms your faith is destroyed by the evidence, unless you are intellectually dishonest. 

Faith is usually defined as believing without evidence, not in spite of it.

&gt;If you have firm faith, nothing should hinder advancement. The furthering of science goes to show the magnificence of God's creation. 

This only works if your faith is completely untestable or unfalsifiable. If this is the case, then your faith must be quite specific and not interact with the world very much, but I suppose it is possible. I can have a strong faith that there is a teapot orbiting proxima centauri and it will be quite difficult to disprove this. This doesn't make my faith warrented.

The Apostles faced this, too.  They found themselves bogged down in the very righteous work of feeding people.  It was important enough to them that their preaching was held up by meeting that need first.  Good judgement allowed them to delegate so that they could meet their primary calling, but that doesn't mean that their calling was higher.  It was just *theirs*.

As the individuals in the early church found they had different callings in different persons, so Jesus (as any individual, especially in ministry) had different callings for his time.  ","1338509139"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I would say, try things that you are good at to help, earthly and spiritually, and see what brings you what we wish on each other, the peace of the Lord.

I personally find peace in helping the sick.  I do my best to donate my platelets and plasma.  I have the gift of the universal plasma donor, and cmv negative platelets.  My plasma can heal anyone, and my platelets can heal people with compromised immune systems such as infants, the elderly, and those with HIV/AIDS.  Yesterday, I was donating, there were complications with the apherisis which left me a _massive_ bruise and pain in the needle site.  I didn't care.  They got a full unit, so my goal was achieved.  I had a bit more peace in my life.

On the other hand, I am terrible in calling people to the faith.  I just can't do it.  I can provide layman's help with those in the faith, so I limit myself to that.

Know what you can do, and do that.  Know what you can't do well, so you can focus your efforts for effect and, God willing you will find His peace.  But there is trial and error in it all.

To be a bit ecumenical, we can learn something from a common theme in Islam.  They tend to say, your sincere effort, giving what you can, doing what you can, only help to earn peace and favor of God.  I share the sentiment.

Man is not perfect, and God knows that.  True effort is what matters.  That is what will distinguish the faithful, who find redemption, from the Sunday Christians and hypocrites, who will not.

You have a gift, search for it by trial, and by prayer, and however you must.  You can find it.

EDIT:  I tended to focus on your ""gift"" rather than your calling...  Hearing your calling in your heart, feeling you have a calling may be hard.  We struggle with it spiritually, and professionally.  I tend to focus on your gifts, and looking to what you can do well, and brings peace, because sometimes just prayer, scripture, and feeling our hearts doesn't quite do it.  Sometimes we have to take what we do well, and start trying...  Your strong points can help that.

Can you swing a hammer?  Try habitat for humanity.  Can you give good advice?  Spiritually or otherwise?  Crisis lines, secular and religious might be the thing for you...  These are just a couple examples from the top of my head.","1338509151"

"kings","t5_2rqrs","I just don't see Andre Drummond leading to more wins for us.  I try to see how he fits into the team and it just doesn't work.  

On offense we need someone who can either facilitate others or score without needing the ball.  Andre Drummond is so bad on the offensive end that he's almost a liability.  His best contribution would be off-ball screens, which doesn't add much with the pieces we have.  

On defense, I don't think he'd make as much difference as you think he would.  He was able to alter shots and protect the rim in college (a point that I'm not exactly convinced of, given his relatively low shot blocking rate compared to other defensive bigs... his blk/40min wasn't even in the top 30 among the nation's top shot blockers), but that skill set doesn't necessarily translate to the NBA.  Thabeet was a far more effective shot blocker in college, but he couldn't adjust to the speed, size and athleticism of NBA scorers.  

I think the style of college basketball greatly exaggerated Drummond's parameter and pick-and-roll defense.  It's far easier to recover from pick and rolls set at 20 feet than it is at 24 feet, especially if you're far bigger than your competition.  From the games I watched, Drummond's talent stemmed more from his athleticism and size than it did from defensive savvy, footwork or fundamentals (though he did stay out of foul trouble).  

I think this draft is too talent rich to warrant taking a risk.

2. Run, jump, grab, hoist. 

3. Backpack w/ a few reusable bags in it is optimal if you don't have a car or bike w/ baskets.

4. Wear whatever, but I recommend good shoes with socks and long pants for getting down and dirty. Latex or plastic gloves (I used to just go to delis and nicely ask them if I could have a couple pairs of their gloves for a school project because I can't afford a whole pack) make me braver when it comes to digging through liquid-covered bags and other goodies.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Note, I don't necessarily agree that this is a bulletproof argument, but I feel what fr0st is _trying_ to express (and having difficulty doing so) is that the game really has a need for two different 'types' of currency:

1. Currency you use to advance through the game itself (repairing, buying pots, dyes, indirect death penalty); you need a constant source of this, and it isn't particularly important. If there is too little of it in the world, people who end up dying too much get frustrated never having gold since they repair all the time. Also, people frankly expect some form of in-game gold/rupees/credits in games like this.
2. Currency you use to interact with other people. This needs to be carefully tuned to deal with inflation, both by destroying it via auction costs and by simply making it drop less. This is where most of the problems are--blizzard simply hasn't found a very good way to balance gold such that it is both balanced _and_ fun.

By tying the two together, blizzard creates a currency that needs to constantly stream to the character (you never want to rely on RNG to drop gold if you need to repair your gear _now_). This results in players simply finding a bunch of gold while progressing in a low level place, going to the AH, and finding MUCH, much better gear than they find. This is a problem because there are always people further in gear-progression selling their hand-me-downs and bad-drops on the cheap. As a result, people end up always simply buying gear in the AH, making drops meaningless (since they are almost always going to be poor drops in comparison to what you bought).

With an alternate, rarer form of currency, at the very least there would be a bit of a rush finding that alternate currency. It would also allow blizzard to tweak the drops on the alternate currency to prevent inflation without worrying about halting player progress (the player never worries about repairs, etc). A side benefit would be that players would also experience the rush of finding the d3-soj-rune equivalent.



Unrelated to the fr0st post: I have a friend who is a level 60 barb, just like me. We both reached 60 around the same time. However, the difference between his gold usage and mine is night and day, and it characterizes a big problem with the game's drops-versus-AH problem. Since I'm familiar with game mechanics and fairly-good at analyzing the AH economy, I saved up and was able to outfit myself quite well for inferno (as well as maximizing my gold usage as I leveled up) when I hit 60. In contrast, his purchasing habits are haphazard and simply suboptimal (as in always gets 1hko'd wherever he goes, even in Hell difficulty).

As he leveled up, he noticed his drops weren't good. His solution was to buy more MF from the auction house. However, as we know, this doesn't really improve his drops as he goes through normal/nightmare/hell. Since drops don't really scale with progression (as mentioned elsewhere, you simply find bad loot that maybe might've been useful 10 levels ago), it results in him still not finding any good loot for himself. So, he goes back to the AH and buys even more gear (with more wasted mf). All this time, he's simply buying sub-par gear in the AH, wasting all of his precious gold. By the time he's level 60, he can hardly survive any level-60 appropriate areas, he can't find any items by farming survivable areas, he has no gold, and frankly, he can't enjoy the game. Players like him will inadvertently gold-sink their currency without understanding it (he also heavily invested into trying to craft better items) and simply be unable to progress. Even though some players will be able to deal with and manage gold as a currency, players such as him will not, and it simply makes the game not enjoyable. It is also disappointing to him when I hand him a mediocre blue with resists, and it turns out far more effective than the shiny rare (or even set/legendary) he bought from the AH, especially since he simply doesn't understand why the boring blue is better than his shiny yellow; as a design, it's horrible that my boring loot is better than the equips that were supposed to make him excited that he spent so much gold on. If the drops were more appropriate, he wouldn't have wasted his gold so badly in the AH as he leveled up.

D3 should be able to make the game fun for players like him, but the current drop system makes it pretty hard for him to progress, and the AH compounds the problem.

Note, I admit part of the problem is he wants to join me in inferno; the problem is that it's not easy to convey that it is simply inappropriate a difficulty level for him, especially since we leveled up at the same time (and frankly, I play far less than him, to boot). This leaves him in hell, where again, the drops are too boring, and there is never a feeling of progression other than grinding gold in hell to try to buy better items in AH. He doesn't even get the joy of having a sellable drop since nobody will buy his Hell drops*, so it just boils down to grind, sell-to-vendor, grind, sell-to-vendor.

*And again, bear in mind that since he's an average player, he wouldn't be able to distinguish between what is sellable versus what is not, so realistically the only gold he gains is from vendoring hell-level items to try to save up gold for inferno-level items. Not. Fun.

I'm an electrical engineering student, and I do a fair bit of gaming. I've chosen, at the beginning of my studies, to go with a Lenovo Thinkpad T420 with Nvidia graphics, and a 9 cell battery. It doesn't offer the absolute best in gaming performances, but I'd say it's a really good compromise in terms of battery life and performance to form factor and weight ratio. Furthermore, it's built to last, so I wouldn't be worried about traveling with it, and bringing it to class on a daily basis. As for the price, Thinkpads are slightly expensive, but you can score pretty good deals if you look around on the Internet (I live in Canada, and I've found the best deals to be on visaperks.ca, and on redflagdeals.com... I think I got a 40% discount on mine).

Some of my friends have Dell XPS laptops, and I'd say they could also be an interesting option if gaming is really important to you. They don't offer as much in terms of battery life, and I find they're less portable and durable than Thinkpads, but they do offer a more contemporary design as well as better gaming performance.

Your pawns will only fill up 10 at a time, so you'll need to take those out of their inventory so that they'll fill up the rest. Give them back and then you have 60 flasks which heal your entire party every time one is used.

"Diablo3Strategy","t5_2u5co","Methods I learned to deal with some of the abilities on some of my seemingly endless Siegebreaker runs are:

Vortex (+Firechains, or whatever that will instagib me if I end up in melee range): Either keep a extremely long distance to the mobs so they can't vortex you or hug some uneven surface while kiting. If the mobs try to vortex you when you hug a wall you'll just bump into the wall. I also recommend picking up Seeker missile and just shooting from behind whatever pillars or stones you find (avoid open space). If a firechain mob vortexes me my method involves yelling AAARGH and smashing the teleport button. It has a 5% success rate.

Mortar: I try to keep the mobs in the top of my screen so I see the mortars shoot off. I move from left to right constantly shooting off orbs/missiles in between mortar rounds. Other option is finding angles and pillars they can't shoot behind.

Jailer: Distance + teleport (fracture). If you have a decent distance they can't chain jail you or anything like that. 

Invulnerable minions I just kite into a corner and leave them there unless I somehow manage to separate the boss from the adds (pure luck). I usually don't even try killing them, just start kiting as soon as I figure out what they are. ","1338509168"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Don't worry about the vaginal orgasms for now. You know you can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, and that's enough for now. Don't make vaginal orgasms a priority right now--that's not the problem here. The problem is that you've gotten used to one way and one way only of orgasming. I've had this issue before too. I could only orgasm whenever I was masturbating because I'd put something like a pillow or blanket between my thighs and grind against it really hard. Well, it's pretty much impossible to experience that same pressure and feeling with another person. So I started experimenting different ways of getting myself off, by myself. You probably need to do the same. Stop using your usual technique. As difficult as that sounds, it's necessary. Try a different method and don't stop until you orgasm or until you're too exhausted to continue. Then try another method. And another.

I got really creative doing this. I bought a vibrator, tried that out and loved it. Tried using my fingers which was very different and pretty frustrating at first considering it took me 30 minutes to an hour to orgasm from that the first few times(especially considering my usual method can make me orgasm in 2 minutes), but now I can orgasm from fingering my clit in about 10-15 minutes if I'm really into it. I even tried using the shower head by spraying the water on my clit, and for a while I felt like I was getting nowhere with that method, but then randomly I orgasmed from that as well. Now I'll still go back to my regular method sometimes, but I make sure to continue switching it up every time I masturbate. The key here is patience. You'll get frustrated because it'll take waaayy longer than you're used to, but don't give up.

Try this out and see if it helps you! And for the meantime, *do not fake it.* Explain to your partner what's going on. Tell him it's nothing to do with him, it's something you're working on and you don't want to have any pressure to orgasm, nor do you want him to feel pressured to make you orgasm. This is extremely necessary, because the more stress you put on yourself to orgasm, the less likely it will happen. Good luck!","1338509178"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","It's helpful to have a logarithmic line when you have something that grows depending on how much you already have.

One example is interest.  Suppose you put $100 in the bank and you get 10% interest every year.  The first year your account goes up to $110.  The next year, $121.  Notice how the growth for the first year was $10 and for the second year it was $11?  That's because it depends on how much is in your account.  Every year you'll get more and more.  The next year is going to be $12.10.

Another example can be reproduction, especially with things that reproduce quickly, like bacteria and rabbits.  [12 rabbits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia) brought to Australia over a hundred years ago are now causing quite a problem.","1338509181"

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I am personally dubious as to whether preferences - or prejudices - we grow up with for one thing or another can be programmed out of our consciousness.  It was a lot easier for me, as a straight white male (who is comfortable being that) to deal with identity politics as a whole once I understood that I didn't consciously build my prejudices -- they just happened over time.

To that end, then, the task was to become aware of them and to deploy my conscious, rational mind to check my subconscious one.

I am aware that I respond to sexually attractive women differently than I respond to average ones.  But that is, again, a subconscious, reflexive, non-voluntary thing.  If I can recognize that tendency, I can then modify and control my behavior.  As I'm married now, this habit pays off in multiple ways (not only in fairness to average looking or less-than-gorgeous people, but to the interests of fidelity, which is of grave importance to me, ethically and spiritually.)

This has important implications for racial prejudice, incidentally.  It also kicks over the argument of race realists (who are into evolutionary psychology and so on) -- because even if it is true that some form of prejudice is part of the human condition, so is rational consciousness.  So is our understanding of ourselves as social creatures, and the implication of allowing things we've evolved to be run our lives.  Look at what our evolutionary tendency to consume high calorie foods has done to us, for example.  The concept that we ought to just let go and allow our instinct to run everything is quite definitively sociopathic.

I allow myself to enjoy attractive women without allowing their physical presence to distract me from what's really important.  I hope to be better at the same kind of control when facing a DELICIOUS PIZZA PIE, which a fat guy like me *does not need,* whatever my involuntary reaction to smelling it might be.

One place this comes into play is food servers in restaurants.  We all know the whole thing about ""cute waitresses"" and the light touch on the shoulder or whatever and how this supposedly improves tips (or the scantily-dressed servers at Hooters).  

Rather than flagellate myself in an effort to respond to this reflexively, I learn to carry it with me and recognize it when it happens.  The outcome is the pretty servers get tipped on the same basis of the ones who aren't as pretty, according to the same criteria.

So it's not a matter of writing it off, but recognizing it, and deciding for yourself how much you're going to let your instincts ""go out and play.""  

The worst thing about people who only ever respond to a pretty face, though, is the degree to which they cheat themselves out of the rich variety of human experience, many virtuous elements of which are hardly confined to physical beauty.

Periodically I'll run into someone who considers themselves a ""realist"" by scoffing the idea of ""inner beauty"" -- which they take as a sort of euphemism for ""unattractive.""  I take it as a separate quality entirely.  Those who cannot see a beautiful mind or soul and insist that others don't either and are just deluding themselves (many in the seduction community seem to be in this basket) are merely projecting their own deficiencies onto humanity at large.

I cannot find any correlation at all between worthwhile character and physical beauty.  Sometimes they go together, and sometimes they don't.  And physical beauty tends to have a shorter half-life than spiritual beauty anyway.  

Given the choice, I'd like to have both, of course.  But the same way I don't judge a product or food by its packaging, I don't judge people either.  That includes not assuming attractive women are obnoxious and vain, either.","1338509189"

Now, let's take this girl into the picture. She really doesn't sound like a good match to try and settle your own issues. She might never cross inappropriate boundaries, but since she is so 'buddy buddy' with them it is driving you crazy. So even, if she would be good for you, the timing is obviously not right.

"backpacking","t5_2qpcz","A lot of people have a hard time understanding **you buy the backpack LAST**.  It's only a container.  You don't buy the sleeping bag stuff sack before you buy the sleeping bag...  

Anecdote!
------------
""*I want to start a family but don't know what size car I should get.  I'm thinking coupe because everyone seems to have one, but that means baby goes in the trunk... am I doing something wrong?*""  **Wrong** 

""*Wife and I are having twins.  That's 4 people total.  Add in one more for the dog we'll eventually get.  Now for trips to grandma's my wife packs 2 bags, I pack one, and the kids will have one each.  So that's about 5 seats + storage capacity in the trunk for 5 suitcases.  I'll probably get either a large sedan, a minivan, or a medium-sized SUV.*""  **Right**


Get your core equipment first
--------------
  Get your sleeping bag, your tent, your stove, your toiletries, your luxury items, your extra clothes and measure their volume.  Take all these to REI and pack them into different backpacks, testing for size and fit.  Then pop an 18lb bag of charcoal on top to represent consumables.  18lbs somewhat accurately represents 5 days of a traditional backpacker's food, water, and fuel.

You will also find your core equipment will change over time.  New sleeping bags, different tent, different clothes... it all changes the required internal volume of your backpack.  So as this changes don't hesitate getting a new bag.  Again, the backpack is merely a container.  It fits what you need it to, not you only fit what it can carry.

Anecdote!
--------------
""*My kids are finally out of the house and off to college.  I have this bulky SUV that is never filled to the brim anymore.  What I do tend to carry in all this space is useless garbage like that duffle bag from hockey from last week!  Yeck!  Maybe I should sell it and downsize to that coupe I wanted when I didn't have so much stuff.*""  **Interesting!**

Winter!
-----------------
Once you have calculated your 3-season equipment volume, adjusting for winter is fairly easy.  You'll only be adding slightly larger versions of your existing items (tent, sleeping bag, extra clothes for winter, etc).  If you can hike 1-2 weeks in 3-season using a 50L pack, a 70-75L pack will work in winter.

The real question
-----------
What I want to see if you coming back saying, ""*My core equipment takes up 45L space.  I tend to eat X lbs per day and drink X liters per day.  The usual trip I'm on has [no|some|frequent] water sources and I plan to be gone on average for X days.  I use a X-type stove and I think it'll take [X canisters|X ml alcohol|X ml liquid fuel] during this duration.  It will be a [popular|semi-popular|remote] trail so I'll plan on taking X emergency extras.  I expect the weather to be [blah], which will [add|subtract] the following items:  [blah].  What size pack should I get?*""  At this point it should be fairly obvious to yourself that the question is rhetorical.","1338509199"

I am assuming you are the owner of the blog so I am writing this to you or the person who writes for it.  I myself do not have a disability.  I do work for a non-profit as a clinician so I have more experience than most in this matter but I do not claim to even remotely understand what it is like to have a disability.  That being said, you are obviously a very thoughtful and intelligent person but your blog reads like a middle finger to a society that has forsaken you.  I've noticed you rarely if ever have people commenting on your posts both here and on your blog.  My humble recommendation is to take some of your anger and try to do something productive with it.  You have a wonderful forum to help others in your position but instead of inspiring others you put everyone on a defensive put off position almost immediately.  To be very frank your blog reads like a therapy assignment for someone whom has unchecked anger.  This may not be your intent and I do not write this to discredit your posts as they are all quite justified but if I were you I would try a different approach and reach out as a advocate for people with disabilities instead of a martyr.

On the other hand, teachers have the ability to close a class to signups, so it is entirely possible to have a small writing class for 20 people where each person's writing is critiqued. Another case is that grading is not wanted because the teacher just wants to teach to interested people and allow discussions to come up organically. Grading may not even be relevant, such as for the cooking class.

Lasers were quite popular in the 60's

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raygun

&gt;Soon after the invention of lasers during 1960, such devices became briefly fashionable as a directed-energy weapon for science fiction stories

You can compare the designs between a ""[A stereotypical raygun as shown in a 1955 patent application for a toy.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Pyrotronicdisintegrator.gif)"" and the [Righteous Bison](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/2/23/Righteous_Bison_3D.jpg) and see that they stick closely to the style of 50-60's scifi rayguns.

I understand your complaint but I don't think that your arguments should prevent the inclusion of new art added to the game because it doesn't fit your poorly researched view of 1960's Evil Genius/Spy Fortress art style

"LibertarianDebates","t5_2tvku","&gt; So for a Libertarian society to be successful, would it require a population of people who are acutely aware of government, politics, and economics?

I think so and that is the point.  It's not that people are apathetic because they don't care, they are apathetic because they feel helpless in the current system.  It's not like humans are somehow incapable of adapting to any system that's thrown in our way.  What if we broke that system and started fresh?  What if we didn't rely on corrupt politicians to make terrible decisions for us and let us do what we think is best?

No one here will claim this will make life a utopia, life is going to be hard no matter what happens to our social-economic-political structure, but at least we can say that our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness were our own; I don't think some people realize how empowering that can become.

You need a blank line before 'technical summary'.

Your fonts keep switching between serif and sans serif.

If you capitalise 'technical blah' and the other headers, why don't you capitalise 'education'?

Put 'certifications' up with 'technical summary'.

I like that you tried to quantify your experience at the top of page 2.

In some places you have a comma after the month, and not in others.  Leave it out for consistency.

Where I am a bit skeptical is when people get super alarmist about the issue.  I have confidence that as technology improves, we'll move away from fossil fuels and also find way to combat CO2 in the atmosphere, such as a new kind of air processing technology, or some biological cure, like those green lamps that were in the news a while back.

I don't think that the reductions in carbon emissions from carbon credits, or a cap and trade system will be significant enough to warrant the increased costs (which ultimately hit the poor the hardest.)

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It's not ""computer models"" as if to say they are arbitrarily constructed with no other evidence. 

There is at least as much evidence for human caused climate change as there is for evolution, possibly more. 

Climate change isn't going to blow over. It won't go away because it's inconvenient to our economies. It will change the earth in permanent ways that will likely eradicate the human species, and the window to stop it is closing fast. 

There was a marketing company that was hired in the 40's and 50's to *spread doubt* that cigarettes were unhealthy. They did this by spreading false information, slandering the character of researchers, and putting up fake scientists to publicly question the results about the dangers of smoking.  This same company was hired by oil companies in the 90's to use the same tactics for global warming. 

Instead of following the hive mind and accepting the current media spins on climate change, you should look up the results found by actual scientists. The best, most unbiased source is probably the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which was established by the United Nations to discover if global warming was real. Not only have they confirmed that the earth is warming, but in 2007 they made the statement ""anthropogenic (human caused) climate change is unequivocal."" They also have found some interesting data on what kind of things will likely happen as climate change progresses. 

I will leave you with this: I used to be just like you, and many of the other climate skeptics on reddit. I thought that most global warming touters were alarmists akin to the ""save the whales"" hippies and vegans. When I finally looked at the actual data instead of just the media spin, I was shocked: I had either stumbled upon the biggest conspiracy ever, or had let myself be deceived all that time. I am a rational person, and the data speaks for itself, but it was still hard to admit that I was taken for a fool by one of the biggest media spins of all time. It is sickening that people are still trying to muddy the waters regarding climate change, because good people are falling for it and missing their opportunities to save themselves. Climate change should never have become a political issue, it is a human issue. ","1338509251"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","More or less, my feeling is this: humanity wants a society to consider itself special with its interactions with nature.  I will agree, though whether this is actually fact or me just rooting for my own team, I will not get into for now.  The only thing that makes us unique among *animalia* is our mental capacity and the large-scale ordered society that it allows, with features such as permanent information, large-scale logistics, and highly specialized roles in society.  The organ that allows this, and is central to human development, is the brain of course.  And our reproductive organs.  These two systems are the core for continued human survival and prosperity.  The rest of the organs are essential only because they act on behalf of those two systems, sustaining life and interacting with the environment.  And really, the latter system is at the behest of the former as well.  So the brain is what matters, reproduction is important for survival of the species, and the rest is just hardware to make sure those two systems can achieve their goals.  I am not saying infertile people (by nature or choice) are unimportant, society has plenty of needs to be met outside children.  The long story short, our brains are what make humans special (to me, at least), our bodies are otherwise quite similar to other animals, with perhaps better dexterity and wider range of sounds from vocal systems than most animals.

**Birth**:
Certain death would likely lead to abortion.  After all, the infant would be in danger too, and that would let R fall under 0.  It is the cases where there is some risk that would be left up to doctor's decision.  I suspect in most cases, the doctor would err on the side of the mother, so most impact would be seen in pregnancies with minimal complications to none.

Your next few points perhaps make me think I misspoke.  Rather than maximizing the number of lives, the goal is to minimize needless death.  I don't think we should try to pump out extra babies on purpose.  But once a human life is in development, seeing that person survive should be a high priority.  A growing population is important, as shrinking populations, especially when coupled by a population that is top-heavy on the elderly, tends to suffer problems (Spain, Japan).  But excessive birth rates can mean that more children fail to reach adulthood (various African nations), which runs contrary to the goals.  If we were to collapse society by overburdening it with too many mouths too quickly, that would be a sad but slightly amusing end.  Too many births can lead to dire problems, and often are accompanied by high mortality rates, so I don't want to push people into pregnancy if they are not with child already.  They push themselves well enough into that state.  The United States at the moment is probably balanced enough that we don't need any pushing in one direction or the other for now.  As the PRC shows, playing with birth rates to any great extent can lead to pretty severe unintended consequences.  This may change, but our birth rate is not going to far to one end or the other for now, so I would let it be.  And I think we don't need to do anything about sperm banks, they have enough to go around for now.  They need not be full, just not empty.

**Organs:**  Organ thieves would not have to give anything back, but may face other criminal charges, including assault, battery, and attempted murder.  If they didn't need the organ, yes, it goes back.  If they took an organ the other person needs, then it goes back, and the other person is placed in care until he/she gets the right organ, then they go to trial and prison.

I would be in favor of compulsory organ donation, though obviously the dead get harvested first.  The living should have a compensated volunteer system, followed by using felons, and those who are dying (provided the organ is still helpful).  It gets tricky with executions, since there is no guarantee organs will be compatible.   

This would be a hopefully temporary fix, until stem cell organ growth is more developed.  

**Zombie:**  
I hope they would use your body part without removing it.  Otherwise, find another object.  If they are cutting off something of yours, that probably lowers the net survival rate, so that's a no go for them.  But yeah, if they put your hand in their entrails to save their own life, be a man, hold them in.  Unless they will die anyways, in which case, don't risk it.  All on-the-fly guessing at odds, so there is wiggle room here depending on the bleeding and the disease odds (if they know they have AIDS, vs have tested clean for common diseases).  

If someone has eaten someone else's face, you have cause to believe they may kill you as well.  I should hope that you would in some way try to help a freezing person if possible, unless it puts your risk of dying up by 50% (from being eaten, or frozen yourself).

When pushed to it, cannibalism happens anyways in extreme cases, because nobody is around to enforce it.  Better some die than everyone.  But if it's a bad famine, the sort that leads to cannibalism, the fat won't stay fat for long.  I don't think we should force you to cannibalize.  If you don't want to, we can eat you once you yourself die (and use the organs).  But please let us know ahead of time, so we can eat you before you are all skin and bones.

On February 7, 2012, President Mohamed Nasheed was forced from power from power in a coup led by supporters of the former dictatorship, which was headed by Maumoon Gayoom. Gayoom was a huge dick, your usual island dictator, in the mold of Rafael Trujillo but not quite as much of a dick. Nasheed is a democratic idealist and if The Maldives doesn't want to return to the terror of the dictatorship, he should probably be reinstalled. Also, global warming is a big issue on the nation made up of 1192 islands, 200 of which are inhabited. The more you know. It's all in the documentary The Island President, which is a great film.

Hell, I tend to avoid bachelorette parties like the plague in general. I have already had bad experiences with them disrupting a nice meal at a restaurant with my bf or just being bothered by them on the street. I hate how they suck attention to themselves, even if you really don't want to give them attention.

As a person who doesn't want to get married, I just really do not feel a connection with the whole ritual and do not really want to have much to do with it.

I get it -  you're excited you're getting married. But must you annoy strangers because you are?

As for gay bars:  Some thing are just not appropriate in all places. You wouldn't start telling dirty jokes at a children's party, for example, or go into a church in your bathing suit. It's just jarring.

Certainly! It means our system should constantly be reassessed to make sure we have as low of a failure rate as possible.  Keep in mind, of course, it will probably never be 0%.  But it is certainly always the goal. 

&gt;Tens of thousands of people die in America each year due to water-borne pathogens.

I'm not sure what OP is referring to exactly, but discussions of outbreaks due to water-borne pathogens in the US is usually focused on public and private water supplies, not all water-borne pathogens, because the former is in our hands and the later is not (we can't do much about people drinking from stagnant streams, but we can certainly try to make sure we don't have harmful chemicals in our public water supply). 

One thing you'll notice about water-borne disease outbreaks is that there may be relatively few outbreaks, but large numbers of victims, due to our water system in the US (one system may support millions, or at least thousands).  

But still, it seems there are relatively low outbreaks, high victim rates, but very low death rates -- as low as 6 per year between 1991 and 2002, according to [this paper](http://courses.washington.edu/h2owaste/group1.pdf).  

At any rate, this is a bit off topic from the subject at hand -- raw milk -- because it is a very different issue (we don't expect an appreciable level of risk when we drink public water or give it to our children).  It's also different because of the animals involved -- cattle don't really show signs of e coli infection, for example, despite the myth that ""they remove sick cattle, so it's not a problem"".

I'm rambling now.  

tldr; of course it's a problem that people get sick from water-borne illnesses (though not at the rate OP suggests), but that's quite a separate issue. ","1338509271"

Stop getting wristy with the club because you have a cast that is putting that slice spin on the ball.  Practice one piece takeaways square to the target line not inside.  Your grip looks strong/ok, 2-3 knuckles and right hand under the club.  You need to get more rotation with your hips towards the target instead of thrusting at the ball and get that right elbow to drop down inside.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Because the last two administrations have chucked out the Constitution, and the Supreme Court merely rubber-stamps whatever they want to do.

That is, the people in power giving the orders do what they want anyway, and the Supreme Court does not stop them.  

Your rights are determined not by what a piece of paper says, but by what you can actually exercise in practice.  

You know how police almost never get punished for brutality and even murdering citizens?  The majority of ""law enforcement"" is extra-judicial activity, and it is almost impossible to hold police accountable for their actions in a court of law.  Courts almost universally take police testimony as sacred and some judges will threaten you with contempt if you so much as imply the officer is lying.

Your ""rights"" are not preventative; at most, they give you some kind of redress after-the-fact, after they've been violated.  *But only if the power structure decides to go along with it.*

The state grants itself sovereign immunity whenever it wants, and grants its agents qualified immunity whenever it wants, and can prevent hearings *entirely* on the basis of ""national security"" grounds.

Since the courts are not upholding the Constitution, the Executive and Legislative branches get away with whatever they want, including such notions as Civil Asset Forfeiture, and extraordinary renditions, plus extrajudicial assassination.

There are rights you supposedly have but are unable to exercise.  Everything ultimately comes down to who is using force, and what those using force want to do.  If those 5-4 decisions had gone the other way, good luck with, what, going after prosecutors who break the law?  That's *out of citizens' hands as it is*, only the D.A. can bring criminal charges, and as the prosecuting agent they *aren't* going to bring charges against themselves.

Class-action lawsuits?  Even if you can bring them, they are gamed by the court system itself, and *never* result in anything for consumers.  Two things happen: 1) Lawyers make money, and 2) the large corp. (AT&amp;T in this case) simply *increases its fees* and passes the expenses on to its customers.

Bush v. Gore?  If the SC hadn't stepped in, it would have been resolved at the state level, which was already in the bag for Bush thanks to partisan control of the process (Katherine Harris) plus electronic voting.

Garcia vs. Texas?  Texas has executed hundreds; this was a procedural dispute that would have at most added a slight delay.  Garcia was in for kidnapping, raping, and murdering a 16-year-old girl.  It's NOT a case with wider applicability.

Citizens United?  Need I remind you that during the healthcare debates, there were 6 registered lobbyists for EACH member of Congress?  Money has always been in play, and Citizens United didn't change that.  Look at the recent story about ClearChannel paying voice actors to call in to right-wing talk shows with scripted talking points.  The money for political influence was ALWAYS there; Citizens United simply gets it out in the open, similar to how politicians have to disclose the money and free trips they get from lobbyists; it's STILL bribery.  2004 was rigged via electronic voting, no SuperPACs needed.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My husband and I aren't multicultural, but I might be able to help with talking to your kids about grandparents.

I haven't seen my dad in about 16 years, and my mom disowned me for being an atheist 5 years ago. Also, his mom died before our daughter turned one, and his dad remarried a few years later. Our daughter is about to turn 6, and she asks lots of questions about her grandparents.

The first thing you should know is that before the age of about 4, kids will accept almost anything you tell them without question, and unless you reinforce it a lot, they will also forget it most of it a short time later. My parents were a non-issue, and she did not think to ask because we never talked about them, especially in front of her. We talked about my mother-in-law more often just as a general ""We miss her"" or ""do you remember that time..."" conversation. When the step-mother-in-law entered the picture, she made it clear that she wanted to be part of our daughter's life in a significant way, so she became ""grandma"" and his mom became ""my mom who died"". While we make the distinction now, it's obvious that my daughter categorizes stories about her bio grandma along with the ones about mommy and daddy's experiences growing up. They are stories that she listens to, but has little frame of reference for.

The trickier one has been my mom, who sometimes attempts to re-enter my life in really inconvenient ways. I don't have positive stories to tell her about my mom, but she sees the cards and presents my mom sends to her and is genuinely curious. The situation is still a bit painful for me, so most of the time, my explanation is ""My mom and I don't get along. She disagreed with some of my choices and made the choice not to be part of our lives."" I usually follow this with reassurance that I love her and will not do the same to her. She's becoming increasingly interested in this. The husband's parents have taken her to church a few times (we are atheists), and she gets exposed to Christianity at school, so she professes now to believe in God, though she doesn't really understand any of it. She knows that mommy and daddy don't believe in God, and grandma and grandpa do, and that we'll respect her decision when she's made it on her own. She knows now that this is why my mom disowned me, and when we talk about it, she asks questions that I try to answer honestly.

Tl;dr: In the end, you will know what's best to tell your kids. They will be curious and ask questions, and we attempt to answer them as honestly as possible. ","1338509287"

It make me think as what would this character do rather that what I would do. And it doesn't use quick-time events as cheap way to make cut-scene interactive but as unique way to connect to the character. The way the game force me to twist my hands to hit certain button combinations as a refection of the protagonist's own twisted posture was a type of physical interaction I was hoping to get from my Wii but so far haven't.

I would also say Flower. Just love getting people who aren't familiar with games to play it. They usually confused and don't get it.

"Fallout","t5_2qnzu","ZeniMax is pretty big but that depends on how you look at it. Just over the past few years, they snagged some big/cult-following developers, namely id Software, Arkane Studios and Shinji Mikami's (Resident Evil and RE4 creator) Tango Gameworks. 

Those companies are part of ZeniMax, sure. But all of those developers have nothing to do with anything Fallout or ES; they're totally independent. Speaking of which, can't wait to see Doom 4, Dishonored and whatever crazy/freaky/creepy shit Mikami will make. Supposedly it will be Mikami's last game he'll direct.

Bethesda Game Studios will probably have little to do with ESO either. They have Skyrim, future ES single-player games and whatever future Fallout game too. Also not mentioning any secret unannounced stuff too.

ZeniMax Online has hundreds of employees who are solely dedicated to ESO and have been working for years on that non-stop. I don't think ZeniMax has enough of a huge budget/employees to develop two giant MMOs at the same time, certainly not for years after ESO has been running.

The only huge MMO that was planned to be successful was The Old Republic. It's sustainable but no where near as WoW capabilities; EA/Bioware are sweating buckets over that, for sure. Blizzard is still the only sole company to even try to develop two MMOs at the same time.

Lastly, 38 Studios, the guys who made Kingdom of Reckoning, had to close down. Among other things, EA passed on a sequel to the RPG. And that's not even counting the planned MMO 38 Studios wanted to make; that MMO was in-development for years. RI tax payers paid them $50 million and all of that **just** went to the MMO project **that will never ever get launched**.  Good-bye $50 million. That's a scope on how much it is to even just develop a MMO. Not counting lost jobs either.","1338509292"

I listen to some of that kind of music, and I'd go for the power reserves of a solid state amp. Without a price range I can't say what kind, but a nice [NAD](http://nadelectronics.com/products/hifi-amplifiers) or a something would do. Actually, the [Outlaw Audio receiver](http://www.outlawaudio.com/products/rr2150.html) might be a good choice. It comes with a DAC, sub out, etc. I've been hankering for one. Or, if you want a little tube action with solid state power a hybrid like something from [Peachtree](http://www.peachtreeaudio.com/) might be perfect. Nice looking and nice sound. Another hybrid option is [Jolida](http://www.jolida.com/product/hybrid), though it's not as lust-inducing as the Peachtree.

As for speakers, there are a million. If you've got space, get a full range tower. I don't shop in that range (kids, you gotta love 'em -- I said you gotta!), but [PSB](http://www.psbspeakers.com/) is a safe bet right up the range. Also [B&amp;W](http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/Speakers/Overview.html), which you might be able to hear at your local Best Buy. But that's just the incredibly obvious ones.

Another option you might want to consider is a vintage stereo from the '70s and something like a big [Klipsch](http://www.klipsch.com/heresy-iii-floorstanding-speaker) like the one I'm linking to. Also JBL, though that won't get a lot of love from the true audiophiles. But I've got a pair of 4312Bs and a '70s HK receiver and that system rocks like nobody's business. The vintage look is good, too.

As an independent customer I sold her on the Mac.

This was only a few months after the release of the iPhone.

I think Best Buy ""customer service assistants"" pre-qualifications are the ability to wear a blue polo, consume oxygen, and stand around with blank looks on their faces.

"HorrorClub","t5_2u5hi","I know that there has been some discussion about the camera angles/techniques used and I quite liked how they did it. Throughout the movie they played off of the theme of something being askew/amiss. They did it with the tilted ""A"" in the pharmacy sign. They had the scene where Louis walks into the house and the key holder is slightly off and then she walks into the next room and the camera changes instead, just before the little girl tells her she is pregnant. I liked the drum music since it represented the pagan side of the town.

The only thing that really bothered me about the movie was the ending. How was the baby supposed to go to full term? Why wouldn't it be in the same form that it was when she died? How does the father not realize that it would have to be a demon child, since it too already died? Even if the baby was somehow normal it would still have only 3 days like the rest of the story.","1338509310"

1. There IS a difference between hand-made and CNC-routed. That difference is generally the 'errors' (however slight, feel is always noticeable) that giva a guitar a unique shape. If you tell ten luthiers to carve you a strat body, they'll all come out different. Some people say this is unique, some people say it's bad quality control. But different none the less. However, it is true that CNC can be done extremely well, and produce better results that hand-made/carved/etc., even though people assume the hand done= higher quality.

Now, I'm not saying that hand done frets are always better - fret arbors are used all the time for a faster turn around time for getting frets in, and if properly done the fret seating will be fine, and PLEK machines can produce the flattest frets known to man - I'm just pointing out that such a system does exist, although it's up to the consumer to decide whether to opt for individuality and personal touch/experience, vs machine - perfect.

"FanTheories","t5_2u6rc","I can contribute this.

In digital audio there is a phenomenon called the Nyquist Frequency. It basically states that, if reproducing audio digitally the sample rate of the audio must be twice the rate of the highest frequency you are producing in order to produce a perfect sample.

The upper frequency limit of human hearing is 20Khz so, in order to record every audible sound a minimum sampling rate of 40Khz must be used. This is why CDs are produced using a sampling rate of 44.1Khz.

According to [this thread](http://forums.ffshrine.org/f63/understand-proper-sample-rates-important-68280/) posted by someone who seems to know what he's talking about the sampling rate of a Game Boy is 22050Khz which means it can produce frequencies at a maximum of 11025Khz which is well within human hearing. Even if he's not correct I doubt with every fiber of my being that the original Game Boy had a sample rate of 40Khz. At the time of it's release that required a ludicrous amount of processing power and it didn't even have a dedicated sound chip.

Trying to pass the CPU's upper frequency limit would result in what's called a 0 amplitude signal which basically means it would sound like a shreiking wall of static.","1338509316"

Don't have time to dig a bunch of examples up, but that will give you an idea of what I was getting at.

Ask your partner to just focus on clitoral stimulation, that way no penetration and should be no pain from your hymen.

If you wanted to break it, it would have to be like larger than two fingers.. The only time my gf and I did that is when we wanted to use a strap on, before that we just did clitoral stimulation. Basically just oral sex without fingers.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","&gt;you're better off calling them ichidan (一段) and godan (五段) verbs than ru-verbs and u-verbs.

Not necessarily.  I've heard all sorts of different ways of referring to them. IMO 一段・五段 is actually an inferior method of referring to them because it requires an additional layer of abstraction before getting to what it means.  i.e.. ～る verbs drop off their る, and ～う verbs drop of their う sound.  In all honesty, I can't even fully remember why 一段 and 五段 are called what they are, aside from that it has something to do with writing the 五十音 in its semi-archaic sideways format.

However, calling them ～る and ～う (or -ru and -u) verbs is easy to remember which is which, and how to conjugate each one.

While most dictionaries may list entries as 一段 and 五段, I don't think I've ever heard of a Japanese teacher refer to them as such (and I've had a lot of Japanese teachers).","1338509350"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Here are some ideas that you may find helpful. In high school, you should learn all you can. As for grades, you should either get good grades and take as many AP classes to get ahead in college (if you're going to a 4-year right away), or just get Cs in high school and don't take the SATs (if you're going to a community college for the first 2 years). Again, still learn whatever you can, but community college doesn't care about your grades and you can spend more time learning on your own. 

Us saying that ""high school doesn't matter"" is more towards the the fact that young teens think that things that happen in high school are the end of the world. Believe us, it's not. Enjoy this time because in high school, you have very few responsibilities and lots of extra free-time. It's a growing experience. Even after you graduate high school, you will not be the exact same person just a year later. High school is still a bubble keeping you from fully experiencing the real world.

http://skepticalvegan.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/fluoride-the-brain-deja-vu/

I have long maintained that whenever possible, one should read the original study. The study in cited by Barret involved 512 children from two villages, Wamiao and Xinhuai, in China. The authors of the study describe the villages,

“Wamiao and Xinhuai are located 64 km apart in Sihong County. Wamiao village, in northeast Sihong County, about 32 km northeast of Sihong, is a severe endemic fluorosis area. The mean fluoride level in Wamaio drinking water was 2.47 ± 0.79 mg/L (range 0.57–4.50 mg/L), and the prevalence of dental fluorosis and defected dental fluorosis was 88.56% and 38.98%, respectively. Xinhuai village, in the southwest part of Sihong county, about 32 km southwest of Sihong, is a non endemic fluorosis area. The mean level of fluoride in Xinhuai drinking water was 0.36±0.15 mg/L (range 0.18-0.76 mg/L), and the prevalence of dental fluorosis was 4.48%, with no cases of defected dental fluorosis identified (Xiang et al. 2004, National Standard of P.R. China 1997).”

In the study children in Wamiao were found to have lower IQ scores[1] and higher serum fluoride levels than children in Xinhuai. In Xinhua 27.59% scored in the &gt;110 range indicating “high intelligence”, 51.72% of children scored in the 90-109 or “normal range”, and another 6.2% in the 110 range, 47.30% in the 90-109 range, and 15.31% in the &lt;79 range. The authors came to the conclusion that the difference in fluoride exposure is responsible for the differing IQ scores after accounting for various factors. Take notice of the levels of fluoride reported for each village. Wamiao, where lower IQ scores were reported, had levels that ranged from 0.57–4.50 mg/L which on the high end exceeds the current Environmental Protection Agency’s enforceable guideline (4.0 mg/L) for fluoride in groundwater and is double the secondary guideline (2.0 mg/L) meant to protect children. However the village of Xinhuai, where IQ scores were higher, had levels of 0.18-0.76 mg/L which is actually quite close to the Department of Health and Human Service’s current standard (0.7 mg/L) for community water fluoridation and is below both the EPA’s enforceable and secondary guidelines. Both the DHHS and EPA’s guidelines are evidence-based, in general reflecting the current scientific literature and consensus, and they are amicable to review and revision. This is a great example of science in action. Rather than providing evidence that community water fluoridation is dangerous, this study actually is in line with the current guidelines and regulations. There is always room for more science, but continuing to the repeat the same canards over and over while crying “SHILL” &amp; “CONSPIRACY!” at any dissent is not advancing science.

Regardless of some of the bad stuff that happens in America, sports is one area where there is zero tolerance for racism. In fact, most racists in America are turned off by sports due to the number of non white players in every team. This is among the very few areas in which Europe can learn from the US.

Now speaking of the wrong path, look at Islam, look at the Bible Belt, faith makes people do some seriously fucked up shit.  Strapping IEDs to yourself and annihilating yourself and those around you in the name of Allah... that's fucked up man.  Murdering a doctor for providing an abortion, or denying scientists the right to study their field because it is against your religious beliefs.... that's fucked up man.

"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","This is not ""yet another reminder to not trust the media"". Valuations, when not made explicitly public, are often guessed at by the player's wages and release clause - nobody ever shells out that amount of money, the clause is just there to ensure that bids are competitive and that other clubs offer a lot of money for the player. The clubs in the Portuguese league have a tried and trusted method of bringing in young talent (especially from Brazil) and giving them European experience and selling them on at a higher price. Clubs slap unnecessarily high release clauses on players that they think have promise, and nobody does this more than clubs like Porto or Benfica. A player's actual value is more likely to be around half the release clause value or less. The reasons we're paying so much for him are numerous.

1. He has a deal with Porto until 2016. Buying out contracts is expensive.

2. He's not even fully owned by Porto, and therefore we must buy him completely as third-party ownership is disallowed in the UK. They've also paid a lot to get 85% ownership of him as it is.

3. He's a Brazilian international.

4. We just won the Champions' League, and everyone knows we're rich anyway.

5. The media were told that his buyout clause was €100 million. There was no reason not to believe this, release clauses are normally that ridiculous. Therefore the club believed this too and made a reasonable offer, along with the reasons stated above.

The media are very trustworthy when it comes to football matters, just take care to notice when you're reading something that is presented as fact and something presented as opinion.","1338509369"

I think you meant “Nope, _didn't_ watch it”.  That's a shame. It was a documentary that aired live on nationally broadcast television in the UK. Certainly such documentaries are not an evidentiary gold standard, but it's more than sufficient to offer a credible refutation of your position, precisely because your rejection of hypnosis is _so_ broad and sweeping that it is trivial to refute.

And a credible refutation is all I need here.  If you say gravity doesn't exist, and that objects when dropped don't fall, and I don't need a gold standard of proof to show that you're proposing something crazy.  Of course, if I link to a video about gravity, you can reject it and demand I find academic papers for you, but I'm not your research assistant. I'm going to refute your nonsense in a way that's easiest and most convenient for me.

Why should I do any more for you?  You're a random person on the Internet with wacky non-evidence-based beliefs (in particular, your refusal to accept a fairly basic and easily verified fact, that hypnosis has been used as an alternative to general anesthesia).  There is every reason to suppose _no_ evidence would ever reach a high enough bar for you. Not [academic research](http://psycnet.apa.org/books/12128/002.pdf), not [acceptance by authorities who we should consider well placed to make judgement](http://www.apa.org/topics/hypnosis/media.aspx), not [news reports](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/sussex/7355569.stm), not [live demonstrations on TV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s5OFD8uTpU), not [direct personal experience](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/u8t04/iama_hypnotherapist_i_use_hypnosis_to_help/), basically nothing.

All this while you offer no credible evidence of your own, and no credible refutations. You're a bit like one of those intelligent-design devotees who claim there's never enough evidence that evolution really occurs. 

I've let myself be trolled by your head-in-the-sand denials for a while, because it's amusing to see you spin and sputter and call me names as you cling to the idea that doing so makes you a good skeptic, even as you ignore those parts of my responses that call your beliefs into question.

That act was not a sin even though the intent to sin was there. No liability. However, concealing that act is an act, and he did it with the intention to sin. I can also see the argument that his secrecy was not a sin because it is not forbidden to conceal things which are not sins. I have to think about this for a little. lol The only thing that's really causing me an issue is Nathan saying ""You sinned"" and David saying ""I sinned."" Nathan says that G-d removed the sin, which I can see to mean that he caused that these things were not really sins at all. However, he goes on to be punished, and Rashi explicitly says he was punished for these offenses.","1338509380"

Now I've been jobless for months because I'm competing with people who have 10 years of experience in an even smaller field than I was in before.

It's soul crushing.  Now I have student debt and I can't find a job.  Last night I was crying to my fiance, it makes me just want to die.  It feels hopeless, like things are just going to get worse.  It's going to get harder and harder to find a job.  We'll never be able to afford to get married at this rate.  I'll never get to do the simple things I want to do, see another country, have children, own a house.  It's so unattainable is makes me feel sick and now that I've gone to school and know that it just made it MORE difficult to find work kills me.

I'd go on medication to get me through this if I could afford it.  She might benefit from that.  I've benefited from taking medication while job hunting in the past.

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","Focus your attention on keeping the leading edge of the cap, just behind the blade's cutting edge, in contact with the skin, but not pressing the skin hard enough to indent it: just touching the skin.

Don't give the guard any of your attention---just ignore it. Some try to get a good blade angle by focusing on the guard rather than the cap (the guard is more impressive and interesting than the edge of the cap, and also is right there protecting you from the sharp edge), but in doing that, they often get too steep a blade angle, which produces cuts and razor burn. The guard is there if it's needed, so you don't have to think about it. Put your attention on the edge of the cap and the angle will take care of itself.

Guys who have already established shaving habits from using multiblade-cartridge razors will find that they automatically tend to hold the razor with the handle close to their face. With a DE razor, this puts the guard on the face and the blade at a steep angle, scraping the skin: razor burn. The correct angle for a DE has the handle far from the face (to keep the cap edge on the skin), which feels quite strange to someone accustomed to a cartridge razor, and often his muscle-memory will lower the handle (and increase the angle) unless he pays careful attention. Eventually, of course, new habits are established. ","1338509382"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","Helmet is Important. Not saying there are cheaper alternatives out there (I ride HJC helmets and prefer them over Arai) but the 39.99 specials you get from walmart are not going to save your life, they might provide a open casket, but you'd rather ride again.

Buy yourself a decent set of motorcycle gloves, Textile, leather, Deerskin (a favorite of mine) , an arm in the cast isn't as painful as your skin being ripped off your digits.

Jacket: I've seen people get into accidents with a heavy duty Denim jacket, and have minor abrasions. Just wear something over your arms. it's better than nothing, though if you can pick yourself up 2 jackets, one for summer and one for winter. (or at least warm/cold days)

Pants could be optional, you're taking a risk, so long as you understand that. it's your nuts/ass.

Boots: I wear 8'' steel toe workboots when i am riding for the day. I'm sure a pair of riding boots would do me very nicely, but these do me just fine. Rarely will i ride with just sneakers.

my opinion, nothing is more important then your helmet decision, followed by Gloves, Jacket, Pants. and when money isn't tight for any of you new riders, you can start to buy matching outfits for each bike or whatever mood ya might be in for the day.","1338509391"

You can use 2nd -&gt; DRAW (prgm) ; STO ; 1:StorePic to store a picture into the program memory.

Simply call the function with the above buttons, then type a number from 0 to 9 so that the main screen looks like this:

StorePic 2

Then press ENTER. This stores the picture into the device memory, which can later be recalled using 2nd -&gt; DRAW; STO ; 2:RecallPic in the exact same method. Note that recallpic will redraw the picture on whatever you have on your GRAPH window, so make sure to 2nd -&gt; DRAW ; 1:ClrDraw and turn all the grids off before recalling a picture.

Keep ALL YOUR CATS AND DOGS without having to painfully put each line in programs!
(btw, if you're on the GRAPH window while using the Pt-Change command, you won't have to change pixel by pixel in the main screen by typing it all out, but you'll be given a neat graphical interface where you can easily change the pixels using the arrow keys and the ENTER button on the graph window)","1338509403"

During double xp weekend i played with a class I named ""The Assistant.""  I used a FAD with extended mags and a grenade launcher.  Hardline Pro and Marksman.  Flash Grenades thrown up high work great.  Don't forget your Recon Drone.

- If you purposely drop bound eye from your inventory, you do not lose ownership and enemy heroes who pick it up cannot use it. (This is the change)

- If you get killed and the bound eye is dropped, you lose ownership and the ownership is transferred to whoever picks it up first. If an enemy picks it up, he gains ownership of it and thus can use it.","1338509404"

I have come to similar conclusions to you - the act of cheating in of itself isn't immoral - moreover I don't think we ought to moralise relationships, I think they are naturally irrational and we should face them on their own terms - but cheating can be bad for a relationship because of the jealousy, ego hurt and so on brought out in the other partner.

( i had no idea the actual date) , then she goes ""THATS ONE OF THE OPTIONS!"";  turns out i was right. 

Second time was in 2004, Champions League game , Almost at the end, Porto needed to score to go on to the semifinals, Mccarthy goes to kick the freekick and i say to my friends, ""Costinha is gonna score"". They simpkly go "" he is nowhere near the ball, what the fuck are you stupid?""

http://skepticalvegan.wordpress.com/2012/05/30/fluoride-the-brain-deja-vu/

I have long maintained that whenever possible, one should read the original study. The study in cited by Barret involved 512 children from two villages, Wamiao and Xinhuai, in China. The authors of the study describe the villages,

“Wamiao and Xinhuai are located 64 km apart in Sihong County. Wamiao village, in northeast Sihong County, about 32 km northeast of Sihong, is a severe endemic fluorosis area. The mean fluoride level in Wamaio drinking water was 2.47 ± 0.79 mg/L (range 0.57–4.50 mg/L), and the prevalence of dental fluorosis and defected dental fluorosis was 88.56% and 38.98%, respectively. Xinhuai village, in the southwest part of Sihong county, about 32 km southwest of Sihong, is a non endemic fluorosis area. The mean level of fluoride in Xinhuai drinking water was 0.36±0.15 mg/L (range 0.18-0.76 mg/L), and the prevalence of dental fluorosis was 4.48%, with no cases of defected dental fluorosis identified (Xiang et al. 2004, National Standard of P.R. China 1997).”

In the study children in Wamiao were found to have lower IQ scores[1] and higher serum fluoride levels than children in Xinhuai. In Xinhua 27.59% scored in the &gt;110 range indicating “high intelligence”, 51.72% of children scored in the 90-109 or “normal range”, and another 6.2% in the 110 range, 47.30% in the 90-109 range, and 15.31% in the &lt;79 range. The authors came to the conclusion that the difference in fluoride exposure is responsible for the differing IQ scores after accounting for various factors. Take notice of the levels of fluoride reported for each village. Wamiao, where lower IQ scores were reported, had levels that ranged from 0.57–4.50 mg/L which on the high end exceeds the current Environmental Protection Agency’s enforceable guideline (4.0 mg/L) for fluoride in groundwater and is double the secondary guideline (2.0 mg/L) meant to protect children. However the village of Xinhuai, where IQ scores were higher, had levels of 0.18-0.76 mg/L which is actually quite close to the Department of Health and Human Service’s current standard (0.7 mg/L) for community water fluoridation and is below both the EPA’s enforceable and secondary guidelines. Both the DHHS and EPA’s guidelines are evidence-based, in general reflecting the current scientific literature and consensus, and they are amicable to review and revision. This is a great example of science in action. Rather than providing evidence that community water fluoridation is dangerous, this study actually is in line with the current guidelines and regulations. There is always room for more science, but continuing to the repeat the same canards over and over while crying “SHILL” &amp; “CONSPIRACY!” at any dissent is not advancing science.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","We're all born into the world without property of any kind. For a long time we only have that which is given to us. Pretty much all the land / resources in the world are already 'claimed.'

If all you follow is the NAP then orphans born into the world are entitled to exactly nothing. All the land, food and property that exist already have owners, and those owners are within their rights to deny the use of their property from others. If the orphans 'steal' in order to survive then it's them that are breaking the NAP and the owners are entitled to use whatever force necessary to defend their property rights.

Under the NAP orphans are expected to beg or honorably starve, and any arrangement (like say, employment) they come to in order to survive is somehow considered 'voluntary.'

I don't know about you, but an employment relationship where one side can expect starvation if they walk away from the deal doesn't sound very 'voluntary' to me. And that's what you get if you maintain absolute property rights and only allow 'voluntary' transfers of property.

See, a society which is more human is one where we all prioritize the value of human lives and the quality of those lives, and not just our own, but all others as well. Property rights can enhance the quality of human lives, but if taken to an extreme they can cause costs in human life and quality of life. I think it's important to recognize that human life and quality should take precedence over property rights some of the time.","1338509420"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes! This was the peak of the days when they were still playing ""Beatle music"" as it was known (not saying the later stuff sucked, but the early stuff had a very distinct sound). They were at the point where they had gotten so *good* playing together as a group, not to mention the songwriting was getting better and better (Lennon/McCartney had it down to a science, and Harrison was really starting to come up with some amazing stuff).

At the same time, you could hear a bit of foreshadowing of what was to come in the studio years (such as the Indian themes in Norwegian Wood), as well as some stuff they wouldn't have even dared to do before this point (Run For Your Life is **extremely** dark, especially for the time period).

*Revolver* was absolutely incredible, as well as the rest of their stuff. But this really was the turning point for them, and the most interesting album to listen to. In my opinion, *Rubber Soul* is more important than *Sgt. Pepper* (without it, *Sgt. Pepper* might never have happened). It inspired Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys to make *Pet Sounds*, which in turn inspired The Beatles (at least partially) to make *Sgt. Pepper*.

I've been shocked a few times, but never enough to cause more than a little skin injury.  I'm not sure why I'm so terrified, but it might have to do with my Mom and her storm fears.

My mom used to make me crawl around and unplug just about everything before a storm, and back in after, because she has serious weather-related fears and was convinced the storms would blow us up via our electronics or something. I also wasn't allowed to shower or use the phone if it was storming.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","i can appreciate that position. i always tell other pro-choicers that i can't fault those who oppose abortion because they believe it is tantamount to murder. if i believed some segment of the population was being murdered for no real reason then i'd be trying to have the practice abolished as well. 

my position is simply that birth is a sufficient definition for the beginning of an individual and seperate life, and don't feel the need to define it as anything earlier, such as a zygote. if i'm pressed to rationalize that inherent position, i usually assert that birth served as the beginning of life for most of human history and it is reasonable to continue to use that definition. it is only because of modern science that we have an understanding of the previously unknown earlier stages of a baby (fetus, embryo, zygote, etc) and, inevitably, future scientific advancements will push back even further that knowledge. that being the case, i feel it's best to decide, as a society, what will be the definition for life going forward, otherwise we'll just be revisiting this issue for decades/centuries to come. 

as someone opposed to abortion, what are your thoughts on the implication of synthetic/artificial wombs on the abortion debate? at some point in the future...sooner than people expect i believe...medical science will developed the ability to extract a zygote and/or embryo from a woman with minimal invasiveness and gestate it entirely inside an artificial womb, if not start the process inside one. when this is a common ability, i think it'll be tough for anyone to defend abortion much, as the primary issue of letting a woman control her own body will be all but moot.

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","Looking back, every ""hard"" section I got to in Resonance of Fate was hard due to me not understanding how the game's mechanics worked.  For example, I didn't realize that your combined weapon level is also your character level, so I never bothered to teach my characters how to use anything other than their starting weapon, which left me ridiculously underleveled for some of the mid-game bosses, and left me stuck on one for several hours...once I figured out how the system worked I was able to complete the chapter with relative ease.  Also, it wasn't until I was five hours in that I realized it was possible to jump!  After spending some time watching gameplay videos online and looking at other people's weapon attachment setups, the game was a lot easier.  Knowing everything I know now, I could probably clear the game in a third of the time it took me originally.

Resonance of Fate isn't like other games, and in order to get very far you need to have a pretty solid grasp of how the game works.  If you don't understand the fundamental mechanics, the game will punish you for it.  Although this did lead to some frustrating moments, I think this is what I liked most about this game: Resonance of Fate forces you to get good at it before you're allowed to progress, rather than simply allowing you to mash buttons and just use the default equipment setup.","1338509425"

I'm a little confused by ""I suppose we could hide it, but I don't really want to do that either"".

I think you could fairly easily figure this one out if, instead of asking yourself whether you go ahead with the fetish, ask yourself ""should I still have a sex life with my partner now that I have a child?""

And then I hope you agree that this is a silly question. It's one of those ""you probably don't want to think about it, but your parents are still having sex"" things. Of course you're still going to have sex with your partner when you have kids. Sex is fun. It just so happens that your sex involves certain taboos, kinks or fetishes. I don't see how that makes a difference though.

Of course you keep your sex life hidden from your children. You're not going to have sex in their faces, are you? Your sex life happens to involve diapers or BDSM or Sissification (occasionally or always, it doesn't matter). So what. You limit it to the bedroom/time when your children are asleep.

If your children ever find out, it'll be seriously awkward. Guess what? It'll be seriously awkward if your kids catch you ""having consensual sex in the missionary position"" as well. Try your best not to make that happen. But I can't imagine it's the end of the world if it does.

As a side note, I'm sure everyone here has experience with ""quitting diapers"". Or, well: experience with trying, anyway. Chances are that, if you do quit, you're going to be unhappy about it for a long time. And nobody wants to have unhappy parents!","1338509445"

If I filter by the lowest buyout, I end up seeing level 12 and 18 items.

Here's how I price:

I only sell items I think are ""good"" for one or more classes.

I set the initial bid at half what I intend the buyout to be.

For level 1-20 items, ~8k for weapons, ~6k for armor.
For level 20-50 items ~20k for weapons, ~10-14k for armor.
(I'm only 47, so not sure what the markets look like at 50-60)

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","I see people say that Moore shouldn't complain because Watchmen is based on older Charlton characters.

As Image co-founder Erik Larsen said, ""if DC doesn't care about ***Moore's*** creations then why don't they make a prequel to the ***Charlton*** characters?

In fact, Grant Morrison was hired to do just that, made an interesting proposal, and guess what? The whole thing was shelved, and part of it is being used in the Before Watchmen comics, just like DC took Moore's Twilight Of The Superheroes proposal, shelved it, and years later hired Mark Waid to rewrite it as Kingdom Come. With a much more favorable contract for DC.

Sorry, but ""They've been doing it for decades already, it's not news so he shouldn't complain"" is no excuse. If we were talking about rape, it's been happening since prehistory, so why complain about it you asshole, huh?

The fact is, Before Watchmen is just another excuse to squeeze more prints out of the original material, hence ensuring the rights still remain out of Moore's hands. Every new bit of Watchmen material has been systematically given in tiny calculated drops to the public to boost the original material's sales. Check it:

* Pre-Watchmen movie rumors for years. Every time news about the movie arrived, sales of the miniseries got boosted.

* Movie arrives. Reprint sales boost.

* DVD arrives. Reprint sales boost.

* Director's Cut arrives. Reprint sales boost.

* Tales Of The Black Galleon. Reprint Sales Boost.

* Ultimate Cut. Reprint Sales Boost.

* Recolored Reprint. Sales Boost.

* Before Watchmen rumors. Reprint Sales Boost.

* Before Watchmen arrives.

Need I go on? Every time there is news about Watchmen there is a boost in the original's reprint sales. It's called milking the cow, and normally I wouldn't mind, but this isn't DC's cow. It's Moore's cow, which they ""borrowed until the baby grows up and they don't need any more milk."" Only the ""baby"" is by now a fat bearded adult they keep in diapers, so that they don't have to return the cow.

DC has behaved like a bunch of thugs since day One to Moore and everybody affiliated to Moore, and to defend them because you want to keep reading comics is as smart as defending your pusher because you want to keep getting your desired dosage.

Guess what? The pusher is killing you by feeding you diluted crap, and DC is killing your taste by feeding you crap comics. You're just too addicted to figure it out.","1338509454"

I would first make the entrance fee about $10 less than the lowest so they would have cash for food/etc., once you have enough rides, while always advertizing, you can up the cost of the park to the minimum amount anyone walks in with (I think it was between $30-90) and still charge for the best rides.

I can't remember what was considered high attendance but I think I had more than 2,000 people in a park once. I never did the math but I like to believe I may have, on my best parks, taken around 80-90% of all the money that entered the park","1338509455"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","There is some sort of historical consensus that Operation Barbarossa was a terrible strategic decision in every sense: Hitler's meddling made everything worse and tied up massive German forces that could've otherwise been used in Operation Sea Lion. The Battle of Britain had already denied the Germans air superiority, so their choices for invading Britain would've been a massive amphibious invasion or a proxy invasion through Ireland, which the British were preparing for to their fullest capacity (I have no doubt that the British would've adopted scorched-earth, extreme guerrilla tactics a la the Soviets should the Nazis penetrate into the countryside). The British army would still be a force to be reckoned with and the Nazis still would've been forced to sustain massive casualties in advancing inland. However, even if Britain had been tamed, the Nazis would still have to divert significant forces to maintain control and govern it. On the other hand, the Soviets would have time to prepare for a Nazi invasion, as Stalin was well aware that the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was temporary. There's also a definition of winning World War II to reckon with here. If by win World War II, you mean defeat and occupy both Britain and the Soviet Union, you still have the United States to contend with, because they would undoubtedly join the war eventually, especially because the Japanese had been planning Pearl Harbor even before Operation Barbarossa. The United States' industrial capacity would've exceeded that of Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and imperialist Japan combined, as it did during the actual war. Such a war (essentially the continents of Europe and Asia vs. the Americas) would have been far more devastating, but the Nazis and the Japanese would've had to deal with substantial internal dissent and sabotage by the peoples they occupied, who would've done everything they could to undermine their overlords.","1338509457"

Asking you what you're doing around here. This is harassment. This is a provocation. As far as I'm concerned, that is the same thing as throwing the first punch.

It absolutely isn't. If he was on public property and didn't lay a finger on Martin, Martin had *no* reason to react violently. 

&gt;Somebody following you around at night can legitimately put you in fear for your life.

Since you said this, let's drag out a hypothetical situation: what if Martin had been following Zimmerman? Would Zimmerman have been justified in shooting Martin because of that? No, because being uncomfortable doesn't give you the right to assault someone, whether it's with your hands, a bottle of tea (and/or skittles), or a gun. 

&gt;Zimmerman provoked a confrontation

There's no evidence (that I know of) that suggests that it was Zimmerman, and not Martin, who provoked the confrontation. 

&gt;Unless you have different facts in evidence, this is an absurdly open and shut case.

It would only be open-and-shut if we knew who ""threw the first punch"", so to speak. Without *actual* evidence that it was Zimmerman, you can't convict him.","1338509458"

The other dances, the homecomings and whatnot, really aren't that big of an issue for most girls. It certainly doesn't sound like they were an issue for your girlfriend. But this is the one dance that will probably mean something for her.

Go to the dance. Be as happy as you can. Try not to sulk. If all else fails, enjoy ogling your girlfriend in her fancy dress. Buy the pictures that they sell at the dance. Smile in the photos. Slow dance with her, slow dancing is easy as hell, you sway back in forth and slowly walk in a circle. Don't get pissy if she wants to dance to other songs alone or with other people, as long as she doesn't take it too far. Be the best boyfriend you can be for her, and reap the rewards later.

Also, if you can, dance a few of the other dances with her. Don't worry about the fact that you'll look like an idiot. Most people do.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","On one hand I understand why the community is upset. According to (some) people, we were promised a 2x IP boost, but instead we're given a 34% IP boost. I also believe we were also promised something else that was supposed to be given out via their Facebook page, but due to Facebook changing their layout and switching over to timeline it punched a hole in their plan and forced them to delay it even longer. I don't condone the fact that Riot promised us rewards, just to skip out on it. Now if Tamat or Nikasaur would've posted that this was a gift for waiting and that the prize(s) we were promised will come shortly, I'd have no objection to getting the 34% IP boost; seeing as there's no hint to that being the case, I'm slightly disappointed.

I understand the whole ""Dude, it's free and you are in no way obligated to spend any money what-so-ever on this game"" idea, but without a community to back them up we wouldn't even be in this situation. Also, IP has a very low value to it. With about 1/3 of the *almost* 100 champions being 6300, you have to work really hard to get them; not to mention their corresponding rune pages that can cost about ten thousand IP per champion per role. Ergo, the community that has brought it to where it is now probably deserves more than a 34% IP boost that goes through a single weekend. Without fans, you're pretty much nothing when it comes to business.

-----

On the other hand, Riot is a company and can only do so much to keep it's fans happy. We recently just got a graphics update that also upped FPS two fold, they release champions consistently, they actually TALK to their fans and listen to us, and I'm sure that we have fantastic gifts coming to us in the future.","1338509475"

You can find it online at a number of places online, but probably not many brick and mortar stores; they're distribution seems rather limited. Rather than strip mining their minerals like all the rest of the hydro aggregate, their product is made out of recycled glass (right here in the USA), and ends up with a texture reminiscent of lava rocks.

Evolution has nothing to do with atheism or agnosticism. Nothing. That's a red flag that you are a Christian, because they are the only group to consistently conflate the two ideas.

Agnosticism is simply the position that we can't know for certain. Just as you can't know there isn't a microscopically tiny ceramic monkey in the park without searching every square inch of the park, you can't know that no gods exist until you have searched everywhere for all possible gods. You can doubt that gods exist. You can consider it highly unlikely. You can refute the existence or at least description of every god posited by humans, but you can never know for certain that none exist. 

If you are not agnostic, then you are claiming that it is not possible for gods to exist. How do you know that? I'd love to have that evidence myself.

"Astronomy","t5_2qhor","It *is* possible that a few of them are actually foreground objects within our own galaxy - objects that lie between us and the Pinwheel galaxy - in which case planetary nebulae are not out of the question.

As you and others touched upon in previous posts, at its simplest this image is a composite of three monochromatic images, taken in red, blue, and visual (green) filters. Using an RGB colour scheme allows these images to be stacked, forming an approximate true colour image as we would observe it with our eyes. You may have seen it already, but for a simple and excellent description of this process - and video of the procedure - check out the [image processing description](http://hubblesite.org/gallery/behind_the_pictures) at Hubblesite.org.

Whether or not the ""green"" objects are foreground or associated with the Pinwheel itself, they are certainly brighter in the green filter than in either red or blue (or even infrared or near-UV, depending on which filters were used on Hubble to image this galaxy). Therefore, they don't emit as much radiation at blue or red wavelengths, indicative of particular atomic emission (such as Kyle_Daoust22 mentioned), and this is why they stand out in this composite image. As you correctly stated earlier, they would not actually be green to our own eyes, if we could view them firsthand from space ourselves.

To solve the mystery? Huge [surveys](http://www.sdss.org) of the sky have led to catalogues of such point sources and we could search by position to see what they actually are. My best guess is just stars or stellar remnants; remember the [Sun peaks in ~green emission as well!](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/SID/activities/images/solar_spectrum_composite.jpg)

**TL;DR**: Not necessarily unusual that they're green... Could be stars or stellar remnants, within our Galaxy or the Pinwheel.","1338509482"

The NBA has shown it is interested  in making basketball a more watchable sport by changing the rules to favor offensive-first teams following the 2005 Spurs/Pistons finals.  I believe they will eventually make rule changes to discourage blatant flopping and hack-a-player fouls.

The solution in my opinion is changing off-the-ball fouls in the penalty to returning the ball with a fresh clock.  If there are more than two off-the-ball fouls in the penalty, it becomes a technical and the fouled team retains possession.","1338509490"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;It just means the cost of his labor will be artificially inflated by the government. He will either find a job that pays more than he is worth, or he will need to make himself more valuable. 

To see why that's wrong, let's imagine he's selling his house instead of his labor. 

Let's suppose his house is worth $60,000. That is the maximum any buyer will pay for it. 

In order to ""help"" people with lower-priced homes, congress passes a minimum house price law: no house may be sold for less than $80,000. 

This does not help our friend. Instead, it hurts him. Before the law he could get 60k for his home, now he can't get anything, because it is literally illegal for someone to pay him what it's worth. Congress cannot increase or ""inflate"" the value of his home via legislation. If it could, then a one million dollar minimum house price law would make all homeowners rich (and a $100 per hour minimum wage law would do the same). 


&gt;I don't see how someone's labor could be worth less than $7.25 per hour unless someone is a terrible worker. 

Then there would be no point in having a $7.25 per hour minimum wage law, since it wouldn't affect anyone. ","1338509493"

In digital audio there is a phenomenon called the Nyquist Frequency. It basically states that, if reproducing audio digitally the sample rate of the audio must be twice the rate of the highest frequency you are producing in order to produce a perfect sample.

The upper frequency limit of human hearing is 20Khz so, in order to record every audible sound a minimum sampling rate of 40Khz must be used. This is why CDs are produced using a sampling rate of 44.1Khz.

According to [this thread](http://forums.ffshrine.org/f63/understand-proper-sample-rates-important-68280/) posted by someone who seems to know what he's talking about the sampling rate of a Game Boy is 22050Khz which means it can produce frequencies at a maximum of 11025Khz which is well within human hearing. Even if he's not correct I doubt with every fiber of my being that the original Game Boy had a sample rate of 40Khz. At the time of it's release that required a ludicrous amount of processing power and it didn't even have a dedicated sound chip.","1338509495"

"ainbow","t5_2tcpq","This is an epic piece. And it's all truth. 

I pretty much grew up the same way, though I was ***a lot more passive.*** For a long time I let people dictate that I cut my hair and more. Of course I didn't have quite the confidence you seemed to have. I stayed stealthy, for the most part, about it and misdirected and evaded MOST of the crap.

I remember in high school, some kid took offense to something about me and so made it obvious that he wanted a fight. I told him to his face what a terrible waste of time that was. Then I walked away and left him fuming. This was in my sophomore year. Fast forward to Senior Year and the kid catches up with me and actually apologizes. I told him I hardly even remembered the incident. It was true. I hardly even thought twice about him after walking away.

After all, I literally did refuse to let him have any satisfaction of being a bully. It wasn't cowardice, it wasn't anything but contempt and I made that known loudly, because he delivered his challenge publicly and I publicly shunned him. I made it clear that if he attacked me that I would defend myself but wouldn't go beyond that. Respect was won then, and by my senior year, I was accepted anyway so it didn't matter.

You don't have to fight every fight, but if you fight the fights that really matter, most people will respect you for it even if they disagree with you. 
You can always ignore the immature ones who don't respect you, especially if you don't let them waste their time on you. I played things a lot more defensively, and it was very draining. It still is, I suppose. 

But I definitely stood up for myself when it really mattered and I did not do anything wrong in doing so. I played a good clean game, and rarely had to swing a fist in defense. I like it like that, since it was far easier for me to outsmart the bullies rather than to confront them.","1338509497"

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","First, the man was never legally declared mentally disturbed or ever committed if he had a CCW permit, as having that recorded would be enough to prevent him access to gun ownership and a CCW permit in WA.  By accounts, his mental disturbance was being excessively irritable.

My point is lawful owners appear to be the source of most illegal gun acquisitions, by illegal resale/gifting or by negligence.  Therefore, making it harder for them to get guns makes it harder for them to make it an illegal gun through sale or negligence.  We don't have to prevent anyone from getting a gun, and do you really think making illegal gun trade more difficult won't prevent anyone from getting an illegal gun?  I don't see why people who want guns illegally have infinite wells of willpower, yet legal gun-seekers appear to give up at any obstacle in these scenarios.

I dislike guns as they are the ultimate escalation of a conflict, and they put the lives of everyone around the situation in grave danger.  I'll take the policeman who has required gun training over the guy who got his CCW permit because he wanted one and WA is a ""shall-issue"" state.  The Seattle Center shooting was a bystander getting hit by someone attempting to use a gun in self defense (probably illegally, sure, but I think still pertinent to this scenario since he was first attacked with a skateboard).","1338509510"

"relationship_tips","t5_2sa5c","It's not that you go to your SO for ALL things, it's just that they are your number one go to person.  Think of it like a super hero.  A super hero might have a side kick as well as a whole supporting cast.  In the case of some problems they might go to a support person about it. But in the majority of cases, the hero and the side kick are side by side fighting the same battles, together.  The ""extra"" people are just that, extras.

I'm more introverted but I have some very extroverted long time friends so I like to think I understand where you are coming from.  One of the main pitfalls of such long time friends is that you fail to let your SO into the inner circle of your life because you just don't have that need.  They are prevented from stepping up and becoming your go to person because there is no space there.  Your needs in that department might be filled already, but I believe that a relationship requires people to support one another in the day to day.  That way when things really get tough, like a miscarriage, major job loss, or big illness, you have that support structure of your SO built, tested and ready to go.  Kind of like, the trial runs are important because when the shit goes down everyone has to know what to do and how to handle it.

Its a tough situation because bitching to your friends about your mean boss is one thing, but going to them instead of going to your SO, repeatedly, and for large issues in your life is another thing entirely.

In your case you might need to make some room for your SO here.  Not that it sounds like your SO feels this way in this case, but I don't know them or what they think.

As a final word, there are close friends and there is family.  Now, a person might consider close friends as family but 10, 15, 20 or 50 years down the line the SO will still be family, the one who you see every day of your life.  They will be the one you trust the most with your children, they will be the one that you tie finances with, they will be the one that you build your family with. because of that I believe in building the kind of relationship, where you also share the most problems with them.  It's you two angst the world.

Not that I'm saying anything is wrong with other relationship structures or anything like that.  I've gotten a little off topic of emotional affairs.  If your SO has no problem with what you are doing then fuck the haters. At the end of the day they are the only one who's opinion on the topic matters, because they're your main person after all.","1338509513"

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","I think my issue is that her personality quirks can't be explained as mercurial. She certainly is that, and more, but being mercurial doesn't necessarily imply ignorance or naivety. 

It's rough reading about a person who goes through life dabbling in this and that without real concern for the consequences, so thoroughly unprepared when it comes to confrontation, adversity, and even social interaction and often acting out of base emotion rather than thought. 

Then again, most of the other characters in the book treat her like a childish nuisance so maybe Kim accomplished exactly what he set out to do. I just don't think she's a very sympathetic character, and she doesn't have much of a *presence* in the actual story. Just someone experiencing it alongside the reader.

For example, [spoiler](/s ""Swan expresses a common thought on charity - ""We're giving Earth so much food, why don't they appreciate it? Why do their people hate spacers so much?"". One of the other characters describes how the leadership is the issue - that food isn't getting to the people who need it even though there's more than enough. Someone who's starving can't be expected to appreciate the fact that someone *else* is benefiting from charity, nor laud the people who approach charity so bluntly and create even more problems. She's not showing the maturity of thought I'd expect out of a 130-year-old, and her character comes off as willfully or woefully ignorant in the context of her peers, who are products of the same society as hers."")

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","here's your most simple, blunt honest break down.

95% of the people on the conservative right of the US don't really know why they feel the way they do about things. all they know is, they're religious, and they have to follow their religious leaders. as of right now, social and economic conservatism are intertwined on the right. they think, ""my religious leader thinks this way, and hes a good christian like me! obviously this is the right way"" 

i mean, a normal person is not going to say ""let someone without health insurance die"" and that they don't want to help that person get insurance in the first place. they think, ""you're fat and lazy and im better than you"" -even though ironically red states are less healthy and use more federal income tax than they give  -as opposed to most blue states (those socialist loving commies).  

but anyway, religion has lead these people down a path which they get to the end of and don't even know why they're there. they 'want' a ""free for all"" society, where everyone is on their own. not being able to place themselves in someone elses shoes who hasnt had the same opportunity or experiences in life. they think, ""i did this, why cant everyone else?"" without stopping to think not everyone is born with the same opportunity. 

everyone should have free basic health care and education. you just have to drag conservatives kicking and screaming into the 20th century (yes, 20th).

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Unfortunately, I don't use medicinal marijuana. I am going to be the first in line though when it becomes legal in Texas though. So many who deal with MS praise it's ability to control pain and spasticity. In my state, doctors in general are too scared to prescribe hard pain medication. Around most major hospitals in this state, there are drug dealers that hang around the cafeterias and outside, jumping at the chance to take advantage of it with patients in so much pain. So my state has a very long way to go before we get to where medicinal marijuana is legalized, because even codeine is considered overly risky to prescribe a patient.

Diet has been extremely helpful for me. I use Betaseron for my infusions, and it does help a good deal. I was stubborn, stopping it early on after my diagnosis. I paid for it after a couple of months landed me in the hospital for a couple of weeks. Eating salads rich with vitamins, lots of fruit and cutting out processed meals has been tremendous in allowing my body a fighting chance. Not only does it keep the weight coming off while being sedentary, but it gives me energy &amp; keeps my mind sharp. After so long, fast food now tastes revolting, which is so easy to use as a primary diet when you have no strength or means to cook.

In digital audio there is a phenomenon called the Nyquist Frequency. It basically states that, if reproducing audio digitally the sample rate of the audio must be twice the rate of the highest frequency you are producing in order to produce a perfect sample.

The upper frequency limit of human hearing is 20Khz so, in order to record every audible sound a minimum sampling rate of 40Khz must be used. This is why CDs are produced using a sampling rate of 44.1Khz.

According to [this thread](http://forums.ffshrine.org/f63/understand-proper-sample-rates-important-68280/) posted by someone who seems to know what he's talking about the sampling rate of a Game Boy is 22050Khz which means it can produce frequencies at a maximum of 11025Khz which is well within human hearing. Even if he's not correct I doubt with every fiber of my being that the original Game Boy had a sample rate of 40Khz. At the time of it's release that required a ludicrous amount of processing power and it didn't even have a dedicated sound chip.","1338509523"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I met some people at the pool over the weekend that had started using ecigs, and they told me there is a B&amp;M shop in town now, but they said they were paying $9 for a 10mL bottle. Thing is, in KY, you can still buy grade A cigarettes for just over $3 a pack, so if you vape 3 mL a day (which IMO is about average), you are spending the same amount on juice as you were on cigs. That was the complaint of the people I talked to. They said they were all for the health aspects, but they were also hoping to save a little money. I gave them a card for ivape.net. :D

Edit: I would like to add, I'm not trying to say don't support your local B&amp;M, but I totally understand why it's often better for some people to order online. ","1338509531"

I understand what you are getting at.  Again, as you well know, Muslims in America are politically powerless, so my opinions on the matter don't have any effect on anyone.  If I am in a majority-Muslim country, that would change.

&gt;But it is palatable to your sensibilities?

Once Allah and his messenger decree a thing, the believers have no say.  I agree with the punishment for apostasy *under certain conditions,* none of which exist today.

&gt;Just to be absolutely crystal clear.
If you failed to fast, God would send you to hell?

No one knows the answer to that.  Allah has made it clear that anyone who dies knowing Islam is the truth but refusing to accept it will go to hell forever.  In the case of Muslims, Allah has reserved the option for himself to forgive them for any sins and admit them to paradise immediately, or to send them to hell for some time as a punishment for sins.  As long as a Muslim dies with an atom's worth of belief that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad (pbuh) is his messenger, even if he is sent to hell for some time he will eventually go to paradise, and once he is in paradise he will live there for an eternity.

"TeraOnline","t5_2s527","Hey Scapes, I know you read this nice little subreddit so hear me out here so I don't have to hope someone sees it through the mess that I'm sure the general discussion board will be.

I'm really disappointed in this news and schedule. Without trying to pull the 'blah blah blah I've been following Tera and En Masse forever blah blah blah' card, I'm someone who has invested quite a bit into Tera throughout the last few years. I'm also a pretty regular college student who likes to play MMOs with his friends, hold movie viewings with other friends, and go out on the town with other other friends, and a schedule like this is what ultimately made me quit other MMOs. I simply don't like having to schedule my life around events in a game. Part of what drew me to Tera initially was that most of the content was created for small groups, allowing for a lot of flexibility in play time instead of having to sit down every Tues/Wed/Thurs from 9-12 in order to progress through a game. I understand that nexus events can't be random or anything like that, but having them only appear on the weekends has pretty much killed any chance of me participating in them on a normal basis. In order to get the revered rewards from Agnitor I'd have to skip out on more of my life than I feel comfortable thinking about. Please send a message to some of the other big wigs in En Masse asking them to rethink the schedule - or at least to add a few nexus events on the weekdays so I don't have to wait four months to get my lovely top hat!

It was really hard, and I dealt with it very poorly.  I did lots of drugs, and pretty much maintained a relationship with her!  I afforded her my friendship (something she desperately desired) when in actuality, it was my only bargaining chip.  Worst idea ever.  It makes me so angry, even to this day, not that I allowed it to happen, but that I dealt with it so poorly.  Salvage the little bit of dignity you still have by severing all ties with her.  Delete phone numbers, Facebooks, burn pictures (seriously, it's cathartic) and leave her explicit instructions to never contact you again.

I quit smoking on Jan 04, 2012 which was 4 days after I found out I was pregnant. I gave it a couple weeks before telling my mom I'd quit and said it was a New Year's resolution. About a month after that she randomly starts accusing me of smoking again without rhyme or reason. To make it perfectly obvious that I wasn't smoking I texted a picture of the 1st ultrasound to her. She didn't check it for 4 days, during which she still bitched at me for smoking. Once she finally decided to look at the picture it took her another 24 hrs to figure out it was an ultrasound pic of a 12week fetus and the baby had a happy face. The text attached to the pic said ""No. I'm not smoking and this is why."" 

Once she figured it I'm pregnant she told EVERYONE in my family. The only person I was able to tell myself was my grandma. My mom had already told her but Grammy has Alzheimers and I could tell her 30 times a week and she wouldn't remember unfortunately. I never got to see my little brother's face when he was told he is gonna be an uncle (my mom said he was super happy and excited). My little brother loves kids and will be a great uncle and a wonderful dad some day. My dad cried and I didn't get a chance to hug him when he found out. As for my mom she was so excited that she called me at 3am after she figured it out and was screaming her head off into my voice-mail. 

When we found out the gender my mom took the envelope that had the ultrasound pics and was going through them. I asked her not to spoil tell anyone and let my Dad and brother find out by looking themselves. Her gender was printed right over her genitals. My mom yelled out as loud as she could ""OMG Its a girl!!!"" Once again surprise spoiled. I'm not going to tell her when I go into labor, and have my little girly.

another way of lookign at it is Sonnen had four and half rounds of the fight in his own domain (wrestling) and couldn't get a stoppage from G-n-P despite throwing punches nonstop in andersons guard. to be clear, this fight was never in a position to be stopped from ground strikes. Anderson was never warned that the fight would be stopped.

 guard is a neutral position. it can also be a bottom dominant position in grappling due to more submissions from open guard than being in a guard. but you are right, being in someones guard means you are dominating them. do you also yell to ""stand em up ref!!"" every time it hits the mat?

Chael could not gain a dominant position (full mount, back control ect) or secure a submission or attempt despite being on top in 4 rounds. he rarely advanced position and his striking was ineffective. silva had harder strikes from the bottom except in  round one when Sonnen was standing and landed on anderson on the ground at 1:30. that was his hardest ground strike the entire fight.

Well, not all of them hate transwomen. Some simply do not believe them to be women, but men. It is absolutely beyond debate to say that many radfems are essentialist. The argument usually goes that the problem isn't essentializing female characteristics, but the fact that patriarchy makes those characteristics ""bad"" or ""lesser than."" So, if they are essentialist, then of course they are going to say that certain people are *essentially* not women. 

Again, I disagree with the position that transwomen are not women, but it is completely absurd to me to think that there are feminists that are simply erasing the essentialist discussion from feminist discourse and saying that those that hold that position are not feminists. ","1338509559"

I take issue merely with the ignorance displayed in this thread in regards to gross generalizations of Puerto Ricans and what I deemed as an unnecessary title noting the ethnicity of the attackers.

Why should matter if everyone knew the OP was attacked by Puerto Ricans, does that make his situation more sympathetic because it was a lone white man against the horrible actions of a group of idiots? If race had no bearing on the reason for the attack, then why mention it? How would everyone respond if he simply said he was attacked by 20 thugs?

As you can see, by simply stating the supposed ethnicity of his attackers, he opened this thread up for the ignorant remarks you see. Yes I take offense to these remarks, I've put up with plenty of racism in my life and have even been attacked myself for simply being Hispanic.

I just find it a little disheartening that fellow redditors upvote these remarks. I'm not naive to the horrors of the internet, but it just seems like a double standard when generalizations of African Americans are a no-no, but you can say crap like this.","1338509563"

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","I agree with you completely.  Religion has for the most part become demonized in our world today.  With the Atheist movement collecting a large portion of the population, religion as a whole seems to be viewed as almost quaint and out dated.  There is however, a significant roll that spirituality plays in our existences, and for most people religion is the building block of that roll.  

I was raised in a Christian Science church until about twelve, and then it dawned on me that the teachings were being overshadowed by the politics of the church.  While the ending of my church going days wasn't terrific, the metaphysical framework that was established certainly helped pave the way for future breakthroughs and insights. 

As our discussion rolled through my mind, it dawned on me that people will take from religion what they are ready to accept and acknowledge.  For some, it's a feeling of comfort for doing the ""right thing"", and for others it's a way of exploring the unknown and uncertainty that comes with life.  In either case, the subject will receive the message they are looking to attain, regardless of spiritual value or depth.  ","1338509566"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","During an Unhallowed Metropolis game, my team (consisting essentially of a US Senator based on Teddy Roosevelt, Clint Eastwood-renamed Colt Eastbranch, a giant steam-powered robot, the Butcher from Gangs of New York, and Dr. Frankenstein) and our airship was attacked by airship pirates. First of all, the enemy airship's captain was a vampire. They lined up along side of us and warned us to surrender. We refused and began combat. He attempted to use mind control to take over our senator. He rolled to resist and critically succeeded. The GM then allowed him reverse mind control the vampire and made it throw itself off its airship down several hundred feet where it pasted itself onto the ground. A couple pirates managed to swing on over by rope and were swiftly dispatched by myself and the Butcher. A third attempted to board but hit the side of our airship and fell to his death. The last one also fell to his death, because I shot the rope as he swung across.

In hopes of getting more pirates on our ship and giving themselves better shots the pirates moved closer. The Butcher and I boarded them, killing all in our path. We noticed they had a cannon and went in search of the black powder for it. We got a couple barrels of it and went to put them out on the boarding deck so we could shoot them and blow the enemy airship up. However, we ran into the enemy engineer. He was a massive figure, several feet tall and a few hundred pounds of pure muscle. He had a big monkey wrench in one hand and a welding mask on, for whatever reason. So, he hits the Butcher who gets knocked out. I immediately drop my gun, put on some brass knuckles and charge him. I roll to hit him. I get a nat 20. So, the GM decides that my punch was so powerful that I caved-in the welding mask into the engineer's face, crushing his skull. I also resisted all damage from that punch. I got my guns and scooped by buddy up while kicking these barrels out to the boarding area the pirates had set up. I swung back across onto our ship and then we pulled away. As we did, our Senator took my scoped Winchester rifle and took aim at the barrels. With a single shot, he blew the whole airship out of the sky. 

We've been running some fun games, using action physics, pulling witty one-liners (getting bonus XP for those), and just going by rule-of-cool as long as the roles are good enough.

Also, in a Pathfinder game, I had a Paladin with a 20 rating in Strength and 18s and 16s in everything else. The one time randomly rolling stats has worked for me. Anyway, at one point we had been knocked out with gas pumped into a cave while we were killing some baddies. Then, we awoke to find ourselves on a slave ship. I immediately told people what I was going to do: Break free. So, I broke out of my chains and ripped the iron door off the slave hold. I threw it a guard (a small rat-person thing), crushing him. I think took his sword and killed another guard who had a long spear, which I took and then ran through the ship making guard shish kabobs.","1338509571"

Vigil says that ""Ilos was a top secret facility"", which implies that it was secret before the invasion; and if official records of its existence were ""destroyed"" (either by retreating Protheans or simple Reapers attacks), there was no records that the Reapers could read.

Well, ya know, the papers got blown up in the explosions and... oh, wait, this is digital information. :) While what you're saying is certainly more logical than information on Ilos just getting lost in the fall of the Citadel and the people on Ilos going with it, I'm not sure enough information exists in the game to support the idea that the writers thought it through. I mean, if Ilos was the site of an Area 51-type base (the mythical Area 51, not the boring real one :) ), then that makes some sense.

&gt;This is literally the only bad line in the scene with Vigil, I remember rolling my eyes so hard the first time it said this. I can forgive it. All they had to say was ""Our scientists had many theories; none of them proveable. In the end, what does it matter? Your survival depends on stopping it, not in understanding it.""

Exactly! But when non-sciencey people put words in scientists' mouths, they tend to infuse them with much more of a willingness to state things with certainty that they never would. Having Vigil just rehash Sovereign's ""the Reapers are beyond our comprehension"" just didn't work for me at all. I just kept hoping that Bioware themselves knew even if they weren't coughing it up (but, as I said before, most of the time in situations like this, the writers don't know).

On that note, I came across [this interview with Mac Walters](http://business.financialpost.com/2012/03/05/qa-mass-effect-3s-mac-walters-on-how-the-game-tries-to-reach-all-audiences/), one of the lead writers of ME3. Sort of confirms the degree to which Drew Kashpyrshyn was implying they were making it up as they went along.
&gt;
&gt;**DK**: How much of the story was sketched out from the beginning and how much was written after the completion of the other games?
&gt;
&gt;**MW**: I think people would be sort of surprised by how little we defined in the upcoming games. So in Mass Effect 1, it was really only a couple of paragraphs about what we thought Mass Effect 2 would be and even less of what we thought Mass Effect 3 would be. And it was the same thing when we where doing 2. It was really about having stakes in the ground about certain things. We knew that Mass Effect 3 would be about, the Reapers returning. We knew that it would be about the galactic conflict that would ensue from that, and we knew that it would be the end of Shepard’s story, one way or the other.
&gt;
&gt;And other than those sort of key stakes, we didn’t tie ourselves into something, which is good, because it allowed us to do whatever we wanted as long as we weren’t veering away too much from [those key stakes].
&gt;
&gt;In three we had the lore pushing us from behind and the looming conflict pull us forward, but most of the details from Mass Effect 3 were developed post-Mass Effect 2. Like 99.5% of them. We hashed it and and figured it out.
&gt;
&gt;And that’s really the only way you can do it because, going back to the concept of all the choices the player could have made in Mass Effect 1 and 2, until we can see what all of those possibilities are, there’s really no way plan out the details of the story for Mass Effect 3.

There was ""no way"" they could plan that out? Well, they didn't have to plan out *everything*, but having a.) a coherent plan for how your unstoppable villains will be stopped and b.) what their motivation is are pretty important points. :)

&gt;ME3 should have opened with Shepard's trial on Arcturus Station, where the Alliance Brass are grilling him/her about your choices throughout the series. Then you hear about the Reaper attack on Earth, and the war starts.

Something like that, yeah. Though that might've been momentum-killing. A lot of times in this sort of story, you want to open with action before you slow things down for character and plot development.","1338509580"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","This is pretty much how I feel. In the 90's, grunge/alternate was the dominant form of rock music, but you still had heavy metal, thrash metal, and some good old classic hard rock albums that were being released. There was such a great diversity to choose from and no shame in dabbling in more than one genre.

Nearly 20 years later, R&amp;B, hip hop and crappy pop artists dominate top 40. Not really a problem if that is the kind of music you listen to, but rock music has been on the decline and your comment about Foo Fighters is spot on. Who else could be considered as mainstream as them?

Also, the ""trendy"" type of rock that gets airtime on any rock stations I'm around happen to be indy or folk rock bands. There is such a lack of diversity available that rock music in general has become stagnant (at least on radio it has). 

People will say that there are plenty of bands on the internet and that is where you will find diversity. However, it doesn't matter if those bands don't get recognition or air time play. The majority of people will never hear of them and rock music as we used to know it will die off.","1338509581"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; If I pay for the medical care I'm not sure how I'm taking it from others.

There are a finite number of healthcare resources, and we're actually beginning to experience a shortage in healthcare resources. If you'd ever had to wait at urgent care or the ER, you would see how you're taking it away from others -- you're delaying their care, and possibly worsening their health.

In addition, in most cases you aren't directly paying for your care. An insurance company pays for your care. Because the pool of money they have to cover all patients is finite, the aggregate effect of many people deciding not to wear their seatbelts (and therefore requiring more insurance payouts) would be to drive up everyone's insurance costs.

TL;DR: You might not be sure how it works, but the sum effect of people not wearing seatbelts (or taking other generally mandatory precautions) is to increase healthcare costs across the board. So there is a huge economic downside to *not* having a mandatory seatbelt law, but there's no real upside.","1338509582"

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","I've already commented on this in a couple of other discussions. I thought I would spread this information...

In digital audio there is a phenomenon called the Nyquist Frequency. It basically states that, if reproducing audio digitally the sample rate of the audio must be twice the rate of the highest frequency you are producing in order to produce a perfect sample.

The upper frequency limit of human hearing is 20Khz so, in order to record every audible sound a minimum sampling rate of 40Khz must be used. This is why CDs are produced using a sampling rate of 44.1Khz.

According to [this thread](http://forums.ffshrine.org/f63/understand-proper-sample-rates-important-68280/) posted by someone who seems to know what he's talking about the sampling rate of a Game Boy is 22050Khz which means it can produce frequencies at a maximum of 11025Khz which is well within human hearing. Even if he's not correct I doubt with every fiber of my being that the original Game Boy had a sample rate of 40Khz. At the time of it's release that required a ludicrous amount of processing power and it didn't even have a dedicated sound chip.","1338509586"

Looking at him, I was so wrong. He's excellent at tackling--he's better than most players in the Premier League at tackling. He can dribble great, and attempts the long ball, something most Arsenal players don't try except Ramsey(who after losing form just doesn't do it anymore).

Statistics are statistics. I don't see how a number can be trash. I'm always confused when people argue about the relative merits of a statistic. If I flip a coin, and it lands on heads, then that's a datum. It would be bad to argue that the 100% heads success rate is representative of all coin flips, but that doesn't make the statistic trash.

What you're trying to argue is that, because the variance in the data is so large (or the number of samples is so small), we have difficulty convincingly arguing that one player is more clutch than the other.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Sure.  It's DEFINITELY best that you don't get involved with the online porn thing.  When I was 14 we had 56k so that was impossible, but I digress.  

NoFap has a lot of people who are porn addicts or addicted to orgasms.  Likewise there are people here who have enjoyed both and are addicted to neither.  Some are doing this to support somebody else they know doing this.  Some are here for a self discipline aspect.  This is going to cause different people to respond differently to your question.  An addict might tell you to definitely try and restrain yourself.  That makes sense for them, because even just a little bit and all the hard work they put in can vanish suddenly.  A person who casually masturbates every known and again might say ""whatever no problem"".  You know yourself better than we do at this point.  You have to do what you feel is right for you.

My two cent is that is at your age no matter what you do you are going to get incredible urges to sex things up.  The biological release for that if you're not having sex (which at 14 I think you're still too young for), is masturbation.  Alternately, if you don't do that, you will have a wet dream.  It just happens.  The older you get, the less the hormones rage, and though you will still have lots of testosterone in your system, you'll get used to it.  

There are plenty of people who can do it and not be addicted to it.  When I was 14 I would not have even tried this, I was just too horny, although I did feel guilty about it for a while until I learned that over 90% of males do it.  Two years later I gave it up for lent, and told my Dad when he asked what I gave up.  His response was ""Well, I never really talked to you about the birds and the bees cause I figured they'd cover that in school, but if you're doing this cause you think it's a sin or whatever it's totally fine and completely normal.  Besides, better that than you going and getting some girl pregnant"".  

If you do decide to undertake this challenge, learn how to do your own laundry so that when the inevitable wet dreams happens you don't have to worry about your mom or whoever does your laundry noticing that.

Whatever you decide, good luck! It's 100% your call. ","1338509601"

"StudentLoans","t5_2ror6","Jen_Snow is right!

You can not consolidate Federal loans with Private (personal) loans.  

Your personal loans have interest rates that are usually based on your credit score, so be sure to pay off any credit card debt, etc.

The IBR plan is a good plan and the Income Contingent Repayment (ICR).  I usually do the IBR since it is depended on your last year's AGI.

Look into the special consolidation offered by the Obama Administration.  If you want more info and steps, just call the servicer of your loans now and ask them to explain it to you.  All of them would be able to tell you estimates and how things can be consolidated.

That's 3600 words per minute, minimum. Assuming I'm getting $10 an hour (which wasn't going to happen if I was doing only 60 words per minute,) that's 360 words for $1, or $2.77/1000 words. In the United States.

Obviously that any service needs credibility. Google achieved that and stores lifetimes of emails where privacy and security is rarely asked.

"redditrequest","t5_2rlnw","You have a problem with the term ""Shitlord?"" I think it's descriptive in an interesting way. Redditors are lords of shit, imagining they're royalty when they're really stinky. But even even if you don't like it, it describes what a person does, not who they are. It's different from a racial slur in that way. Racial slurs are much worse because of this.

I've been thinking of good things that have come from hatred, rage and mockery, and it's a class that includes maybe most of the art that's ever been created. Activism is often based on hate. Mockery (and its cousin, shame) are a great way of changing people's behaviors. 

The thing is: It all depends on the target. When people in a corrupt dictatorship mock the powerful, it's a positive, useful thing, even when it comes from a place of hatred and contempt.

When, say, a white person makes nigger jokes, it's the exact opposite.

SRS's targets are (usually) sexists and racists on reddit, who are hated for the fucked up things they say and do. I really don't see what the problem is with that. 

Personally, I don't care what reddit thinks about anything. I'm not interested in providing a free education to willfully ignorant people on the internet. I'm not interested in converting anyone.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","&gt; it's very difficult to define from a legislative standpoint to define what is or isn't a safe warning shot

No, it's incredibly simple, and already on the books:

If you cause property damage or personal injury with your shot, it wasn't safe.  If you did not cause such damage/injury, then we can't know if it was unsafe, and unless proven guilty you are assumed innocent.

Sure some unsafe shooters *might* get lucky and get off scott free the first time, or even many times.  So what?  If they did no damage, there's nothing to prosecute anyway.  But the first time luck isn't on their side, they pay the price.

Yes... its all very simple.  But people prefer to complicate things with enormous legal tomes that are ""insanely long and incomprehensible"", etc.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There's two main types of race cars: enclosed wheel and open wheel.

Enclosed wheel cars are generally modified versions of the cars you see driving down the street. For example, I believe the current NASCAR champion drove a Chevrolet Impala. You can buy one of those from your local dealership, although the one that won the championship had a lot more stickers and some well-paid engineers tinkering with the engine.

24 hour Le Mans is also enclosed wheel, they're all cars that you can go out and buy yourself. This is supposed to add to the excitement because you're working with a standard product and doing the best you can with it. 24 hour Le Mans, by the way, is who can go the furthest in 24 hours. It's held in Le Mans, France. Petit Le Mans uses the same idea but runs for 10 hours around a track in Georgia.

These are endurance races (who can go the furthest in a set time). Most races are who can complete a distance in the shortest time. Either around the track at the same time, or by completing a route one after another.

Open wheel cars look like [this](http://www.hdwallpapersarena.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/formula-1-cars.jpg). You won't have seen anything like this parked on your street, as they're purpose built. The excitement here is that they're much faster and the science and techy geeks love the fact that they've been built from scratch. They're thoroughbred racing machines.

For both types of racing, each country generally has its own national leagues (or championships, as they're called in auto racing). These are usually ranked lower than the international championships, where the best in the world all compete on one track. Often a young driver will prove himself at national level and then graduate to international.

'Formula' denotes the type of racing, and generally, the lower the number, the faster, more powerful and more prestigious the championship. So Formula 2 is a slower version of Formula One. Formula One is often seen as the pinnacle of all motorsport, and that's where the drivers are paid tens of millions of dollars per year and become international celebrities.

As with many sports, American racing such as Nascar is not very popular outside of the States and what is popular with the rest of the world (Formula One, touring cars, the World Rally Championship) rarely makes an impression within the States.

Auto racing is a huge and wide-ranging topic. I'm not sure if I've covered everything you were hoping to learn, but those are the basics. If you want to know anything more specific, let me know.","1338509630"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've had a tooth drilled after the numbing agent had worn off. My dentist must have been a greedy sob, because he was working on at least 3 other patients. He obviously wasn't paying me the attention I needed, because he would leave for like 20 mins at a time. I was still a teenager and even more socially awkward than I am now, so when he was drilling into my tooth I didn't know wtf to do. His assistant noticed I was clutching the arm rests pretty hard and asks the dentist to stop. He just mumbled ""sorry"" and injected my gums again.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt; rules of the playtest

Because it's going to completely undermine Wizard's efforts to solicit my feedback and allow me to play and respond. It's not my fault that their playtest is using a sub-par distribution methodology.

&gt; and this subreddit

That rule is there to prevent payed materials being linked to and pirated on the subreddit on the basis that the only real revenue stream that most of the publishers have is their books. They make money by controlling who gets what rules. And that's, at present, the best method to monetize P&amp;P RPGs so I can't really fault them for wanting to discourage piracy of these materials(arguments about using them on a trial basis aside). There's quite a difference between some playtest documents that wouldn't let you play a whole game and a full ruleset.

If you wanted to, I suppose you could use the 5th Edition ruleset they provide to adapt an earlier edition to a quasi-5.0 D&amp;D game. But anyone with the legit materials can do that. And it's absolutely *free* to play these materials. I just wanted an alternative distro because I'm unable to access the Wizard of the Coast website on my cell phone.","1338509634"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","I've played a Bladesinger since I first read about them.
Here's the data for a Bladesinger from back in 2nd Ed. 


**BLADESINGER**

 Of the roving elves, there are few as deadly as the Bladesinger. They are masters of their
weapons and have spent their lives in the study of their chosen weapons. They have also learned
to cast spells while engaged in combat, and thus they double their might.

  To be a Bladesinger, a character needs at least a 13 Strength and Constitution, as well as a 15 Dexterity and Intelligence.

·  Role. While some characters may stay at home to defend the elven way, Bladesingers go out and actively promote it. They do this by seeking out their race's foes and eliminating them, either through words or actions. Acting as both diplomats and one-elf armies, they insure the safety of the elf race.

·  Secondary Skills. Hunter, Trader/Barterer, Trapper/Furrier.

·  Weapon Proficiencies. Bonus: None. Recommended: One-weapon style for use in combat and spells; two-handed style for use when spells run out.

·  Bonus Nonweapon Proficiencies. Blind-Fighting, Dancing.

·  Recommended Nonweapon Proficiencies. Etiquette, Juggling, Singing, Tumbling, Weaponsmithing.

·  Equipment. The Bladesinger is always identifiable by his weapon of choice. Such an item is always ornate and beautiful, enhancing the Bladesinger's appearance in battle.

·  Distinctive Appearance. Not only are they easily identifiable by their weapon of choice and catlike grace, Bladesingers are decorated with their weapon guild's distinctive tattoo. Each guild has a separate and unique tattoo depicting its style of weapon through an animal representation. Long swords are often represented by great cats such as lions or panthers, a whip would be shown as a striking snake, and so forth.

·  Special Benefits. There are four special benefits to the Bladesinger kit, as follows:

--The Bladesinger chooses one weapon and practices with it extensively, to the exclusion of most other weapons. If practice makes perfect, the Bladesingers are very well practiced in their weapon of choice-for they are virtually perfect.

  The poised steps of the bladesong (the act of attack by a Bladesinger) not only reveals the Bladesinger to be a creature of beauty even during battle, but the steps also carry him into advantageous positions for either offense or defense. He can instinctively grasp the flow of the battle around him, and his feet will carry him through the intricate maneuvers necessary to optimize his attack.

Such is the intensive training of the Bladesinger that he gains an automatic +1 to attack rolls as well as a +1 for damage. This is in addition to the normal elven +1 for use of the long or short sword (if applicable). Despite any additional, further training, this is as high as the bonus can be.
  
--Bladesingers receive a special bonus when they wish to try an unusual maneuver with their blade. This bonus is equal to +1 for every four levels the Bladesinger has attained. The bonus only serves to cancel the penalties normally applied for such a maneuver. All other penalties and bonuses still apply.
 
  EXAMPLE: Vilana Pyreen, a 5th-level Bladesinger proficient in the long sword, attempts to disarm her opponent (a special maneuver). Normally, this gives her a +1 to initiative and a -4 to attack rolls. Since she is a 5th-level Bladesinger, however, her bladesinging ability gains her a +1 on her disarm maneuver. Since she is an elf, she gains an additional +1 because she is using her sword. Finally, she gains a +1 for her bladesinging ability with her sword. Her total is only a -1 to disarm her foe. If she were 12th level, she would have a +1 on her disarming attack.   

--Bladesingers have been taught from an early age to grasp the flow of magic around them and to turn it to their advantage. They can cast spells even while in the front lines. Although they cannot actually attack while casting their spells, they may defend themselves against
incoming melee attacks.

  Their defense is equal to their level divided by 2, plus 1. All fractions are rounded down. Thus, a 6th-level Bladesinger gains a +4 to AC (6th level/2=3+1=+4 AC). The same goes for 7th-level Bladesingers (7/2=3.5 -.5=3+1=+4 AC). This does not apply to rear or missile attacks, for it is nearly impossible to defend against those while casting a spell.

  Bladesingers have practiced the somatic portion of their spells well enough that they may cast their spells one-handed, suffering only a slight penalty. It adds +2 to their casting times, making it easier to disrupt their spells. Like any other spellcaster, if they are hit they
lose the concentration necessary for maintaining their spells; they lose the spell. Their spells are, therefore, usually of an offensive nature with very short casting times.

--The training is hard enough that only a 3rd-level Bladesinger can begin to teach even the rudiments of the bladesong. If another elf wishes to learn the bladesong, he must seek one of the masters of the blade. Bladesingers charge a high price for sharing their skills. 

·  Special Hindrances. To offset their abilities, Bladesingers suffer some severe penalties.  Not only must they attempt to advance the cause of elvendom somehow at all times, they must also lend aid to any elf in need. Unless the elf is proven to be an enemy of the elven way of life, the Bladesinger must sacrifice life and limb to save that elf's life.  Of course, the Bladesinger is free to determine whether there is, in fact, an elf in danger.

Too many times other races have tried to eliminate the Bladesinger menace through illusion and trickery. The Bladesingers have grown wary and have, unfortunately, allowed fellow elves to perish while trying to determine the truth of the threat. Thus, most Bladesingers carry at least one detect magic spell in order to avoid possible errors.

  Bladesingers are so devoted to their chosen weapon that they can never learn another one. Unlike other elves, they do not gain a +1 to attack rolls with a bow. With all other weapons, they suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls, even if they have taken it as aproficiency. If they have not devoted the slot to learn the weapon, the Bladesinger suffers the ordinary nonproficiency in addition to the -1 penalty.
  
  If the player is using The Complete Fighter's Handbook, he may not allow his character to specialize in weapon groups. The Bladesinger focuses on a single weapon only.
  
  Bladesingers may wear no armor heavier than elven chain or studded leather. Bulkier armor restricts the Bladesingers' movement enough that they have at least a -2 penalty to attacks if they try to use their bladesinging ability while wearing such armor. The penalty is greater for heavier armor, although this is at the DM's discretion.

  Bladesingers rarely use weapons other than swords. With only rare exceptions, they never learn two-handed fighting styles. They may not use shields or two-handed weapons, for these interfere with the bladesong. Even when they have run out of spells, Bladesingers will fight one-handed or with both hands on their single-handed weapon. To
do otherwise negates all bladesinging bonuses.

·  Wealth Options. Bladesingers start their adventuring lives with 30 to 180 gp (3d6x10), and only one restriction: They must purchase their weapon of choice. Any monies left after buying their initial equipment must be returned to the Bladesinger's Guild. Later in their adventures, they must take opportunities to upgrade their weapons. Other than
these restrictions, they are free to do as they wish with their money.

·  Suggested Elf Subraces. Grey elf, high elf. ","1338509638"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;What I'm implying is that if you drew a Venn diagram of the situation, that there would be some overlap between the circles labeled ""atheist"" and ""determinist""

While that's technically true, it's a moot statement because atheism is simply defined as lack of belief in god; therefore, there's potential overlap with virtually every other philosophical notion in some way or another, the only exception being (obviously) theism, or anything that theism entails.

&gt;...and that the rather vague phrase ""a great many"" is suitably broad to encompass that resulting overlap.

Broad?  Do you know the meaning of ""[great](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/great?s=t)"" or ""[many](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/many?s=t)""?  They are unusually specific adjectives, and your interpretation of them is either willfully ignorant or flat out stupid.  Let's break it down with most relevant definitions of each:

* many: constituting or forming a large number
* great: unusually or comparatively large in size or dimensions

Those are both positive statements that each, on their own, imply a large portion of any given quantity.  Both of them together would logically amplify this assertion to an even further degree.  As I showed earlier, determinism doesn't *logically* jive well with atheism, so the assumption that ""a great many"" atheists follow this line of thought is not a reasonable one.  Therefore, such a claim requires evidence from the one making the claim, otherwise it's a useless conjecture.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You seem eager to put words in my mouth; You're straw-man'ing almost every point I've made...

&gt;So, your real point the whole time was that religion is evil?

No

&gt;I was a bit appalled to see you claiming a legitimate philosophical concept ""wasn't real"" just because you didn't believe in it.

No, it's not real for reasons I've already listed: because it's just a tool to free people from intellectual responsibility, and because it offers no differentiating element to simply being agnostic.

&gt;And I'm still offended that you would make such a brazen, egocentric leap in logic as to claim that this belief system you disagree with is nothing more than a trend that nobody really truly ""believes.""

No, I'm sure many people believe it. I'm saying they're stupid for believing it. 

&gt;the scope of that spectrum is religious belief, and your philosophy declares you as a nonparticipant in that entire realm of thought and discussion.

Interesting way of phrasing it. I would say that that ""realm of thought and discussion"" is troglodyte rather then ""I've declaring myself a non-participant"".

And just a little more about Coleman's bad experience at a couple jam sessions: it would be nice to let everyone play, and be inclusive and accepting and all that huggy shit, but the fact is there's only so much time, and we don't want to waste it. So if nobody knows who you are, and you don't talk to anyone before trying to take the stand, chances are you're gonna get turned down, D&amp;G frames or no.

"askseddit","t5_2s7xh","you're welcome. Glad you found it useful :).

&gt;&gt;Should I identify why they've been holding me back or why I'm not surrounded by ""awesome company""?

i meant identify why ""I've never considered myself truly 'worthy' of awesome company.""
as in why are you not worthy?? Or not truly worthy? What makes someone worthy or not?

&gt;&gt;I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""those things work against you"". 

basically ""I'm good looking and have always been highly complimented on my intelligence."" your belief is a filter. Its fine, its a good filter, and is helpful in many situation im sure, otherwise you wouldnt cling to it as much as you do, but - you are not fully present because of it. You do not see full spectrum of opportunities because you filter everything thru the notion of being good looking/smart, as opposed to (for example) a fat guy, who's not the smartest one in the group is always looking for that opportunity to prove that his fat, or percieved lack of smarts - does not limit him, and because of that he ends up with the super model, and everyone in the room is just shocked by how could he get that hottie.

Also you have work less hard for strangers' benevolence if you're good looking, if someone is massively disfigured - it makes more sense for them to do their best to figure out how their disfigurement is read by others and what it evokes in the strangers' they meet minds and feelings, and they work harder to transcend their appearance, you dont have this motivation so you always attract the 7s effortlessly, hence you have less motivation to work hard to get the 9s and 10s, whereas someone with a disfigurement is always working be it a 7 or a 9, or a 4 or some guy even.

In short - you're not fully present because of your looks and beliefs. 


&gt;&gt;I actually met an old friend over a couple of days for a festival-event a few weeks ago. He was never really a ladiesman back when I knew him well, but he was awesome with the ladies at the festival. I asked him what had happened, and said it was all due to the fact that he had started hitting the gym a few months prior. It wasn't so much the fact that his looks were improved, as much as it was due to the increase in confidence it had given him. 


Its great that you have a good live example of this idea!! If this guy thinks like you, and is challenged by the same problems, you can build a friendship on this common challenge and work thru it together - it really does help.


I had a similar experience when one of my best friends told me he was depressed and said he wanted to start taking depression meds, i told him to just go back to doing his favorite sport 3 times a week and if he still felt that way - he should get the meds. Of course in less than 3 weeks he was able to turn everything around. Much of his depression had to do with getting girls too, he is engaged to be married in a month.","1338509663"

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","The observer thing is the best representation of what consciousness might be, philosophically, that I have ever heard of. Only, it doesn't control. At all. It just observes. The brain is stimulated by external stimuli, as well as existing pathways, and self-modifies, etc. But it does all this deterministically. There is no outside voice telling us to do it, because our brains are nothing more than very complex, self modifying computers. All consciousness can be said to be is an observer, that watches.

Obviously not all machines should be treated as equal. However, at some point a machine will be complex enough to simulate an entire human brain perfectly, at which point it is absurd to say they are not conscious, as any machine that can simulate another must be (compuationally) more powerful than that simulated machine.


The beauty of the Geth is that they open us up to the idea that an individual, organic consciousness, which we are of course very familiar with, is not necessarily the only kind of valid consciousness. Pulling us out of our human-centric worldview, and showing us the possibility of something different. Not worse or better, necessarily, just different.
This is why many of us are upset that the Geth's characterisation in ME2 was thrown out in 3 in favour of human-centric consciousness being the ultimate goal.","1338509671"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","Here's a few more data warehousing-related use cases for those that prefer to avoid ETL frameworks in lieu of ETL libraries &amp; toolboxes:

   * file movement - ideally, data flows through an ETL process as a sequence of files (usually easier recovery, eliminates database complexity from ETL, is a commodity interface, etc).   Rsync isn't the best - ideally you've got a file movement tool that support pre &amp; post actions for both source &amp; destination.   This allows you to prevent a downstream autonomous process from picking up a file in the middle of being transferred, etc.

It is the one part of the VIS design I am not a huge fan of, though.  But I also just generally hate roll pins.  I have all the right starter punches, roll pin starter punches, regular punches, appropriate BFHs, but roll pins are still just awful.

However, it wasn't my first time doing it.  Through a series of actions founded upon stupidity and impatience I thrashed a different VIS receiver and, once it was beyond any possible repair, stripped it and messed around with it a bit without fear of ruining anything (any more than I already had).

"OCD","t5_2qvqm","First of all, I'm so sorry your parents had the audacity to claim you were ""faking it"". That just awful. :(

Secondly, I want to offer you all the reassurance I can. Where you have gotten to in your life is no small feat. I mean, the fact that you are capable of holding down a job, and are able to get out of bed and the house, that's marvellous! It's something you deserve to be proud of yourself for. I argue that you are in fact getting better! It's just that, perhaps, your definition of what ""better"" is may need some tweaking. :)

I have had OCD for my whole life, too (I'm 28 now, and my tendencies were recognized at age 7 and finally diagnosed at 13). I've also gone through the mutations - the forms of OCD I have now are quite different than what I experienced when I was younger, and I've gone through a litany of different obsessions and compulsions.

For me, though, the point is that I will *always* have OCD. I'm okay with this! What I am concerned with is my *quality of life*. There are times when the OCD has made my quality of life miserable and damn near unbearable. It consumed my every waking moment. Now, however, I have a remarkably decent quality of life. I'm happy a lot. I'm able to go to college. And yes, I still have OCD - some of my tendencies are even, occasionally, noticeable... It just doesn't consume me. My obsessions and compulsions are just... part of what makes me, me.

The thing for me is that my OCD is now something I can live along side - it doesn't control me as absolutely as it once did. When I tell people I have OCD, some respond with, ""You do!? I had no idea!"" or ""Yeah, I thought so."" It says more about *them* then it does about *me* - IE, if they have been observing my behaviours in such a way as to make my OCD noticeable to someone familiar with what it can look like. 

A work place is full of a high level of scrutiny, and someone noticing that you displayed what looked like, to them, as possibly OCD, isn't the end of the world. You are *still* better! Learning to cope with OCD, learning to understand and come to terms with your behaviours and manage to live a rich and fulfilling life, *that* to me is ""overcoming"" it. 

I hope you can be proud of yourself for how far you've gotten, and that concern over whether or not people notice you have OCD, or the quality of this OCD, doesn't turn into a problem for you. It sounds to me like you've come a long way - don't lose sight of that. :)","1338509687"

 Most people think that because the college is expensive it must be better than others and that simply isnt the case.

Almost all degrees have 40 elective hours so you can screw around and test the waters for what you enjoy for over a year and still be alright.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","I am 42 years old, married/kids/etc.  When our lives hit some speedbumps several years ago, my PMO escalated.  I never got to the ""extreme"" stuff, but I could spend a few hours a day on a porn binge.  I had no idea it was messing up my brain chemistry so bad.  I didn't know what was causing my ED.  Was it stress?  Was I not in love any more?  Did I forget how?  Was I too angry at my wife?  at life?

Whenever I'd start searching for solutions/help/answers, 99% of what we hear is ""masturbating is okay!""  ""porn is okay!""  I even when to a urologist for ED issues, and got some Cialis to help my ED.  When the Cialis didn't help AT ALL, I knew something else was going on, but I couldn't put words to it.  Eventually I found YBOP, and eventually NoFap.  After several mis-starts this year, I'm PMO-free since March.  (yay 2-month-badge!).  I could finally put to words what I've been experiencing.  More importantly, I could hear tesitmonials from men who have beaten this and have their manhood back.

Here's what I'd advise:

* The goal is sex with your girl and giving up porn &amp; fapping, and especially fapping to porn.  So, be sexy with him all you want.  (especially in the morning, good god please in the morning!)

* His scumbag-brain will CRAVE the old rewards.  It will do ANYTHING to trick him into his old rewards.  He will likely have a hard time resetting, getting into old habits, etc.  Habits are hard to break, neurochemically-reinforced habits are even harder.  It's like a smoker carrying around a pack of cigarettes in his pants all day.  

* THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU OR IS ATTRACTED TO YOU.  I know, girl-brains can't get their head around this, but us PMO guys understand this.  I don't ask you to understand it, just accept it.

* There's no tricks to it.  He just needs to decide to stop.

If you two are talking about it, and he wants to stop, and he has your support, you're going to be fine.

As someone else said above, there are literally NO downsides to NoFap.  NONE.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","First off, you need to know that only about 25% of women can orgasm from penetrative sex alone. 75% of us need clitoral stimulation to get off. So in no way are you not normal or is there anything wrong with you. Stop faking it though!! That only prevents the guy from trying new techniques with you and it actually prevents you from actually being able to reach orgasm. You're way too busy stressing out over whether or not you'll cum and when to call it quits and just fake it to actually let yourself just relax and get lost in the pleasure of it all (which is what's needed to bring you to orgasm). You also need to know it takes an average of 20-30 minutes for women to orgasm with a partner.

In no way is you joining in to get yourself to orgasm a bad thing! Just see it as you and your partner working together to get you there. The vast majority of the time where I'm having partnered sexual play, that's what I need to do in order to cum. Your orgasm is not your partner's responsibility alone.

See if your school offers any free counseling, focus more on making friends with people. Pick a day and set it as a goal to not go on any dates until then to hold off on the temptation.

Shoving money into mattresses, as you say, is meant that people are saving their money and not doing anything with it- in a bank, the bank would use the money for loans which would (hopefully) not only increase wealth but also allow business to expand and increase *productivity*. When he talks about money being plowed into a limited number of wallets vs. being plowed into business, he's making a point about the ways maximizing profits can reduce productivity. A very simple, unrealistic, example would be this: if a company cut all employee wages by 10%, its profits would increase without increasing productivity (ceteris paribus).  
In defense of your point, downsizing could be due to a decrease in demand where productivity in the country would increase by moving employees to areas where they're more productive. Shifting jobs to low-income areas could help to bring more prosperity to that area. In the end, I think all the things he listed could be helpful or harmful to the economy as a whole, depending on the situation.","1338509722"

I understand now that you have a personal influence in your opinion on the matter; supporting abortions of convenience to you would practically be like supporting your own murder. 

However, I don't think it's fair to condemn those who choose abortion, even for the relatively benign reason of it putting a massive strain on their life. It's merely the extinguishing of potential, and given that it's such a stigmatized choice I'd be very surprised to hear that it's commonly being made lightly.

Note that even you refer to your unplanned pregnancy as a mistake. I can respect the position of owning up to one's mistakes, but when there's a solution to that mistake that does not result in suffering for others or results in less suffering (and I do conceptually separate death and suffering) I think it is wrong to repudiate people who choose it, even if it is the easier way out.","1338509733"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In the old testament writings of Moses it says to love God and to love your neighbors. Later Jesus claimed that these are the two most important laws. If you follow those laws, you won't be raping anybody.

If you really believe people were so heartless that they saw women as nothing more than property, you could even bring up the commandments of not stealing and not coveting your neighbor's wife or property. You weren't really a part of the society. You don't really know what it was like. Because of your bias, you believe that all fathers think of their daughters as nothing more than pieces of property and have no love for them or any other women for that matter. Your dog/cat/pet is your property, but do you really treat it as if it's nothing but a piece of property?

Today people seem to have this conception of arranged marriages being like, ""You're going to marry this person. We made arrangements. Deal with it."" I'm not saying that can't and never happens, but when you encounter people that still practice this, they'll tell you it ain't like that. They work things out with their family. If the man or woman involved has no interest in marrying the person, then they are not forced to. Because of the marriage mixing the two families together, the families are involved in the marriage decision.","1338509761"

The Merlin is an awesome ship, even more awesome since the very recent changes. The trick is to not engage with T2 blingpimped deathmobiles until you can afford some of your own, or at least until you have a lot more training under your space-belt.

It only takes a few days to train T2 small guns and another few days to get most of the useful support skills to 3 or 4. Merlin is shield tanked so you'll want to train shield skills, primarily whatever the skill name is that increases total shield capacity. 

[This looks like a decent fit for the new Merlin](http://eve.battleclinic.com/loadout/60959-Inferno-Merlin-Mini-Fleet-Blarpy.html), but I'm not an expert on the recent changes, but at least you'll be on the right track.","1338509762"

First Amendment to the US Constitution? Just spitballin' here. Maybe you're not from the US and don't have freedom of religion where you are, but here we do.

This girl was .8 miles from a Wal-Mart - literally 3 minutes away - where she could have purchased Plan B over the counter without a prescription, so I really fail to see what the problem was here. She was directed to another hospital 16 miles away that had staff qualified to do a rape kit, less than a 20-minute drive. She received the rape-kit and presumably was given Plan B.

So I fail to see how she was, as this post is entitled, *""denied emergency contraceptives.""* She received the contraceptives, from qualified SANE physicians who treated her at a nearby hospital where she claimed she'd been raped. *She wasn't fucking denied anything.* She just couldn't get it WHERE she wanted to get it at the exact moment she wanted to get it; but that's not controversial. Not every hospital has SANE staff on duty 24x7; and they shouldn't have to. Our health care costs are already to high to staff SANE centers 24x7 on the off chance some girl gets a little too drunk and get's you know, ""raped.""

There is simply NO controversy whatsoever here. It's all bullshit hysterics by a bunch of pro-abortion websites linked 4-deep in this post.","1338509766"

* This idea's been mentioned here several times, but I really like it: Manager's challenges tied to limited instant replay. Not for balls and strikes, but the opportunity to overturn a wrong call on the base paths or in the outfield would add an interesting twist to the games, I think.
* I don't think a salary cap'll matter much, honestly. The length of the season contributes greatly enough to parity within divisions that I'm not sure a salary cap would make any difference as far as relative wins and losses go.

"zelda","t5_2r61g","I posted this here before and most people seemed to agree with me. Backed up by the Hyrule Historia I think I have the timeline right.

Let me try to explain it as easily as I can! First of all Link and Zelda are not always the same person. Link is often a different person each time and Zelda is simply the name given to all the women of the Royal Family in honor of the original Zelda (From Skyward Sword). The only person who's the same in every appearance is Ganondorf, the series main antagonist.
Another thing to understand is that there's three separate timelines (which I get in to in a minute) but you have to think of it as playing by ""Back to the future"" rules, in other words, if you travel back in time and change something then you create an alternate timeline which you are now living in and the timeline you left simply continues on without you, it isn't edited.


With that out of the way here's how the games go in order.

1: Skyward Sword.

2: Minish Cap.

3: Four Swords.

4: Ocarina Of Time.

After Ocarina due to meddling in time three different canon timelines occur side by side so here's how it works.

Timeline A: A what if Link lost to Ganondorf in OOT.

5A : A link to the past.

6A: Oracle of Time/ Ages.

7a:Links Awakening.

8A: The Legend of Zelda

9a: The Legend of Zelda 2.


Timeline B and C occur from Link defeating Ganon in oot. Either way when Link defeats Ganon in oot the sages intervene and seal him inside the twilight realm. At the end of OOT Zelda uses the Ocarina to send Link back seven years to live his life at normal.


Timeline B: Link arrives in the past, uses his future knowledge to warn Zelda about Ganon and just like in the future, Ganon is executed by the sages and trapped in Twilight.


5B: Majoras Mask.

6B: Twilight Princess (Ganondorf escapes twilight but link is around to stop him.)

7b: Four Swords Adventures.


Timeline C: This is after oot, Ganon was still executed and sent to twilight but link is no longer around since he's in his alternate time now. (Timeline B). The events of Twilight Princess occur still here but Link isn't here this time and Ganondorf takes over, to stop him the sages use a last resort, Flooding Hyrule.


5C: The Wind Waker.

6C: Phantom Hourglass.

7C: Spirit Tracks.","1338509769"

I started it off by roaming around the world doing meaningless things. Go out, roam the imperial city, maybe go outside and kill a few monsters, then go home and sleep. I did this for two hours my time.
I then made my way to the quest location pretending I didn't know where I was going. I made it seem to my character that he was just off going on a little excursion. I spent about an hour my time going around, setting up a fake camp site, and then just chilling over night for a few ingame days. 
After a while, I finally came across the location and approached it with caution. I wasn't what I once was; the hero who closed the oblivion gates. It had been time and I was wary of approaching this foreign place. Then I entered and never looked back. Spent the whole weekend just going through the entire quest.

That is all I meant to clarify. The easiest way to ensure you get a healthy mix of classes is to ensure that a few don't stand out as being absolutely better than others. If you limit a certain number of roles (say you want all queues to give you 2 tanks, 2 healers, and 4 dps) then you are going to artificially inflate queue times if you have no tanks on at a certain time.

So I like the idea in theory, but in practice you would only be able to use those roles in a pvp scenario for ease of the teammates to know what each person is doing.","1338509782"

Her: ""Hey, this smells weird.""

Me: ""OH, what? What does it smell like?""

Her: ""I don't know, it just smells off to me.""

Me: ""Oh, let me smell it!""

I take a big whiff.

Me: ""I don't smell anything.""

Her: ""Are you sure? Smell it again.""

I take another whiff and as I'm smelling it again, she shoves the cone into my nose and gets ice cream inside my nostrils. I wasn't even mad, I was just in shock. I vowed to remember that just in case she would ever try to pull that prank on me again.

About a month ago, we are back in Old Port. Same kind of deal, we were out walking around and she wanted some ice cream. We bought some and she did the whole routine and I fell for it again. I couldn't help but admire her dedication.

Sounds like you know your way around building stuff, so just scrounge up some good parts. A prebuilt NAS may feel more solid though. It all depends on the parts you buy. Newegg has good reviews for that.

As for software, I personally went for the full server and installed an ubuntu LTS distro. If you want something simpler, FreeNAS or alternatives may suit you. I haven't tried them myself. The only downtime I've had on my ubuntu server have been me breaking it trying to make it do more things than NAS stuff, or upgrading it.

Edit: Whatever your choice, think for a while before you jump right into raid. Make sure your system supports RAID expansion if you plan on getting new drives, and think about how it may restrict your buying choices in the future (for example, if you start with a 2tb, you're going to need to get only 2tb drives in the future unless you go with a system like unraid or drobo).","1338509807"

I believe your best chance for making this a milestone in human history is to have the project funded by the scientific minded people of earth. Advertise &amp; market it as a completely not for profit exploration to advance our civilization.

Get heavyweights like Neil Degrasse Tyson involved. Set up an online account. I would personally pay a few bucks a week for the next decade to fund this. &amp; ALL scientific advancement to be honest. If several million people get involved it could equal billions of dollars a year.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt;The only problem I face right now is that I'm really afraid that it might just be a passing fancy. I've experienced things like this before (like when I tried to teach myself to skateboard, and my board is now collecting dust in my mother's shed). I understand this is a flaw of mine, and I'm working hard to better myself. I'm worried that I would throw myself into conversion and learning/experiencing as much as I can, and then lose my ""oomph"".

I'm like this too. I'm a serial hobbyist. I will obsess over a video game for 2 weeks then never play it again. I do this with chess about once a year. I have learned about 2 months worth of several different languages. Gardening, photography, raising chickens, worms, bats, you name it. I get myself into all sorts of things all the time. 

I also do this with Islam. I will read Quran a lot for a while, trying to memorize and recite. I review my studies and try to delve deeper into the religion. I really love it, those months when I do this are the best of my life when I do them. Then I fall off for a while and return later. Even when I ""fall off"" though, I still pray every day and keep a general involvement with the religion, but I'm not as obsessive about it as I get when it comes time for me to really ""do Islam"" for a while. 

Islam is a lifelong spiritual journey of self improvement and coming close to God - it is a truly beautiful thing that deserves a place in your heart and your rotation of hobbies. You can generally identify as a Musilm, perform the rites of worship, and stay mindful of God, and find some time to obsess about it every now and then like your other hobbies :)

Can you think of any other examples of countries where are presence is actually useful? I can't see how over 900 military bases are necessary. Natural disasters don't happen in most of the countries we have troops in. Anyway, Japan and Germany don't have troops over here protecting us, so why is it our duty to protect them around the clock? I'm sure there are plenty of examples of countries that don't pick up much of the cost of our presence if our military expenditures are 41% of those spent by all countries around the world. 

I'm sure plenty of them vote, remember the percentage of US citizens currently serving in the military is 1%.

We now live in a world with targeted remote drone strikes, extrajudicial executions of US and non US citizens, 24/7 propaganda channels, and to top it all off, the most amazingly terrifying spying apparatus ever constructed. The amount of data governments collect on their citizens each day through facebook, twitter, skype, text messages, and plain old warrantless wiretaps would have been the Gestapo's and Stasi's wetdream.

As desperately as I'd like to find hope in this quote, I can't. The balance of power has been shifted too far. It's Game Over and there's no coming back, no matter what the people do. Absolutist states have won.

In all likelihood, Assange will be extradited to Sweden then extradited to the US where he will be brought up on a shame trial for the crime of telling the truth and then locked away in a dark hole forever. (I doubt they'd execute him, but you never know) If Sweden refuses to extradite him, the US will kidnap and blackbag him just like we've been doing to other people for years.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The architecture of the financial system had changed.   Loans have to have buyers for them to be sold.    Normally, crappy loans could not be sold in the secondary market, let alone tranched in AAA bonds.   But when the architecture of the financial system changed, investors could slap a CDS on the loan and tranche it into a AAA bond.  

The focus should be on the change in the laws that governed banking that caused the demand for mortgages in the secondary market to go through the roof.  

For example, There were hundreds of thousands of ""no doc"" loans that were created and sold.   No doc loans are just that - no documentation required.   These are not mentioned in the article because underwriting is completely off the hook and it makes it clear what the problem really was.   In fact, the worse a loan was, the higher the interest rate, and the more the bond could be sold for.     

 The cause of the mortgage meltdown was not issues with documentation in underwriting.    Banks are responsible for mistakes in underwriting and servicers and investors can send the loan back to the underwriter.    

Lawyers take people like her, that document mistakes, make a lot of money, and make the public think that the problem was the brokers and underwriting.  Not so.   Before the architecture of the financial system changed, many of these loans could not even be sold to the secondary market, let alone tranched into a AAA bond.

The change in the architecture of the financial system is where the focus should be, and the system is still the same as it was, except that currently, CDS are out of favor as insurance for loans.  But that will change and we will repeat the cycle all over again.

This judgement diverts attention to the real cause of the problem and that is why this is not a good thing.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of my girlfriends I and decided to take some shrooms and see how the evening unfolded. This rapidly progressed into eating ecstasy, taking GHB, and I additionally dosed myself with some acid.

All in all, it was shaping up to be a good night.

We lay cuddling, and she gets increasingly gacked out of her head, and cuddles turn to making out, and groping, and eventually it's looking like it's going to be sex. She yanks me down the bed by my ankles and puts on a glove and starts banging my ass, which puts me in a *bit* of a panic, since I haven't really done anything to clean out, and I'm used to doing proper maintenance beforehand. She ignores this, yells at me a few times, and tells me to wait right there and DON'T MOVE. She goes to the bathroom to pee.

I decide to take her literally. ""I'll show her,"" I think, and since I know she has a bit of a necrophilia fetish, I make a decision to not move AT ALL.

She comes back, tells me I'm good, and starts talking to me. I don't respond. She starts groping me. I lay there lifeless and limp. I don't even blink for the LONGEST time, trying to only do so when she's not looking, to the point where tears stream out of my eyes from never closing them for minutes at end. This turns her on IMMENSELY. She proceeds to get increasingly fucked up, mumble insane crazy things to me, and fist me for about an hour. After an hour, hour and a half of this, she tries to fix the music that's stopped playing (she's unfamiliar with Google Music, so this takes her a while), and on her way back she trips, faceplants onto my tit, and blurts ""Ah, fuck!""

I completely lost it. I felt my lips start to tremble and tried my best to hold a grin back, but I failed. Eventually I started laughing so hard I was crying (since, remember, I'm fucked up, too), and in that moment the hot corpse-sex was lost.

I once told my friend that if he quotes Star Wars whilst in the process of fucking his girlfriend, that I would give him $20.

She thought it was odd, but she decided to keep on going. During the middle of fucking, he said ""the force is strong with this one!"" At that point, she was really confused, stopped fucking, and asked him why he quotes Star Wars twice. He then told her about the money I would give him.

I was an AP student and an art kid, but didn't really fit with either. The AP students were cool but too normal. The art students were cool too but too clique-y. I never had that cliche group of friends and was a loner, but got along with most everyone. I was known as the kid who balances all her books on her head between classes and the girl who did etch a sketch art. I only keep in touch with about 3 people from high school. 

TL;DR: a weird quasi art/AP student

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I've brought up the John Lennon comparison on here before with Chris Brown. I actually like Chris Brown's music so you can think whatever you want of me. Chris Brown was totally wrong, man or woman you don't attack your spouse, simple as that, no excuses. That said there has been talk she started it and whatnot, does that make it okay? Absolutely not, but there it is.

They've since recorded together and seem to be passed it. If she has forgiven him people on sites like this need to let it go. Rihanna isn't going to sleep with you because you whiteknight her on the internet. John Lennon, paragon of virtue and peace did the exact same shit, worse if you factor in the way he treated his son and stuff. He had a longer history of it but sites like this pick and choose, at random it seems to me often, the causes to pile onto (which, in Chris Brown's case was like two years late?) and it just gets further dead horse'd. 

Chris Brown is doing what he's been ordered to do. I like his music, I don't care for musicians or actors personal lives. I care about them providing me with entertainment. I don't expect shit from them as humans so it doesn't bother me. I'm glad you made that point because I see people on here defending a man who was imprisoned for 17 years for killing a 9 month old boy with a tomahawk saying he's done his time and should be let it (he was denied parole so is still in) but hey, Chris Brown, Mike Vick, let's never let them off the hook.

"BMW","t5_2qn3a","&gt;The 6 is a coupe, but there is now a 6-sedan. So there is a 6 coupe and sedan.

There is no 6 series sedan, the gran coupe while it does have four doors is still considered a coupe by BMW hence it will retain its even numbered designation (don't get me started on manufacturers calling their four doors coupes, it drives me up the wall but were talking BMW logic here)
&gt;The 5 is a sedan, and there will most likely be a 5 coupe added.

The 6 series is the coupe version of the five series.  They share the same chassis and power trains.  The only variant of the F10 5 series is the F07 GT (that X6 mini-me monstrosity that BMW calls a ~~wagon~~ Grand Tourer)

Just wanted to clear that up for you, BMW never stops confusing me with their logic, it is mostly marketing, although even internally they are changing their designations, An E36 was an E36 regardless of if it it was a sedan or a coupe, but a current E9x 3 series is either a E90, 91, 92 or 93 depending on weather it is a sedan, wagon, coupe or convertible.  Then you have the F10/F07/F04 all externally known as a 5 Series, internally the different designations denote weather it is a normal 5 sedan, GT or Active Hybrid Sedan.

If you have a gun that is capable of 2 MOA at one hundred yards, and you have the best shooter using it, all of the bullets will strike the target within a circle with a diameter of a 2 minute arc. In this case, about two inches. Which is good.","1338509878"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I bought the greatest hits version recently and I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it.  I stopped at ch. 6 after putting 9 hours into the game.  My main gripe with the game was the battle system.  I wouldn't mind the linearity of the level design so much as long as the game had a battle system I could thoroughly enjoy and experiment with early on, which it didn't.  Its emphasis on auto-battle, paradigm shifting, and staggering provided me with little challenge.  During my 9 hours with the game, I was never in a battle that pressured me into doing anything outside of those three aforementioned game mechanics and battles became repetitious rather quickly.  I also didn't bother with mixing up different paradigms since the set roles given to me by default worked well enough that I never felt compelled to manually experiment with mixing different roles on my own.  Also, I absolutely hate how the camera pans around erratically.  I've read somewhere before that they were trying to go for an advent children inspired, cinematic feel for the battle system, but it really made things feel way too chaotic.

The only reason why I bought XIII was in anticipation for XIII-2.  I've read that XIII-2 was a step in the right direction and I wanted to beat XIII to get an understanding of the story and it's characters before I picked that up.  But after playing XIII, I've been left with such a bad impression that I'm now unwilling to play either.

**tl;dr  FFXIII is so poopy that it turned me off from wanting to play XIII-2**","1338509886"

It's not. If gaming is your primary goal, this is a good build for a somewhat low budget, and it's correctly prioritized.

&gt;Why shouldn't I just get an H61 motherboard?

You should. Spending more on the mobo than the CPU is really dumb.

If your budget is strict, then you really should get the i3 and 7850. If it's not, you should spend a little bit more and get a better CPU.


It also depends on what games you want to play. If you only want to play Diablo 3 and LoL, then you should probably get a better CPU and cheaper GPU. But if you want to play BF3 and whatever other newfangled games kids are playing these days, then the 7850 is the right choice.","1338509888"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;this response is presumptuous, judgmental, and overly critical.

People come to AskReddit for advice and opinions, you won't always like the answers you get, and if I'm talking out of my ass you are free to just ignore me. Mine might seem negative, but I'm just trying to be realistic and trying to give you some advice learned through personal experiences.

&gt;If the person is truly like-minded, then I'm not holding anyone back from anything. 

True, but you won't find someone identical to yourself, none of us do. You keep talking about sharing ""YOUR"" lifestyle, not you enjoying their lifestyle. You want to find someone the same so that you don't have to do anything other than what you do, or anything outside of your comfort zone. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I've been exactly where you are, it's just unrealistic.

Your going to need to be open to enjoying them for them, not for them because they are the same as you. That's too easy, and it just won't work out that way. I say selfish because you only want someone like yourself so that you don't have to do anything different, but that's not going to happen. Your going to meet a girl and fall in love with her, and she may be a gamer, but she's also going to want to go out to eat, hang out with her friends, and have you explore her hobbies and interests that are completely different than your own. You will eventually need to be open to the idea of sharing *their* lifestyle too. Not just ""I want to find a girl who will fit into the hole I have in my life, but be exactly like me so I don't have to change anything"".

You'll find someone, I just want to make sure you are open minded about it so you don't miss that special girl who you fall in love with. If you're looking for something so narrow, you won't find love. You need a bit more of a scatter shot, and you need to date and go out with multiple girls to find one that you just can't live with out.

Good luck in your search, and again, OKC is okay. I met a gamer girl there, and we've been together for almost 2 year together and just bought a house. All I can say for practical advice, is message ALL of the girls you are interested in, don't get hung up on one before meeting, and go out on a real date with them after only exchanging a few emails. Real life chemistry is everything, and you only get that in person talking to each other. It might take a handful of first dates. The summer I found my girlfriend, it took about 16 different first dates with different girls before I found her. Again, this is why I stress being open minded, because the girl you might fall for, might be the one you only *considered* messaging or had second thoughts about.

Fortune favors the brave. Start dating! :)","1338509895"

More fishermen need to be aware of what they are doing to a fish when handling them.  As far as the slime coat on a fish one of the biggest factors of handling them has to deal with water/air temperature.  A fish being handled and exhausted in a warmer area will be more prone to parasites and bacteria.  In colder water it is not as big a deal but there are some mediums where what you think is a good temperature to avoid disease and such but they are really optimal conditions for a lot of nastys.  The number one thing I tell anyone when it comes to handling fish barehanded or gloved or in any situation is avoid touching the gill covers and do not stick your fingers inside for a better grasp.  The gills and gill cover are the most sensitive and prone to bacteria, parasites, etc.  ","1338509902"

He didn't give you a 30 day notice eviction... he probably gave you a 30 day notice to 'quit'... that means ""leave or 30 days or I'll evict you""  So, after the 30 days, if you are still there, the landlord can go to court and say to the judge ""I told him to leave 30 days ago and he didn't... help me""  

Then you have a few days to wait to go to court.  You will lose.  The judge will say get out... if you don't the landlord will go back to court and say you didn't leave... the court will say GTFO again.  If you still don't leave, the landlord goes back and can schedule a date with the Sheriff to remove you.

Mind you all the court things will be at your peril and expense if you lose (which you will if you landlord isn't a dummy)

Just know that you are not on the street in 30 days... make a good effort to get out of there and all... but lord help the landlord who kicks you out without going thru the hoops.

Best of luck

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Try Path of Exile.  Its 100% barter based with no gold at all.  It's genius.  There will be no auction house at all because the devs want the players to actually barter items.  I quit d3 and am loving this game right now.  Also, when it's finally released it will be free2play.  Cool thing about it is that it's not just one game world.  You can actually be parts of ""leagues"" in the game, which are basically instanced versions of the whole world (think useast vs uswest) except they are private.  So even if the main game gets overrun by gold farmers or whatever, you can join a private ""league"" and be able to play in an untarnished version of the game.  It's basically D2 with the FF7 materia system and FFX sphere grid.  Its fucking awesome.","1338509910"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","No, I never chose to be attracted to anyone.  I did mention this in my first post: ""we do not choose to whom we will be physically attracted or indifferent or disgusted by.""  I also did not choose whether or not to like brussel sprouts or the color blue.  In my evaluation, these kinds of desires are given, or 'natural', and are differentiated from volitional acts.  

In Christian moral theology (contextual note: I was educated in moral theology in an ecumenical and interfaith RC environment), moral value can only be ascribed to volitional acts.  This means that those who assume that queerness is a choice will give that choice a moral value (usually a negative one, in my experience).  Those who assume that queerness is a given, or a natural state, cannot ascribe moral value to queerness without being theologically inconsistent (or subscribing to a moral theology that I know nothing about).  In my reply I was merely trying to answer your question by explaining how different Christians can draw different moral conclusions about queerness, based on their primary assumptions.  I was not trying to make a moral judgement, although after re-reading my post, I see that I did, sort of.  I stated that it was a mistake to ascribe volition to physical attraction and gender roles.  It follows that I do not think queerness has a moral value.  This does NOT mean that I think queerness is morally wrong; it means I think queerness is not a moral issue.

Love *is* a moral issue, however.  Everyone, queer or straight, chooses whether to love another person, or not.  Love is not lust or attraction.  It is a different beast altogether.  

 To offer a more personal context, I am also queer.  I have no difficulties with this.  None of the students and teachers that I studied with at seminary had a problem with it, either.  If they did, they kept their mouths shut about it, probably because they wouldn't be able to support their arguments adequately.  We had several rock-star moral theologians on staff who wouldn't put up with sloppy moralizing.  Most of the community were very vocal about the normalcy of queerness and were active in promoting gay rights.  (You should have heard the tumult about Prop 8, especially when we found out about Bishop Cordileone's involvement!)  In short, there are many different ways to interpret Christian teachings, biblical and traditional.  I realize that my seminary experience could have been VERY different, but that's why I didn't go to Bob Jones U. or something similar.

Anyway, I apologize if my first post was not clear.  I hope I did better this time.

[And you do have a point about the pepperoni.  Regardless of whether or not I desire pepperoni, I can *choose* to order pepperoni or not.  What is the moral value of that?!  I would say there is none, but I do not currently have a theological source to back me up on that.  Aquinas probably had plenty to say about distinguishing orders of volition, but I don't remember any of it.  I can try to look it up for you, if you're interested.]

As a GM, it's not exactly a great idea to openly say ""we have interest in acquiring ________."" That only leads to your competition offering less on their part, because they know at the end of the day, you want that player. Playing hard to get is part of the mental game to attempt to get the best deal for the organization.

Tampa Bay is definitely not out of the question. They might be gunning for a cheaper option (e.g. Jonathan Bernier), but in the end, I highly doubt Tampa Bay is out of the picture for the Luongo trade.","1338509924"

"Civcraft","t5_2tm1t","Being on mumble isn't the same as being in prison in the real world. We tend to think that prisons have a reforming effect because those in prison have nothing to do, no choice but to think about what they've done and reflect on past poor actions.

Griefers have no such obligation. Being on mumble actually strengthens my point: they are still able to participate in a component of the game.

I'm sure they have thought about it, and maybe they are reformed. Hopefully we develop a way to fix this situation. But remorse alone doesn't make a man innocent and absolved of all former actions. The cost of a new account is relatively low, so that's always an option for someone genuinely concerned about starting anew. But the ideas of reform only work when paroles are implemented, when constant monitoring can occur, two things we don't have the ability to perform in CivCraft.","1338509928"

In other words, the statistics are trash in trying to draw a conclusion about which player is more clutch.

Practice swing you swing through it nicely, weight gets forward, hands/club pull you up into a nice finish. Actual swing, looks like you're much tenser and hitting AT the ball instead of through it, your weight doesn't get through and you end up leaning away from the ball (bit of reverse pivot)

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I think part of the problem is that that sort of behaviour is actually rational from a cost/benefit point of view. Most women targeted are people that the man in question doesn't know and, if they ever meet again, probably won't recognise him. That means that there is virtually no cost to being rejected, in exchange for a very small chance of some benefit. (That ignores those who do it just to be annoying (who win even when they ""fail""), but they won't stop until they find something more irritating.)

Unfortunately, I can't really see a way to solve that. Legislation isn't the answer, because the irritation caused by a single event doesn't justify the time and effort of going to the police, and you aren't likely to find any prosecution witnesses. Socially conditioning girls to be more openly sexually aggressive won't help here like it would in terms of flirtation and pick-up culture, and socially conditioning boys against it is unlikely to work without returning to the kind of sexual repression that the Victorian moralists idealised, especially since that sort of shitty behaviour actually works kinda well among school kids.","1338509939"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","In the code example, they are doing addition.

    A = 0
    B = 1
    C = 2
    ...
    X = 23
    Y = 24
    Z = 25

When they encrypt the first letter, it's F + E = J; (5 + 4 = 9).  If your addition goes over 25, then you loop it back around to 0 (also called modulo 26).  They do the same thing for each letter of their secret message.

The most secure encryption you can ever have is a one-time pad.  You basically generate a random array of bytes that's exactly as long as your message (this is called the pad).  Then you take the first byte of your message and XOR (similar to addition) it with the first byte of your pad.  You do this for each byte.  Then, to decrypt, you take the first byte of the encrypted-message and XOR it with the first byte of the pad.

The article is talking about doing the same thing, except instead of randomly generating a pad, you use a commonly-available book.  This decreases the security because patterns can be found, and once they determine a unique sentence or phrase from the book, they can figure out your entire message.","1338509952"

However, there's no technical reason why you can't start with mid-level characters.  It's not recommended for new players, since those characters tend to be overwhelming with options (e.g. which spells to memorize, or other variable stuff), and it's better to spread out the encountered monsters over a larger area.

"wikipedia","t5_2qh3b","To some extent I imagine it's because the Catholic Church gradually lost most of its temporal power.

The medieval church was often more about political power and wealth than religion.  If you're a second son who's not going to inherit his father's duchy, being a bishop was a pretty lucrative option.  The pope was basically the king of a big chunk of Italy, so governments and family dynasties struggled for control over the papacy.  As a result, an awful lot of medieval and early modern popes were basically temporal rulers who didn't take religious life very seriously.

Times have changed.  There are much better routes to power and wealth than the Church.  Recent popes (especially since 1870) generally became priests because they actually wanted to be priests.  Thus, while I'm sure there have been sexually active popes in recent times, in general you'd expect modern popes to care more about their religious vows than their medieval counterparts.","1338509960"

 It was set up that we split it into thirds. With utilities rent ect. ect. everyone paid anywhere from 400 (months where heat/conditioner weren't needed and electric was cheaper) to about 425 (winter/summer). My boyfriend and I paid anywhere from 800 to 850 a month. 

Question two. My unemployment.
It has been just about 3 months. I do however run things for my parents. They own a car dealership and they need cars to be taken through inspection/things done at the dmv/phones to be answered... So i had some income coming in to help but not a set 20 hours a week-full time job. And I have put in applications everywhere from dealerships to be a receptionist to dunkin donuts to my local mall. I had an interview at best buy two days ago and I go in for my second interview saturday. So it's not like I haven't been trying and the best buy job is looking promising. 

question 3. the friend.
We have been friends with each other for about 8 years. We were the type of friends that would see each other and then go 5 or 6 months without seeing each other because she was always too busy and plans were always canceled by her. So yeah she has been flaky before. She is a huge momma's girl and always runs to her when anything goes wrong. She hasn't been very good about fixing her own issues or being on her own ever. She spends money every night she is here to go out and get fast food or chinese or whatever she feels like so she isn't very careful with money (but i didn't know this beforehand). She has casually brought up how she really misses home a few times but she normally goes home for saturday or sunday nights so I figured it was nothing. And she hasn't ever really said anything money wise to me, although she has always been good about paying rent on time so thats why I jumped straight to moving out and not her being late on rent. 

Question 4. boxes.
I haven't but she has a shit ton of clothes and still has her bedroom at home. So basically she has like 10-15 outfits here and then the rest of her clothes are at home. She has a bed, movie case, and odds and ends here like tooth brush, hair dryer and all that here but it wouldn't be a whole lot to move at the last minute.

That cheap little bass kicked my PBasses ass all up and down that store. It was comfortable, sounded awesome, and had looks to boot.

They have a mutual friend who tries to get them to date, but both guy and girl seem content to be friends for now. Issues arise from the boy's mother who still has trust issues from when her husband left her to become a woman. 
Ai Ore is also more gender-bending. It's also very detailed and beautifully drawn. The plot is cute, also has more music mentioned, because the girl is a member of a wildly popular girl band, Blau Rosen. 
Lovely Complex has a lot of humor in it, a really tall girl and a very short guy. It's really cute, set in high school as well.

The only components remaining you can skimp on are the motherboard, PSU and hard drive. You don't want to skimp on the PSU, you'll need the drive space anyway sooner or later, so the motherboard is the only option.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't know how controversial this is but I think there is nothing wrong with the term ""friendzone"". It gets a lot of shit these days. ""It's a term created to villainize women for saying no"". Traditionally it means having feelings for someone who does not return them. It's very real. I understand some guys get entitled about it but the term itself is fine. I'll never forget a tweet I saw that said ""The friendzone doesn't exist because friendship isn't a machine you put coins in until sex falls out"". That person clearly never had it cross their mind that maybe it's more than just sex and that there's actual emotions involved. Now no one should be entitled for anything just for being nice, there are assholes that think that way. I just think the actual term is far less harmful and far more real than the internet make it out to be. I mean what the fuck else are you going to call a situation where you're friends with someone and you like them. You're not hung up on them, not obsessing, not demanding sex from them, just having honest feelings. Why don't we try to make the term mean what it was meant to be then just assuming all guys who use it are entitled losers. Are we seriously going to ban an entire term describing a common situation just because some ass hats on the internet can't get over someone. 

It also bugs me when people flip out over the word slut. I don't even like the word. I think it's used too much and no woman should be judged for her sexual activity. It's just something about the way the entire world stops when it's said on reddit these days. I think it's because they seem to only be angry at the word and not the fact that someone was being judged. ","1338509975"

Yes, ofcourse it's my personal opinion about what i think about his style and i shared it on this open forum. What's wrong with that? It just so happens that a lot of people agree with me.

Well i don't expect him to win tournaments when he plays but why he is being so secretive about something? What does he have to hide? That's what makes me suspicious, am i listening to somebody that is diamond league at best? How do i know his high level analysis IS exactly that? He IS selling himself as a high level analyst, that's how his whole day9tv business is based on. I don't know how you don't see that. Easiest solution, i stopped watching him. I then post on this forum explaining why. 

I don't why you are upset that people are not praying to him and are turned off by his behavior about guarding his play. Different people perceive differently and share their opinion. 

In Incontrol's case, yes, once he toned down being a passive-aggressive prick and continue to contribute to the community overall, people stopped attacking him. There are still few that hate him but overall it's a positive opinion.

Why should i give you more examples other than LastShadow's situation? One murder is enough for a saint to get convicted in IRL.

She is very open about her sexual past, and there are times I get jealous.  It's not really easy to hear that she did hardcore bondage and fetish videos and participated in orgys at sex clubs but in the end its all in the past.  I asked if she ever missed it and she said it was an exhilarating feeling of being able to make hundreds of dollars for an hour or two of shooting while having sex while at the same time dirty because of the views most people have on it.  She looks back and laughs at how she had her pussy shocked one time or was spanked 21 times the day before her 21st birthday.  It's something she chose to do and isn't embarrassed by it at all, so why should I let it bother me?  My girlfriend is an amazing person and there hasn't been a moment in the 9 months that we've been dating that I regret being with someone who did the crazy things she did.  She was totally willing to have a monogamous relationship with me and I have never doubted her faithfulness.  And being as experienced as she was she was willing to be patient to be my teacher and it was very easy for her to make me a better lover.

In terms of what to read *first*, that depends on what kind of book you like. If you enjoy science fiction, *This Alien Shore* has has been a fan favorite, especially among young readers.  *In Conquest Born* was my first novel, and some tell me it's my best work ever (I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing).  It's not as much a straight-up linear narrative as my other books, which is good if you like complex, dark, and challenging fiction, and not so good if you like...well, staight-up linear narratives.  For those who love dark fantasy, the Magister Trilogy is clearly the way to go.  And teen readers love the Madness Season.  

As for best work...wow, that's a tough question.  And I don't think there's just one answer to it.  If you want my best characters, I think Gerald Tarrant and the leads in In Conquest Born win that one hands down.  Best crafted conclusion, I would have to give to Legacy of Kings.

The schedule that Knoxxer posted is our beginning schedule. It is subject to change but it's our starting point.

We're using this as our starting point due to the population of players that can enjoy this event. The more the 58-60 player base grows, the more the schedule will grow. We want players to group together and finish a nexus, and having a Wednesday morning nexus won't result in enough players to get through an event.

We're always listening to feedback and I know these times don't work for everyone's schedule (Short of a 24 hour nexus period there is always someone that will be left out) but let's use this as a starting point and grow the times and days from here.

And then the man is ""saddled"" with child support payments for 18 years even though he wanted nothing to do with a child.

Sadly...If a woman chooses to raise the child alone...then the consequence of that is that she and the child will likely be poor.  

I think it's pretty dickish to father a child and then have nothing to do with it even if the child was unplanned.  I think it sucks.  I understand your pain...but if he made it clear to your mother that it was a one-night stand and he wanted no part of the pregnancy if she decided to carry it to term...then you really shouldn't expect a relationship or money from him now.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","First of all, I have no issue with foreign managers of national teams. As others have mentioned, smaller nations and those without strong footballing history would be fucked, for one.

But ok, let's say that FIFA mandates that the manager of a national side has to be eligible to represent that country in competition AND that this were somehow legal (IANAL but I'm almost positive there's no way it could be). How the hell do you police something like that?

When it comes to actual on-field players it's very easy to simply mandate that they're all eligible but what would be stopping (for example) the US from hiring Ashton Kutcher as a figurehead but having Klinsmann in some other nominal position where he still runs everything, either directly or through the named manager? Do you bar all foreigners from entering the training grounds and locker rooms or even simply talking to the true manager? It just wouldn't work.","1338509987"

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Well, in terms of fantasy authors making music, there's Cats Laughing, a band that featured Steven Brust, Emma Bull, and Adam Stemple, all fantasy writers. Some of their lyrics are very fantasy-oriented. Also, Michael Moorcock was heavily involved in the music scene - too much to put here, but check his bio for some really surprising tidbits.

My favorite band ever was Cocteau Twins. Their singer, Liz Fraser, has an otherworldly voice and often sang incomprehensible lyrics, which (for my money) made her sound as close to elven as you can get without pointy ears. (She also sang some things on the Lord of the Rings soundtrack later - making the connection official, so to speak). 

Also on the 4AD label, Dead Can Dance was a great band with another phenomenal female vocalist, Lisa Gerard, who sang incomprehensible lyrics. You may have heard her warbling vocals on the soundtrack of Gladiator. 

More recent, I always feel like Sigur Ros sound completely otherworldly.","1338509991"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I checked your summoner profile(I assumed it was the same as reddit), and I found that as I learned it was best to play most if not all of the free week champs, which I saw you have done. Eventually you'll find one you like enough to play as you learn the game. For me it was Vayne, who I found after about 5 weeks of playing. I learned most of the ins and outs of game with her and played her until around level 26. It also helps to know what type of character you play in other games. Malphite is a pretty easy(and tanky) champion with melee attacks and some AoE on his W and E. He also has range on his Q and his ultimate makes him charge to a location. Other melee champs with AoE and ranged abilites include Amumu, Gragas, and Olaf. There are others, but I'm guessing they are out of your price range. Also, if you want to look up a type of champion you can use the LoL client by going to your profile(little button of a person, its by the store) and clicking on champions, then checking categories you like.","1338509992"
"rawdenim","t5_2scl9","1 - before I got into raw denim I was a 32 in levi's and now I'm a 30 in APC (sold them), 30 in Rogue Territory, and a 31 in 3sixteen.  

2 - The best thing I've done to combat odor is using dryer sheets.  Put em in the pockets or inside the pants when they're not being worn.

3 - The longest I've gone without washing is 7mo. of daily wear.  I would've gone longer but they smelled like death.  

4 - Personally, I'm against tailoring, tapering, etc. on denim.  I wear them as is but then again I am taller than the average joe so I loves me some long inseams (36minimum) but that's just me.

**There are no rules for dry denim!!!**

*For reference I'm 6'0"" and 145lbs (skinny I know)

*I'd highly recommend spending the extra cash for some 3sixteens.  I have the ST-100x's and 2 pairs of SL-100x's, love them all!

*  tens-of-Billions-$$ weapons purchases, by the Saudi Government.


*  their significant ownership of Fox News.  (and other U.S. ""news"" media.)

Interesting talking about the brainfog - that sounds less like a hangover to me and more like the morning after smoking a lot of ghanj where you still feel high.  Your bit about the ""ability to learn new things"" is also analogous to heavy marijuana usage.

When I was in therapy for some past trauma, I was doing a method of therapy called EMDR where you basically reprocess memories by activating both hemispheres of your brain to cope with and eventually de-fang the old memories that give you a hard time.  I do not know the fine details, only that it worked amazingly.  What I did notice though, and my therapist verified, was that if I smoked pot at all I would often find myself having large setbacks or not integrating the things I had ""learned"" in my previous sessions.  As far as my sex drive goes, I was so depressed at the time that most days it was all I could do to go to class.  Eating was difficult.  masturbating?  Nearly impossible.

As a matter of fact, recently I've had my teams give up easily defendable towers for virtually no reason (obviously this article isn't to blame for that). I understand that yes it's better to lose a T1 instead of losing a T1 and your life, but at the same time, you need to be able to discern whether the situation allows you to save the tower or not because of how great of an impact the towers make on the game. All in all, I feel it might not be the fault of the article's author and may just be how damn situational dota actually is, from item and skill builds down to ward placement between any given game.","1338510012"

Honestly, I'm bored because there is not really much to do in this game for me. I have cleared act 1-3 and the first two quests in act 4 on inferno and i don't have that urge to kill Diablo, i know that farming the Resplendant chest in act 3 gives the same drops as act 4 packs and i know that the champ packs killed in early act 4 drops better then Diablo so what's the point other then being able to say ""Hey i killed him on inferno""... for what?

And because of the system with Legendarys and Set items i have no real urge to farm for either of those, the blues i have will just be better anyway. 

However i see that there is potential in this game, once they get the Legendarys worked around like they plan too and once PVP get into the game i see this being enjoyable again, possible another expansion with some more content and stuff.

But for now i feel that this is no where remotely close to what farming was in D2 and i have nothing special left to do in D3.

I'm not saying it was to easy, it sure as hell was a challenge but what now? Once you got over that challenge? ","1338510013"

Also one of the people in the game wasn't exactly the most friendly, wasn't particularly unfriendly, just had a negative attitude and whilst we had clearly said it was our first game, this person was acting as if we should know more and play better, asking out loud if he was playing with people who had 500 ELO.

If there are no provisions in the lease relating to the amount of increase that your rent may be increased by, then you can make an argument that 13% is unjustifiable because it drastically outpaces inflation, local economic growth, and is unsubstantiated by any changes in the local community.  It's a reasonableness argument if there are no provisions in the lease.

If the lease does speak to rent increases, then you're bound by what's written.  So long as you know how to interpret what's written in such a way that it is beneficial to your cause :)  For that, I'd suggest hiring a lawyer with some background in landlord/tenant law.

&gt;
&gt;We're using this as our starting point due to the population of players that can enjoy this event. The more the 58-60 player base grows, the more the schedule will grow. We want players to group together and finish a nexus, and having a Wednesday morning nexus won't result in enough players to get through an event.
&gt;
&gt;We're always listening to feedback and I know these times don't work for everyone's schedule (Short of a 24 hour nexus period there is always someone that will be left out) but let's use this as a starting point and grow the times and days from here.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So when you can't argue with logic you complain about things which everyone thinks are OK?  

How is 4G 'jumping the gun'?  Do you mean 4G or 4G LTE?  Do you mean in terms of speed or coverage?  Or maybe battery life?

You seem to use 'jumping the gun' as the basis for your complaint. 

One man's jumping the gun is another man's we have it first.

UGH.  Just a big fucking UGH.  Seriously, your argument doesn't even make much sense.  ALL phones have limited battery life and battery life is a function of chemistry so until better chemical solutions are usable we have to use what we have available.  Secondly more cores does not equal quicker battery consumption.  These aren't desktop PCs with CISC CPUs.  These are mobile devices with RISC CPUs and so more cores actually often means that these RISC devices can do more with less and idle at much lower states therefore consuming a lot less power in said states.  Greater complexity in RISC CPUs equates to more dynamism and greater functionality with sacrificing power consumption efficiency.  Indeed as far back as the first ARMv7 cores we started to see Video Decoding with less than 5% CPU impact and these days that has blossomed out to Encoding, Audio and 3D rendering all with lower power consumption than ever before let alone the ability of modern RISC CPUs to idle at lower states as just mentioned.

The user experience is improved and is constantly improving.  Sure, we need more battery life.  But the same is true of laptops and any portable piece of electronics.  It's a function of having power in a portable device and can't be avoided for now.

As to 4G, that's a carrier issue and has almost nothing to do with devices outside of 4G aerials needing quite a lot of power to operate (and devices have increased their battery capacities to compensate for this, Apple's iPad 3rd gen included).  You can't get something from nothing and so greater bandwidth must come at a cost. 

4G LTE is another issue altogether and once again is a carrier problem, only this time with marketing rather than application.  It's 3G at peaked speeds rather than 4G in any real context.  No mobile device or device maker is to blame for faked 4G.

As to the rest of your argument, I dunno mate.  You say the device makers jumped the gun by a year or two and I say....***wat.***  You think technological progress needs to slow down?  Really?","1338510028"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I don't think R+L=J is ironclad, and I think people do jump the gun a bit when they treat it like it's a totally solved mystery. But I do think it's the theory with the most evidence so far. I think it could turn out not to be true, but I won't be surprised if it is true either.

There are records of Targaryens from past points in history who didn't have silver hair and purple eyes, so it's possible that Jon got the Stark traits from Lyanna instead. I think it would be mistake for us to assume that genetics in the story works so rigidly and perfectly, like you always only get the traits of one side of your family, depending on which side is known to be more dominant. I could see Jon being Rhaegar's son, but getting a lot of his physical looks and his warging from the Stark side. And as for warging too, yeah, we just don't know the whole story. But if Ned could have passed it on to his kids, why not Lyanna? It could be related to them all having blood of the First Men in some way.

Melisandre definitely has some issues with her prophecies, I agree with you on that. But I think that that's actually what GRRM has wanted to make her character arc about. She started off as very, very convinced that Stannis was AA, but she has been given reasons to doubt and wonder over time, and as we saw in her chapter in ADWD, now she's starting to see Jon in the flames, even if she doesn't quite understand what it means. So I think she's of course not as amazing a sorceress as she'd like people to think, but she's not a complete fraud either. She's starting to pick up on something as she's stayed at the wall, and she believes her general magical powers are getting stronger too (remember when she makes the wildling warg's eagle burst into flames randomly when Stannis shows up during the battle for the Wall?)

And as for your favorite characters, that's all just personal preference really. Can't say much more about it than that. You probably have a very different selection than most readers of the books, but it doesn't really matter, you like whoever you like. There's literally hundreds if not thousands of characters in the books, so it's pretty easy for almost anyone to find several that they really enjoy, even if there are a lot of others they don't care for. I'll grant you though, Euron is one of my favorite characters in the series. He's probably my favorite villain because of how equally cunning and mysterious he is at the same time. Absolutely no one has any idea just quite what he has planned.","1338510029"

Gabaldon actually researched a ton of 18th century history, and I haven't found any inconsistentencies in her keeping track of the complicated plot line.

I think what I'm getting at is that there are many different grades of what is considered Romance-based fiction, with ""50 Shades"" being incomparable to most. 

Outlander, to me, shows the awesome scope of what romantically based fiction can do. Claire Fraser is still her own woman, very independent and decisive with her own thoughts, yet she also cleaves to Jamie. Their relationship is the central part, but not obsessively so. ","1338510032"

Nobody argues that we should be able to abort fetuses, except in extreme cases where not doing so would endanger the life of the mother.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I've got an appointment with my psychiatrist to review the dosage in about a week, so will bring it up then. The problem is that for me dexedrine's been both a godsend and fitted perfectly into a slot in my brain chemistry I had no idea existed. It makes my brain work better than literally anything else I've tried, but I think I'm pretty damn sensitive to it, which is why I've had such bad reactions when upping my dose suddenly. I'll definitely bring it up with my psychiatrist next week, and if it happens again will simply go to my GP.

Another potential issue is that NICE (the semi-independent government body that decides what drugs or procedures are available on the NHS) hasn't approved adderall or most other ADHD drugs other than Ritalin and dexedrine for prescription through the NHS. A month's worth of Dexedrine without insurance cost me £150, having gone private and taken the monetary hit in order to secure a speedy diagnosis and treatment where the NHS would have taken months. However, I can subsequently get it for the low price of £7.90 per month publicly now that I've gone through my GP with a diagnosis. Adderall, on the other hand, is not approved for treatment of ADHD and costs upwards of £300 to import a month's supply. I'm really loathe to switch to anything else at this point without compelling reason where I have few to no problems at standard daily doses...

Either way, we'll see what my doc says next week. Thanks for the advice man :)","1338510047"

I don't mean to come off as cynical, I'm just saying that when foreign films are reinterpreted for an American audience they aren't just translated to English. They are tailored to the mainstream American audience, meaning that the sex will be tuned way down to nothing and the violence will be tuned up to the point of ridiculousness. All subtlety and artistry will be thrown out the window because the American version would be an action flick, fundamentally different from the original film. No, I'm not saying American movies are automatically worse than foreign ones, I'm saying that when they remake a movie for a different audience they are making an all-new movie. They wouldn't make Oldboy in America because Oldboy already exists.","1338510049"

17-10 ranked shaco player S2 with 63% win rate. 46-30 S1 w/ 60.5% win rate. I prefer armor pen reds, as they help with shiv/deceive damage early and allows for you to avoid attack speed completely and go straight for damage. Mp5 is a must for yellows, as you have major mana problems early to mid game, and considering you're playing a very advantageous early game character you want the most bang for you buck without going back to base. I avoid armor yellows mainly because you can do without them when you're ganking a majority of champions. MR blues for the reason that we're not running armor yellows in that we make up for armor with MR instead. Most of the champions you'll be ganking will be in mid/bot lane and will have some form of ability that does magic damage, hence we get MR instead of armor because you shouldn't be trading with most champions (you're an assassin not a scrapper).

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","&gt;No new vaccines would be produced, since they rely on evolutionary techniques, and JWs don't believe evolution occurs

Witness theology allows for significant variations and adaptations. for example, this is from one of the fairly recent publications found here http://download.jw.org/files/media_books/lc_E.pdf

&gt;While the word “species” is used frequently in
this section, it should be noted that this term is not
found in the Bible book of Genesis. There we find the
term “kind,” which is much broader in meaning. Often,
what scientists choose to call the evolution of a
new species is simply a matter of variation within a
“kind,” as the word is used in the Genesis account.


so that basically says that witnesses believe new species can arise, or evolve, from others. But birds are still birds, lizards are still lizards ect.

As for the other stuff, youre pretty much right. But witnesses don't expect the whole world to convert and see things going along as they are now. It's not until after armageddon that they expect to have only witnesses worldwide, but then the world and humanity will be a different place and all those other things would be irrelevent.

No one knows this about me in real life, but I have several giving customs to celebrate the fact that I am actually pretty comfortable now.  One is to fill up and entire cart with non-perishables and buy 1 item for myself.  I love to wheel the thing up to the fire fighters collecting for the poor around Thanksgiving, and wait for it...

One always comes up and starts looking, they open thier hands, and ask, ""What were you looking to donate today?""  

I look over my purchase carefully, as if considering.  I always try to get something really small for myself and have it bagged in its own bag and placed at the farthest end of the basket.  This way I have to reach way over and practically wag the bag by thier hands to pull it out.  One or two will slump just a little, some will gratefully grab for even that small offerring, but every single one is utterly shocked when I loop my little bag on my wrist, and walk away from the kart, leaving the full kart for them.  PRICELESS.   It's a pricey endevor, $200-$500 a kart, and worth it every time.

Being thankful for what you have and giving a hand up to those around you is the responsibility of every worth-while human being on the planet.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; If you don't believe in private property, but I do, I can't build a house on land that I own, or even own land to begin with, because *you would interpret it as an initiation of force*, or theft, against you.

With the italicized caveat, I would agree to that.  Obviously, a primitivist would claim that he is ""defending"" the land from people attempting to homestead it.

Of course, both voluntaryism and primitivism are belief systems.  But that doesn't mean they are *equivalent* or even *equally valid*.  While the primitivist has no epistemological basis to back up his property norms, the voluntaryist *does have* an epistemological basis to back up *his* property norms.

So, unless the primitivist can present a epistemological basis for primitivism that is *at least as sound* as the epistemological basis for voluntaryism, it *inevitably* follows that the primitivist is wrong, that acting on his primitivism is evil, and that violence used to stop his actions is just.

The fact that the primitivist rejects but can't refute voluntaryism, isn't evidence that voluntaryist epistemology is somehow ""invalid"" -- it's just evidence that the primitivist is a brute.

------------------------

Also, isn't it funny how the people who say ""I don't believe in private property"" ultimately behave as if everything was *their* private property anyway?  They violently deny property to *others*, but it's all fine and dandy if *they* acquire, use or otherwise control property.  Those people act *exactly* like legitimate private property owners, except for that pesky requirement to prove that they legitimately *own* what they are trying to control violently.  The rankest hypocrisy covered up by the fanciest perfumes of philosophy.

I don't bother trying to square the circle for them anymore.  Whenever I hear someone saying ""private property is bad, isn't real, is theft, is violence"", I don't bother answering to their elaborate **excuses**, because what they really **mean** -- their true, observable agenda -- is **What's mine is mine, and what's yours is also mine**.

How do I know this?  I've lived enough and studied enough to know that **every single person who has called himself a communist or a socialist, and attained a measure of power, has always acted in consistence with their true agenda, and reneged on their false excuses.**","1338510064"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","1. Yes it's about self reflection at one level. The relationship between the material and the emotional is one of the most fascinating aspects of capitalism as psychological behavior, consumption as sublimation. For me it's not about the feeling, it's about where the feeling is coming from. Does the difference really matter?

2. Possessions as tools, not against that at all; tools make things easier. It's that line between machine and human which I find interesting. I've become very aware of how close we are coming to the singularity. To what extent can human contact be replaced / re-channeled by technological means and how does our current capitalist system drive that? Also the implications of this process on society and especially politics.

3. Nobody has ever had experience with the black market. It's interesting how certain pleasure-inducing products are within the ""legitimate"" structure of the market and others lie outside this system. The argument for this dual nature of the market I feel hasn't been studied enough, probably to avoid the stigma of being seen as advocating drug use (for example), which I feel our generation is caring less about.

I ain't no communist. I think analyzing capitalism in its current form is essential to driving it towards the form which we truly desire, not just accepting what is given due to inertia. In this regard I am battling the residual effects of the Cold War: criticizing capitalism doesn't make you a communist. This argument is intellectually lazy.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In March of this year I went on a religious immersion trip to Philadelphia (I live in Wisconsin) where we brought 45 college students of many different religious affiliations to experience all the different kinds of major religions in the world. When I came back I was telling my family about my experiences and my aunt who I consider my favorite of pretty much all family members outside of my immediate family was asking about some of the people I met. Basically the conversation led to her saying ""Well at least you didn't meet any atheists, right?"" I was dumbfounded. She is the most loving, caring, (insert complimentary adjective) here person I know, yet that still came out of her mouth. To make matters even worse I handled the situation in the worst way possible by being like ""haha... yea"" because I was surrounded by my whole semi-religious family and didn't want to cause any debate. Thinking back I wish I would have just grilled her on that point right on the spot. ","1338510074"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;that's ultimately going to cost more than the entire Netherlands?

What a strange thing to say.  From the crude CG mission animation you could bet on (at least very simply put):

    6*FH launch for base structures/rovers
    6*Cargo Dragon (propulsive landing variant + base infrastructure integration)
    3*Dragonrider (propulsive landing+deep space prep)
    2*Rover vehicles
    3*EDS
    3*Deep space hab (would probably end up being Bigelow modules)

Giving a low end price estimate excluding coms infrastructure, propellant, consumables, crew training etc of

    9*$125M (3 for 2 Dragons each, 3 for the Bigelow space habs, 3 for crew dragons+EDS)
    6*$200M
    3*$250M (low end estimate)
    2*$50 (ballpark)
    3*$20M (ballpark)
    3*$100

$1125m+$1200m+$750m+$100m+$60m+$300m = $3.5 Billion USD.

Lets throw in another $3 billion for things I haven't mentioned and delays and cost overruns.  

With Dutch GDP at approx. 700 billion dollars, I don't think the mission will cost ""more than the entire Netherlands"".","1338510079"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I suppose I can agree that potential is expressed in different ways.  It just seems a shame to me to take a finely tuned machine like the human body and degrade it.

I won’t argue about obesity being the sole source of healthcare woes and wholeheartedly agree with the smoking and alcohol issues (I don’t smoke but do drink).  You made a few points I wanted to offer counter-argument to:

&gt; A) you're addicted to bad food (there's a billion studies on this) 

Recognize that it is an addiction and treat it as such.  I have alcoholic tendencies (hereditary) and I curb my alcohol intake to accommodate.

&gt; B) it's expensive to eat healthy (so the average person who is fat can't easily afford the food) 

I disagree with this one; there is a wealth of knowledge on healthy food and there are plenty of bulk food stores, warehouse stores and other places that stock healthy alternatives.  

&gt; C) it takes immense willpower to change and not everyone has that

Agreed here, willpower is the biggest thing needed for change.  Willpower comes from wanting to change and forcing yourself to go on even if something is uncomfortable.  

&gt; D) you have the whole world out to get you.

Start a support group, connect with others who have similar issues.


All four things above are a direct result of not having willpower and of laziness (sorry to insult :/).  This is why many larger people do not get respect.  People who DO exercise willpower and keep themselves under control view those who don’t as inferior for the simple fact that they did it and they view it as not that hard.  I would liken it to how “normal” people view a transient/bum on the street.  I know I usually think –I have my shit together…what the f*ck is their problem?--.  I believe this same mentality applies to society’s view of large people.

I regards to the reversal, i.e. calling me things to my face…you may call me anything you wish on the street.  That’s why a person has self esteem, to counter nay-sayers :).  Maybe it’s about time you did and exercise your first amendment rights.

Either way you'd have to put the key in if you wanted to register your game with Steam (so that you could record your hours, unlock achievements, download patches/updates easier, etc) so it makes sense to just get the Steam key rather than faffing around with download files and THEN getting it.

Ghost recon is just a 6 on 6 game and the maps are small in size. There are no vehicles and it is in third person. It's a very nice tactical shooter in it's own way, but it requires a lot of teamwork. ","1338510101"
"amiugly","t5_2rgjh","Honestly I think the new pics are even better. But I know how it is re-entering the dating scene and being insecure. 3 years ago my wife left me after a 15 year marriage, and I has a similar mentality.... you kind of feel silly trying to upgrade your style after so long being comfortable not having to work hard to impress girls. But, I tried it. I got into decent (not amazing) shape, I got some new clothes, I really tried to embrace life and the excitement of being single again (I wasn't happy in my marriage). But I can now say I am in an amazing 2 year relationship with a girl that is way way out of my league and better than I ever thought I would have.

You can 100% go out today and have no problems dating. I mean, keep working out etc.... it couldn't hurt. But you are a good looking guy, you'll do fine.

Oh, and I don't think you need to go down to razor level. Maybe Bruce Willis is too much, more Anthony Edwards level hair... just a bit closer/less volume.

I hate movie trailers since they ruin the product that they're trying to promote, but there appears to be two kinds.  The first spoils the first 75% of the movie.  The second pull you in tonally and peaks your interest.  I don't understand people who like the first kind of trailers.  I've never understood it.  But I think I'm starting to, because just now I realized that people take pleasure in posting the plots to movies that won't come out for 2 years.  There's only a short jump from there to spoiling the movie in a trailer.  It's a shallow cultural experience in my opinion, and it's tainting science fiction culture, if such a thing exists.

Part of the fact that three blokes are coming up on a weekend up to Sydney is to have a crack at the local fauna, and although the pubs are great, you want a more lively atmosphere.

The Cross is a zoo but if you want a good chance at appearing on the local news as a witness to a shooting or fistfight, go here. It's the authentic ""Sydney Saturday Filth"" experience. I really recommend the Beresford. Particularly the latter in terms of a decent place to drink, lots of people to look at, and a dance floor up top. Get there early because the lineup after 930ish is brutal. Place closes early (1am) which leaves the rest of the night for other places to check out.

If you're a couple of young gents out on the town, the beer halls are great, but you can drink good beer down in Melbourne in the multitude of your great pubs and bars.

Also, while Sugar and HFCS may be about on par health wise it should be keep in mind that without such a incredibly cheap sweetener companies may be more open to other, healthier, methods to make their products taste better that are currently cost ineffective due to HFCS.

In short, HFCS may be on par health wise, but it comes at a tax cost to our society and resource cost to our land (corn is a intensive crop on the soil, and corn subsidies actually increase the cost of other foods that would have been grown on those lands a brought costs down) that is totally unnecessary.

The biggest problem with getting old and eyesight is that even if you were nearsighted (coudlnt see far, but see close really well) you will now be double fucked - that's why bifocals are needed.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","When I was 18 or so, I had the bright idea of trying to see how fast I could be going and still do a full 360 on a [Wave Runner](http://www.yamahawaverunners.com/).  

Like the two people in the picture, I grossly underestimated exactly how fast those things can go when they are 'flat out', (I should have clued in when I looked over and saw I was outrunning cars on a nearby road).  So, after a while of slowly increasing speed I just said, ""fuck it, I'll do it at full speed"".

The short version is that the wave runner did a perfect 360.  I came off of it as if I had been shot from a catapult, (which, in some ways, I had been).  I can't tell you how far I went through the air before I hit the water the first time, but I can tell you that I skipped three times before I slowed down enough to actually enter the water.

Once I stopped, (about when I entered the water), I had about a 20 meter swim back to the wave runner.  I also hurt.  My entire body hurt.  It hurt for about three days.  On the list of 'pain I have felt in my life', I have this one tied with the time I took a 12 meter fall onto a palett of bricks.

That guy in the picture, the one in the air -  this is a picture of him moments before discovering that same feeling for himself.","1338510133"

The problem is that the quality control on the injection moulding process just isn't as good, so many of the blocks are mis-formed. Within about half an hour of starting your 1,500 block set, you discover that 10-20% of the blocks just don't fit together. Either there's a leftover 'tag' of plastic from the mould, an air bubble in the block or pieces where the plastic has sagged or melted entirely.

The reason that Lego is expensive is due to of the number of blocks that fail the quality assurance checks and end up in the bin. Megablocks are cheaper because the reject blocks end up right there in the box with the rest.","1338510135"

"budgetfood","t5_2si9h","In terms of non-carbs, canned tomatoes and tomato sauce are both good.  They usually go on sale every month or so (~1.25 a can in Canada).
The same with canned tuna (1$).  
Canned beans aren't as cheap as dried, but I never seem to get my shit together enough to cook and package them ahead of time.  Invest in some Beano- pricey, but worth it :p

Get a bag of frozen mixed veg on sale and throw a handful into whatever you are making- more expensive than fresh, but again- no prep and they never go bad.

If you want to keep eating meat, get some lean ground, fry it up, and then keep it in a ziplock in the freezer.  

Basic fresh veg:

Apples. Buy 6 every weekend.  Take one to campus each day.

Brocolli.  A head of brocolli + pasta + can of tuna + some chicken broth and chilli flakes makes a decent meal.  Make enough that you can take the rest for lunch or eat it the next night.

Carrots.  Sticks, cubed in fried rice or soup.

Celery and onions.  2 sticks celery chopped + leftover rice + can of tomato sauce + half a chopped onion + spices/hot sauce.  Fry it up, you have ""Spanish Rice""  

Also, sandwiches.  Quick, easy, tasty.  Don't keep the deli meat longer than 5 days!



Get a few basic meals (as above) that you know how to make, and then   shop so you will have the ingredients at home to make at least half of them.  ","1338510137"
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The climate crisis we face today is not some sensationalist scene from a bad movie (day after tomorrow). It is, unfortunately, really happening. 

(below comment copy of a response in a different part of the thread)

There is at least as much evidence for human caused climate change as there is for evolution, possibly more.

Climate change isn't going to blow over. It won't go away because it's inconvenient to our economies. It will change the earth in permanent ways that will likely eradicate the human species, and the window to stop it is closing fast.

There was a marketing company that was hired in the 40's and 50's to spread doubt that cigarettes were unhealthy. They did this by spreading false information, slandering the character of researchers, and putting up fake scientists to publicly question the results about the dangers of smoking. This same company was hired by oil companies in the 90's to use the same tactics for global warming.

Instead of following the hive mind and accepting the current media spins on climate change, you should look up the results found by actual scientists. The best, most unbiased source is probably the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which was established by the United Nations to discover if global warming was real. Not only have they confirmed that the earth is warming, but in 2007 they made the statement ""anthropogenic (human caused) climate change is unequivocal."" They also have found some interesting data on what kind of things will likely happen as climate change progresses.

I will leave you with this: I used to be just like you, and many of the other climate skeptics on reddit. I thought that most global warming touters were alarmists akin to the ""save the whales"" hippies and vegans. When I finally looked at the actual data instead of just the media spin, I was shocked: I had either stumbled upon the biggest conspiracy ever, or had let myself be deceived all that time. I am a rational person, and the data speaks for itself, but it was still hard to admit that I was taken for a fool by one of the biggest media spins of all time. It is sickening that people are still trying to muddy the waters regarding climate change, because good people are falling for it and missing their opportunities to save themselves. Climate change should never have become a political issue, it is a human issue. ","1338510137"

1. Nearly 0 in my case, it only really matters for scholarships. They take nearly anybody. 

2. While jaded I believe U of W to be more of a tight knit community with smaller classes and better relationships with the professors. Some say its easier with their A- and all but you will get the grades you want if you put the effort in.
U of M offers more choices and IMO more opportunities, has more available to them because of their size. 

3. If you are looking to stay in the city for your entire education. I don't think that U of W has either of those. Here is a list from their website

4. University 1 is basically forcing people to take general courses so that they have an idea of what they are getting into for university. I am not sure about the logic but it helped me when I switched from Physio to Asper. 

5. To be honest I am not sure that my volunteer experience really helped me with anything.

6. University is not about being smart. People who are the best and brightest rarely do the best in University because they are not use to working. I had mid 90s in high school and excelled easily in high school, my first years GPA at university was a bloody 2.1. It was horrendous, I was not used to putting in the time that was necessary for studying or essay writing. If you are not serious about doing it, you are wasting a lot of money and time. I worked to try and change that first year for the last 5 years but it will always be there dragging me down

The P-51 is a bit bigger and gives a bit more leverage, but it seems that the good ol' P-38 is superior when it comes to quality.  I got to check out both in an army surplus store earlier this year, and the P-38 seems to have much ""cleaner"" machining.  Sharper blade, crisper edges, etc.  They seemed to be made from different grades of steel too.  Overall the P-38 just seemed like a better made tool.  My dad has one on his key ring that I'm pretty sure he got back in Vietnam.  The damn thing is a trooper.

5 minutes later, a small doe walked up on me and I shot it at about 5 feet. 

I had no comprehension of bullet placement or anything. If I had been smart or had any knowledge, I would have shot it in the head. Instead, I shot it in the shoulder (it was quartering towards me), it hit the ground and jumped up and ran, so I shot it in the butt. It did a somersault and flipped over and landed on it's back. It tried to get up to run again, but I jumped on it and tackled it to the ground. It died quickly.

One of my worst kills ever. It really bothered me for a while.

Very few will pick 0, 10 or 20; they're so round and un-randomy. 0-10000 also have numbers that will be picked more or less often, 4782 probably being among the more popular ones.

Thought I would also do a quick run down of the MFS because its fairly uncommon (I never heard of it). I saw [this](http://slickguns.com/product/mfs-223-55gr-fmj-zinc-plated-500rd-case-12475-fs?a=5735&amp;k=other) with free shipping so couldnt pass up trying some of this stuff out. Its actually pretty damn accurate ammo! I went prairie dog shooting today and thought I would test it out and it worked fairly well. I plugged 8 prairie dogs from 100+ yards with it. I wouldnt rave about the accuracy but it would be damn good for plinking. 

Out of 150 rounds I had 3 FTF. All three were past 120 rounds. My only complaint is that this ammo is dirty. It started to clog up the works, thats why I got the 3 FTF. I have never gotten a FTF from the 1500+ rounds of XM193 I have run through my AR. The MFS zinc coated ammo did pretty well, I was impressed. Cant beat $.25/round plus free shipping

I immediately went home and cleaned the AR out, dirtiest I think its ever been. It came off quickly and didnt take too much longer than usual to get clean again. Ill be buying some more MFS for plinking.","1338510169"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Well you have to look at the people doing the studies. They have an agenda, they are scientists, sick of religion. Religion has always condemned the filthy act of masturbation, and more importantly:

LUST IN GENERAL.

Allow me to repeat that.

Lust in general.

The scientists are heavily addicted to lust. They totally lack a decent control group. Frankly, they are not scientists at all. A scientist is objective. Its just that the truth about this whole planet is too vile to stomach, that we are just tricking ourselves with pieces of paper and garbage science. It's sad, but its true. 

There are three types of people. Total fornicators, who just burn in their own passions (forni, furnace). Then there are the type of people here, who were the same as the inquisitors and catholic priests, people who bottle the energy but are completely ignorant of what they are doing, and as a result I've already encountered pedophiles in this group. Lastly, you have people who behave intelligently and know how to properly manage the energy.

If you really want to strive to know something worthwhile, if you want to know ""The Truth"", then stop being like other people. This humanity is just a herd of animals, guided by bad shepherds. You have to fight voraciously against commonly accepted ideas, like this study on prostate cancer for example. Prostate cancer rates are as high as they are BECAUSE of fornication. The prostate totally burns up when it is depleted. You can feel the irritation. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in Canada among men.

Just don't believe in anyone, even me. But you're not going to meet many people like me, that is a fact. Too many people enjoy lust, you can get swept up in it all and never hear a thing about it again. That is your right, you choose, the wet path or the dry path (see the Mona Lisa painting), but do remember your Divine Mother.","1338510169"

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","I think Sozin realized A) he needed the comet to give him the decisive advantage against air nomads on their 'home turf' (accessing the temples and over powering them)  B) even with the comet the Earth kingdom was not going to fall in a 1 day: the major cities were heavily fortified/ far from the fire nation's territory and they didn't have the air ship advantage or the drill. Did they even definitely have the 'tanks' used in A:TLA??

In his shoes I think rather than the 4 air temples I might have actually wiped out the 2 water tribes w/ the comet then concentrated on the earth Kingdom: 

This would have cut the Avatar off from learning water and fire (obviously), and with the earth kingdom besieged made learning earth substantially difficult. 

In this scenario since they were not wiped out w/ the air nomads sky bison could be (in theory) captured and enslaved giving the fire nation 'air support' in Iroh's later assault on Ba Sing Se which would have swung the battle and possibly spared his son DRASTICALLY altering his mentality and life vs what we saw in A:TLA

1) *Climate has changed before*.

2) *We can't even predict weather, so how can we predict climate*?

**For the first**, the answer is this: it is through understanding these past changes that scientists get answers about current global warming. It can be determined that natural causes of global warming aren't causing the current trend. The rate of warming that we have seen and will see is not like anything humankind has experienced before, and is happening too quickly for long-term natural causes (orbital changes, rock weathering, long-term solar trends). However, it's also been occurring for too long to be caused by short term cycles (El Nino, the 11-year solar cycle). [This link provides a good explanation](http://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-change-little-ice-age-medieval-warm-period.htm)

**For the second**, think of this analogy. A professional basketball team is playing a college basketball team. Analysts can, with a high amount of certainty, predict the professionals will win. Despite this, they might not be able to predict the exact order in which points will be scored. The winner is climate, and the order of points is weather. Climate is sort of like an average of weather, so predicting its behavior doesn't require knowing every single weather event along the way.

"confession","t5_2qo2a","Hi, there!  Former anorexic/exercise bulimic reporting for duty.  Went from 230 to 140 in 3 months through concerted, dedicated self-abuse.  Allow me to commend you on your determination.

As my experiences are an easy 20 years behind me, allow me to share a few tidbits beyond the typical ""you shouldn't abuse your body/see a counsellor/change your diet/don't hate yourself"" stuff that I'm sure you've seen an eyeful of already.

First off, your metabolism is going to be fucked up for the rest of your life.  You started doing this when it was changing, right?  You were gaining weight and you had no idea why?  Well, by kicking the shit out of your food intake right about the time your body is reconfiguring for adulthood, you're doing a damn fine job of ensuring that your body configures itself for extracting the most possible nutrition out of your shitty, shitty diet... which means once you ditch your shitty, shitty diet, you'll likely have more nutrition than your body will know what to do with.  You think you got it rough now.  Wait 'til you're 30.

Next up, that 17 pounds that's traumatizing the hell out of you isn't traumatizing the hell out of your family or friends.  They aren't going to understand.  Going off the reservation about food isn't going to bridge the gap.  If you tell your friends that you *must* lose weight, that it's killing you being this heavy, that you're disgusted when you look in the mirror, they *will* help you.  They *will* support you.  They want you to love yourself and if helping you lose 17 pounds will help you love yourself, they'll jump in with both feet.  

Purging?  They're not going to get behind that.  They're going to see you as sick.  Someone who needs a cure.  Not someone employing a means to an end.

Finally, you are employing an inappropriate approach to a personal body change.  You've lost perspective on the problem.  I don't say this to tell you you're wrong, but to tell you that your goal weight might not be as set in stone as you think it is once you get close to it.  And really, ""weight"" is a shitty way to determine health.  My wife (5'8) went from 110 to 130 simply by eating a little better and lifting weights for three months and I'm here to tell ya - holy shit every one of those pounds was *awesome.*

Don't take this the wrong way, but right now it looks like you're dabbling with an eating disorder.  You're rationalizing it in terms the rest of us use, you're justifying it on the basis of reasonable goals, and you've yet to commit fully to what is, in fact, a really lonely and unpleasant lifestyle.  You've probably got plenty of people in your life that will happily and eagerly help you achieve your goals in a far healthier way - sometimes the only way we find them is by asking.  

And, by the way?  17 lbs of weight gain in 5 months despite your best efforts might very well be endocrine-related.  ""Rapid weight gain"" is an indicator of all sorts of peculiar things going on under the hood.  You do yourself a real disservice by not popping into the doctor's office and saying ""hey, Doc - I'm swelling up like a balloon and it's freaking me the fuck out.  What do I do?""

You can keep the purging to yourself.  Or, you know, stop.

Good luck, either way, and know that I'll be thinking about you.","1338510176"

We have wild rabbit that live in our neighborhood and our kids love them.  Everytime we see one on the lawn, the girls will come out and fawn over it from a distance.  One morning the girls were out on the back deck playing and I went out back to do some yardwork.  Without seeing it I walked right up to a very young rabbit...couldn't have been but a couple weeks old.  It started to scamper away and I called for the girls to see the cute little thing.  It hopped through the fence into our neighbor's yard, where there kindly old dog that just hangs out on the porch all the time suddenly thought he was a puppy again and bolted up and went tearing after the bunny.  The bunny was confused and tried to squeeze back through our fence, but the dog caught it and proceeded to crush it in his jaws and parade around the yard with the dead bunny prize in his mouth.  The girls looked on in horror and started to cry.  I didn't blame the dog.  He's a good dog...he was just being a dog.  But I felt a little responsible for the demise of the little bunny.

Are you kidding? I am not a religious person but I grew up going to church regularly. I remember a sermon where the preacher was talking about how all lawyers are going to hell because they're basically a league of people who lie regularly under oath to get to a specific end.

Most lawyers have no concern about truth or justice; they do what they're paid to do and whatever it takes to get to the end they're looking for. Lawyers are the last people who are going to stand up and point out how ridiculous a lot of the SCOTUS judgments are, how the constitution is being shredded....

Think about it. The best lawyers work for the highest bidder. Always. Who has more money than the people who are aggressively destroying the rule of law and shredding the constitution?","1338510177"

One of my brothers friends, who were a couple grades older than me, got to speak at graduation. Throughout the speech he delivered quotes from 'the good book', to which the audience nodded like good little bobble-head dolls.

If a service wants to allow it that's up to them, but I think breastfeeing in uniform in public is not in accordance with a professional combat-fighting institution. I wouldn't go so far as to say that a woman should have to pump just because she's in uniform.

They serve other purposes as well. It's nice to practice chambering a round with since there is no possibility of a ND. You can also stagger a magazine with real rounds and snap caps when out at the range to help you identify flinching issues.

"computergraphics","t5_2qhxp","Hey avngr,

I actually just graduated from Purdue (May 2012) as Computer Graphics major (CGT) with a Computer Science minor. As for companies you could possible work for I've interviewed with companies such as Amazon and Dreamworks. The real question is are you looking to do computer graphics for engineering work or are you looking to do more artistic work (which is what I gather from your deviantart).

Now, I will say if you are serious about transferring do realize that CGT will not land you a job straight out of college in the animation, 3d modeling, etc job market. It isn't focused enough to fine tune your skills. From my graduating class those who focused on animation, 3D Modeling, rigging, etc are now either doing grad school in CGT, more education via animation mentor / Gnomon School, or are still looking for work. One of my friends got an internship at sony most likely followed by full time as a rigging/TD. My other friend is working for a small mobile game studio and I am still interviewing with companies.

Me personally, I wish I had gone with a full CS degree or maybe CS and CGT degrees instead of CS minor because I am more on the technical side and want to do tool programming / Technical Director type jobs. I will say a lot of graduates from CGT were not happy with the department because the department isn't keeping up with the industry and wastes a lot of classes on things that should not be taught that Adobe Illustrator compared to jumping into Maya or similar programs earlier on.

If you would like to chat more or have any questions etc. Feel free to pm me and we can skype, im, etc I'd be more than happy to answer any of your questions.","1338510188"

"CalPoly","t5_2s470","GPA is really not that important.

If you had a high GPA, the most it would ever help you is getting your first job. Nobody cares past that. They care about what you did at your last job. Recent experience is always the most relevant.

If you had trouble getting an internship, I'm guessing you were talking to a lot of the big companies at the career fair, etc. Big companies are stacked against you if you have a lower GPA because they need quick tests to whittle down the massive pool of applicants they get. ""Is your GPA 3.0+?"" is usually one of those tests.

Look into smaller companies. They are less likely to care about something small like your GPA and will consider you as a complete package, not applicant #15312356. And unless you enjoy feeling like an irrelevant cog in a massive machine, smaller companies can be a lot more fun and meaningful to work for anyway.

Sidenote: GPA is an awful indicator of the employment value of a person, and smart companies know that. Some of my most valuable coworkers have been people who had mediocre GPAs, because they spent all their free time (and some of their school time) working on side projects and exploring things that interested them because they were passionate about the field.","1338510191"

Ah, but I suppose you're checking the 3x3 matrix further on your link (the markov one). The code you posted is for the 2x2 one at the start of the article.

Note that in the article they find an eigenvector for the *transpose* of the matrix A.

If you do:

then you should find the same eigenvector as in the article (although again, normalized to a length of 1).

Our emotions have nothing to do with what is right or wrong, beyond what has been engrained into our genetic makeup over millions of years... Which varies quite widely (of course). 

Your ""not constructive"" criticism does not offer evidence for the existence of altruism and the mixture of social/antisocial behavior is the best description of the tendencies of cooperation and aggression that exist within human nature. 

The ""it seems a bit narrow"" criticism is not a criticism, but your assertion that human nature should somehow be more mysterious or complicated than the composition of its animal parts. Mixture is almost exactly opposite of polarized (either or).

People are forgetting that this is not a normal offseason. We won the Champions League and got a nice chunk of change from claiming that trophy. If you use some of the estimates of our Champs League winning that have been tossed around so far (anywhere from 45-60mil euro, leaning toward the high end of that scale most likely), we have not spent very much money out of pocket. At worst, the Hazard signing is a push when you take our Champs League winnings into account, and the wages for each player are largely going to come out of the wages for departing players such as Drogba, Kalou, and Bosingwa.

I am pleased to see that Abramovich realizes we are a depleted squad and that we need some serious help in order to contend on multiple fronts next season. Last season's squad (despite winning the Champions League) was awful for large stretches of the season, and we needed some new blood to get us moving again.

Or as nekura was saying, being able to hide in spots on maps that wouldn't be possible with a larger character model. The theory is that the fraction of a second longer it takes for the other person to correctly identify you gives you an edge you wouldn't have against the same person if you had a larger character model.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","&gt;You said we have bad coaches and players. I provided a link showing that we have had good coaches who developed players into NFL talent.

And I responded with several reasons why the information in that link was flawed. I thought they were all reasonable points. 

&gt;Oregon State was not an inconference foe in 2009 and was the pac-12 runner up to Oregon.

Your post mentioned ranked team, and ESPN didn't list the Beavers as ranked, so I skipped over them. Regardless, they finished 8-5 that year (though with a tough schedule).

&gt;The Mavericks last year are a perfect example of a team winning with depth and not to mention having five great starters is a definition of depth

The way I've heard it, depth is patently not about your five starters, but who comes off the bench. Their bench helped them a lot, but only Terry and Stevenson really helped them against Miami. Only Terry played more than 13 minutes in game 6, and they had their superstar to carry them. This is getting away from the main point of my first post though, which is that you said I was making excuses, and my Heat example was to show that I wasn't making excuses, but providing legitimate reasons for why our performance was down relative to our recruiting classes.

&gt;Basically, you said that Stanford isn't going to be good this coming year because the recruiting rankings are not up to reloading caliber

No, I asked why everyone thought Stanford was going to be as good as predicted next year. This is different on two accounts. First, Stanford can be good next year without being in the Top 10, like they are predicted to be, and second, I was asking a question, not making an assertion. 

&gt;but then go on to defend your own teams failure last year by saying that recruiting rankings aren't everything and that there are other factors.

There are other factors. Stanford is a great example of the fact that there are other factors to consider besides simply recruiting rankings when talking about how good a team is. My claim was never that Stanford wouldn't be good next year because they hadn't been recruiting at an elite level. That's why a previous post in this chain said that ""in the aggregate"" recruiting rankings are predictive of on-field success. Do you not think losing Pryor and Tressel, and Posey, Adams and Heron for part of the season had an effect on our success?

&gt;Not to mention when I provided evidence that Dantonio beat a ranked team your only comeback was ""herrr derrrp the Big East is bad herrr derrp"". Can't win an argument against the unwilling.

I asked an honest question about the credentials of Dantonio. You answered providing his credentials. I accept those credentials as true, but that doesn't mean I have to accept those credentials as overwhelming evidence that Dantonio was a great coach at Cincinnati.","1338510233"

[Macs Are PCs, Dammit!](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2327233,00.asp)

You're spouting off a misconception and now you are defending it. Read the article above and shut the fuck up already. You are wrong. The term ""personal Computer"" had been around long before IBM clones. How could IBM coin the term for the IBM clones when the very first commercial computers where using the term. [Apple also used the term Personal computer in its ads for their computers](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/04/30/old-apple-ad-what-kind-of-man-owns-his-own-computer/).

I don't relish kicking you while you are down but you just have to keep replying, don't you? Cognitive dissonance can be a bitch sometimes.

What you have done, is you saw a Mac commercial and bought into the bullshit. Its the same as BMW saying ""it's not a car, it's a BMW!""

Mac's are PC's and they have even used the term themselves before those stupid misleading Justin Long commercials. Even the wikipedia article on ""personal computers"" goes into detail about OSX and Apple in general. You are 100% absolutely wrong. 

Next time at least get your fucking facts straight. ","1338510235"

I'm a vegetarian, and just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you'll lose weight. I actually gained weight for awhile, because all I was eating was a shit load of cheese, bread, and junk foods. 

If you aren't going vegetarian for ethnic (murdering animals) and/or health (all the chemicals in processed meat) reasons, then you won't feel a need to stick to it. You can still lose weight and eat meats, just choose leaner cuts, and grill instead of frying.Try getting organic meats if you can. 

Just eat more veggies and fruits, and remember that dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger. A good tip is if you are feeling hungry, drink a glass of water and see if it goes away after 10 minutes. If it hasn't, then you probably really are hungry. ","1338510236"

Still, Boxers play like crazy.

Personally, I have a terrier is very picky about his company, but he instantly takes a shine to any real terrier (and by that I mean a Jack Russell or offshoot of a Jack Russell, like a Fox Terrier.  Not a toy dog like a Yorkie who happens to have ""terrier"" in its name, while possessing zero actual terrier ancestry or capability).  Regardless of the temperament of the other dog, he immediately wants to play and will pester them until they cave.","1338510244"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You've mentioned one thing here, sex-ed. catholic schools teaching condom usage is very uncommon, but good. Considering that the church itself teaches that condoms are worse than stds.

It's possible that depending on where you live they are required to teach that, but where there's free reign it's very uncommon for teachings such as that to happen.

Of course, every school is going to be different, and schools in different regions/countries will be different again.

For specific examples, the idea that the bible is true. The problem is, that it's being put on the same level as maths and science. It does not deserve to be. I didn't go to a catholic school myself, but from friends that have (So my statements are largely anecdotal), I have been told that the schools they went to:

Claim that Noah's Ark story really happened, despite the mathematical impossibility of fitting all the animals onto the boat, the boat being able to withstand the stresses involved, the waters origin and dissapearance.

Jonah and the whale as being a true story, despite the fact that aperson would not be ale to live in a whale (Sorry, ""Large Fish"") for three days.

Basically, when te bible is taught as truth, more truthful than what we can actually know, you are teaching falsehoods.

Most of the people I know who went through catholic school have left the faith, as they were taught contradictory things and decided to go with the more likely.","1338510246"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I'm glad it could be of help. To expand on what I mean, since there was some extra discussion - If you take your paragraph defining the Prime Mover and just replace mentions of ""God"" with ""The Laws of Physics"" or ""Math"", you end up with the same thing, such as:

&gt; *Math* exists necesarily, which means it doesn't depend on anything else for its existence.

&gt; *Math* is also immaterial.

Which makes sense. Nothing is *required* for 1+1 to equal 2. 1+1 equaling two isn't a *thing*, so it is immaterial.

An entity such as the laws of physics (which is only loosely definable as an ""entity"", but we can run with it) are just as ubiquitous, eternal, perfect, ""good"", and immaterial as the God you are attempting to define. However, you're taking an extra, unprecedented step by *personifying* such an entity. More justification is required to accept such a personification. 

Since we know that the laws of physics exist and are tangible, testable, and provable, it makes more sense (since it doesn't require anything extraneous and unjustified) to accept that some law of physics was the Prime Mover and behind the Big Bang. And sure enough, we are learning more and more about what that force may very well be (something such as vacuum energy.) I anticipate that one day science will provide a definite understanding about this.

Also I feel that a philosophical argument could very well serve as a proof for God, but I've never seen one that has sealed the deal.","1338510248"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","1.  So what we see on a small scale is different than what happens on a large scale?  Does macroevolution follow this rule too? :P
2.  ""a selective sweep"" -- I agree with everything you wrote and linked about this.  But you accumulate thousands of deleterious mutations along any path to fixation for a single beneficial one.  How many of these will be purged in the next selective sweep?  One?  Two?  How many selective sweeps have humans had in *recorded* history?
3.  Fair points about Lance and Einstein.  But you're looking at at least 1000 to 1 for the ratio of deleterious to beneficial.
4.  ""I've already explained why that's simply not true. With math""  The equation you used doesn't apply here.  If you pretend that no beneficial mutations occur, it still shows that the deleterious ones don't achieve fixation, even when every child has them.  This obviously can't be true.
5.  ""What you're doing is saying 'evolution can't explain X'""  No, I'm not saying either way.  Your argument is:  A. Evolution produced all features of life.  B.  Color vision is a feature of life.  C. Therefore evolution produced color vision.  D.  Color vision exists, so evolution is true.  But all this is rather tangetal.  My original point was that beneficial mutations are very rare.

"AskMom","t5_2u75n","I think a lot of it has to do with your age (a 22-year-old getting married and having children is probably more out of the ordinary among her friends than a 35-year-old woman). I found that getting married didn't affect my friendships all that much because I was in my late 20s and many of my friends were married or in long-term relationships, as well. 

Having a baby was a completely different scenario. I grew much closer to the women I knew who'd had babies around the same time (three of us at my work at the time had children, all 5 months apart), but much further apart from friends who had no children. I think it's inevitable. While I've stayed in touch -- whether by email or Facebook or text or whatever -- with some of them, we are just at very different points in our lives. Some of those friends don't particularly care for children, or plan never to have any. A few of them really dig kids and like to hang with her.

But since we moved out of state for me to attend graduate school, of course we don't see them as much. Some of them are sort of forced to hang out with us when we go back home to visit. I don't think they mind an occasional lunch date with a toddler, but I know, if I were childless, I wouldn't want to hang out with someone else's kids all the time. 

I don't think your friends are ""bad friends"" (except the ones who you say lash out! What's that about?!) anymore than you're a bad friend for getting married and pregnant ""on them."" I just don't think it's easy to understand how much a child changes your life until it actually happens. I am guilty of judging moms when I was childless, because I couldn't empathize. I was totally clueless as to how much work it was, and how special that little person would be to me.

I think, as time goes on, you will meet other women in similar situations, and make new friends who are at the same point in life as you are right now. I wouldn't go out of my way to ditch the friends you have now. Some of them may want you to reach out to them, and they may not know how to relate. You can help them by talking to them about what you're going through, and asking for their help, but also by making time *for* and *about* them.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","In the cinematic universe Iron Man doesn't stand a realistic chance of beating Thor.  Thor is too strong, too tough and too resilient. Sure, IM can hang for a while, but the longer the fight goes on the greater his disadvantage becomes.  IM simply can't inflict any real damage on Thor, whereas IM's suit can be systematically taken apart (as was starting to happen during their hand to hand combat-sans Mjolnir).  Even with the power boost he was still just holding his own. And if Thor can get IM's power levels to 400% he can push it to waaay past that.  The point is, the suit has a limit and that limit is easily eclipsed by all the lightning at Thor's disposal.

In the cinematic universe Thor also beat the Hulk. Without Mjolnir maybe the Hulk wins but there's no equalizer for that hammer.

With all due respect, to say the rest of the Avengers are on par with Thor strength-wise is simply incorrect. Only the Hulk is (and that's just strength-Thor still wields more raw power).

Change your diet. Cut out all processed foods and eat fruit, veggies, and protein.

Exercise every day if you can, even if it's only a walk around the block.

Add Vitamin D mega-dose to your diet, most MSers are D deficient. Also add a flax oil capsule and eat a lot of Omega3 rich foods. They're natural anti-inflammatories. 

Lastly, don't sit around feeling sorry for yourself. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer the same year I was diagnosed with MS. She is dead now. It really could be worse and staying happy and positive is key.","1338510269"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","The problem is that modern polygamy is DEMANDED by religion. The Polygamists in the Kingston compounds or the FLDS communities do what they do because they have been told to, not because they decided they were polygamists. These communities practice polygamy and that means one man has many wives, so the communities have to ostracize unwed men. Google ""the lost boys of Las Vegas"" so many young men are pushed out and end up as people trained to fit into a specific community, with no community, they get really messed up. Women have it even worse just read even one of the articles about Warren Jeffs, He isn't being tried for polygamy he's being tried for sex with minors, women dont get to choose who they marry and at what age that marriage is consummated &lt;Shudder&gt;. This is the problem with these communities, they allow this sort of things to happen and its horrible. 

On the other hand that is how polygamy is generally practiced if you went for just the idea minus the religion and community and if you weren't a religious sociopath and there were two, er, three or more consenting adults and let me emphasize this again if you are NOT A COMPLETE TOOL but rather a rational and ok person.

But they could start by dumping the comically inefficient production pipeline that wastes millions for every big budget movie production and maybe stop paying people like Tom Cruise $20 million just for being a walking prop. 

Movie budgets have only ever gone up, while independent productions have repeatedly shown that you can make a decent movie for under 5 million.

And din't even get me started on ""Hollywood accounting""

I'd be quite happy if all the big studios died and went out of business tomorrow, and the TV media groups too. They've been around too long, they're inefficient and actually believe that they're the only people capable of producing content. When the truth is that if they disappeared, dozens of independent producers would immediately step in to take their place. Something they can't do right now because monopolies and cartels prevent them.

The production business needs to die. It cannot be repaired - it is too far gone. It needs to be completely destroyed so something better can grow in it's place.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","There are a number of benefits.  True competition in the retail space has been made possible by making the physical network itself government owned, not owned by Telstra.  This will enable a better deal for consumers as ISP's don't need to buy access from Telstra.  Also, fiber is many, many times better than the copper wire that is used by your phone line at the moment.  Once the fiber is in the ground, upgrading speeds in future only involves replacing the equipment at either end of the fiber, not digging the ground up to replace wires.

Fiber can carry enough information to make 'triple play' possible- phone, internet and TV down the one wire.  So no more foxtel price gouging- watch alternate services like iinet's FetchTV take off, so finally we'll see some real competition for pay tv as well, not the foxtel monopoly we have at the moment.

More bandwidth, and faster speeds are possible over fiber. It's hard to predict what this might eventually lead to, but think of it in terms of trying to explain what 'the internet' is to somebody who just got a phone line, back in 1900 or whatever- that's the kind of leap forward we are talking about.

Telecommuting and cloud computing will be made much easier thanks to the NBN.  Somebody in Ballarat will be able to log into their virtual desktop in a Melbourne data center for example, in the same way that you log onto gmail today.  In cities, over time, that will take some of the stress of transport networks as workers don't need to physically be in the office to get their work done now.  What we are seeing with ipads, 'bring your own device' to work and similar changes in today's workplaces will be the tip of the iceberg in this regard.

The NBN has an immediate benefit in medical and education uses.  The bandwidth available via the NBN will allow real-time video links for distance learning (teachers won't neccesarily have to physically be on site to teach a class- a professor in Sydney can log on and teach a lesson to a class in Alice Springs- this is nothing new, but the NBN widens the scope so that that sort of distance learning is commonplace.  What that means is that where you decide to live won't affect the quality of the education you can get.  Same goes for medical help- a doctor in a remote community will be able to use an HD video link to instantly connect with specialists for help and diagnosis- imagine a field doctor in a remote community dialling in a heart specialist for one of the capital cities. Again, in a country as big as Australia, distance is no longer an issue.

There's a ton more reasons the NBN is a good thing, have a look on the NBN website or do some googling, but the combination of regulatory reform (breakup of Telstra monopoly), the improvement in the physical infrastructure (fiber is miles better than copper) and the social benefits that the NBN will bring, make it a long overdue and extremely important piece of infrastructure for the country.  

It's too important to politicise but unfortunately the Coalition have done exactly this.  Realistically, it should have bipartisan support but Tony Abbott has instructed Malcolm Turnbull (shadow comms minister) to 'wreck' the 'wasteful' NBN plan (his words), so there is a very real chance the NBN in its current form will get scrapped in the 2013 election.  I don't really care for politics in general but for this (and a long list of other) reasons, I sincerely hope the Coalition does not get into government in the next election.","1338510288"

You're made look at a red dot while the doctor does his magic. It's scary at one point when they make a slit in your cornea, because you feel pressure on the eyeball then everything goes black. You feel blind. You technically are for a few seconds. Then the laser starts, the lights you see are moving around like you're on some ~~awesome~~ weird acid trip. You smell burning... It's the cells being killed. Everything slowly gets less blurry, but still blurry because of anesthesia. 

This all lasts about 5 minutes per eye. It's been 7 hours since my operation, stuff is still blurry. Should be good by tomorrow morning.

The really obvious mistake was 'ionad' instead of 'iontas'. Ionad is kind of hard to explain but but it usually refers a building which is the center for something.

Mathematicians, have at me because I have no idea if I'm right.  I'd be really interested to know what the odds of getting a royal flush on the flop are.

&gt;Are the probabilities for the various hands the same in Texas Hold ’em as in Seven-card stud or are they different somehow due to the community cards? Could you please explain why or why not?

"WTF","t5_2qh61","OK, no way is that deer going to change the handling of that gigantic fucking beast of a 4WD. My biggest insult is to any person who would even contemplate driving such a stupid vehicle.

It's so fucking huge it resembles a land-going barge more than a vehicle of any kind, and the impact of a deer on a barge would be negligible.

I can easily understand how a stupid woman, driving a stupid car can make this stupid mistake.

I once saw a woman collide with a motorcyclist who ended up under the car, and she just stopped, then carried on - driving over his arm and dragging him down the street with his helmet under the rear axle. Fortunately, another driver cut her off to prevent her from killing the rider. He was actually OK.

I ran to the scene, and the woman was what I would describe as ""barely human"": she had no concept of what had just happened; no idea she'd just mowed down a motorcyclist and then dragged him 50 metres down a street. She simply said to me ""Oh, a motorcyclist"", but she said it in a way which meant ""Oh, just a silly motorcyclist then, nothing important.""

I wanted to punch the bitch in the face, but I simply said I would stay at the scene to ensure the police got an accurate description of her total incompetence, and I would be happy to be a witness at her trial, because she had no business ever operating a motor vehicle again. After that she shut up.

I didn't have to end up testifying, but the bitch lost her licences for 3 years, and was fined $4,000 + court costs.","1338510295"

The oil (or shortening more specifically) is at a high enough heat for it not to be an issue. Similarly, you notice most places do not have separate grills for meat and veggies, bread, etc.

  As far as fully cooked meats, you can ""cross contaminate.""  For example, I can cut a chicken wrap, then cut a burger dressed all the way with at most, a quick wipe of my knife.  There should not be enough bacteria remaining in the cooked chicken inside the wrap to make anyone sick, and if there is, the person with the wrap is definitely going to have problems, regardless of whether the residue of the chicken was transferred somewhere else. 

Contamination, on some level, is impossible to completely stop, which is why I mainly focussed on preventing dangerous contamination (raw chicken with anything cooked, for example)  ","1338510295"

I'm really glad I read your post. 

It does help to get things out. 

Here's what I think:

You should document all the visits that happen between your son and his biological father. You have sole custody and the biological father only uses one five hour visit per month when he is allotted two five hour visits per month. 

If he isn't using all his access time now, he will never be granted extra holiday time. I'm not sure how to get in front of a judge to finalize your plan to move to Canada, but you should be able to get a better deal than all holidays with the biological father. 

Is it more realistic to move to Canada than to a country in Europe? Have you ever been to that country in Europe? Do you speak the language there? Is your husband's family there?

It might be that British Columbia is a more viable option. If you put the cost of meeting with your son to have access to him on your ex, then he won't be able to afford it and he won't disrupt your family anyway. 

I know these problems are difficult and take a long time to solve. I think you should be able to get a good outcome for your family eventually. Please try to keep documentation of what happens in an organized file. 

Good luck. ","1338510304"

Also, they actually hit sexual maturity at an older age in the past as well.  Recent decades have seen a very fast drop in the age of puberty, so when they say 12 year old marrying, think more like the average 9 or 10 year old today.

Also important to note, there was far less to learn and there wasn't any real concept of childhood.  Life was harsh back then, so by 12, you knew far more about living and surviving than even 18 year olds know today.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I'm all for people pursuing the education they wish to pursue, but taxation is theft. There shouldn't be anything funded with tax money because there shouldn't be taxes.

The economic view is that taxes are always a negative on the economy. It means less money for people to have and to use, and tax revenue can only exist as a permanent consumption of a fraction of the economic pie. Lots of people try to justify taxes as ""a way to force people to put money to the most efficient use,"" but that's not true. If there were a 100% tax rate then employers would just be emperors of dominions, doing whatever they please because they reap no benefit or loss from their actions. No taxation means people have more money that can go to intended uses, *and* it means that people can learn quicker what is a right investment and what is a wrong investment. Imagine only having wages enough to buy groceries and gas, then suddenly you get a million dollars. You wouldn't know how to spend / conserve / invest the money beyond your gas and groceries as immediate needs.

There's also the idea of subsidization skewing market supply and demand, and there's plenty of literature on the subject, and this is the argument most people take against subsidies. Personally I like to strike at the root.

EDIT: I would really like to know why when I say ""there shouldn't be taxes"" that I get downvotes.","1338510310"

A single-shot variant might not be classified by the BATFE as an assault rifle, but their classifications aren't a catch-all, especially since those classifications are intended to direct the application of gun control laws rather than define the actual function and purpose of a weapon.","1338510310"

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Some details: this is an el-cheapo Kent tandem, which nevertheless works just fine (we rode a rented $1.5K Trek before, and this Kent is more comfortable, modulo shifting issues). 

We were biking in the Big Bend National Park; the road to the Balancing Rock was not accessible to vehicles without a 4-wheel drive, so the tandem was quite handy. The ride was about 4 miles one way on a gravel road, and the way back was uphill (about 100 m total). You can see the route on a satellite map [here](http://www.sports-tracker.com/#/workout/romwell/1b62dckadh30d8s1).

This would have been ultra-easy if not for the damn heat, uphill, gravel (mostly heat). The bottle holders came in handy. The turkey vultures (not shown) were circling above us for the last mile - all in vain :)

Third: As a society, we're just more okay with soda than with smoking. Soda doesn't piss off the non-soda drinkers in your vicinity, it doesn't make you smell bad, and its harmful effects are not as readily apparent.","1338510313"

"formula1","t5_2qimj","In early 2010 when Webber won a few races on the trot, he had a special braking style that enabled him to make better use of the EBD. Once they started ""improving"" it and tweaking it more to Vettel's liking in late 2010, and especially in 2011 with the OTBD and Pirelli tyres, the performance delta between the two increased markedly.


This year with no diffuser blowing of any kind (supposedly), they're back to being equal. The thing about Vettel though is that in 2011 he blitzed everyone. They all had OTBDs and arguably Red Bulls was the best, but I don't think an Alonso or a Hamilton in the second RB7 could have beaten Vettel that year. He was simply supreme in that car all year.


It gives me great pleasure to note that on most online forums I visit to discuss F1, the majority of outright Webber haters / Vettel lovers are very quiet so far this year... no more cries of ""Webber should retire"" and ""Vettel is easily the best driver in the field"" ... ha!

"wow","t5_2qio8","Spirit/Hit (until capped) &gt;&gt; Intellect &gt; Mastery &gt;= Haste &gt;&gt; Crit would be more correct.

[Mastery scales better than Haste with the 4set bonus from T13](http://i.imgur.com/96BTK.png). I ran that simulation just now. Mastery almost always comes out ahead unless you're super close to the ""softcap"" for Haste, which is at 2772 (2777 whichever it is) rating. It's true that they are incredibly close for some people though. 

Mastery pulls ahead if you have the Legendary too, which I don't. Sometimes I've seen Mastery go as high as ~2.6 DPS per point while Haste is at ~1.7, right now Mastery for me is worth ~2.35 and Haste is worth ~2.

Something else to point out is that Haste sees diminishing returns very quickly during Bloodlust and heavy burst phases where Mastery thrives. Haste might be better when you need steady DPS over short periods of time, but for burst, Mastery is better and for fights like SpineHC, Mastery is the way to go. It's the only way to go.

It depends a lot on the gear I suppose, as Haste does see more value in lower tier gear.

This isn't the biggest problem I have with AMR, far from it, the biggest problem I have with it is the hardcap problem me and [monsterfenrick have been discussing](http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/udtp3/how_to_use_askmrrobotcom_like_a_boss/c4ukg76).

Resolution has nothing to do with screen size whatsoever.  Resolution is simply the layout of addressable pixels it's got, period.  X-by-Y, same as a map grid.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","So, you would have *all* the merchants of the world, and *all* the buyers of the world consult and modify *one* blacklist? If I can't bribe my way off it, what mechanism prevents me, directly, or by proxy, from adding the names of my competitors to it? Who are the trustworthy merchants who run it? All of this is power. A small cabal entrusted to run such a vital service. And arbitration systems? A primitive court, missing certain safeguards.

The founding fathers believed they were getting squeezed to death by the British East India Company, and a hereditary British Aristocracy. They did design to avoid direct democracy, which has problems, yes. They went for the simplest scheme they could come up with, first-past-the-post, which has major problems too. Later mathematicians have some schemes that come closer to satisfying the Condercet Criterion (though fully satisfying it is a mathematical impossibility).

And yes, I imagine you're a 'libertarian', not a Nazi. Calling you as such based on your username was a fit of cattiness on my part. Godwin's Law. I lose. Please refrain from calling me a Communist, or a North Korean (I have been banned from /r/pyongyang/ after all). I actually want the removal of large chunks of government power as well. ESPECIALLY CORPORATIONS.

Money is power. It is Capital (machinery to make things), Land, and Labor. In the absence of any regulation upon its use, it becomes the de facto power of a country, if not in name. It is not unreasonable to imagine Archer Daniels Midland buying up all usable farmland in the U.S. That is control over the food supply. At that point, they could raise the price to whatever they wanted. 1 year of servitude per burger sound reasonable? If you're starving? Yes, it does sound reasonable. The key is small competition. Governments against consortiums, executive against legislative, etc. Enough confusion and churn to allow the average person to rise up, and get a decent size slice of the pie, a small mansion, a stack of cash, a great car, etc. Social mobility is critical, without it, no bright minds will stick around to work at anything interesting, for there is no profit to it.

Ironically, *slightly* higher tax rates increase social mobility. Weird, I know. You need to keep people from completely locking down niches, and having war chests to do your goods dumping and monopoly establishment.

Worth noting that while the 13"" Pro does have a lower res screen than the 13"" Air, it is a better *quality* screen. (Which is not to say the Air screen is bad, just not as good as the Pro.) You need to compare the two screens side-by-side. Check out res, colour and viewing angles, in particular.

I am just waiting on the next round of Macbook Air and Pro upgrades, due any week now. Hopefully the Pro will get a screen res bump to the same as the Air.","1338510336"

The Hornets didn't get screwed, the Lakers did. The Hornets got more in return from the Clippers than they would have from the Lakers. 

...

I'm not saying it couldn't happen.. just that the short term results which are not even close to significant mathematical anomalies shouldn't be considered ""evidence"". 

There were several teams that had a built in conspiracy theory story if they won the lottery. Charlotte, New Jersey, Cleveland, Sacramento all would have led to similar stories today. The odds of those 4 teams combined were probably larger than the Bobcats.. so the odds there would be conspiracy theory talk today was greater than 51%... before it even happened. 


Also worth noting, a lot of people were saying before the draft that the Bobcats were the one team that would possibly not go with Davis and either trade down to the #2/#3 pick or just take Kidd Gilchrist with the first pick. So them getting the #2 may not even be that important. ","1338510339"

"law","t5_2qh9k","&gt;How do you figure that? I would say the opposite. Look at the difficulty many communities have in removing bad teachers.

You need to flesh out that analogy a little more. What are the actual problems faced in removing teachers, and why is that situation analogous in a meaningful way to the judiciary system? I suspect that the difficulty in firing teachers has far more to do with unions than with the fact that they get paid by the state. Broad analogies such as this are almost never helpful to understanding a situation. Why not stick to talking about what we're actually talking about?

Anyway, my point is that public employees can be held more closely accountable to the people of a state than can employees of private companies. 

Also, now we're talking about ease of removal, rather than ability to control conflicts of interest. We've jumped tracks again. 

&gt;IMO a better oversight would be to have judges controlled by the community and not by the state. Each community would appoint judges by their own methodology 

You do realize that communities already select their own judges, right? It's very common for judges to be elected by popular vote in the community the serve.

&gt;Alternatively, the judge could remain a state employee, but the plaintiff would have to be a private attorney working at the behest of a victim.

This is a workable system, and is similar to the way things have worked in various countries at various times. I think the advantages it brings, however, have absolutely nothing to do with eliminating the state as a ""common employer"" of both judges and prosecutors. I think it could eliminate some of the problems that exist in our prosecutorial, rather than judiciary, systems. 

Also, I think you're forgetting that someone would have to pay this ""private prosecutor."" It certainly shouldn't be the victim, so that pretty much leaves the state. ","1338510340"

""Looking for four leaf clovers. I've never found one,"" she says.

""Oh? I find them all the time,"" I respond (which is, actually, somewhat true.)

""No you don't,"" she says.

""Yep, in fact, there is one right there,"" I say, and standing up, i reach down and pick a single Four Leaf Clover out of the whole clover patch.

Bissel addresses a common complaint with Max Payne 3. Narrative dissonance (or as in this article, ludonarrative dissonance) is an issue, especially for Rockstar, who tends to write very grounded stories and dialogue. 

I actually didn't experience this problem in Max Payne 3. Max Payne is constantly self-deprecating. His deep depression causes him to overstate his failures and understate his talents. Further, I think Max regrets that he's good at is killing people. Max's narration and inner monologue doesn't always match up with whats happening because his perspective is skewed. He can't see the events of the story clearly. But hey, that's just my personal theory. ","1338510353"

What I believe is not relevant, that is just a historical fact that the budget was cut.

* Good Grade 11 grades can be handy if you are looking at early admission.
* It's all about what you want to take. Look into the programs you want to be in at both universities and see which is more appealing. (their websites are a good place to start)
* For Eng you want to go to the U of M because it's the only place to get an Engineering degree in Manitoba recognized by the regulatory body(The pre med system is crazy so I'd ask around)
* U1 is a ""faculty"" at the U of M you start in the U1 faculty rather then just being in nothing before you get into a real faculty. For most programs you will need basic courses before you get to the meat of it. Written requirements etc. So you use that first year to finish those up. The nice thing is those courses can do towards a ton of diffident programs. I took all my first year Eng courses and I changed to comp sci and didn't waste much time because of the overlap.
*  Learn to meet deadlines without reminders and work on your own. Besides that just get good grades in your University prerequisites.

Here are my general instructions I have been giving people:


Please create a post in /r/loans and send me and a PM with a link to your post.  Once you PM me, I will send you my email address and I will request that you send me info on the loan you are requesting, the interest you plan on paying (if any), the time frame you plan on paying it back, and proof of ID (I usually request a photo of your ID, a photo of you holding your ID, and a photo of a utility bill with your name on it).  Also, in the email, send me a link to your request in /r/loans.  Sorry I know it's kind of annoying but I have been getting a lot of requests and I need to keep track of everyone.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Reallocation or allocation, the way you split contribution between funds in your account.  For example I have three fund in my Roth and want fund A to have 25% of contributions, B 25% and C 50%.  A few year later I want to change that make it 33%/33%/34%, that only changes where new contributions go, that is reallocation.  Balance mix is how much money is in each fund any given time. Say fund A went way down in value and maybe C went up, my balance mix is now 15%/20%/65%.  I don't want that so I rebalance. I sell shares of Fund C and buy shares of A &amp; B, when done I am now at 33%/33%/34% like I wanted.  Reallocate/rebalance only applies if you have more than one fund in your 401(k) or IRA.  If 100% of your money is in one fund and you want to keep that way then disregard this info.  For example you put it all in a target date fund, it supposedly has the mix you already want and you don't have to think about it.

Why not sell when the market is low? You lock in your loss. Take some nice round numbers, say I buy 100 shares of a fund(or stock) for $30 per share, that is $3,000 balance day 0.  In a few months the price drops to $20 a share, the balance is now $2,000.  You freak out sell it all and take your $2,000 and hide it under a mattress. Some time passes and the share price goes back up to $35 and you decide to get back in since this fund isn't so bad after all.  Your $2000 now buys 57 shares @ $35.  Say 10 years from now you retire and want to cash out and the share price is now $45.  So your balance is 57 shares x $45 = $2,565.  Now compare that to $4,500  (100 shares x $45) if you had keep in the fund thru the price drop.  You pull your money out because you ""lost"" $1000 when the share price dropped, but that is an unreallized loss unless you cashout then.  If you had stayed in you could have gained $1,500.  The point is you didn't loss actual money only fund value which means nothing short term.  The only thing that matters is price at buy and price at sell.

If anyone else has better explanation for either concept feel free to chime in.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","No, man. The RMAH was not something that came from a vacuum. Diablo 2 effectively had no economy, because of all the cheating and hacking and item/gold farming that went on. The game's economy was fuckin' broken.

Because gold farmers exist (and they exist because demand existed, they didn't spring from nothing) Blizzard took steps to keep its IP under its control.

Do you know how many support requests they probably got from people who's duped items disappeared, who bought items with real money that never showed up, who were hacked as a result of dealing with shady third parties, etc? A metric fuckload.

The RMAH makes sense. Diablo's AH also =/= WoW's auction house. Diablo is not WoW! Very few things in WoW make sense in Diablo.

This wasn't something that was masterminded in a conference at ActiBlizz HQ to suck money out of the population. Demand for real-money transactions is exists, and is quite high. Blizzard/Activision would have been remiss if they didn't take steps to bring that aspect of the game under their control.

These things don't happen for no reason. The community of a game has a huge effect on the way that game develops. And by 'community' I don't mean thousands of fourteen-year-olds bitching on the b.net forums, I mean hundreds of thousands of people using 'black-market' third-party real-money marketplaces and then bitching to Blizzard about it when they get fucked in the ass.","1338510367"

I'm still leery of the application of hate crime legislation, but the motivation makes much more sense now:
&gt;Part of criminal law is promulgation and articulation of community values and creations of regulations that favor social coherence and the orderly, smooth operation of society. 

&gt;Hate crime laws do not punish the way people think. They recognize what we as a community consider a particularly heinous brand of violent crime, harassment, or vandalism/destruction of property. Hate crimes have a different impact on their victims than mere assault, etc. For instance, if someone sets a trash bin in a black neighborhood on fire, that carries a very different message and threat than if a burning cross is set up.

&gt;Because the harm of prejudice-motivated crimes carries a greater impact, and inherently turns on differences between social groups, hate crimes are also more divisive than your average crime. Acts which are particularly divisive stand as more of a threat to an orderly and co-operative society.","1338510371"

The only ""day-time"" hostile mobs we have are angry dogs. I think that if Mojang is to add a hostile mob, it should be an existing animal this time, and live in the daytime and night. **Bears** or **sharks** would be neat. Or bearsharks.

Personally, I think that we don't really need another hostile mob. We need some ""decorative"" mobs; mobs that maybe are small and don't drop anything of importance but will add atmosphere to the game.

This might include **fish** in large bodies of water. Another is **songbirds**, possibly some that actually create chirps occasionally (too often would be annoying). I think maybe **monkeys** for jungle biomes would be neat. The monkeys could even harvest coco beans or be able to climb free-standing vines. Another decorative mob in mind is **lightning bugs**.

Scope out those dimly lit tables against the wall! Yes, that means you still have to go to said annoying club, but there may be hidden opportunities that could be worth checking out - just once. And maybe go with one of the people you can tolerate the most, so the experience isn't doomed from the start. (Extremely optimistic viewpoint, I know - but it *could* happen!)

Also, I'd actually recommend putting the baby bird back where you found it. It looks like a fledgeling. There are tons of fledgelings being picked up by well-meaning humans around this time of year. What most people don't know is that the baby bird's parents feed it on the ground as it flaps its wings and learns how to fly. If you can't put it back, I'd recommend calling Animal Services or your nearest wildlife rescue. In most states it's illegal to handle or keep wild bird species. Doves are also notoriously difficult to keep alive. They're very fragile and have thinner skin than most other baby birds, and it's easy to puncture the insides of their mouths or throats while you're feeding them if you're not experienced.","1338510377"

The only alternative to those plants is to either extract the plants yourself, or use this [website, Flowing Visions,](http://flowingvisions.ecrater.com/c/1168679/harmala-extracts) which is the only place I have ever been able to find that sells harmala extracts for an acceptable price (the other places offering them are chemical supply houses and it is ridiculously expensive).

At the moment it looks like he doesn't have more than 200 mgs harmine available (harmine is the one you want), which is about one does, maybe a bit less depending on your body chemistry (300 mgs would be enough for anyone for sure).

You can keep checking back and eventually he will have grams of harmine available for about 15 dollars. It may take about 2 weeks for your product to actually arrive though (all my orders in the past have indeed eventually showed up, FWIW).

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Sure they all talk about the Trail of Tears and how slavery was bad and whatnot, but it still is all in a very Euro-centric manner and much is simply not stated, completely changed, or merely opinion. For instance, they won't say that more people lived in North America than Europe by far, that they lived in structured societies, had large cities and established large trade routes. Instead they focus on plains Indians, and forget to mention that that culture never existed prior to the expansion of Europeans onto the American continents as they were pushed off their property. They say that the Native Americans didn't have a sense of property, so they just gave away their land for some pots and beads. They barely touch on the exchanges between Native Americans and Europeans. They tell about how Europeans brought all this enlightenment over to the Americas, but not about everything brought back over to Europe. Those are just a couple examples from a certain time period. Much more where that came from... 

That being said, we shouldn't walk about being guilty about how awful white people are. That's just stupid. We weren't the ones who did it, no point in feeling bad about it now.

Go read ""Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong"". It's a great book. I'm studying to eventually teach history myself and was rather skeptical at first too, so I decided to go back and actually read through the textbooks that our school uses and it's absolutely true.

Unfortunately, HOA's have managed to get decent footholds in some areas, and there's no way to opt out short of not buying the house.

I will say, though, that I've heard some (few) good things about them; they tend to bargain with landscaping companies, so people get their yards cared for at a discount, for example.

If you have the extra memory, windows will take more of it as future-proofing performance, and programs will also reserve more memory.

If you have more memory available, it's less proactive at clearing memory, why clean up that gig that was in use if you have five more to spare?

Personally I think my system uses more than average because of how I use it. I might be watching a movie, with firefox up, while playing elona, and handbrake doing some encoding in the background. If you're using your computer in a more normal way, no point going over 8 gigs, and 4 would be enough for sure.

I come from a pretty shitty part of town. As in, ""I've-seen-multiple-meth-labs-explode"" shitty. My family barely has the money to scrape by. I'm literally amazed when I go to a friend's house who comes from even middle-class money and see how nice they live, because I'm so used to being crammed into a tiny duplex that an actual two-story house seems luxurious to me.

And you know what? We're not fucking poor because we're ""imbeciles"". We're poor because my father was disabled in the line of work, but never got any compensation from the company because they had better lawyers. We're poor because a nursing home doesn't pay that much, but my mother loves taking care of her residents. We're poor because I can't afford a car, cutting me off from many jobs that require a car.

Yes, we're poor. But you know what we're not? We're not fucking imbeciles. My father can fix a piece of machinery better than anyone I know. He's an amazing chef, and has recently become a very knowledgeable gardener. My mother remembers the names and preferences and ailments of dozens of residents, and cares for more people every day than you probably will in your life. Me and my sister are attending a university for engineering and medical degrees. So no. We are not fucking imbeciles.

Neither are my friends, my family, or most of my neighbors. We're people. People trying to get by, in a world that's, intentionally or not, set up to make it very difficult for us to succeed.

Our new director and I drove to these meetings every few weeks. In this time I explained some flaws we had in our current model of business. As a result of this direct feedback, three AVP positions were opened, and I was promoted to AVP 2 years after starting there. Really a positive experience as the average tenure in my staff (I manage 4 people) is 15 years.

Until Americans are smart enough to realize that the GOP has aggressively attacked the middle class since the early 80s (feel free to google specifics, truth and facts about how busting unions and the lack of wealth in the middle class go hand in hand and how all the money saved from busting unions goes straight to the top), the middle class will always be an endangered species. 

But then again, a country that is incapable of standing up for itself, a country of poor people who vehemently back the rich politicians who are only protecting their own...a nation of people too ignorant to vote out the real crooks....they deserve nothing better, do they?

Americans get the government they deserve. It's that simple. It's much harder to be intelligent and informed than it is to be an ignorant follower who does what Fox News tells you to do.

In the end, as the middle class withers away, they have themselves to blame and that's got to burn a little bit. All of the wealthy siphoned away from them, all of the misery that comes with losing your home to a high medical bill....very much the direct result of the middle class being stupid enough to buy into the demonization of unions from the right.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","Firstly, we need to clear up how a program is compiled and then linked with its libraries. There's two ways this can happen - static linking and dynamic linking. Let's deal with static linking first.

When you utilize a library (assuming it isn't something that is a header only library), the code must reside somewhere. When you start writing (compiled) programs, this is pretty much always an executable file. However, libraries aren't (necessarily) made to be executable. Instead, they are compiled into a .lib or .a (or equivalent). This contains compiled, executable code. When statically linking, this is basically all ""added"" to the executable file by the linker. Thus all the code is bundled into the executable, and consequently, the executable size reflects this.

Now, with a DLL (Dynamic Link Library), this code is not bundled into the executable when it is linked (Note that the code in a DLL is already compiled, just like a static library).

Now things get slightly more complicated. When utilizing a DLL, whether it exists or not can be checked before the program is run (which is why sometimes you'll see a ""cannot start this program : cannot find some dll file""). However, this can also be delayed right up until the code is required (run-time dynamic linking). Instead of checking for the DLL at start time, it will only go looking for it when it is explicitly needed. If it isn't there, whoops, program falls over. Now, all of this is obviously slower than static linking, so why does anyone do it? A few reasons:

- Managable executable size. Imagine if you used a massive library and had to statically link the entire thing; especially if you were using operating system DLLs, you'd essentially be redistributing stuff which was already on everyone's system.
- Recompilation and relinking: when a newer version of some library comes out, if you were statically linking against it, everything would have to be recompiled and relinked into a new executable. With a DLL, you can simply ""drop in"" the new DLL, assuming it conforms to the same interface as previously, and voila, your code will now be using an updated version of the library.

So, that's all a long winded bunch of stuff about DLLs. We can answer your questions now:

A DLL is just a library. It can contain code for doing anything. I could build a DLL with some code like:

    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }

Which I could then distribute to you. It'd be silly in this case because there's so little code, but in principle, there's nothing stopping me from doing this.

Things in a DLL are already compiled into machine language.

If this is all very confusing, just remember, a DLL is just a library of code (and possibly data/resources). It contains executable code, just like an EXE.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;I would think most people that like the idea of a government running their lives (e.g. government healthcare) should trust that the government is doing the right thing by not throwing money at the problem.

1. Have you looked at the US and health care? I know most European nations are different, but that's because of momentum. The same way that Americans are fiercely protective of existing programs like Social Security or Medicare. Good luck getting rid of those. It's political suicide. Summed up best by a Tea Partier's poster at a rally ""Keep your government hands off my Medicare."" Those people are too fucking stupid to know what they believe.

2. Global warming solutions almost always go to economics. People might want the government to handle certain things, but they don't want to be told that they have to buy only green products, or that the fossil fuel industries are going to be killed off because they are harming the planet. Do you know how many jobs that would affect? Or even simple caps on carbon would be a big deal. It's not hard to imagine why developing countries would hate the shit out of all that.

If you're into the whole 60's punk thing, you should find ""Scream Loud! The Fenton Story"" it's Michigan garage that murders.

Israel's economy is in better shape than our own and it is a highly developed nation.. yet we give it more foreign aid than any other country.

Israel would not legally be allowed to receive this money from the U.S.by U.S. law if we officially addressed and recognized Israel's illegal nuclear program.

If your main problem is that you aren't very deep then I suspect you might be out of luck. Just make sure he's curling his fingers as he enters you.

God, I would LOVE to see Pudge and Alaska and the Colonel brought to life on the big screen, but I feel like having to take the story out of a first-person perspective would lose so much of the story. And I can't imagine any actress who could ever portray Alaska as vibrantly as John Green did. I'm not going to lie, I think that the Career Day scene would have me in tears of laughter and other scenes would have me in tears from other things. I'd wait at the midnight premiere and everything. Done right, his book could be incredible as a movie.

And for that matter- all of his work. The Fault in our Stars would make a particularly beautiful movie, and it's very easy to see some of the scenes in the novel as scenes in a movie. But that's the trouble with adapting books to movies: everyone sees those little snapshots in their head differently, and there's no way to please every single nerdfighter out there. 

For what it's worth, I think either Alaska or Margo Roth Spiegelman (Paper Towns) would be an incredible part to play. They're so human and so whole, yet they're just dreamy enough to make them seem almost surreal. ","1338510433"

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","In a world of giant spirit pandas, face-stealing creatures and the manipulation of the elements that essentially compose the planet, it's fair to suspend disbelief.

But I had an idea that just hit me: what if Amon and Korra are tied spiritually through Aang and Ozai? Korra might be completely unable to utilize Airbending to its fullest because Ozai's grandson/whatever is able to tap into that Avatar energy that Korra, as Avatar, is supposed to have access to, meaning that Amon's access to that energy means Korra doesn't have access to it to the point where she can fully utilize it? Kind of like Netflix: you can only have one instance of it up in a browser, and the other tab in the browser just won't load.

Last few episodes of *TLA*, the energybending thing happened. We saw Ozai vs Aang, the red and the blue energy, which signified their internal energy flows. Well, Ozai damn near consumed Aang, remember? What if that interaction was akin to breaking a spiritual dam that separates normal Benders from the Avatar(s)? Think of it as regular Benders pulling spiritual energy from their respective sources, and the Avatar has access to his/her own special, different reserves that 'power' their bending. What if Ozai retained the ability to tap into that Avatar pool?","1338510443"

Also, it seems (at least from that article) that Ford is developing that engine for mostly performance concerns. The article mentions noise once, and mostly as an aside. It spends most of the time talking about reducing weight and increasing turbo charger performance.

So...yes, she can play as nice and friendly as she wants, and shake her head and *tsk* at her fellow believers. And it means little, if nothing at all, since she still takes her fucking marching orders from the invisible man in the sky.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Wow, come on man.  Rondo had the game of his life, but you really think he is a HOFer already?  These are the types of things that strengthen my thoughts on Rondo being very overrated. I wont deny he had a phenomenal game yesterday, and overall is a great PG, but I think the Celtics are the perfect fit for him and so he is maximizing his potential. He is a pass-first PG with a broke jumper.  Yes he is a great rebounding guard with a knack for the ball on defense, but he still has major flaws that other elite PGs don't have.  People seem to forget that Rondo was given wide open 15-footers all game because he usually struggles or won't even attempt them.    That was the Heat's game-plan, but he just happened to be able to make them for once.  

He also has three hall of famers to pass to, which is a huge reason why he is able to put up such crazy assist numbers.  Rondo is a great point guard, but I wouldn't even put him in my top 5 PGs.  In my opinion he is behind Rose, CP3, Parker, DWill, and Westbrook.  Hell, I'd take the young and promising Irving over Rondo.  Rondo is a great, pass-first PG without a legitimate jumper, so without the right pieces around him he is an extremely limited player.  If you put him on any subpar team in the league right now, would he really make that big of a difference?  I don't think he would but I'm open to arguments as to why you think he would.","1338510456"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","ACTUALLY,

I come from a pretty shitty part of town. As in, ""I've-seen-multiple-meth-labs-explode"" shitty. My family barely has the money to scrape by. I'm literally amazed when I go to a friend's house who comes from even middle-class money and see how nice they live, because I'm so used to being crammed into a tiny duplex that an actual two-story house seems luxurious to me.

And you know what? We're not fucking poor because we're ""imbeciles"". We're poor because my father was disabled in the line of work, but never got any compensation from the company because they had better lawyers. We're poor because a nursing home doesn't pay that much, but my mother loves taking care of her residents. We're poor because I can't afford a car, cutting me off from many jobs that require a car.

Yes, we're poor. But you know what we're not? We're not fucking imbeciles. My father can fix a piece of machinery better than anyone I know. He's an amazing chef, and has recently become a very knowledgeable gardener. My mother remembers the names and preferences and ailments of dozens of residents, and cares for more people every day than you probably will in your life. Me and my sister are attending a university for engineering and medical degrees. So no. We are not fucking imbeciles.

Neither are my friends, my family, or most of my neighbors. We're people. People trying to get by, in a world that's, intentionally or not, set up to make it very difficult for us to succeed. So before you start generalizing and judging and spewing classist bullshit, how about you think about the fact that these are actual PEOPLE, with lives and histories that you DON'T FUCKING KNOW, and stow your fucking judgement.","1338510458"

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","The big decision is what type of area you want. Beaverton is the closest thing to a stereotypical suburb that we have in the Portland area. That means lots of soccer moms in subdivisions with no character and strip malls galore, but very little crime in all but the worst areas. Ironically, Beaverton has the best bike infrastructure around, IMO, but everything is far away and driving is almost a necessity and there are a lot of anti-bike residents. If you are attracted to area for the quirky, ""Keep Portland Weird"" mentality, Beaverton is farthest you can get from that in the area. East Portland if you can afford it or NE if not is a better bet if that is what you are looking for.

Assuming you end up deciding on Beaverton, I can say having lived there for probably 30 years of my life that I don't have a thing to add to the post I replied to. In particular, that map is gold when looking for a good area to live within Beaverton.","1338510458"

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Male here:

First, there's nothing wrong with being sexually independent, and social stigma's notwithstanding, I applaud you for wanting to experience and explore your sexuality.

That said, there's a couple of things you need to understand: 

About flirting: When is comes to flirting, there are two types of people: Cats and mice. Don't be afraid to be the CAT. There is nothing wrong with approaching an attractive guy and sparking a conversation and/or asking/offering a number. Most men find this VERY attractive. The bonus is it puts you in a position to be the ""Rule Maker"" so to speak, or set the relationship standards. ""I know I may have come one a little strong, but I want you to know I'm really interested in getting to know you and seeing if I can feel comfortable with you. I may not be in a ""relationship"" frame of mind at the moment, but a girl has needs, and I'm curious to see if you're someone I can satisfy those needs with.""

This will let a guy know where you stand and what the standards are, and what to expect.

Next, as it relates to your small community: I have always believed that a slut is a woman who can't keep her mouth shut, not her legs. You can sleep with a hundred men, but if no one knows who and what you're doing, they will never be able to call you anything other than ""friendly"". That said, fishing in small ponds is a good way to earn a reputation, as most of the fish may swim in the same schools. I would suggest widening your social circles, venturing outside town limits, and meeting people outside your area. This lowers the odds of you running into friends or buddies who may want to compare notes.

In addition, dating is sometimes the best foreplay, and even if it's not going to lead to the alter, there's nothing wrong with dinner and a show, or drinks at a bar, or even a cup of coffee at a coffeehouse. Everything doesn't have to be ""Wanna come over and fuck?"", and it's a great way to find out if you can in fact feel comfortable with someone you may want to sleep with.

Finally, as far as learning HOW to flirt and be seductive, I have some literature about seductive women, and I'd suggest watching some movies featuring seductive characters; almost anything with Angelina Jolie comes to mind; but the most important thing to remember is the definition of Seduction: Getting someone to do what you want them to do, and making them think it was their idea!

Best of luck.","1338510465"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I saw something semi-similar the other day at Wal-Mart. This girl about the age of 17 was using one of the motorized carts, with her friend standing on the back of it and riding it. I didn't see a cast, or anything to insinuate an injury. An elderly couple was leaving the store, and the woman said to the girl, ""Shouldn't you be walking instead of using a cart that someone could actually need?"" The girl responded in a rude, ""I hurt my leg today and can't walk well."" The older woman retorted with a, ""Uh huh, sure,"" and left with her husband.

I laughed and watched the girl give the older woman a look, and I waited for her to say something. She didn't, and continued to use the cart with her friend laughing hanging on to the back of it. Honestly, it sickens me to know that teens these days speak to people rudely and use things that they don't need because they are lazy. This teen wasn't overweight or anything. Perfectly normal girl, except for the fact that she had a fucking mouth on her. I'm 26, and when I was a teen, my friends and I were never rude like that, and we certainly weren't that fucking stupid to use a motorized cart when we didn't need to.

That being said, if the woman in your comic was really overweight, chances are walking around the store would have probably put her in a real bind in regards to breathing. Certainly not advocating her using it if her walking would have been no problem, but you just never know.","1338510467"

I decided to try and mimic Neo by flailing my arms backwards in slow motion. In doing so, my lefthand blocked a football that was thrown from across the playground without looking.

What I am saying is that these little differences make a big impact on people lives -- on the lives of gay citizens, on the lives of the uninsured, the lives of the poor, on those who work in exploitative conditions.  I *did not* say that one should be complacent.  One would have to consider our collective lot in life to be pretty hopeless to come to the conclusion that our dominant political parties were despotic and that nothing should be done about it.

Social, political, and cultural changes do not come from the ballot boxes alone: we've got to attempt to create alternative institutions, engender a culture of solidarity, of commitment, human dignity and truth-seeking through our thoughts and actions.  Maybe I'm living in my head too much and our situation is hopeless.  But that's not to say we shouldn't try to move forward, albeit cautiously.  I don't, however, think that these problems will simply be solved by dealing with the bourgeoisie, as a Marxist would call them.  I think they also go deeper into other areas.  What I mean is that I do not accept economic determinism.

Also, I appreciate your patronizing tone, you arrogant dick.  (Although I apologize for not having expressed myself clearly last night.)  I am aware (perhaps not adequately) of the larger picture.

Having a frank conversation about children should not disrupt the happiness of a relationship.  If it does, you should really evaluate whether your relationship is strong enough to sustain children.  Part of being in a committed relationship is being able to talk about things that may be uncomfortable/embarrassing/painful.

IMO, you are thinking about this in a sensible way, and that this is a real issue that needs to be addressed.  You should approach this discussion the way you wrote this post: he's an awesome guy, you love being with him, you think your relationship is great, but you want to have kids in the future and want to know his feelings about it (don't turn it into an ultimatum, just ask him how he feels).  Then you have to decide for yourself if you want to be a part of that.  Consider the flip side of what you said: *not* getting married and *not* having kids can also breed resentment in someone who wanted that.

FWIW, I know many guys (straight and gay) that have known by their early 20's that they wanted kids.","1338510470"

"Python","t5_2qh0y","You know the reason that Kickstarter has a deadline rather than indefinite funding is to speed things up, not make people desperate.  The reason that there is a funding deadline is because *you get your money back* if they reach the funding deadline without raising the amount that they asked for.  This is a good thing, designed to ameliorate the fears of 'investors' who might think that their money will disappear down some dark hole if they give but not enough money is given to actually finish the project.

A kickstarter project which promises to deliver additional functionality if they receive additional funding beyond their original request isn't extorting anyone.  Some kickstarter projects receive double or tripple their funding request, and it is very generous for this project to commit to do something specific with that additional money, should it arrive, rather than just taking it without doing any extra work.

www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android

This project received ten million dollars in funding when they initially requested only one hundred thousand or 1% of the final funding total.  Did they commit to doing anything extra with the additional 9 million 9 hundred thousand dollars?

"Diablo","t5_2qore","I got to Act II of Hell with a barbarian (my first character) before I realized firsthand that my vision of what the class could do was rendered impractical by the later difficulties, IE., I had no choice but to gear for armor, resists, vitality, block chance, etc., and use health recovering and/or armor boosting skills more often than damaging skills.  I wanted to rip through enemies!  I mean, I put in my years as a maintank in WoW and I quit that game for this one because I had high dreams of not being pigeonholed so badly.  I was dead wrong.  The only offensive thing I use that isn't a cooldown is on leftclick, wtf!

Anyway, instead I'm leveling all the other classes slowly. I'm saving monk for last, in case it's more or less a faster barbarian. I leveled a demon hunter to 30 and it was alright, but it doesn't quite have the destructive feel that my level 16 wizard has.  I only got to level 9 with the witch doctor because I'm not sure I ""get"" the appeal.  He played like a very clunky necromancer.

Edit:  To answer your question, the monk is definitely the fastest attacking class and also the class that benefits most from faster attack on gear.  Although in the meta sense, it seems to me that really good wizards require the fastest clicking in regards to kiting.","1338510481"

You may have been born to Muslim parents, but had you been separated from them at birth and been brought up by non-religious people, you wouldn't be a Muslim. 99% of the time, people assume the religion of their parents. Note that this is also a terrible reason for assuming that your religion (whatever it might be) is the correct one, since it's merely an accident of birth. 

Back to your post, you need to do some research. One of the reasons you're going to encounter hostility with this approach is that you seem blissfully unaware of the penalty that your faith prescribes for those who leave it. The death penalty is the ultimate insult ... far worse than any pushback you'll receive from ex-Muslims. 

Given the potential consequences for apostasy, I don't know of a single person who took the decision to leave Islam lightly. It's a very, very serious decision and one that's never motivated by something as trivial as wanting to appear different or to insult believers. Again, you need to do some research, as your intuition on this issue is not accurate. ","1338510489"

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","That's not entirely true. Conservative Judaism does not hold that the law can not be changed *at all*. Not in the slightest, and interestingly enough, it's the opposite stance on tradition that lead to the way they are. They believe that halakha is binding, the tradition around those halakha may not be. They believe that rulings are still up for grabs. They do today, what the Orthodox will be doing when they agree on a Sanhedrin. Orthodox Judaism will not overrule an enactment without a valid Sanhedrin. Conservatives will. Mainstream Orthodox Judaism has a form of Res Judicata where the tradition becomes halakha and can not be changed absent a very good reason why it should not. Conservative Judaism does not give such a strong power to the tradition and will regularly reconsider minhagim. In the Conservative's eyes, they are still doing legitimate halakhic analysis and accurately practicing G-d's law. They have thus far not held invalid an issur d'oraita. It's impossible while still claiming halakhic legitimacy. This is a drastic departure from what the Conservative movement has been doing thus far.","1338510491"

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","&gt;Sure, fair. At the same time, that means that 25%, not 10%, of WoW's paying subscribers have agreed to pay for another year.

The people who still play are into WoW big time, that number doesn't surprise me at all. I've been there and done that and it's not my cup of tea anymore but each to their own.

&gt;That accounts for some of the instability, maybe. It does not account for all of the ways in which the AH itself is just baseline terrible. Examples include the lack of comparison tooltips with recommended items, the inability to sort recommended items, the lack of direct comparisons on tooltips in search results (you know, like how when you're in the game it'll tell you the effect an item would have on your DPS and your health?), the fact that some but not all commodity searches default to a quantity of ""1"" (meaning you can just click ""search""), the fact that some but not all parts of the AH UI allow you to hit ""enter"" to submit - while other parts allow ""enter"" to bring up the chat (definitely accidentally gave away some items for near-free trying to respond to a friend in chat, this way!), the fact that the sell tab resets if you switch to a different tab, the fact that you can't see the stats on your gear if it needs to be repaired, the fact that the ""legendary or set item"" box isn't a search box but rather requires you to select one item at a time, the fact that you can't search for stats on gear while using said box.... the list goes on and on and on. These are not stress-testing problems; these are ""we didn't spend enough time on the AH to make sure it was actually good"" problems.

I'm not defending the quality of the GAH, there most definitely are some quality of life issues that need to be addressed with the AH. I'm saying the bugs I can set aside for the time being.

&gt;By ""hacking"", I mean ""of accounts"", not ""of the game"". Grey-market RMT sites are the #1 source of hacked accounts in WoW, for example - and vice-versa: those hacked accounts are in turn the #1 source of the things the RMT sites sell.

Those are things outside of blizzard control. Those are all ""user error"".

&gt;It's interesting that you'd claim that ""it's only acceptable for the producer of a product to directly profit from it"", too, when the RMAH allows players to directly profit from the things they sell, in monetary terms. Or rather, it will, if it ever goes live.

You misconstrued my comment there, I should have been more clear. I'm saying it's silly that services of this nature were ""taboo"" previously games should have been doing stuff like this long ago. There are always going to be people who would prefer to pay money to avoid the grind and no amount of whining and complaining about it from developer's is going to stop it. It's better this way as it's all ""above board"" and the developers get an additional revenue stream that is totally optional to the players. 


Having said that however I strongly feel the loot system was designed around maximizing revenues from the RMAH and that's crappy. You either have to be poor or have entirely to much time on your hands to want to run the same dungeon 200 times to get that .05% chance of something dropping that special loot. I'm 41 years old and if my money was that tight I'd rather offer to cut my neighbor's yard and deposit my pay from that and buy the damned item then farm the imprisoned angel quest 200 times.

The important thing to think of is:  what will I do if it DOESN'T work?  You need a contingency plan for that.  Generally, experienced people find that getting your BM camp operation as simple as possible yields the best results.  For instance, many experienced participants have long since ditched evap ponds for waste water and just pump it out/store it in bottles to be dumped off playa.  Much cleaner and you don't have to worry all week about such things.

Likewise it might be easier to just bring a mixture of rechargable and disposable batteries for all your camp lights and such, and then rely on ice in the cooler.  You should focus on getting your refrigeration needs down as low as possible.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I think you're confused here because you're riding the supply curve when you talk about costs, specifically at a marginal level. Firms will produce additional output as long as the cost of producing an extra unit of output is less than the price they will receive. Both the demand and supply curves occupy the price/quantity-sold space , but the supply curve and where it interacts with the demand curve is a function of marginal costs. 

The price level is determined by the intersection of demand and supply. Of course the two curves can find new equilibrium price levels, but only if there is a change in the shape or a shift in the location of one or both of the curves. A simple example is the computer revolution, where we see marginal costs falling and thus the supply curve shifting to the right. Even with the shape and position of the demand curve remaining constant, we'd still predict a lower price level and higher quantity sold. ","1338510518"

Now Gaikai is looking far more promising, I am starting to seriously worry about OnLive's future. Where is their PR? Why aren't they advertising on TV and securing deals for more recent games than relying on Batman and Assassin's Creed? 

On one hand it seems like they failed to win over the publishers, but if Gaikai can do it what is stopping OnLive? With the news of the Samsung Gaikai TV, OnLive need to pull something out of the bag pronto if they want to avoid falling by the wayside. 

Then again, I expect this is sometimes how it pans out. A startup gets the wheels in motion but someone else improves on the concept and delivers a better implemented version that is more successful. That is the joy of competition. It is just a shame to see such a opportunity created and then squandered within such a short space of time.","1338510523"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","The reason the Greeks had no need to practise forming up was that phalanx warfare was typically employed in domestic battles (Greek Polis vs Greek Polis). There was an accepted moral code amongst the Greeks that each side would let the other form up their phalanx before begining battle. It's an incredible thing to think, that moments before people were to march to their death, that they would allow their enemy to maximise their strength, but it happened.

Another reason why drilling was never introduced was that Greek cities simply did not maintain standing armies. Those who made up the phalanx were the wealthy men of society, the only time they were obliged to come together was in times of war. A merchant trying to go about his business is not about to drop everything, suit up in his armour, and head out to the field for a few hours everyday to practise forming up. It just wasn't practicle until the concept of standing armies came about.","1338510524"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Start by understanding that religious people are not stupid. 

If you think that the correct way to argue against faith is by throwing facts at it, you don't understand faith. Faith implies that no facts are required to believe a thing. Learn to understand faith and religion before you try to argue against it. You don't explain a math problem by using color theory. You don't counter faith by trying to undermine it with factual corrections.

Taking something on faith does not make a person stupid. We all take things on faith continually. Our entire perception of the universe is just an accumulation of lies and half truths concocted by our brain. We are all full of comfortable little lies we like to believe.

When facts don't prevail against religion, it doesn't mean your facts are insufficient. It means you fail to understand religion. Try studying some philosophy, theology or even anthropology instead of just regurgitating arguments.","1338510525"

My naive understanding is that the Talmud mentioned 613 commandments from the Torah, one negative commandment for each day of the year (365) and one positive commandment for each bone and vital organ (248). However, since they didn't take the time to list them out, more ""modern"" Rabbis (i.e. Maimonides in the 12th century) had to scour the Torah searching for positive and negative commandments that would add up to these numbers.

It was basically a constant struggle. We know their were probably no stashes because there simply was very little coinage around that time. As for antiquity, I do know that Athens had a huge silver mine close by when they were at their height so I would imagine that the wealthy had a cut of that but this is speculation. The Greeks sent a lot of coin East for exotic goods like spices and silks and didn't have much to trade back.

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","&gt; Spoiled it(You suck by the way)

A spoiled vote expresses the dissatisfaction/dissention of the registered voter with the electoral candidates on the poll or the constitutional referendum choices being voted on. There are some countries who do not give out the tally of the spoiled vote nor the percentage voter tally of the voting populace. In Ireland they *are* counted and announced as part of the total vote tally, which is something I admire about the Irish PR system.

The spoiled vote is a means of people who respect their right and democratic opportunity granted to them by their country's democratic constitution to vote to show their displeasure at the choices offered them.

The spoiled vote (when it's tallied gives a figure for the dissatisfied and the ""don't knows"" who want to exercise the hard won right to vote in a democratic election.

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","  Hello my name is Kevin so basically I've decided to share with you one of my most grueling childhood stories that has happened to me. This happened 7 years ago and I am currently 15 and in high school. I use to go to this noodle shop that sold these Vietnamese noodle bowls called Pho. I loved Pho especially its soup and how it has the essence of lemon combined with what I cant express but I have one word that should show how great it tasted like. It tasted like RAINBOWS... So basically I've decided on that day to go to the shop to eat its Pho once a week. Each bowl costed about 3.50 for a large one so it was also cheap. There was also this girl at the shop who usually was the first one to my table to ask me what I would be having today. She was about my age. After a while the shops workers told me that she was the manager's daughter and that she was working there to start her allowance. The restaurant was the size of one of those haircut places. And usually I was the only one there. They treated me with free soda and free refills because I went there every week leaving them with a huge tip. I've repeated this for 3 years. I went there so much that they even dropped the price to 1.50 just for me. The girl also started to send me messages that she ""liked me"" for example is that she started to leave early just to follow me and to talk to me on the walk back to my home. But then everything changed when I stopped going there. I had moved to a different county thus meaning changing schools and meaning I had to also stop going to the shop. They started sending me coupons in the mail box. I don't even know how they even got my new address. The only personal information I gave the people who worked there were my phone number and email. The coupons then started to turn into little letters begging me to go back. So I asked my parents if I could go but they said no because it was ""Too Far Away"" and that they were ""Afraid I Would Get Kidnapped"". After a few days my parents asked the mail man to not give us mail from the shops address. But the I've started to notice that when I was sleeping the smell of the Pho and even the taste would fill up my whole entire room scaring my ass off. Its been years from that day and now I'm 15 and in high school. The events still happen but have been happening much more lately now. There have also been my cravings for the Pho and even the hallucinations. I'll give NoSleep and update tomorrow on what happens. If you know whats happening please I beg you tell me!

"photoshop","t5_2qhcb","Not sure if this is exact, but I'll go ahead anyways:

Step 1: cut out the girl/guy. This is annoying, but is a necessary photoshop skill. You can use the magnetic lasso, eraser or pen tool.

Step 2: go online and find a paper texture and a set of spatter brushes. This will introduce you to the wealth of free PS resources on the web. Take advantage.

Step 3: While we're on the topic of free online resources, check out sites like dafont.com. Nearly all the fonts are free, and you'll find what you need most of the time. I found the font Tertre after a minute of digging, it should do.

Step 4: Create a blank photoshop doc and drag in your paper texture. Click cmd+shift+U to desaturate it.

Step 5: Make a new layer and fill it with a radial gradient, with black on the edges and white in the middle. Set the blend mode of the layer to overlay.

Step 6: Make another layer. Use your new spatter brushes and make artful black splotches. Set the opacity to 50% and the blend mode to overlay.

Step 7: Make a blank layer and fill it with a beige/yellowish color. Set the mode to overlay.

Step 8: Use the text tool and your new font and type an ""a"" in red, go to your character selector (in mac its called character palette, not sure about MS) and insert a heart character. Set this mode to overlay.

Step 9: Drag in your cutout head. Go to layer adjustments and lower the saturation, also shift it a little to the red side. Then lower the brightness and raise the contrast. Play around with it, it won't be perfect but that's how you learn.

This won't be exact, but it'll get you pretty close. Feel free to ask any questions you want. Good luck!","1338510536"

It might surprise you to know I am a registered Republican. That I paid my own way through college without student aid. That I started work when I was 15 and have always paid my taxes like a good little worker bee. That I voted for Ron Paul in my state's primary. Could a possibility cross your mind, I doubt it. 

Since you want to make this personal, I have plenty to blame Bush for. I have plenty to blame Obama for and I have plenty to blame everyone back to Washington for. There is a fucking pile of corpses and misery oozing down the edifice of this country like a diarrhea drenched toilet from a fool dead of dysentery. I will not forgive nor forget those who have contributed to that. Now you seem like a nice little peon so why don't you crawl away and died with the rest of your numb minded patriots who enjoy guzzling on the phalluses of your pimps. When your done choking on their sticky patriotic jizz maybe the thought that somehow, someway this is wrong might cross your mind. Then again probably not. No consequence to me... your world is already dead. Your inheritors won't pay any more attention to you then you pay attention to the hunter gatherers who ran around Ice age Europe.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It could be the case that it is front, but the people are very stupid if they are running it this way while trying to launder money. The whole point of laundering money is to hide where it comes from and make it seem legitimate. I have a forensic accounting background and once people start to really look into it the whole thing comes undone. So the last thing you would want to do is draw attention and scrutiny. 

People dont need to do this for small amounts of money. If they are making enough money that they need to launder it then they shouldnt be needing to scam people for $60 or so. 

Finally a smart money launderer would want to have a real business that makes money on its own. 

So, it could be, but the people running it are idiots. ","1338510557"

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","I'd like to comment on why we're seeing some of those bulleted points you listed.  I think the business community is a little nervous about what effects current/pending legislation will have on their bottom lines.  So even though they may be doing well now, they are hedging their bets, and choosing not to expand until the Washington dust settles.  
 A few examples of what I mean:  
o  The healthcare overhaul's ultimate costs to businesses is still not fully known, as it is slowly implemented (it may not even exist soon).

o  There are a great number of tax cuts about to expire -but Washington says maybe they won't.

o  Washington has been playing with ""temporary"" tax cuts, like the recent payroll tax cut, instead of permanent, long term tax policy.

I think this ambiguity from Washington is creating an atmosphere where businesses are wary, and are not re-investing their capital into future growth.","1338510558"

His family has been amazing and supportive...and he is wonderful.  We both work a lot and split chores and stuff 50/50.  His family has never made me feel like an outsider (well, except for ONE aunt, but she got over it).  In fact, they all live in Mexico, and we go visit them.  They give me a room in their homes and treat me like family.    I will say that socio-economic status and education seems to play a role here.  Most of his family members are engineers, corporate business men, scientists, etc.  I actually prefer his family to mine.  The only thing I would change is their lackadaisical approach to getting to places on time.  :)  I agree with your last statement...really look at the family you are marrying into...but in every situation, not just a different culture.

That's been the general trend down to the south here in [Canada's pants](http://mitchieville.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/canadas-pants.jpg), too.

Your brother falling isn't really the worst that can happen to him. The worst that can happen is that he doesn't fall, and he doesn't learn, and he keeps getting himself into this kind of destructive relationship. He has a much higher chance of living at home until he's 40 that way, or of your parents finally getting sick of it, and living on the street.

Especially if CBSi starts to deal direct with twitch partners on advertising space, times, and durations.

I can see them offering incentives for Twitch users and broadcasters to agree certain advertising conditions.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have been on a lifelong quest to find the best value in almost everything you can think of. Here is the culmination of my experiences thus far:

* **USED speakers**--the best deal in audio is buying used, and any review that says some speaker/headphone is ""the best"" is usually written by someone who has just never listened to anything good before. Feel free to PM me for audio advice, as I can offer several recommendations on used gear to look for. 

* **Taste Nirvana Coconut Water**--the only coconut water that doesn't taste like shit IMO. If you've tried coconut water before from brands like Zico or Vita-Coco, and thought it tasted like dog shit, then I strongly urge you to try this brand. It's the closest thing to sticking a straw inside an actual coconut. Here's the link on Amazon where it's a dollar cheaper per can than the supermarket: [Taste Nirvana](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OVWQDA/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00) I've found that the best coconut water comes from young Thai coconuts, which are much sweeter and fresher tasting.

* **Volkswagen Cars**--the only affordable cars on the road that still have the great German handling IMO. i.e., the GTI is extremely fun to drive while the new Audi's and BMW's have shitty electronic steering with no road-feel.    

* **TireRack.com**. Amazing selection of tires for usually around half the price of buying from a mechanic/store.

* **Amazon Prime**. I am an Amazon fanboy for what I think are obvious reason--because almost everything is cheaper on Amazon, and has tons of reviews. Amazon Prime is great if you order stuff often because you get free 2-day shipping on everything, and 1-day shipping is only 3.99.

* **Studying Math/Comp Sci/Engineering in College**--Same tuition except you actually learn something and get a job

The implication is that the directive of armed warfare which is given here must neither be undertaken to gratify one’s whims nor to obtain wealth and riches. It must also not be undertaken to conquer territories and rule them or to acquire fame or to appease the emotions of communal support, partisanship and animosity. On the contrary, it should be undertaken only and only for the cause of Allah and such a sacred undertaking has no relation with personal and selfish motives. This is the war of the Almighty which His servants undertake at His behest and according to the guidelines provided by Him for His cause. They themselves act as mere agents and implementers of the will of God. They have no objective of their own before them in this undertaking; rather they have to fulfill the objectives of the Almighty.

"zombies","t5_2qi0e","http://www.cracked.com/article_15643_5-scientific-reasons-zombie-apocalypse-could-actually-happen.html

Depends on the type of outbreak as to if they can starve. Most likely scenario is a virus or parasite, in which they can only survive in the dead host for a short period of time before dying, hence the need to spread the infection rapidly. This also explains why they dont eat eachother, they need to spread to an uninfected to reproduce. They can distinguish alive and dead from smell and are attracted to movement. Zombies cant swim as such but its believed they can walk under water. As for the SOUND zombies make, speech is generated from vibrations in the vocal chords travelling through air. As zombies dont necessarily need as much oxygen coz their dead, and also as their neck wud be deteriorating speech would sound different. Also only the brain stem and core of the brain wud be functioning so the zombies would lack the ability of distinguishing words. As for the walk vs run, this is probly due to different levels of decomposition and rigarmortis, fresh zombies would be more capable of running, although not as fast as a human as they lack coordination from not having a fully functional brain. ZOMBIES VOTING u cant be serious lol. I think you need blood flow to get high off charlie sheen lol. If a zombie saw itself in a mirror i believe it would be quite confused as it wudnt detect a smell from it (maybe a good defence strategy there, good work). And finally zombies cant reproduce as humans do they do it via spreading infection, plus u need blood flow to get an erection, and blood flow would cease after death.","1338510586"

"urbanexploration","t5_2qkvl","OP here. Here are my own thoughts, for what they're worth. This is a place where I don't have a problem with the graffiti, though I generally hate graffiti. It was abandoned by the local government in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew, and it has been allowed to rot ever since. Meanwhile, the local government hasn't done anything to renovate it. It hasn't leased it. It hasn't sold it. And it hasn't demolished it. So it's held onto this thing -- a public, taxpayer asset mind you -- for nearly a generation without letting the public use it.

At this point, I don't care if graffiti artists want to reclaim it. At least somebody is getting enjoyment out of this building. I also think that after getting battered by a hurricane and suffering 20 years of neglect, this thing would need a new coat of paint and all of its seats replaced anyway. So the graffiti artists likely aren't doing much to increase the cost of the eventual overhaul anyway. If anything, they might even be helping the restoration cause (albeit unintentionally) because a lot of people like me are learning about it, photographing it, visiting it, etc. largely because of the graffiti. 

I'm a journalist and wrote an article about this place after taking my photos. I didn't initially post a link to my story because I didn't want to be seen as trolling for hits, but my article has some info about the history. http://www.governing.com/news/local/The-Eerie-Interior-of-Miami-Marine-Stadium.html

I have been advised in the past to only use past tense verbs if you are no longer performing those tasks/job.  If you are still in that position and they are your current duties, it would be ok to use present tense (I was advised this by several resume review services from my university)

&gt;Edit for cover letter - don't put 'varied' twice. 'Youth' is plural, don't add an 's'. Justify your text. It's a definite improvement from the first!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sex is important to her. Does it matter why? Would you hate her so much if baseball was her interest? How about computers? 

You've decided it's a character flaw. You've judged her. You've decided to get angry when it comes up.

Why?

For all you know, there could be all kinds of reasons for her to talk about it. 

For example.


Does she have a strong sex drive? I do, ever since I was molested, and I hate it. I would love to be one of the ""take it or leave it"" types. I prayed over it. I went to therapy for it. I tried to commit suicide over it...all in the hopes of becoming like you.

There were no easy answers. You see, I can't not talk about it - not when I'm terrified to the point of tears by it whenever it comes up without warning.

Eventually, I found friends I could trust with that side of me...and suddenly, the problem wasn't a problem anymore. I could be just me, instead of ""someone who talks about sex too much."" They're pretty fucking awesome people - but most of them were raped or molested too. 

It's wonderful to meet those who weren't. 

I really hope your friend wasn't. 

And if she wasn't, if she's just having fun..?

Well, that's what she enjoys. Her body brings her pleasure. So long as she's being safe, sane, and consensual about what she does...

When it comes to motherboards ASRock.  These guys often make really high performance boards at a low price because they don't offer a lot in the way of after sales service, but what you get for your dollar is always really good value.  Just make sure that whatever board you buy from their range is at the upper end of their pricing structure because the really cheap ones often have substandard components.  This isn't a problem though because their upper end boards are pretty much always cheaper than everyone else's midrange motherboards.

"canada","t5_2qh68","My concern is how this applies to performances of free music. By free music, I do not mean music which is offered for download free of charge, I mean music that is produced and licensed for perpetual royalty free use or music that is produced by an artist who has no intention of monetizing the work. This tariff doesn't seem to clarify exactly what the definition of a 'published sound recording' is or when exactly the tariff applies. 

It seems absolutely ridiculous to me that someone could write an original song, post a video of them singing it on Youtube and then have to pay a copyright board to play that song at their own wedding. Yet, from my initial (although quite brief) reading of the tariff, I don't see anything which would exempt such cases.

'Re: Sound' seems to be operating under the principle that ""we will collect fees from everybody who plays any sort of music anywhere and if you're an artist, you can register with us and get a small cut of the royalties we receive"" and this model seems seriously fundamentally flawed and I doubt it is really helping artists out (and probably doing nothing for independent artists).","1338510610"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;&gt;The reason behind this?

&gt;The reason behind this is twofold: there are more adult women than men, and there are more women eligible to vote than men (due to men being the majority of felons)

This was not a question, if you look I answered myself as to how men are treated as they are disposable, - and in fact-

&gt;And how many of those boys vs girls make it to adulthood? You're not seeing the whole picture here.

THIS was the very point I was addressing, if women and men are treated equally disposable, they will suffer (more) equal losses. 

&gt;&gt;No, it doesn't.

&gt;And I can tell by this you live in fantasy land.

There is a reason we have a Government, mutual prosperity and the protection of civil rights. If someone really feel that any action can be justified by simply being able to out-muscle their victim, they need serious counseling. Really, you can legitimately argue for murder/rape/theft with this argument and be just as valid. 

&gt;&gt;This is reflected in the fact that most parliamentary/republic democracies have founding principals, such as the Constitution/Bill of Rights

&gt;And we've shit on both of them for the longest time.

Can't argue with you there, it has happened, and it is a terrible thing it has happened. But it was rarely the voters who implemented those laws. Recent examples would be the detention portion of the NDAA 2012 or CISPA, where a huge public outcry called foul, however people in power with private interests push it through regardless. This is a failing in our system, one I feel can be, and needs to be fixed. A good start would be employing an Alternative Vote system rather than the one we have in place [\(for anyone interested, here are some good video's on the topic\)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) and making practices such as corporate lobbying and gerrymandering illegal.

&gt;And I can tell by this you live in fantasy land.

&gt;Drop your fantasies and face reality.

If you are interested in continuing a conversation, please leave personal attacks calling me delusional out of it. I'm not certain if I said anything to offend you other than state opinions, but I am honestly just interested in seeing arguments against my position, not my sanity.","1338510612"

I'm sorry but if men are taught or engineered to take greater risks in their career isn't it logical to have greater men percentage of men on the top AND greater percentage of men on bottom?  And if women are more conservative with taken chances regarding their career wouldn't we see them fill the center ""class"" more?   And what would you know, but that is the case!

In addition how many women are benefactors of these top men?  How many daughters and wife(ves) have recieved power from these men?  And how many women are placed in poverty because of homeless men?  

Sorry, but this view by feminist is agenda based on how women can have more power and has nothing to do with equality.  And that is why when people view the feminist lobbying agenda realize it is a sexist movement.

During the study the doctor in charge suffered some kind of tragedy and left the University without completing the study. Shitty.

I was insured briefly following the study and saw a cardiologist. The guy thought I was crazy because I was fit and no record existed of my previous diagnosis. He did a quick EKG and sent me on my way. I hope to be insured sometime in the next 6 months and plan to find a better doctor.

He created multiple languages and multiple cultures and customs for the land. Not to mention some of the downright most badass moments ever (Eragon and Saphira essentially creating their own fucking sword, Roran nonchalantly sitting at a table, drinking mead and playing bones while an entire cavalry heads his way to kill him, Eragon destroying Galbatorix by casting a spell to literally make him feel everything he has done to everyone and agonize in the suffering he has caused, etc.).

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","I'm currently working on my masters (in chemistry) at the University of Manitoba.  I have been going to this school for about 6 years now.  

It's never too early to ask questions!  I wish I had looked into it more when I was younger!

As far as I remember, your grades in grade 11 have nothing to do with enterance.   All they looked at were grade 12.  I did fairly poorly all throughout highschool, except the last year.  Doing well in grade 12 got me several scholarships.  I didn't apply in grade 11 though.  

As far as I know the biggest difference between U of M and U of W is the class sizes.  Winnipeg has MUCH less people, so the class sizes for your first year are probably going to be smaller.  Winnipeg is probably around 50, Manitoba can be anywhere from 50 - 200.  

Untill recently the U of W wasn't very active in research (as far as I know), but lately I have met several other grad students there, so I'm assuming the times have changed.  It also seems to be more of an 'arts' school, though this is from an outside perspective!

If you're planning on going into engineering or medicine, in highschool you should probably take all the sciences (Chem, phys, bio, math).  Though when I started university it didn't really require highschool bio, but it helped a lot for those who did take it.  

At the U of M they have University 1, which is more or less a trial year.  You take some courses that apply to your choosen path, but there's room for other things.  My first, and second year, I took courses from all over the spectrum.  

As for volunteering I would think the hospital could use some?  Perhaps someone can answer this better.  

My advice for highschool is try to enjoy it!  University can be tough, and you wont have as much slack!  From highschool I think the most important subject that helps in University is Math.  Even more so if you plan on going into engineering.  I still use a lot of the same math I used in highschool today, and trust me it's a pain to try to re-learn it. ","1338510620"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll answer from a plumbers perspective. Most drain clogs are not your fault. Any pipe work that leaks behind walls, in ceilings, or under floors are probably not your fault. The one thing we always get lied to about is toilets. Thats usually your fault. When a toilet gets clogged we usually ask if you flushed baby wipes or feminine products down the toilet. Or if you dropped anything like a cap for a pill bottle or something of that nature. Baby wipes and feminine napkins do not break up in a toilet. They just sit there if they don't go straight down. If you did, and tell us, we can get a snake and boom, we are done. If you lie, we waste time trying to solve the problem by flushing and maybe changing a part that you may need to pay now because you lied. If you dropped a bottle cap from a pill container, just say so. We disconnect your toilet and pop it out from the other side if we can get it. If you lie, we waste time trying to snake it, which doesn't work and then we assume it's the toilet and have to go and get one that you will pay for. ","1338510626"

The sports fans actually do want fundamentals.  The sports fans appreciate it.  The sports fans will remember it.  The sports fans are bored of around-the-clock arguments and discussion of the sideshow carnival stories.  They will get it right.

The argument is only possible by painting both of these groups with the same brush.  It's unfair to the hardcores who actually do value talent over entertainment, and to the casual fans who never really ascribed much value to boys and their sports in the first place.","1338510631"

Synthesis is actually a very complicated process, I've made electronic music for 6 years as a hobby and I still barely understand how to make simple sounds.

If he's actually interested in that side of things, there are TONS of free VSTi programs you can download first, before spending money on an actual synthesizer. 

If he's just interested in playing keyboard, I don't have any recommendations for beginners. Even the ""good"" entry level keyboards aren't all that great, and unfortunately the better ones are way out of a beginner's price range.

Especially if he gave up playing one instrument already -- it shows a lack of dedication to something he doesn't realize takes a *lot* of effort.

I've not been able to slow steam down.

&gt;those kinds of developers who are passionate enough to release today would not go away or sell their souls to steam. 

Yes... they will. You just watch.

&gt;You advocate against one kind of DRM to control your library on the basis, I assume, that they can lock out out.

Why are you making assumptions? I've spelled it out letter by letter quite clearly that it's because this particular DRM can control _entire libraries of games_. You keep completely skipping that point. Why?

&gt;Steam thus far is the least intrusive DRM (except no DRM at all) that comes to mind.

Steam is the MOST intrusive DRM I've had to deal with. You can't even launch a game without having the steam client running. It's constantly breaking access to games I paid cold hard cash for. I've had significantly more trouble with steam than I had with even the infamous Spore DRM.

&gt;Steam has no ultimate power.

This is simply incorrect, and I think you know it. You may not consider it to have any power over your games, but that just means you're wrong. I'm glad you've never had to deal with steam locking you out of your games over and over again, but I have, and I'm not the only one who has. You may not believe it because you've never experienced it yourself, but steam is already locking out thousands of users on a daily basis.

If you simply continue to refuse to accept that my experiences with this lock in mechanism are real, and that they are, in fact, not uncommon, then you'll never understand why I so vehemently oppose steam coming to Linux.

I'm done explaining this to you over and over again. 

Keep on supporting steam and see what happens. You'll know that you were warned and you'll kick yourself for ignoring it.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","And I repeat, you conveniently neglected to mention that there were more than a few other nations that supplied--directly--Iraq with far more weapons and ""state-of-the-art"" technology than did the United States. 

&gt;We obviously would never take the same kind of stance in regards to Israel (e.g. jumping in on the side of Egypt/Syria/Jordan in the Six-Day War to prevent Israel from acquiring land through war).

What does this have to do with anything?

&gt;The same applies in the Iraq-Iran war. We may not have wanted the war in the first place, but we would have been a lot more okay with Saddam winning than with Khomeini spreading the Islamic revolution into a new country.

Actually, all the evidence points to the US not wanting Iraq nor Iran to ""win"" in such a decisive manner.

&gt;So there you have it. This was much more than an under-the-radar messaging that chemical weapons were okay. At the very least, ambivalence to the use of chemical weapons was our official policy up to the highest levels.

Then it would have been smart of the US not to publicly accuse and condemn Iraq for using chemical weapons in [March of 1986,](http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/21/world/us-condemns-iraq-charges-use-of-chemical-arms-in-war.html) calling it a ''serious violation of international law.'' ","1338510652"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Innocent until proven guilty only refers to the way in which jurors have to view a defendant in a criminal case. Individual citizens have no such obligation. 

Rape has only one real question: was there consent? If the answer is no, then its rape. The end. Period. 

Even if the friend hadn't sort of said no, it would still be rape. Why? Because there was no affirmative consent. Silence is not consent. Sort of no is not consent. Neither the OP nor her friend believe that OP asked before acting, nor does OP claim any non-verbal cues which would have served as non-verbal consent.

There really isn't any ambiguity. No affirmative consent = rape.

**Edit:** So, downvoters - are we in disagreement that there was not consent? We can spell this out, no? There was no consent. On top of that, her friend may have ""sort of"" said no. If there isn't consent, and the person sort of says no, it's sexual assault. Savvy? 

**Edit 2:** Also, the difference between ""I sort of said no"" and ""I said no"" can be that its very easy to blame oneself for an assault. E.g. ""I said no, but only sort of because I didn't try and push him/her off."" or ""I think I was taken advantage of, but I did go back with him/her to their room so maybe its my fault."" or ""I though I said no, but my friend didn't stop, so I must not have said it.""

My sister used to have the same phobia until one day she decided to trap the spiders in a cup instead of killing them. She ended up keeping them as pets, but I just thought she was crazy. Then one day I walked into the bathroom and found a decent sized spider behind the toilet, but since I had to go I decided to ignore it. I figured I'd have to go out of my way to kill it since it was in a very inconvenient location. After a while, I still hadn't killed it so I decided to give it a name. I named the little guy Sherlock. One day a while later I found a spider in my room, but even to my own surprise I didn't freak and I wasn't afraid, but of course I did kill it. I can't say that my fear is completely conquered because I still freak out a little when I see a big wolf spider or such, but other than that, it's much easier.

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","Be very careful about native resolution vs the resolution it's 'capable' of.

Lots of crappy knockoff projectors will be able to take a 1080p signal, which is 1920 x 1080 pixels, but the actual display of the projector is VGA (or less) which is 640 x 480 pixels.  So you're losing 3/4 of the picture and it's definitely not HD.

In general you're going to have a tough time finding a decent 1080p (native) projector for less than $700-800.  Personally I use an Epson that I picked up at Fry's for $350.  It's a little over 720p and I believe it's 2700 lumens (lumen specs are also dubious, but this one is very bright).  If you're willing to drop down to 720p it's a good option, and if you can spend an extra $100 or so you can find one that does 3d.","1338510662"

Yeah I try to deal as well but, once you taste the relief that comes from a good narcotic opiate its hard to go back. More power to you for not self medicating. It isn't the best way to go about helping yourself. That's for sure. However I will stand by weed being highly beneficial for arthritic pain and for lowering stress which lowers breakthrough rates.

I'm basically the same with drinking. Its nice to hear that most of you guys are as well.

"fitmeals","t5_2sd23","I kind of wing it; I looked for the original recipe and can't find it at the moment. 
This is my version:
1 can diced pineapple (save the juice; about 1/4 to half cup)
1 cup quiona 
1/2 cup (or more) chopped cilantro
1/4 cup olive oil (or less depending on how saucy you like things; never any more tho. )
2 cloves garlic (I like garlic)
pepper
1 lime
vinegar 

Cook the quinoa (2:1 w/water). Let the quinoa chill for 20 min or so. 
Wisk the pineapple juice, olive oil, garlic, pepper, juice from the lime, and your preference amount of any kind of white vinegar. This dressing needs to sit for at least 10 min before using. Also if you crush fresh garlic, the garlic should sit for at least 10 minutes to bring out its full potential. 

Mix the cooked quinoa (now about 3 cups) with diced red onions, pineapple and cilantro. Use a fork, not a spoon. Add the dressing to your liking and mix again. Let sit for a few minutes to fully marinate. 

Like I said, I wing it. I adjust the amounts of garlic and vinegar to my liking on the day. Also I adjust the ingredients, this has become a go-to meal for me. Black beans, red peppers, salmon, tomatoes, parsley, chickpeas are all ingredients I have added to this salad, usually with great results. Sometimes I add a bit of milk when cooking the quinoa to up the calcium. This is a dish that all ingredients can be toyed with when making it. 

Its cheap and healthy. Enjoy.

This is well worn material.  Groups like ACORN are required to turn in every voter registration they receive.

ACORN even flagged the registrations it suspected were false.  [Source](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/apr/26/eric-eisnaugle/mickey-mouse-was-registered-vote-florida-republica/)

But lets be clear about the present voter purge.  

1. It is illegal under the National Voter Registration Act.  Purges of voters can not occur within 90 days of an election. [Source](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/nvra/activ_nvra.php)

2. The list is heavily skewed toward removing Democratic voters.  It is a calculated political move to favor one political party. [Source](http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/05/29/2822073/south-florida-democrat-say-gov.html)

3. The post-election analysis of the purge in 2000 found 70-95% of the purge list was erroneous.  Qualified voters (including one County Elections Supervisor) were sent threatening letters warning them that past felonies barred them from voting, when no such felonies existed. Preliminary analysis shows massive errors in the present purge list as well.  ","1338510671"

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","I split upper body and lower body weights with core and cardio in between.  

**Mondays** are upper body and I choose at least two ""push"" exercises and two ""pull"". Example: Dumbbell bench press(push), then single-arm bent over row(pull). Overhead shoulder press(push) then assisted pull ups(pull).  

Depending on how I feel after that, I'd add a core exercise like [negative sit ups](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz-Qk1x99y4) on a decline bench (while holding a weight behind my head) and/or planks.  Then I eat protein and stretch.

**Tuesday** I'll do lower body. I do 4 exercises that aren't too similar to each other. I choose from: Deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, overhead squats, walking lunges (with dumbbells), hamstring curls (on stability balls or TRX bands).  I do calf raises on every leg day, and even some upper body days, because I have such underdeveloped ankles/calves.  

I don't do core afterward because I'm usually spent from leg exercises. They are the biggest muscle groups and those exercises incorporate a lot of core.  Then I eat protein and stretch.

**Wednesday** is a light day because I am usually sore. I might splash around in a pool, go for a walk, or even a short jog if I feel up to it. Anything that will help me stretch my muscles and get some range of motion so that my stiffness doesn't inhibit my workouts the rest of the week. 

**Thursday** is upper body again, focusing on whatever types of upper body exercises I didn't do on Monday. I really like doing [two hands anyhows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmFUbv7UxUE)(with dumbbells instead of kettlebells) if my legs are up to the squat part. It's a full-body, compound exercise and it's my favorite exercise ever.  If I'm feeling tired, I take it easy on weight. No reason to kill myself, just get a little bit of strain and stretch.

**Fridays** I've been doing [sprints](http://www.ehow.com/how_179_sprint.html) or [jumps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg88OVW8gvc&amp;feature=fvwrel). My bf was a sprinter so I go with him to the track and go through the [warm-ups](http://www.brianmac.co.uk/sprints/sprintdrills.htm) with him.  I can't really sprint yet because of my weak ankles/calves but I give about 60%. It's such a workout for the core, legs/glutes, and even the arms because you are cycling them so fast. 
Sometimes instead of the sprinting on the track, we jump on things :) Literally set up plyo boxes of different heights and jump from a two-legged standstill.  He has moved up to one-legged, and very high boxes. But I'm still only about 15"" off the ground, jumping 2 boxes in a row.  It's a lot more tiring than it seems!

**Saturday and Sunday** are whatever I feel like I could use more of.  I'm considering making them light stretch and walk days because I am getting exhausted from combining work and working out.  The summer heat has also been getting to me so I'm taking it easy and just being more careful with my diet and staying hydrated.  Also, I [foam roll](http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=9911) every day because it's made a world of difference in my recovery time and physical comfort.

edit: Of course, working out 5+ days a week can be excessive if you don't get enough recovery in between.  I work at a gym so it is convenient for me. I follow this program because my bf is a personal trainer and it's something he and I do together.  It would still be effective to water it down and work out 2-3 days a week and that is what I do every few months if I start feeling tired every day instead of strong.

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Piercing Orb is amazing, due to a few factors, not least of all a quirk (or bug) in the way it works. It can be cast through a LOT of terrain that other spells cannot - i.e. you can cast it down a staircase from a point where another spell such as MM/AO would hit the top of the staircase, and PO will just pass through. I have since dropped it from my spec in favor of MM with Charged Blast rune. However this is mostly due to me picking up Temporal Flux and wanting the slow off my signature. I would really love to still have PO, but I just can't work it into my current spec.

It was taking me approximately 2 AOs and 1 PO, or ~3-4 POs to kill one of the serpents. The nice thing about my positioning in the fight was that the serpents that were spawning far away from me were partly off-screen, and they also have a delay before spawning before they go invis, that would allow me to kill them before they disappeared.

Also, I was sure as hell not using the same spec from start to finish on my attempts at killing him. I played around with some downright crazy ass specs trying to get him down, almost all of them failing miserably. After a couple of gear upgrades I tried again using my main farming spec (the one I linked in my previous reply) and found myself making progress easier, so I stuck with it. I honestly have only killed him twice, once solo once with my mates (Seigebreaker runs are quicker and reward better loot), so I couldn't really comment to my consistency. Having ~35k hp and ~55k damage now though I suspect he would give me much less trouble.

Gear wise, honestly there's no big glaring gaps in any of your pieces, so it's not as easy as saying 'well your [gear slot] is way worse than any of your other pieces, so upgrade that!'. I would recommend looking for good deals over amazing upgrades. Getting 3-4 really good deals for minor-reasonable upgrades for 1-2mil total will give you more of a boost than one big upgrade (generally speaking, if you can shop around a bit and not impulse buy :p). Also, I found a screenshot of my gear from the day I killed Belial (a wizard buddy of mine was wanting it).

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","these are my own personal guidelines for debating on reddit, not sure if this is what you're looking for:

* Stay calm, stay frosty, stay detached.
* Don't expect to win every single battle. 
* Always remain honest about your own life and privilege.
* That being said, remain vague and don't give away too much personal information.
* Indicate when you're drawing from personal experience. Concede your biases. 
* Source your arguments, and save comments that add to your knowledge base. 
* Concede points when appropriate. Don't be afraid to correct yourself if you're actually in the wrong.
* You have the limitations of distance and unfamiliarity with the other person getting in the way of easy communication, so don't add hostility to the mix (unless you feel it's necessary). 
* Don't devalue the other person with personal insults, but don't be afraid to call a spade a spade when taking apart their arguments.
* Know when you're wasting your time. If you're hurting because of someone's debate conduct, or if someone is harassing you, make a judgment call about whether it's worth it to continue. 
* Don't ever let winning be more important than the argument itself.","1338510686"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I guess it's a tough call for me, because when I read the book I am kinda removed from making my own direct moral judgments on the characters, but I might say Victarion as well, but it's kinda an unfair contest in the sense that, while almost all the POV characters are flawed and have their own strengths and weakness or faults, what little we know about Victarion puts him so far down below most everyone else.

I find the Ironborn in general to be really shitty people, but Victarion is like everything negative about their culture distilled into one horrible manifestation. We get two other Ironborn POVs, Asha and Aeron (I don't count Theon because I don't think of him as having truly absorbed the culture at such a young age when he was taken) but even these two are much more likable. Asha does the raiding and killing, sure, but she comes off much better because she tries to warn Theon at Winterfell, she distrusts Euron, she's witty and empowered etc. Aeron is a religious zealot who who's extraordinarily holier-than-thou. He's not really very high on my list either, but he's mostly just trying to keep things customary and tradition, albeit twisted customs. And he was likely molested by Euron in his youth as well, so in some way that has to humanize him a bit.

Victarion is a brutal monster, who, to be fair, has been tormented by Euron probably longer than almost anyone. But that reality doesn't really make up for his savagery, his pride for Ironborn raping-and-killing culture, and his beating his pregant wife to death with his bare hands thing.","1338510695"

Not very pro-life of you there...  Nor does it do anything to change the simple fact that the child is there, and best benefits from growing up in the loving environment provided by a family.

&gt;unfortunately people have children to glorify themselves rather than to build a family unit proven by generations to be the best foundation for success.

I'm not sure how you would prevent that... it seems rather open to interpretation which couples are having children just to glorify themselves and those who want to build a family.  Also, as I stated above, once the child is here there isn't much to do other then take what steps can be taken to ensure that they grow up in a stable family (which both gay and straight parents can provide).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Are you seriously asking why its better to have drones do this than conventional air forces?

If you are serious then...

1. You are not risking pilots lives. Beyond the obvious downsides of losing a persons life you also lose their experience and training that will have likely cost your air force dearly in terms of cash and time.

2. Drones can stay in the air for far longer than a manned plane, they have no crew so the can effectively remote fly until needed, this is a huge advantage over regular aircraft.

3. By staying in an area for much longer they can also ensure that they are hitting the right targets much more effectively than a pilot who is covering an area for a few hours at most. They constantly monitor and assess the comings and goings of their targets several hours in advance and can help their operators plan the best time to strike etc.

4. By removing the pilot from the physical threat of combat you enable them to make much more calculated decisions, they no longer have to worry about enemy planes or AA emplacements taking them out. They can effectively ""relax"" and ensure that their job is done without having to worry about getting in and getting out before someone kills them. This means less rushed decisions which should in theory mean less civilians killed due to someone hitting the wrong target or at the wrong time or both.

Now those are the advantages on paper and assuming the operators have the best intentions.

It would be interesting to see the stats of drone strikes in terms of enemies killed against civilian casualties compared against conventional air strikes from manned planes.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I don't understand what you said at all.  If you pay 6% of your income above 15Kpa then you're paying a random amount against your loan.  If the interest is variable then sometimes you'll be paying more principle and sometimes you'll be paying more interest - I'm not sure what 'real terms' means.

Doesn't matter though, since your gf is in the states.  In general, what you're asking is ""Is there some way my gf can get out of paying back her student debt?""  

Well, she borrowed the money, and now makes a very good salary - in who's interest would it be to give her a break on the interest?  No ones.  

She would be MUCH better off spending a couple months learning how money works and dedicating her short-term life to paying off her debt via her massive income rather than trying to find some random company or government program to ""help"" her get out of paying what she owes.

As for loan forgiveness: why should someone forgive this loan?","1338510713"

I would say that the ideological basis of the monarchy turns more into a traditional and/or symbolic one, as the true ideology of the UK is democracy and political power to the people in the form of votes.

Ideologies can change over time, and I think the basis of the modern royal family is different to those of past times, where things were much different and in this way they are no more than a reminder of history.   ","1338510714"

1. foreshadow the death

or 

2. Make the person redeem themselves in some way, that still leaves a lack of closure for your main protagonist.

My 2006 Kia Spectra was out of the full warranty and only under power train. So they only cover a few important parts at that point.  

I call about some rust on a few parts and how one snapped off.. well It is out of warranty and rust is not covered... then they asked when could they pick it up... They came and picked up my car, offered me a courtesy vehicle, fixed it for free and everything. Excellent customer service, very nice.  

Oh and when i first purchased the car I had an issue with the dealer and i called Kia to complain about the issue (The dealership informed me I was not allowed to work on my own car.. at all, not even oil changes, it would void the warranty.) They called and apologized, called again to follow up with me.. that dealership stopped carrying Kia/Hyundai about a month later.. Related? I dunno, but aside from what happened to the dealer Kia was very nice about it.  

Also my mother owns a Hyundai Santa Fe and she take horrible care of it.. horrible. it has 250,000 miles on it, still on it's 2nd set of tires. (They are still in great condition) and all we have had to do so far is replace the rear shocks.. only took 40 minutes to do on my own.  

My Uncle owns a Hyundai Accent with nearly 300,000 miles on it, it has had a bit of work, but it is still going strong.  

and to slip deep into anecdotal territory, as if I wasn't already, My mechanic dislikes many cars, even Kia/Hyundai.. when I asked him about keeping an eye out for an old Kia Rio.. He told me it was not going to happen.. I responded...

Your anecdote is unconvincing.


&gt;Your anecdote is unconvincing.
It is a sample size of one, I recognize that. My wife is a teacher and she just barely missed being laid off. Companies go out of business, people get sick, bad guys rob banks, bad guys rob shareholders. What's your answer? To whine about it? To point out the rich bad guys? If they did something illegal they should go to jail. Otherwise, newsflash, we live in an imperfect world, sometimes dickheads get ahead, and I don't hear you offering any solutions. All I see is boo hoo. 

Also, your judge of success is ""he ran the company into the ground""? AFAIK they just took over Conti and are now making air travel miserable for even more people. I BET you are an obama stool, I am not sure if you've noticed, but things haven't exactly taken off since he got in office, feels JUSSST about like it did before. I bet you make excuses for the fact that x and y isn't working out for him (dont care enough to actually creep your history). IF I am right, that's proof enough that your logic is dictated by what you want to believe rather than the other way around, and I dismiss you as a fool.

If I am not, the point is, ""running it down"" or whatever you said is a vague and unquantified term, what were other airlines doing? What was the market like, did they incorrectly hedge fuel, or not hedge it, what tools that united had could some more noble ""man of the people"" have leveraged to bring on the golden era of united and taken over the world?

"Fantasy_Bookclub","t5_2s92h","The characters In Conquest Born will always have a special place in my heart, because I literally grew up with them.  I started toying with those character concepts when I was still in high school, so they were part of me for most of my adult life.  The two most challenging were Jenseny and Kamala.  Jenseny because of the multiple personality element. That was actually a concept I'd come up with when I was thinking of what to write for my second book, but I didn't feel my narrative skills were mature enough yet for what that would require.  So I waited until I felt I was up to the task, and I think This Alien Shore really benefitted from that decision.  Kamala was about as far from my own mindset as a character could possibly be, so every step that character took was completely outside my comfort zone as a writer.  I had to explore issues of gender identity, sexual identity, and childhood abuse that were completely alien to me.  Fortunately I found people to whom they were not alien, who were willing to open up their lives to me, and share many things they normally don't talk about.  Some of them are now close friends.

It ""sort of"" works but has some serious limitations. The big one being that the ""server"" you get is supposed to run a windows computer with a computer name of ""LANHUB-SERVER"". This is so computers can connect without having to type in an IP or do some sort of broadcast lookup (and there is no override). The client frequently crashed, and we had a real rough time getting the voice chat to work (It did eventually work, but the quality lacked and there are not many options to use it). There's really not much that it does that can't be facilitated by other means.

It's a great idea, but I don't think the person(s) working on it really have all the skills they need yet to put out a polished product. The UI really lacks, and it looks like they tried to focus on style/customization before having a working product.

Where the hell do cops and reporters get off talking out of their fucking asses?  

In the UK, dumb ass cops and told reporters two dead kids probably were on the bath salts, with no fucking reason to say that other than the fact most cops are shitheads and talk like it.  So cops talking stupid cop shit, got bath salts outlawed, even though the two kids that drank themselves to death, smelled of only booze and had no drug wraps or residue on them, in fact when tox' results came back, the dead kids had never touched the stuff, and OD from booze alone.   

The news reports I've seen have been trying to whip up mass hysteria by warning: 'new drug grants superpowers', what a bunch of BS.   

I noticed that solders are taught that Adrenalin can let people get shot without even knowing it.  So how come when a solder gets back from war and becomes a cop, they then suddenly switch to, it must be PCP mode?


We know this now dead attacker was acting nuts.  We don't know if he was on anything other than being pissed off and or crazy. Maybe he hadn't slept in a long long time, or maybe he was taking perfectly legal sleeping pills and was sleepwalking and the marshmallow man called for back up.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","2CT7 + LSD was one of maybe two or three experiences where I actually had open eye hallucinations i.e. seeing what wasn't there, as opposed to what is there but different. The other one I can think of was a high dose of 2CE.

Alone, either of the two substances is quite a visual and euphoric psychedelic, but together, they're melting, colorful bliss. I saw a tree turn pink and flip upside down, so it looked like it was growing out of the sky. I saw shadowy figures running down my hallway toward my door and disappearing once they got too close to the lit part of the hall.

Whereas on the 2CE I hallucinated corpses, a rat on my shoe, beady orange eyes hovering everywhere... you get the idea.

You work hard to pay your way through college and medical school, dedicated to becoming a doctor so you can save lives.

a: you won't perform abortions so you are told you cannot become a doctor.  more people die because of lack of access to quality doctors.  Your education is useless and you move from small, understaffed, substandard hospital to small, understaffed, substandard hospital.  With some real equipment, you could save hundreds of lives.  But, that equipment is reserved only for people whose moral view follow the prevailing social norm.

b: you become a doctor and dedicate your life to saving patients.  you work in a complicated bureaucratic system where not everybody believes the same way as you.  Nevertheless, you disclose to the bureaucracy your own moral views and limitations.  They promise to work to ensure that you aren't put in a morally compromising situation.  Seventeen years later, your bureaucracy is taken over by another bureaucracy.  There are some kinks but no major issues.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I'm still not really seeing the connection between libertarianism and a the idea of a bunch of monarchies. You are correct in identifying the libertarian idea that private ownership implies that the individual has full discretion of how they use their land.  What I'm seeing is the difference between how you view Libertarianism and how Libertarianism exists is that private ownership is not meant to be able to tell others what to do, but rather so no one can tell you what to do with what you privately own.

How this interacts with others is that libertarians believe that they should be free to do what they want with what they own, while also maintaining the idea that others should be allowed to do as they wish as well.  The monarchy system implies that there is only one owner of all land, which is the opposite of libertarian. So to describe libertarianism as a bunch of monarchies only touches on the fact that an individual is wanting to do do as they wish with what they own, but misses on the idea that libertarians believe that everyone else should also be able to do the same.

Here's a good quote that describes libertarian values:

""The core idea is simply stated, but profound and far-reaching in its implications. Libertarians believe that each person owns his own life and property, and has the right to make his own choices as to how he lives his life – as long as he simply respects the same right of others to do the same.

Another way of saying this is that libertarians believe you should be free to do as you choose with your own life and property, as long as you don't harm the person and property of others.

Libertarianism is thus the combination of liberty (the freedom to live your life in any peaceful way you choose), responsibility (the prohibition against the use of force against others, except in defense), and tolerance (honoring and respecting the peaceful choices of others).""

And to answer your question about the gladiator death match, libertarians would support your wish to set up a gladiator fight, but only if the combatants, and anyone else involved did so willingly.  This is based on the fundamental belief that you can choose to do whatever you wish as long as everyone agrees to do it.  

Another thing I'll touch on is that, like the passage you quoted, libertarians do not strive for equality.  Private ownership implies that if someone has more than another, that one shouldn't take from one to give to another.  It should be done through voluntary means that doesn't just mean charity, but also means economically as well.  For instance, if I hire a contractor, I choose to give him x number of dollars of y task in a voluntary transaction.  

We also acknowledge that private ownership is enacted through legal norms and institutions. This is one of the roles that we believe that a government should be involved in.  There are countless examples of how strong title policy, and strong private ownership laws, have contributed to numerous economic gains, while it is especially obvious that when there are not strong title policies, a countries economy suffers.

A great example of this is a project that I got to observe as an outsider that my friend did in south africa. South Africa has long been known to have very poor title policies, and especially bad record keeping.  What this caused is that no one had any incentive to improve the property that they ""owned"" because they might not officially own it.  It's like if you don't know for sure that you own the house you live in, you aren't going to throw down 30k on a remodel of it only to find out someone else is moving in and taking your property.

My friend got involved in a bunch of projects in south africa, especially in water and rail lines.  They were having trouble getting people to sign on to having them install plumbing and sewer lines for properties as the property owner didn't want to spend money on it.  When they found out it was because of the bad record keeping he started a new business that assisted the government with electronic records and actually went back and cleared all property titles in the city.  As a result of everyone now knowing what they owned, the got permission from a majority of the people to install full plumbing systems.","1338510740"

Tear up your lawns and use it for food. 

Plant high yield grains and fruits in city parks. 

Use your swimming pools for agricultural water storage.

Seed empty lots in urban areas and turn them into productive food resources. 

Teach your kids how to grow food naturally and sustainably.

Collect rainwater, fuck the laws.

Most importantly, ween yourself off of the current food system; there is so much wasted energy and resources that go into simply transporting food its ridiculous.

You can reach out to your neighbors and create a plan to feed your neighborhood, its not as hard as everyone thinks it is. Only then can we ween ourselves off this craptacular system that our governments have us addicted to. All the big agriculture and food systems need to be directed to those who cannot provide for themselves, not the lazy and privileged. By feeding ourselves, we control our future, and hopefully the planets future as well. 

I really feel that this is a small but necessary first step into insuring our existence. Not only will we be healthier, but all the energy and resources (food transportation, food refrigeration, packaging, waste, etc...)  used to keep our current system going will be redirected and spread out to more beneficial ventures.The less we depend on these assholes, the less impactful their decisions become.","1338510746"

As for whistleblowers, your Daily Beast article is full of inaccuracies.  Here are come clarifications:

&gt;Kiriakou is charged with identifying a covert agent, three Espionage Act counts, and making a false statement, for which he faces 50 years in prison. In the government’s own words: “The charges result from an investigation that was triggered by a classified defense filing [by attorneys representing Guantánamo detainees], which contained classified information the defense had not been given through official government channels, and in part, by the discovery . . . of photographs of certain government employees and contractors in the materials of high-value detainees.” **In other words, instead of investigating the government’s withholding of exculpatory information from Gitmo detainees’ lawyers, the government investigated how the lawyers obtained the information.** And instead of investigating the approximately 70 names and 25 photos of the detainees’ alleged torturers, the government investigated how the prisoners found them out.
&gt;
&gt;Count I accuses Kiriakou of allegedly confirming the name of an allegedly covert agent — **even though the covert agent’s name has never been made public**. Count II alleges that Kiriakou violated the Espionage Act by affirming the allegedly covert agent’s (the same one whose name has never been made public) involvement with the “Rendition, Detention and Interrogation Program.” Counts III and IV stem from Kiriakou’s alleged communications with New York Times reporter Scott Shane, for a story he wrote in 2008 and for which Shane had some 23 other sources. Count V alleges that Kiriakou tried to trick the CIA, but failed, during the pre-publication review process for his book, “The Reluctant Spy: My Secret Life in the CIA’s War on Terror.” **The Indictment leaves out that Kiriakou took the “trick” information out of his book, and that the CIA cleared Kiriakou’s book in its entirety. More likely, the government is actually upset that Kiriakou’s book sharply criticizes the CIA’s torture program and reveals embarrassing information about the FBI – namely that the FBI shelved potentially-actionable intelligence in the aftermath of 9/11.**

See http://www.salon.com/2012/04/09/journalists_casualties_in_the_war_on_whistleblowers/singleton/

Also:

&gt;**The government’s spectacularly failed case against NSA whistleblower Tom Drake** claimed that he allegedly retained allegedly classified information for the purpose of leaking it to Siobhan Gorman, then with the Baltimore Sun. **It turned out that he disclosed unclassified information** about a failed and wasteful (multi-billion dollar) NSA spy program that compromised Americans’ privacy.

Dailybeast wants to pretend that Obama's not going after whistleblowers because they aren't ""whistleblowers"", they are ""leakers"".

You can only BLOW THE WHISTLE by making information known to the public.  That's how it *works*.

&gt; Obama bailed out the banks in 2008 before he became President and by the way, banks paid back those loans with a profit.

As for your comments on Khamenei ""praising"" Obama, you don't seem to understand how politics work.  He's pointing out war would be disastrous, so not to give in to the military hawks that are aching to start up a war with Iran.  

From your own link:

&gt;But Khamenei had criticism for Obama as well. The Iranian leader said the economic sanctions pushed by the U.S. and other nations as a way to get Iran to alter its nuclear program would fail.
&gt;
&gt;He said the U.S. president has continued a policy of wanting the Iranian nation to ""...bow through imposing sanctions.""
&gt;
&gt;Khamenei said resorting to the sanctions was a sign of misunderstanding and an unrealistic approach by the U.S. toward the Iranian nation.
&gt;
&gt;The Iranian leader warned that the misunderstanding will damage American leaders: ""It will lead their calculations to failure.""

This is all very understated criticism.  In reality they are apoplectic about the sanctions, which will simply kill millions of the most vulnerable people.  Don't forget the body count from sanctions against Iraq:

http://www.independent.ie/world-news/sanctions-have-killed-500000-iraqi-children-372964.html

http://iraqwar.org/childunicef.htm

Sanctions are about killing millions by slow starvation, as opposed to quickly killing them with bombs or nukes.

regarding right/wrong, it sounds like you're looking for some sort of objectivist moralism here. that won't do. what i'm trying to show is a way to maintain subjective terms that make sense. happy/sad are just examples. if you can't see the connection, just consider where the terms right/wrong would come from in the first place (you seem aware of evolution, after all - although i'm not sure what to think of you mentioning ""animal parts"").

and honestly, egoism/altruism is such a worn-out discussion. it's not like we're ""binary"" in the sense that we can only be one or the other, or that our being is somehow mixed up of the two in whatever percentage. evolution doesn't run on egoism. that's just not empirically sound (look around biology a bit, i guess). i'm not saying it runs on altruism either. *fitness* is all there is to it. and you can't toss those two concepts around here, and expect them to be as easily handled as you seem to...

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","&gt;First, why are feminists so obsessed with power. Apart from the observation that women have always been fascinated with and attracted to men with power ""the ultimate aphrodiasic"", the whole argument about privilege hangs on the allegation that males have the power. The fact that it is only a tiny percentage of men who have power, with the rest living ""lives of quiet desperation"" doesn't matter to them because the fact that men have power privileges ""the male"".

This also ties in with another problem regarding the transition from feminist theory to feminist action: the Patriarchy. The critical difference between a sociological patriarchy and a feminist one is that in a sociological patriarchy, a man must merely fit the male gender role and not die, to be guaranteed a moderate degree of personal power, whereas in a feminist patriarchy fitting the gender role does not now promise any particular increase in power, except in young men in the tradesman class and the very upper fringe of society which will never really affect most of us.

However, once the concept of a feminist patriarchy is accepted, it easily becomes confused with a sociological patriarchy, which then supports the idea of male privilege. ","1338510755"

Hey mum and dad check me out.  The parents went into complete denial mode and compensated by doing things like reporting my 19 year old son to the police for having a noisy lan party (boys only, all decent boys turning up with their laptops and their little carrier bags of booze) because they were TALKING TOO LOUDLY (it was summer and they had the windows open).  Like my son said ""why not just ask us to keep it down?"".  No loud music, just lan party noises.

What used to amuse me and my kids the most was the Saturday night cavalcade of chavs screeching up, running into her house and grabbing their whatever, and out again and then another chavmobile would screech up.  This would go on until about 10pm on a Friday and a Saturday night.  We used to laugh our heads off just watching them all.

But yeah, her scumbag parents called the police on my son's innocent little lan party (which I'd set up for them) and all they were doing was talking loudly.

You want to try and start teamfights mid game if you're super fed, because you will absolutely destroy their team since they most likely will not have all of their items at that point. I like playing her with people who can initiate well and have a decent amount of cc, or damage that they would be prioritized over Kat(ie Ali, Malphite, Mao, Hec, Riven, Blitz etc). If you can catch their carries out of position and kill them, your team will be able to win those teamfights and starting pushing towers really fast, which ends up winning the game.

I find that having the game go to late game makes it harder for Kat. Everyone has their items and they know you are the threat, so they save cc or get huge MR in order to render you useless. It's still possible to win by taking out their carries (since the carries don't NORMALLY build things like FoN), but it gets harder.","1338510764"

&gt;So if you can get a bullet going around 5500 feet per second (the fastest commercially available ones seem to be able to do about 4000, so 5500 is probably doable)

5500fps, eh?  The only ""guns"" I can find that can fire that fast are [railguns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun#Tests).

&gt;you might be able to get it into orbit around the moon (as long as you aim it so that while it goes around the moon, it avoids regions that are higher than you are. Better start at the top of a high mountain).

Trouble is, your periapsis will be the altitude you're firing from.  Even if you exceed the minimum orbital velocity, your apoapsis will move out, but your periapsis is still the height of the mountain you shot from.  In an absolutely ideal scenario, every orbit, your bullet will pass over the same mountain, at the exact height you shot it from.

However, this scenario isn't ideal.  The moon rotates, so no matter which direction you fire in, the terrain is changing every orbit.  I suppose firing from the peak of the highest mountain would solve this.

Lastly, low orbits aren't at all stable, and the moon is especially bad at destabilizing orbits.  Here's an issue NASA had with a low-orbit satellite from the Apollo 16 mission: http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/06nov_loworbit/

So, in short my point still stands.  If a bullet is fired on the moon at sub-escape velocity speeds, it **is** going to come down, sooner or later.

1.) How important is it that she actually break the curse? Is the curse something that she could learn to live with? If, in the end, she has to make the sacrificial decision to live with the curse in order to save somebody else/save the world/etc., then maybe it's not necessarily important that she actually break it.

2.) Back to the sacrificial thing. If a deal in black magic caused the curse, then perhaps a tremendous act of ""white"" magic could break it. So she gives up something very important to her and in return the curse is broken.

3.) She's rewarded for her actions. If there are ""higher"" beings in your story, maybe one of them has been watching, and one of them is powerful enough to break the curse. 

There really are endless options, and as long as you explain WHY the curse is broken, then it won't feel like a cop-out to the reader.","1338510768"

Come 2 minutes later when I turn around to start configuring it, the screen was looking much like the one in the picture. I sat there for a second just stunned as to what the hell happened. I've never been so confused in all my years of IT that a laptop screen would just decide to implode in on itself with the power of a thousand angry gods.

Second...you didn't look at your own links, did you?

In your first set of rankings, 6 of the top 25 are Big Ten.  Only 1 is SEC -- and it's ranked near the bottom (UF at #19), lower than five of the six of the aforementioned Big Ten schools.

In your second link, the pattern is similar.  5 of the top 50 are Big Ten, with only Vanderbilt from the SEC making an appearance.

In the last link -- and this is the link that makes me think that you're trolling -- ESPN has *clearly* ranked the BCS conferences based on academics.  They even have a number next to the conference name that indicates their rank.  In this ranking, the SEC is 5th, out of 6, and the Big Ten is 2nd (only to the ACC).

Quoting the article:

&gt;The most powerful football conference in the BCS, the SEC, is the second worst academic conference in the nation. The difference between level of play on the field and the level of production in the classroom is too large.

&gt; There is a reason the SEC is vying to become more successful academically, and its lack of production in the classroom is a big part of it. Over the past few years multiple schools has been accused of violating NCAA rules, including Florida, Auburn and, most recently, the South Carolina Gamecocks. ","1338510789"

I told the guard that I had a metal pin in my elbow and that's probably want set it off. He turned away for a second to grab one of those wand scanners to verify my story and while he was looking away I wrapped a handkerchief in my pocket around the pipe and stash and slipped it quickly to one of my friends.

At this point it wouldn't probably have mattered anyway as we had already succeeded in evading the potentially harsh consequences, but when he waved the wand across my arm it went off, verifying the existence of a metal pin in my arm that does not exist. ","1338510790"

Leisure and pleasure are indulgences. You gotta keep the kids fed. But you may find happiness in the smallest accomplishment. When you're rich, the basic needs are met so you concentrate on more esoteric issues. Your happiness may be more comparitive or competitive, even. But deep down, happiness determined by chemistry.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","Since you're just starting out, go get a lesson or three.  Getting a USGA/CPGA certified instructor to show you how to properly hold, take back, and swing the club through impact will pay huge dividends down the line.  Starting lessons as early as possible will hopefully minimize picking up bad habits and put you on a path for fun and successful golf.  

Lots of driving ranges and courses offer beginners golf lessons, either solo or in a group.  Golf courses and clubs are hurting for players these days, so beginners instruction rates can be pretty competitive so shop around a bit if there are a number of places in your city/area that offer lessons.  Do check their websites and see what kind of certification the instructors have.

As for what a good swing looks like?  There are hundreds of clips on youtube with slo-motion analysis of the swings of professionals - just search ""golf swing"" and watch the first 10 hits that come up.  You won't be able to replicate their movements, but the videos should give you a good idea of what the swing motion should look like.

For some comparison, watch this video as well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3kh0bjlYX0 ""The strangest (professional) swings in golf.""  This should give you a good idea of what *not* to do.  Granted, Moe Norman was one of the most accurate golfers ever, but it's not a swing you want to copy when you start out.

And finally, for some old-school reading, I've found these article by Leslie King on swing mechanics to be helpful in getting my game back.  It's pretty wordy and represents an old-school swing that's been taken over by the modern power swing by the pros, but for beginners and amateur golfers it's still a great reference. http://www.golftoday.co.uk/proshop/tuition/lesson1.html ","1338510799"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That's true.  No amount of legislation is ever going to make some people accept that homosexuality is okay.  However, it does neuter one of their biggest arguments, that allowing gay people to marry ""changes the definition"" of marriage, and that it will lead to churches being forced to marry gay people in violation of their religious beliefs.  

Honestly, my main beef with the OP's statements is with this: ""These people are offended, understandably so, when people want to change the definition of marriage. We can't forget about freedom of religion.""

As has been pointed out numerous times in other marriage equality posts around the internet, ""marriage"" has been redefined a number of times.  50 years ago, ""marriage"" in America was between a man and a woman **of the same race**.  That was racists legislating their ""cultural values"" the same way homophobes are trying to do now.  The only reason that gay people can even TRY to redefine ""marriage"" in the legal sense is that the culture has changed to be more accepting of homosexuality in the first place.

So I'm against creating a new word for a union between two same-sex people.  It's marriage.  UNLESS, of course, we define marriage as a RELIGIOUS union, and then the new term (or just use ""civil unions"") is applied in a legal sense for ANY couple (or group, for that matter) who want to apply, regardless of sex/gender.  That way, religious people can have their backwards homophobia without it legally or financially impacting gay people.","1338510808"

"Braveryjerk","t5_2tl1h","####So I was standing in a rather large line at my local Wal-Mart today behind a couple families that I know from when I went to church with my family in year younger. It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, handed him a $5 and told her to keep the change. One of the middle aged women (I knew these people, so I also knew that they all make over 6 digits) grabbed her kid and yelled very loudly, ""See that man? He's acting just like Jesus wants us to."" For some reason this set me off, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, a Slayer shirt, and gym shorts, so it must have been a nice sight. Very loudly, I said ""Like Jesus? Ma'am I'm an atheist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical Christianity is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. I gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.","1338510825"

"GradSchool","t5_2r4r8","I am in a similar situation.  My wife and I have an unplanned 2 month old.  I have a pretty generous stipend (PhD, bioengineering) and that is our sole source of income.  My wife is finishing her last electives for her masters using online courses so she can stay home with the baby, and otherwise we just tightened the budget.  We are fortunate that in AZ a mortgage is cheaper than rent, and we were good enough savers before this to score a nice new house on a short sale.

Get (better) health insurance.  My wife had great benefits because of her situation with the university, but I've seen the hospital bills.  aye!

We are not able to save as much as we did, but we put away anything leftover at the end of the month.  WIC is a big help, you get coupons for stuff like peanut butter, cereal, milk, vegetables, etc.  

I became an avid reader of /r/budgetfood , and /r/Frugal.  Lifestyle changes saved me a lot of money.  We don't go out to eat anymore, its hard with an infant.   Alcohol and entertainment budget shrank.  I drink a couple beers at home and watch netflix rather than drinks and the cinema.

Babies really aren't that expensive (so far, assuming you have health coverage).  Their food is basically free.  Tell your family/friends, and have someone throw you a shower.  We got lots of hand me downs from cousins and friends, stroller, car seat, crib from family.  You can sign up to have diapers delivered from amazon, and it is cheaper than the grocery store.

Be ready to be exhausted a lot of the time.  I go to the lab at 6 in the morning so I can be home by 12 to trade off babysitting duties so my wife can do hw or whatever.  and then we trade back in the evening.

But!  be positive.  I was dreading every day until the due date, and sometimes I feel overwhelmed, but it has been way easier and better than I thought it would be.  My advisor was very nice about it, even offered to baby sit and gave me 2 weeks off after the birth.  He had his kids during his post-doc and understood.  So did some of the other professors I talked to.  And seeing your smiling baby really melts it all away.

The more recent study was basically more rigorous. The found men who identify as bisexual who also have had a history with both sexes behind them.

However I think the methodology lends itself to a bit of a witchhunt. I don't happen to believe that all bisexual people would respond to both sets of stimuli consistently. Maybe they're sexually attracted to one and romantically the other. Or maybe they have shades of asexuality in them. Or maybe they've looked at so much porn, they won't respond to looking at naked people without some hand involvement.

However studies have been done comparing gay men and lesbians with their straight counterparts where it was found the neurological activity associated with being attracted to men is the same regardless of sex, the same as but distinct from attraction to women.

I think she deserves to be forgiven, when she shows that she is actually sorry for what she did (independent of how much money she has payed back.) This however has very little to do with consequences.

If someone stole my bike, I could forgive them, but I would at minimum want my bike back. And possibly more based on their motivation for stealing it.

I haven't read the specific expert advice the government received but [this article](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6041a4.htm?s_) suggests that cocooning when implemented correctly is excellent but actual outcomes in attempting to implement it do not achieve better than moderate results. On that basis the decision could been made that the cocooning program is not sufficiently cost effective to continue to be implemented.

make sure you get to put in her 30 day notice if she is moving out. that means rent is due now for the up coming month. Get to help you find a new roommate. i wouldn't go nuts on her about it, 30 days is normal and she not bound to you on the lease. It might make her kind of a wimp, but not really a shitty friend, however i wouldn't be to trusting of further money type arrangments. 

get her to kick in a few hundred extra as a ""cleaning"", security, something if she hasn't already. It sucks, but here is the time to put on your big girl panties and become an adult, you have to learn to roll with the punches, her timing sucks but bad news never shows up in good times it seems.

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","In one word, yes. I think the whole situation has come about because in day-to-day world practicality is in the forefront how we live and often deeper principles don't have time to come to mind in our fast paced society. May be in general less time to think leads to more choices based on practicality and less about principles. And people don't understand the online system enough to figure out the result of their choices. Lack of privacy is well hidden, especially online. How would people respond if everyday facebook would post in their feed the list of all the sites they visited with the ""Like"" button? So the down side may be that until privacy is not obviously practical it won't get the priority.

What about pointing out to them that they are arguing from simply practical side but you are trying to have compromise between principles and practicality?

The good side is that the number of people who see the value of privacy is increasing. May be people are starting to notice that violation of privacy also brings about loss of their sense of freedom?

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","First, there are actually a lot of anti-racist websites and blogs out there that aren't combative in tone at all. Some examples:

http://stuffwhitepeopledo.blogspot.com

http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/

http://colorlines.com/

http://www.racialicious.com/

http://crunkfeministcollective.wordpress.com/

Second, if you *have* come across a post or conversation that's heated, 99.99% of the time, it's because a privileged person started it by being willfully ignorant, refusing to obey the website's rules, or otherwise exercising their privilege in a shitty way....exactly the way it happens when a shitlord wanders into the Fempire. Similarly, the rage might be due to something like the failure of a marriage equality bill or some cause that's vitally important to someone's life. Or just a nasty incident with a real life shitlord.

So anger and combativeness in social justice circles can't be decontextualized and then criticized for scaring away potential allies. Minorities, social justice activists, SRSters generally do not drop rage bombs for no reason. Assuming we do comes dangerously close to shitlord notions that women are inherently hysterical, feminists are bitches, and minorities are uppity and irrational. We're human, but we're not allowed to have human reactions to shitty situations. That's a privilege, apparently.

Third, the 'hearts and minds' thing *can* be a derail if it's used to scold marginalized people for being angry about their marginalization or for choosing to be aggressive with people who refuse to listen. That is the [tone argument.](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument). 

As the Geek Feminism wiki points out, the argument that you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar is based on the presumption that the privileged person being yelled at is an innocent victim of minority wrath. But:

&gt;If you tread on someone's toes, and they tell you to get off, then get off their toes. Don't tell them to ""ask nicely""

[This](http://theangryblackwoman.wordpress.com/2008/02/12/the-privilege-of-politeness/) is my favorite response to people who bring up the whole, ""being angry is hurting your cause"" argument.

&gt;""Why do I (or anyone) have to be polite when we are offended? If someone offends me with racism...why should I be nice while confronting them? No one has given an answer to me yet because the answer is for the accused’s comfort level...It is a privilege to expect someone to confront you on any kind of prejudice politely! **I go through every day knowing that I will be offended and there is no politeness when it happens but in return I have to be nice? I have to be polite?""**

Basically, if you say something racist and someone points out that it's racist, it's unreasonable and rude of you to demand that they point this out in a way that suits you. You've already done something bad. Apologize instead of looking for a reason to police other people's emotions. Expecting others to treat you nicely *no matter how badly you treat them* is a privilege.

Fourth, it's helpful to conceive of anti-bigotry movements not as monoliths, but composed of distinct branches that perform distinct functions. [This is an excellent explanation of different modus operandi for activists](http://genderbitch.wordpress.com/2009/10/03/a-m-o-communication/). Anger has a place in activism too. 

Finally, the fact that you've mostly come across confrontation so far is probably due to the nature of online discussion, where it's easier for things to escalate quickly. But there are plenty of appeasers and logic bombers and cool-headed education going on out there too. Online communities that are as aggressive to ignorant people and bigots as r/SRS is are a rarity, in my experience.

You'll find the cool-headed conversations, debates, and arguments you seem interested in. You just have to keep reading and researching. HTH.","1338510863"

But Victorino was awarded second base on an obstruction call after he collided with shortstop Omar Vizquel even though contact occurred well onto the infield grass. Victorino eventually scored on a sacrifice fly.

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt;And once one has accumulated enough, they have the capability to dominate everyone and they proceed to game the system.

We're starting at different points here, you are starting at the point of a monopoly as if it is a given, I'm talking about the realistic progression, hence I asked you to name one. I should of clarified, please name any that occurred without state intervention.

Regardless Ill argue from a logical point of view. For them to achieve a monopoly legitimately, they would have necessarily had to have been producing the good/service exceptionally well, so well that competitors can't beat the price, and no investors bother to leverage them as no profits could be forseen. They'd also have to keep them low, as if there is a profit opportunity there would be leveraging of other competitors (hence no real monopoly price as we see with current illegitimate artificial patent/copy right monopolies etc). 

This would need to be followed by an attempt to implement a state-like structure for the purposes of domination. This is where I have the issue with realism. This step requires the contracting of at least the majority of security firms for the coercive purposes, followed by compliance of all their utility suppliers and by all their (sub)contractors, and face boycotts by the population/companies/revolts etc, and convince most of their employees (most are just regular people working as the ""exploitated"" proletariat) to continue. There is also the ability of other businesses hindered by this process to pool resources together and contract the security out. All while continuing a highly profitable monopoly --&gt; which by definition of being legitimate, the profits are much lower than in todays artificial monopolies. With also the huge inefficiencies of a monopoly through the stratification of information (theres a diminishing returns). 

Now Im not saying its not possible, just incredibly unlikely. Contrasted to the infrastructure being in place from the get go.

I consider myself a fairly open minded person; my best friend is an Atheist, as well as the most close-minded, logic-based person I know, but we still have the best conversations. I have a ton of respect for this guy and his views, and I know that there are a lot of Redditors out there who are very similar to him. But then I see a ton of posts on Reddit about how idiotic Christians are, or how a Christian surprised you because they did something semi-intelligent. It just seems contradictory to claim that everyone is equal and whatnot only to turn around and denounce Christians as a whole, simply because some of them have done stupid things. I do not simply assume that every Atheist is a Christian-hating smart-ass that sees himself as president of the world, nor should it be assumed that all Christians are incompetent, redneck, pedophile neanderthals that gold-encrust every centimeter of their church.

You aren't superior/inferior because you believe one thing over another, you are just you. If I converted to Atheism tomorrow would my IQ go up by 50? No. It's ridiculous that there are so many people out there instantly make assumptions about your intelligence or lack thereof because of your religion.

When I was in high school I knew a fair number of people involved in the Lifeteen Mass, which was known for being quite 'charismatic'. Every single one of them since then became either non denominational or atheist. That's the extent of my personal experience with the movement.

Theologically I have a variety of objections. Liturgically I have many more, and perhaps even stronger.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; So when you can't argue with logic you complain about things which everyone thinks are OK?

You've lost me there. Not sure what you're referring to.

&gt; How is 4G 'jumping the gun'? Do you mean 4G or 4G LTE? Do you mean in terms of speed or coverage? Or maybe battery life?

Battery life and coverage. Coverage was slim, meaning it was functionality for a minority of users. And battery life suffered. Until the new chips arrived, it was a net negative for users.

With phones having an average life of a few years, it meant that for the first third or more of the phone's life it wouldn't greatly benefit from the cutting edge tech, but it would still suffer the negatives of carrying that tech.

By the time the networks arrive (not that they really have yet), more efficient chips arrive, and more efficient devices arrive. At which point the early adopters are better off ditching their phones and buying the new models without lasting out the normal 3 year device lifespan.

&gt; You seem to use 'jumping the gun' as the basis for your complaint.

You seem to think I have a complaint. I'm only commenting, not waving my arms in anger.

&gt; One man's jumping the gun is another man's we have it first.

First is no good if it doesn't make the experience better.

Every book, every magazine, every store should have a giant headline out front explaining this.

The possibilities in backpacking equipment are unending and if you can establish a concrete number in all these variables it gives a sense of control; just the wrong kind of control which will ultimately cause you to sacrifice on more important things because ""it won't fit"" or ""I'll buy that too because I have plenty of room"".  Usually it's the latter where a large pack will be preferred and loaded up to the utter glee of the sales rep.

One of these days, I'll build meself a still and use the magic of technology to automate it and the magic of spectroscopy to learn what I'm making.

"pinball","t5_2qyd7","Get the backstory on it. How'd he end up with it? Start it up and make sure it plays. Take the playfield glass off and start a game. Run your fingers across rollover switches and see if they register. Use a pinball and try the slingshots and bumpers to see if they respond. Being an EM its more than likely going to need a wire soldered here and there, some relays cleaned and maybe bumpers or flippers rebuilt. Look in the backbox and under the playfield for any hacks.  Personally if the playfield looks good then its worth getting and putting a little money into. The Boston pinball repair site (http://www.bostonpinball.biz/ebay0512.htm) shows it as being a decent price based on ebay sales.","1338510912"
"running","t5_2qlit","If you want to spend extra money, there are various types of runner's lube, but they are mostly petroleum jelly (Vaseline) and do the same thing.
