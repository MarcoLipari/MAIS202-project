I must have been doing it for a couple minutes when my face started to tingle, I kept breathing and the tingling feeling started to become overwhelming. My face felt like it was boiling but it wasn't hot. Along with the tingling in my face I felt a tightness in my stomach underneath my belly button like nothing I've ever felt before. At this point I decided it was a good idea to stop breathing rapidly and I ran to the bathroom to see if my face was on fire. It wasn't, it was hardly even red, my stomach looked normal. My brain felt cold and my vision was shaking slightly. The tingling slowly subsided and my head felt so clear... it was incredible. I'm just wondering if I possibly built up some kind of energy to uncomfortable levels without a quick way to dissipate it or if I just managed to flush my brain with too much oxygen and that my reaction was normal. Also why did my stomach get tight. Any thoughts?","1364774402"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","My big thing would be to look into ways to save money on food so that your money can go further each month. You said that you like to do more low-key things like go to a park or library, but it's always good to have even just a few dollars of 'fun money' remaining in your budget each month.

I think that couponing to save money on food and get more bang for your buck is your best bet. It's easy to do and there are some great sites for coupons out there that you can print coupons from at home! My favorites are

-Smartsource.com

-Coupons.com (this is one of the biggest)

-Redplum.com

-Thekrazycouponlady.com

Also, your local Sunday newspaper should have coupon inserts in them if you're worried about wasting printer ink and don't want to go that route. I know that's where the majority of coupons people get come from, but I prefer online because I can search specifically for what I like to eat/buy as opposed to just hoping that the Sunday inserts will have what I want.

Likewise, 'liking' facebook pages for different food brands and signing up for email news letters can get you coupons - tons of brands (like Uncle Ben's rice, Gilette Venus razors, coffee mate coffee creamer, and many more) will give out exclusive coupons to their FB 'fans' and newsletter subscribers!

I'd also suggest looking online at the coupon/price matching policies for the grocery stores near you. For example, Walmart will happily accept coupon specifically made for other stores (even Target, CVS, Walgreens, etc), and price match ads for other local stores. My local Walmart will price match the ads for any stores in a 30 mile radius! I just print the pages I want off of the competitor store's website and bring them with me to the register. (Other stores will do this as well, but I think that Walmart is the most lenient.) 

Since you're in the south look into double coupon policies - that's where a store will double a coupon up to a certain amount, so your $1 off coupon is magically worth $2 at the register. I don't know how many stores do that, but it seems like every woman on that 'extreme couponing' show is from TN, MS, TX, etc so it's something to consider.","1364774403"

Bad management is a problem, I agree. However, that doesn't justify mindless tax cuts. And although I agree that exorbitant spending is unsustainable, I don't think that is what most democratic governments do.

Capital doesn't appear out of nowhere. The total amount of capital is fixed, and is only redistributed among a society's persons. You don't make money, you get it from someone else. Big corporations use society's resources and labour, and get to keep the profit. It has been known since the rise of economic science that progressive tax systems are not only morally just, but reduce social inequality and allow a better standard of living for the whole of society. This is not me saying, just ask any capitalist economist.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;It doesn't. Why should it?

In order to deny infinite regress it must.

&gt;The second premise states that an infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite,  The point seems obvious enough, for if there has been a sequence composed of an infinite number of events stretching back into the past, then the set of all events in the would be an actually infinite set.

&gt; But manifest as this may be to us, it was not always considered so. The point somehow eluded Aristotle himself, as well as his scholastic progeny, who regarded past events as a potential infinite.  Aristotle contended that since things in time come to exist sequentially, an infinite never exists at any one moment only the present actually exists. Similarly Aquinas after confessing the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite nevertheless proceeded to assert the existence of the infinite regress of past events is possible.  This is because the series of past events does not exist in actuality.  Past events do not now exist, and hence do not constitute an infinite number of actually existing things.  The series is only potentially infinite, not actually infinite, in that it is constantly increasing by the addition of new events.

&gt;These Aristotelian thinkers are clearly presupposing an A-Theory of time and an ontlology of presentism, according to which the only temporal items which exist are those that presently exist.  On a B-Theory of tenseless time, since there is ontological parity among all events, there can be no question that an infinite temporal regress of events is composed of an actually infinite number of events. Since all events are equally real, the fact that they exist (tenselessly) at different times loses any significance

*Natural Theology* page 115

Suffice it to say that a large part of the argument against a past infinite universe requires A Theory.  Other arguments might be offered but they all have reasonable escapes (namely the appeal to entropy and Borde-Guthe-Vilenkin Theorem).  Disallowing an actual infinite procession of events is very important to how robust the actual argument is, and an actual infinity existing in a series of tenseless moments cannot mesh with this line of reasoning.

&gt;That ""there is no prior state"" is already what the kalam argument says in the first place.

It does not.  The three supports of the first premise are:

a) Intuition that no things comes are produced from nonexistence.

b) That ""nonexistence"" holds no preference as to creating universes

c) Disagreement with current observation of things (especially universes) not coming into existence without cause

These all presuppose that a state of ""nonexistence"" is a thing which it makes sense to talk about.  ","1364774408"

The drop must have occurred outside or in a common area. Maybe it caused an electrical disturbance on the unit 2 side?

Edit
Second reply. Per entergy press release http://www.entergy.com/news_room/newsrelease.aspx?NR_ID=2693 it looks like there was an electrical issue that occurred as a result of the dropped load. This would imply unit 2 scammed on generator lockout or reactor coolant pump trip. Emergency generators started to repower the unit 1 and 2 vital busses. The unusual event was likely due to the loss of offsite power (LOOP)

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","THE BIRTH OF REGULATION
Vanderbilt, Carnegie, Rockefeller, and others are often remembered as monopolists, yet they radically lowered prices. As early entrants into their markets, they fought their way through chaotic competition by strictly controlling costs and increasing efficiency at every step. By making transportation, steel, and oil far cheaper and more widely available, they contributed to the rapid growth the American economy, and the creation of tremendous wealth.

Not everyone was happy with these developments. The rise of large companies also gave rise to a new class of lifelong wage workers (by contrast with earlier generations, which had anticipated owning their farms or shops). Unionization and strikes increased rapidly after the Civil War. Starting in the 1870s, workers demanded laws to limit the workday to eight hours.

Farmers, too, felt helpless before the railroads—“the greatest and most powerful monopoly on the face of the earth,” in the words of one orator. “They let the public feel their power in the fuel of their kitchens, the bread of their bodies, the material for their houses.” Cheaper transportation integrated the national marketplace, putting farmers in distant regions into direct competition with each other. And railroads gave discounts to large, long-distance shippers; farmers who sent their harvest and livestock over short distances to local markets resented paying a higher rate per mile.

As with workers’ demands for eight-hour laws, agrarian radicals wanted government action. One council of Grangers declared, “We hold that a state cannot create a corporation that it cannot thereafter control.” Another speaker said, “The time would come when the management of the roads must fall into the hands of the public.”

This call for public regulation, even ownership, marks a major shift in politics. Gone were the days when Jacksonian radicals wanted the government to stay out of the economy, to allow individuals to rise on their merits. Now those on the left embraced government intervention as a means of countering the new power of large corporations, which towered over the economy as no businesses had before the Civil War.

It took decades for this kind of regulation—especially federal regulation—to emerge. Yet even before the death of Cornelius Vanderbilt in January 1877, the modern argument over private enterprise and the role of government had clearly emerged. In a sense, it does not matter whether one sees Vanderbilt and his peers as robber barons or captains of industry; it is the fact that we argue about them as one or the other that matters most. They not only changed the way we live—they changed the way we think.","1364774423"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","You don't combine efforts or pool resources merely to feign moral superiority.  The whole point of non-hierarchical organizing is empowering the individuals within.

And, generally speaking, anarchist support / assist the subjects in liberating themselves.

Most contemporary unions are not anarchist, or anarcho-syndicalist rather, but that's irrelevant.  Organized labor exist to counter the disproportionate control of organized capital.  Another means is worker-owned wherein decision-making control resides with the workers rather than extraneous shareholders.  Similarly with cohousing being a means of relieving dependence on lenders / renteirs.  Unless you lead an exceedingly isolated and austere lifestyle, there's nothing self-sufficient about it.  Put simply, there are hundreds of millions of laborers behind the commodities you utilize.","1364774424"

Ken Jeong of the Hangover? Ok. What evidence do I have that this is much larger than one mans résumé?

You are one of the first, if not the first, to bring the plight of Chinese rail workers to my table. Nobody is thinking about that today. Nobody. They'll think VT Killer before that. How's that for machismo?

Writing this while in East Asia as a white America, those same themes you mention are ever-present: the Momma's boy versus the Marlboro Man. It's cultural, and it has weight because there is indeed an established cultural history that reinforces it. Did you have a Tiger Mom? I know I didn't.

Lastly, I can confirm that what you describe does give a pattern of Xenophobic behavior, because people do the same thing to foreigners in Korea. Dunkin Donuts currently has a marketing campaign featuring a zany wired white guy who has clearly drank too much coffee. Foreigners are given comedy roles as the pratfall and slapstick guy like its a minstrel show. So, given your description, I feel like we're brothers ;)

My advice is to pay attention to what's actually happening now: pay attention to the movies coming out of China and Korea, and Hollywood's willingness to adapt them. You should promote your country's native film industry whenever possible cuz there's a lot of interesting stuff in there.

It's still going to take a while for the Midwest and Deep South to accep a leading Asian man, and Hollywood knows this.

In any case, you really only need one CB who can cover a talented, big receiver because almost no one has two of them.

Exactly. The social connotation behind the word is important.

Being called gay is an insult to straight people because they correlate it to a lesser person of being. (Not necessarily conscious assumption, again it's the social stigma behind it). Which is why when someone calls me gay, I don't take offense, I just let them know I'm actually straight.

The only reason APR is listed is because when marketing financial products you're legally required to do so, even if APR has absolutely no relevance which is why Wonga makes great effort to inform people about it: http://www.wonga.com/money/is-this-apr-expensive/

The sort of person that uses a Wonga loan is the sort of person that a) needs money *fast* b) needs a small amount of money to  help them c) has no ability to gain credit through a more mainstream lender (eg: their bank, a credit card). These people often default; the reason the charges are high (but not very high) is that Wonga loses money on the people that fail to pay.

They were using Katy Perry as an example somewhere in this part of the thread. To get an idea of where I'm coming from, I do not consider her to be skinny. She is a normal weight and has very healthy proportions. The VS angels are what I would consider skinny, but not very skinny, and they're more capable of running fast and far and lifting a bunch as most larger people haha.

At the gym I see many slightly overweight to somewhat more overweight women doing say, forty goddamn pounds on the hip adductor. I can do 130 pounds. I weigh 108 and I my exercise is very moderate.

"college","t5_2qh3z","Early (decision) is truly a double-edged sword. On one hand, the chances of getting in, especially to top ranked schools, jumps up considerably. However if you are rejected then you cannot reapply for admission under regular decision. You can also be deferred in which case you can apply again. However, you must also realize that you need to sign a contract that is BINDING. When you ED a school and get in you MUST go. I'm not even sure how you would go about getting out of ED without it ending very, very badly for you. You also are not allowed to apply to any other schools in the ED process otherwise the school reserves the right to rescind your application. This is why my college counselor told me ED should really be reserved for your ""dream school"", or a school you really, really like but don’t have as much of a shot at in RD.

There is also early action. Early action is non-binding, and you can EA to as many schools as you like. However I don't think EA increases your chances as much to get in as ED but I do not know about admissions statistics for EA as fewer schools use EA compared to ED. 

Some schools also have ED II where they have a second round of early decision prior to the regular decision deadline. This is just another shot at ED but later in the admissions process.

In terms of ""chances"", it only helps you, but there are just some major caveats to it. You cannot get cold feet, and you have to be content with the fact that if you are rejected, you need to move on. Don't waste ED, on either a school you are unsure you'd be happy at or a school you already had a good shot at getting in to.

Of course obesity correlates to higher instances of mortality.

Yes, and there's people unironically claiming that cutting down trees causes literal pain to plants.  There's crazies everywhere.

It removes the, ""well, I'm not perfect, and won't be perfect, so why even try?"" mentality.

If you continue the relationship, even if you've learned your lesson and *never* cheat again, you absolutely *must* tell.

If cheating is a possible dealbreaker for your partner, in essence you remove his/her right to make that decision for him/herself.  What's more, your partner may have suspicions, may have noticed your guilt/change in behavior/etc., and may need the truth no matter how painful it is.

Trout is 21 and the league will catch up to him... Whether that means a true sophomore slump or just a drop off I cannot say. The kid is a stud but its just hard to see him as good as he was last year consistently.

Braun brings his second PED accusation to the table, doubt it affects this season but you never know. 

Both these gentlemen are OF, the deepest position in the sport.  

Miggy is by far the safest and best choice at #1, why?

He plays 3rd, a weak position. He is a better offensive player then every player mentioned (not counting steals), including Cano. He is apart of one of the best offenses in baseball right now. And he rarely gets hurt... Oh and consistency, name the player who has been more consistent then him.

It would be one thing if every post was viewed and voted on equally like in an actual democratic environment. Unfortunately that isn't how reddit works.

It is because the content of a picture can be absorbed so quickly that makes them a problem. On reddit votes per minutes is everything. The chances of something making it to the front page depends on how quickly it receives its first 10 upvotes which are weighted as high as the next 100 which are weighted as high as the next 1000. The faster something can be absorbed the quicker it gets upvoted and the more likely it is to make it to the front page. The longer it takes to absorb the content the more likely it is to slip away from the new page before it gets upvoted.

The more submissions per minutes the bigger a problem it becomes because content leaves the new page much quicker. As I said in another post it isn't a big problem yet but as more people join the more karma whoring posts show up. They move to the front page while articles, videos, and albums that would have started interesting debate slip away never to be seen again.

If you want a good comparison of two subreddits about the same topic where one bans pictures and the other doesn't check out the difference between /r/gaming and /r/games.

I looked outside to see a motorcycle driver on the ground. I got out the phone, dialed 911 and ran to the scene. He was coherent and lifted the face shield of his helmet. He said his ankle hurt. I looked down at his ankle, kind of pinned under the bike, and his bone was completely sticking out. Like the ankle was separated and just hanging on by a couple strands. He asked me how bad it was and I lied. I said, ""it looks fine man, you'll be ok, just hang out until EMS gets here."" I felt so bad for him. He had leathers and a helmet on so that was a plus. The biggest kicker of this story is that while I was kneeling next to him I heard a phone ring. I looked around and saw a cell phone about 10-15 ft from him. The motorcyclist said it was his phone so I ran over and grabbed it. I answered the phone and the voice on the other line said, ""Hey Mr. X this is John from Harley Davidson just was checking in to see how your new bike is doing."" I just hung up the phone...and I told him it was a solicitor.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;That's not true! Marijuana is more than 20 times more harmful than a cigarette. Now, you might say... that seems like a lot! But that's trusting the same researchers who are playing on your fears of cancer. The fact is, everyone is going to die of something, and as we live longer thanks to advanced in genetically modified organisms and new food sources, we should expect the rate of cancer death to go up. Powerful lobbying forces have linked that with tobacco, when really, it can be blamed on the consequences of our modern lifestyle. Tobacco is a natural plant, smoked by the American Indians for thousands and thousands of years. Yet, there is no data suggesting that pre-contact American Indians had high rates of cancer.

&gt;So even these duplicitous charlatans tell you that marijuana is extremely harmful. Case closed.

This is a top level comment is unscientific (makes a broad claim without linking to anything reputable, comes off as a hand-waving argument), contains anecdotal evidence:

&gt;Tobacco is a natural plant, smoked by the American Indians for thousands and thousands of years. Yet, there is no data suggesting that pre-contact American Indians had high rates of cancer,

and blatant laymen speculation:

&gt;The fact is, everyone is going to die of something, and as we live longer thanks to advanced in genetically modified organisms and new food sources, we should expect the rate of cancer death to go up.

You see, Reddit was a primitive society on the internet (What people used before the Helyion Network) through the majority of the 21st century. It had its own clans that were specified things, like /r/funny or /r/wtf, although these ""*subreddits*"" might be just one huge sarcastic joke.  Some subreddits focused on peacefully spreading their ideas, like /r/athiesm.  /r/SRS is another great example on this.  They were renowned for their understanding, and kindhearted discussions and weren't biased at all.  Regardless of what subreddit they prefered, all reddit-tors enjoyed ""may-mays"" and lulz.  They were also particularly fond of another social site, 9Gag.com.  These two groups got along extremely well, considering all the content that they share.  Reddit-tors enjoyed kidding with their pal ""OP"".  If you look on almost any thread, there is banter calling Op a faggot, which is clearly light-hearted kidding among chums.

I also have to say sorry for all of the typos and such, I lack a correcting program on my computer and English is not my native language. 


The quote should work quite well as the order was unclear. Edmure is still beneath Robb and does what he is commanded, so he should be looked upon as a soldier even thought he commands the forces of RR.


Anyways as of the order, it is pretty unclear to me. It does not say anything about not engaging the lannisters. Edmure was never informed  by Robb what the order **hold Riverrun** really meant, and that is a crucial mistake no matter how you look on it. I would have blamed Edmure if the order was **Holder Riverrun only if it is attacked, but otherwise leave Tywin to march through your lands and kill your smallfolks.**


Robb worked on the assumption that people would understand the plan that he made *after* leaving RR


It's not exactly obvious either. For all Edmure knows the lannisters still hold the two passes out of the Westerlands, unless you go far to the south of Lannisport. Robb looked like he was trapped there. And Robb only had 6,000 horse. Tywin probably had more, as well as lots of foot, including archers who can be lethal to horsemen without footmen to guard them etc. Tywin still had most of the castles in the west, would be able to raise more men etc. Why should Edmure guess Robb wanted to confront Tywin in the west. It doesn't make much sense before it's explained by the Blackfish. 


Anyways we know that the Tyrells must have been already preparing to march of KL to support it, the question is really if they would have done it even thought Tywin wasn’t with them.  If that is so it would not matter if Tywin marched into the Westerlands.  


Anyways my question is how you can blame Edmure for doing what he did on such vague orders when he was not informed better? If it is due to blaming him for the RW, then you should remember that he was sacrificing himself to a Frey to attempt to mend the bond that his liege lord managed to shatter,  it is also important to remember that the Young Wolf lost loads of horsemen by fucking over the Freys (and moral of troops) so even if Tywin went into the trap he would outnumber the Young Wolf, and probably be awaiting some sort of engagement seeing as he gets report where the Young Wolf ravage his lands.  There is also the fine opportunity of  Tywin winning, and even then people would blame Edmure. It is important to remember these three things about Edmure: 


1.	We only have Cat`s PoV from the battle, which are second hand and her views on him have been affected by always remembering him as clumsy, naïve and all that shit.
2.	He is to good a person to really be a lord, however he still did as he was ordered.  To *hold Riverrun* , he had not gained any new orders such as letting Tywin march through his lands because Robb or Blackfish did not dare sending a raven or a outrider.
3.	**He cannot read minds and would therefore not know about this “masterplan” that would only give the small northern army some defense advantage, making Tywin bleed in the engagement, but we have no idea if they would have won.**


Heck, we do not even know if the Blackfish or the Young Wolf really had a plan, it could be something that they made up in an attempt to win back some of the allies that Robb married by his useless political moves. Or else they come off as to drunk on their former glory that they think they would have won the fight no matter how many more men the Lannisters had.

As for not hurting yourself, you should pay attention to your body, it will generally complain if you're doing something wrong, though some things might be fine after getting used to them. If you know somebody with knowledge of biomechanics get them to take a look at what you do, they might have some insights.

If you lack somebody to practice with you could buy whichever weapon you want to do (ask about where to buy a good one when you decide) and try some solo practice. It's of course not complete training by far, but it gets you swinging the weapon around and used it. Feel free to beat on a tire, attach a rod of some sort on a spring on a wall for some basic binding practice  or check grauenwolf's post about making a pell.

If you give us languages and perhaps a specific weapon we might be able to help more. Also check this for texts:

"depression","t5_2qqqf","When I'm in public or in social settings and someone does something that irks me or annoys me, I get really extreme about it in my mind. I think about violently stabbing them to death or kicking their faces in. I've simmered it down a little to just visualizing a shiny ax getting sharped against a stone wheel, getting it really really sharp. Sometimes I then think about using it to hatchet someone to death but I try to stop at the sharpening.

Not sure if this is because of my depression. Taking public transportation is the worst for me (when people can't move into the fucking train to let other people on, especially when the conductor is repeatedly announcing for them to do so, that gets me extremely angry and I want to scream ""JUST MOVE THE FUCK IN FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, THERE'S TONS OF ROOM, STOP BEING FUCKING IMBECILES"")

I've never done physical harm to anyone and I don't think I could even if I tried (I'm 100lbs and am a 22 y/o girl), I just have a lot of pent up anger and frustrations. I need to find an outlet for it, maybe exercising or something. Problem is that I'm a wimp when it comes to climate (live in New England, too cold to run) and I can barely get out of bed some days, let alone exercise. 

Humans are disgusting, vile creatures IMO. I can look at someone and see their hair foliciles and just want to burn their flesh. These aren't healthy thoughts, I know. I've talked to my therapist and he doesn't really have any suggestions except to find something to channel my anger in a healthy way (duh). The problem, again, is getting me to do something.. I'll *want* to do it, there's just this mental block that stops me from acting upon it.","1364774502"

When I started off I was pretty uneven but did well a lot of the time. Now that I've started taking it seriously again I've improved hugely. I have a couple of bad nights, of course, but I usually do well. Thursday night there were 25 people in the crowd, and about 20 were comedians who had heard my stuff before. I thought I was going to eat shit. But, surprisingly, I killed (as much as an open miker with a year's experience can, anyway.) It's really hard to tell how or why these things happen. 

My style is really personal and Marc Maron-like in the way that I just talk about my thoughts and feelings. I don't really experiment much, but I appreciate those who do. I have a few goofy one-liners I have just to throw in there on occasion and one time I impersonated a bad comedian in order to make fun of shitty comedy, but usually I keep to the personal stuff. Last night one of my comedian friends told me, ""You have a really bright, sunny and happy look about you, so the audience doesn't expect you to be bitter. And then you start talking and it turns out you are, and it catches them by surprise."" That statement about sums it up.

So far I suppose I've been lucky, not having to pay any customs fees. If I were to buy these exact same bras in local stores, I would be paying well over $100 each for them - you just need to get smart about where you shop!

Before it I was very energetic and outgoing but I was also very emotional and overly sensitive and was always fighting with everybody and felt like a maniac. After about a month on this stuff I have kind of stopped going out everyday and doing a million things and have just started chilling in the house and watching TV and playing video games and lounging around with my GF. I feel much less enthusiasm to fill my day with 10 different events and am happy doing nothing all day. But on the plus side, I am much calmer and feel more in control and have a much brighter outlook on everything. I no longer start constant fights with my girlfriend or feel manic or overly-emotional. I mean a couple of days ago i actually sat calmly on a bench with my girlfriend for hours and just ""people-watched"" customers in the mall playing with their kids etc. I havent been able to sit still like that and chill in 10 years. So its a trade off I guess.

She also has a problem with pulling her hair out, from anywhere on her body really and eating it. The problem hasn't gone away with the laser treatments. 

Are you pulling the hair out of your eyebrows for aesthetic reasons? Do you think your eye brows are bad and you're trying to fix them? Do you use tweezers or are you pulling at it with your fingers? Or is it a nervous habit, do you find yourself picking at your eye brows when you're reading or studying and don't notice?

 If it's just an aesthetic reason I really don't think it's trichtillomania. I would try waxing before the laser hair removal if it's an aesthetic desire. It will last you like 3 weeks and it's only like 7-10$ a visit. Plus it won't leave you with nasty scarring for a week or two after you get it done. 

If it's not a certain aesthetic that you're seeking then the laser therapy will do nothing. If it's a stress habit (it looks like it) counseling is the best route to go. If you're at university they should have free counseling sessions. If it's some kind of body dysmorphia then once your eyebrows are fixed there is the high risk of you finding something else to fixate on. 

I would absolutely recommend counseling, and using this fundraiser to help you with that. 

Good luck :) ","1364774504"

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","I'll be fine, it is just disheartening seeing all my straight friends easily finding their partners, getting married, having kids, having couple nights out and inviting me because they feel sorry for me. And then yes, having the class of bear thrown upon simply based off of the way I look. I am very unhappy; even after losing 50lbs I'm still too fat and still considered a bear, I think its a very degrading label actually. To each their own but I've struggled with weight my whole life and was tormented as a child for being overweight, now as an adult I still get teased and rejected because of my weight. I'm learning to control my weight and I made steps in the right direction, My therapist has tried to shed a more positive light on the bear community for me but I don't think fat should be worshiped and idolized just like I don't think unrealistic body types for most people should be but that is the society in whole we in. 

I don't see the bear the community as a lower class, but I'm not attracted to huskier men, I don't see them as cuddly or any nicer then anyone else. I don't like being fat and I'm trying to change but yet I'm still forced to be part of sub culture I really want nothing to do with. I don't want to be associated with a group of people that see an extreme unhealthy lifestyle as sexy. I mean don't get me wrong, I don't mind a man with a few extra pounds and I actually really love body hair, but why does hairy usually equal fat? It doesn't have to be but normally the guys that I like I'm to heavy for them because they don't go for bears...well I'm not a bear. I don't know how many time I've gone to the bars put myself out there only to go home feeling dejected and self loathing because all night long I'm told I'm to fat. I've developed quite the wall around me I know, its why I'm therapy I need to remove the negativity, grow a thicker skin and get back out there and I am, just because I'm working on myself doesn't mean I need to be alone while do so. 

We have our pride planning comity and the AIDS project which I am getting involved in our LGBT center closed due to lack of funding, there was a gay bowling leauge but due to lack of support it disbanded. I was involved with the gay mens choir which is actually nationally known and amazing but as fate would have it what I actually enjoyed was taken away from me, I ended up with nodes and well goodbye singing voice. There is also a first friday breakfast club for gay businessmen but I cannot get the time off work plus an ex of mine from a long time ago who hurt me very badly attends the club and well I cant see him due the restraining order I have out against him. My past choice in men, wont be making that mistake again hopefully. Our gay community basically revolves around the bars, we have 3 and that's about it. I've tried to start other gay groups here but there's never any support because it does not involve the bars. I just don't seeing moving as an option, my family, my friends, my life here outside of dating I have a very good life and I'm involved in many activities but I'm usually the only gay person and the gay guys that I do meet don't want anything to do with me.

The egoism in Objectivism this is not. It's a much more mellow egoism that posits that people that one cares about become extensions of the self. So you're ""selfish"" in this sense when you do kind things for your husband, wife, children, or friends.

Everything currently called marriage in a secular civil sense would be labeled ""civil union"". The term marriage would be reserved only for religious ceremonies, as determined by the religious organizations. People that get married in a religious ceremony would be both married and civil union-ed, but the term marriage will be meaningless outside of the religious community. 

In this way there is no ""separate but equal"" problem. Everyone has the same legal rights and is treated the same way by the law. But people that are concerned with ""sacramental marriage"" can maintain the distinction.","1364774509"

Yeah, they'll let you hang around with them, but just because they see you as their personal slave, and don't expect you to ask something in return.

This is what you assholes call the friendzone. No, you know what? The friendzone, if it exists, is a place where you end up after having announced your intentions with the woman, and she says ""Well, I'd rather be friends"".

Animated like this, of course.

A lot of my favourites I can't see translating well to live action. Joe the Barbarian, I Kill Giants, Blacksad, Le Grand Mort, Daisy Kutter... There are a lot of things I'd like to see adapted, with the proviso that the animation style was consistent with the art style of the comic itself. If I had to pick something for live action though, it'd probably be either Green Arrow: Year One or something from the Vertigo Crime series.

That said, overall, L'Incal would be my pick, like I said above.","1364774525"

I like the fact that it is a small, compact country (compared to the US) but that there are so many different towns and cities and regions which are instantly distinguishable from one another. Each area or region has its own culture and way of doing things, in stark comparison to the US which is huge and requires you to travel hundreds of miles before seeing any differences on a similar scale. I also like the fact that it is in the middle of Europe, which is amazing if you appreciate history, culture, and travel. I can get in my car or on a train and travel just a couple of hours in any direction and be in either France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, Czech, Poland, Denmark, Netherlands, etc. In the US it can take a full day just to get to the next state where everything is pretty much the same except for the license plates.

Germans are also, in my opinion, much more informed about what is happening not only in their own country, but also in the world, than most people in the US. I know it may sound like a stereotype of the oblivious American, but there is a lot of truth to it. But for me the biggest positive is the fact that they basically have their opinions and, for the most part, keep them to themselves. It's not at all common here to see people going mental discussing different political parties, or to have people try to force their religion (or lack of it) in everyones face. I have to say, as someone originally from a country where anything to do with politics is almost guaranteed to degenerate into in-your-face name calling and bumper sticker ""logic"", it is very nice.

I don't do anything so unusual when I'm not working. Every once in a while I will take a weekend trip to somewhere like Switzerland, or to some other nearby place. The biggest difference to the States is, like I said, that I can go someplace completely different over the weekend whereas I need at least a week to do the same thing in the US.","1364774530"

**Ingredients**

**Cupcakes**

•	10 tablespoons (11/4 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature

•	3/4 cup sugar

•	2 large eggs, room temperature

•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract

•	1 tablespoon rose water

•	1 cup plus 3 tablespoons all purpose flour

•	1 teaspoon baking powder

•	2 tablespoons almond milk (or regular milk)

**Frosting**

•	12 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature

•	2 cups powdered sugar

•	2 tablespoons rose water (you can use less if you prefer, I went crazy)

•	1 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Preparation**

**For cupcakes:**

•	Preheat oven to 350°F. Line 8 standard (1/3-cup) muffin cups with paper liners. Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in medium bowl until fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Mix in flour, then almond milk. Divide batter among prepared cups (about 1/3 cup for each). Bake until golden brown and tester inserted into center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Transfer cupcakes to rack and cool completely.

For frosting:

•	Using electric mixer, beat butter and sugar in another medium bowl until smooth. Beat in vanilla and rose water. After frosting has cooled, spread it over cupcakes, or use piping bag with large petal tip to make roses.

No, changing the legal definition of marriage won't directly change what the sacrament of marriage means in the Catholic church, but marriage was originally just a religious function. When the government chose to give benefits to ""married"" couples, there wasn't any confusion as to what married meant. It was a man and a woman, and it was reflective of the marriage that was occurring in the church.

Times have changed since then, marriage is (soon to be) no longer representative of the sacramental marriage in the church. Whether gay couples are allowed to marry or not doesn't change my contention that the government should not ""own"" the word ""marriage"" in any right.

"Bioshock","t5_2shl2","There's as much, if not more, evidence that it's a figment of his guilt ridden imagination as it is her hopeful one. That he has invented this whole fantasy of saving her in order to ease his guilty conscience. Everything in the game starts and ends with Booker. There's nothing more cohesive than that. The very first scene of the game is Booker and the very last scene of the game is again Booker's eyes and this time having apparently rescued her. You can hear her, but it's not certain she's there. Everything is experienced through his understanding of the world and when she's not there he still is. The story is Booker's not just Elizabeth's and him imagining that the daughter he abandoned is some wonderful creature who can change the world is a pretty normal fatherly instinct. That he would imagine her being special is nothing amazing. She could go anywhere in space and time and yet always seems to return to a place he can get to her - that sounds like something he would invent in order to 'repay the debt' through heroic actions. Either way I'm just trying to make a point. I don't think either him or her inventing the whole thing is true. Or at the very least I'll be very disappointed if that's the case.

Regarding the nosebleeds again, I agree with you that they're primarily happening to people experiencing trauma but that's explained by the standard theory that they're remembering some of the other universe memories and it's causing the reaction. Elizabeth is involved (and Booker and Comstock and the Luteces) but it's not because she is dreaming it all, it's because she is instigating all this trans-dimensional travel and causing different incongruent memories to blend with each other. Being alive when you've got the strangest feeling you died must be horrific. People aren't supposed to be able to do this and it's not without consequences.

Disregarding Booker's initial nosebleed doesn't help because it is evidence. You can't legitimately explain it away with ""It was just a nosebleed"" or ""Comstock forsaw he'd have a nosebleed at that time and said some stuff to annoy him before it happened"". That's not what the game is about. Booker's nosebleed was triggered the same way as all the others. Comstock sparked a memory in Booker that contradicts what he ""knows"" to be reality.","1364774545"

Yet it's been stated that if we were to look at the universe from the point of view of something in a different super-cluster (ie. something very far away), it would look exactly the same. Unless the universe is ~~donut-like~~ *torus*-shaped, this should not be.

&gt;Thus, the question I have is if Catelyn went out of her way to mistreat Jon in the past -- and which form this might have taken -- or if she rather tried to avoid and ignore him?

&gt;""Mistreatment"" is a loaded word. Did Catelyn beat Jon bloody? No. Did she distance herself from him? Yes. Did she verbally abuse and attack him? No. (The instance in Bran's bedroom was obviously a very special case). But I am sure she was very protective of the rights of her own children, and in that sense always drew the line sharply between bastard and trueborn where issues like seating on the high table for the king's visit were at issue.

&gt;And Jon surely knew that she would have preferred to have him elsewhere.

Whenever you talk about what temperature is comfortable without talking about the humidity in the air you are not speaking to the full representation of how our body's not only perceive comfort but actually cool themselves.

A room that is at 90% humidity that at 80 degrees is going to be a lot ""hotter"" than a room that is at 40% humidity that is also at 80 degrees.

Here in Florida it is common, right around this time of year to boot!, for it to be in the 70's but the humidity is in the 80-90% range.  Making it what we mostly call ""muggy"".

The title of the news article referenced was actually changed from just ""Canadian oil"" to ""Exxon's Canadian oil,"" so it's less evident now, but there's an angle to this story in the US that's very much opposed to Canada, even though the Americans are the ones that are most behind the construction of the pipeline.

"programming","t5_2fwo","A functor is an informal term in C++ used to define a struct that has overloaded its callable operator

    struct FunctorA {
      bool operator ()(const T&amp; param);
    };

    struct FunctorB {
      bool operator ()(const T&amp; param);
    };

Now consider two use cases, one case would be a function that takes as a parameter a functor and applies it to each element in a vector, well the common solution to that problem is to use parametric polymorphism aka templates:

    template&lt;typename F, typename T&gt;
    void Apply(F f, const std::vector&lt;T&gt;&amp; v);

And then you can use it like so:

    Apply(FunctorA(), myVector);

However, let's say you want to store a list of functors in a container:

    std::vector&lt;???&gt; functors;
    functors.push_back(FunctorA());
    functors.push_back(FunctorB());

In this case parametric polymorphism doesn't work, so instead we need to use a technique called type erasure which is what boost::function does, it basically allows us to define an ad-hoc relationship between otherwise unrelated classes and in doing so provides a common interface.

    std::vector&lt;boost::function&lt;bool ()&gt;&gt; functors;
    functors.push_back(FunctorA());
    functors.push_back(FunctorB());

So basically, boost::function is a storage mechanism, it allows us to store things which behave like functions in a uniform manner, but the things we actually intend to store are still functors themselves.

And boost::bind is basically a special kind of functor that takes an existing functor and 'binds' parameters to it, effectively reducing the number of parameters of the original functor.","1364774569"

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","My impressions from the game:

-Duke had no answer for Louisville's top of the key pick and roll. I'm surprised K was not able to adjust to such a simple set.

-I did not know Dieng had that kind of range on his jumper. 

-I liked that when Duke broke the press, they settled into half court offense rather than continuing to push the ball. Louisville was clearly looking to bait Duke into a chaotic, up and down game, and for the most part Duke kept the tempo slower. 

-Louisville's shot blocking was impressive, Cook never adjusted to it.

-Duke fouled multiple three-point shooters. Unacceptable. 

-Louisville got contributions on offense from everyone, and Smith and Siva did a great job finishing at the rim from odd angles.

Kudos to Louisville on the win. I really liked this Duke team, I thought they had five great pieces that fit well together. Very sad to see it end this way, and to realize that Mason, Seth and Ryan have all played their last college game.

If you could somehow simulate it 100 times i think it would be something like 80-90% of the time this team is a top 4 seed/legit contender. This season though, everything that could go wrong, went wrong. Massive amount of injuries (losing Nash, the guy who was supposed to run or co-run our offense after 1 game, Dwight playing way below what he normally plays at because of his back injury and he also tears his labrum in his shoulder. Losing Steve Blake most of the season and having to use Duhon/Morris. Pau being out most of the season or playing injured. Losing are most productive bench player in Jordan Hill the list goes on and on.) Also having a Coaching change 5 games into the season and now having to learn entirely new offensive/defensive schemes during the season with little time to practice and again tons of injures. Hard to build chemistry on the court with all that shit happening so this season doesn't really surprise me.

I think if this squad was healthy and had a better coach they would be fine next year. Hell, i wouldn't be against trading Pau as well for some youth/athleticism at the 3/4 position as well. (would probably help overall). The ultimate of course would being able to bring back PJax but with Jimbo Buss at the helm i have my doubts. ","1364774578"

"economy","t5_2qhpn","As an actuary, I always like to chime in on these conversations.  I am in full agreement with you that Social Security faces serious fiscal challenges.  The fact is that on a present value basis, the fund is insolvent, however, it is not quite as bad as some may lead you to believe, nor is it as good as others would lead to believe.  The truth, as always, is somewhere in the middle.

First, and foremost, I would like an opportunity to respond to your reason #2.  I would like to point out that the questions raised by the authors of that Op-Ed, and the methods they used to calculate their ""life tables"" and expected fiscal shortfalls, were inaccurate or questionable for a number of reasons.  I would highly suggest you read the following response from the Office of the Chief Actuary regarding the Op-Ed for a thorough discussion (Paul Krugman called this response and ""academic takedown"" of the article, and I don't even really like Paul Krugman in general):

http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/pdf_notes/note150.pdf

With that said, I would also encourage anyone interested to read an issue brief on the 2011 report, available for public discourse, released by the American Academy of Actuaries (the governing body of Actuaries in the US that determines standards of practice and whose members are considered capable of signing off on regulatory filings) available here:

http://www.actuary.org/pdf/SocialSec_Trustees_2011_IB_FINAL_060111.pdf

which states:

&gt;The Social Security Board of Trustees issues an annual report on the Old-Age and Survivors, Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust funds that provides a detailed assessment of the financial condition of Social Security program for the next 75 years. The 2011 trustees’ report shows that benefits and administrative expenses exceeded payroll tax income in 2011. That report projects that, based on the trustees’ intermediate or “best estimate” assumptions, the deficits will continue indefinitely into the future. As a result, the Social Security trust funds that have been built up by past surpluses of taxes over expenses are projected to run out of money in 2036. Once the trust funds are depleted, benefit payments will be limited to what can be funded by tax revenues at that time.""

It goes on to state:

&gt;According to the intermediate estimates in the 2011 trustees’ report, current assets in the trust fund as well as future revenues are projected to fall short of future benefits and expenses during the next 75 years by $6.5 trillion on a present value basis, or approximately 0.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on the same basis. This shortfall can be addressed by increasing the current payroll tax rate of 12.40 percent by 2.15 percentage points, to a rate of 14.55 percent—or through other taxation increases equal to 0.7 percent of GDP.""

So, the shortfall, while concerning, is 0.7% of expected GDP on a present value basis.  While that should be addressed now, before we allow the shortfalls to balloon, it is also not something that is beyond repair.  The fact is that Medicare is actually substantially more concerning in terms of the shortfalls in the Medicare reserve trust, which is due to be exhausted by 2024 as of the most recent data I've seen. 

I am, however, in full agreement with you that the low interest rate environment is making difficult on retirees, and not just in SS but in private pension liabilities and near retirees saving in personal IRAs and 401k's.  And that is ultimately something that is only making solutions to these problems more difficult to solve.  Couple that with the size of the generation that is the boomers, and the ballooning of their retirement costs on a present value basis each year as it draws closer, and I only hope that we can begin discussions on reforming the programs now, instead of passing some last minute deal with no sustainable, long-term solutions.","1364774580"

One thing that is very bad for business is setting a date on any particular prophesied event.  If there are any firm or fixed dates on any particular event, then BOOM your religion is out of business as soon as that date passes.  (Unless you're a real fast talker and can re-calculate a new date and somehow have people believe you.)

Therefore, it's good for business to make a nice non-specific apocalyptic prophesy.  Simply make a list of all of the stuff that has always happened in the world and with humanity (for example, wars and rumors of wars), and then say that as we do more and more of all of the same stuff we've always done, the end draws nigh.

Elrond had not yet given his blessing, and said Arwen's hand in marriage would only be given if he defeats Sauron and becomes king, a seemingly impossible task that no one knew for sure could be accomplished. So along comes Galadriel, whom everything she does and says is prophetic by the nature of her character, hands the jewel to Aragorn as wedding gift, a wedding no one knew would happen and would only happen after Sauron was defeated. It foretold his marriage to Arwen, which serves as a prophecy of victory. I've proven that.

So, we know that the reason he has the jewel is because Arwen loves him, which is also why she had forsaken her immortality. I've proven that.

We know the jewel can heal the bearer, which means it can heal Aragorn. I thought the jewels ability was more obscure than that and that it's protection only came from prophecy, but the fact that it can directly heal Aragorn only helps support my interpretation. So I've proven that. 

I've cited lore and given you all the ""relevant substance"" one would need to understand it, but you still don't. That means, at this point, you're choosing not to understand it on purpose. But that's okay. Some people are perfectly happy with their narrow and limited interpretation of the story.

the reason destruction in video games isnt a big thing is that it sound better than it really is.

could you imagine a game like GTA 5 if every thing was destructible. the entire game would be a pile of ruble by the end. you wouldn't be able to have a story because the building you were suppose to go into is destroyed.

games like BC2 had pretty good destruction but the map was flatend by the end of the match and left totally unbalanced 
 
their just isnt a lot of games that can implement a full destructible environment correctly. it adds a lot of challenges you wouldn't think about.

but eh their is a reason im not a game developer, im just not creative enough to think of a game were 100% destructible environments could be implemented. it is a cool concept and believe me when i say people are working on it ","1364774589"

The original bitcoin network uses one series of blocks, that are linked to each other mathematically (the hash of the previous block is included in the contents of the next one).  This ensures that there is only one history of transactions, and that everybody can agree on what account balance goes with each account number.  The rules for how blocks are generated and how many coins come with each block are part of the software.  

If your new block violates the rules, it will be rejected by everyone else.  You would have to convince the majority of the network to accept the new rules.  This is hard, so it's easier to start a new chain under the new rules.

The idea that Bodhidharma was a Buddhist monk, is also common knowledge, except for you. If you are going to try to refute common knowledge, you need to provide the proof. Your proof is that the word Buddhism is a new word? That's it? That is not good enough. How new or old the word is, is completely irrelevant.

I can't speak to any of these loans, of course the connections mentioned here are worrying. But in the end, if a loan is unrecoverable, it's unrecoverable. You have to write it down and move on. Japan's financial system allowed banks to hide bad loans for decades.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Fell in love with Flamenco some few years ago. 
Here is a few of the videos that I have been obsessed with lately:
TANGOS DE LA SULTANA  CAMARON DE LA ISLA &amp; Tomatito (I suppose this would be called 'Flamenco Neuevo')
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XySNShonCIg

Vincente Amigo has amazing compositions and such feeling along with super sophisticated technique. I'm less familliar with him but he is one heck of a musician...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0tT1j-GacY

One of the things about flamenco is that it's not solely a guitar technique/style but rather it has the dance, singing and rhythm to make it true. I think that this video gives a fair representation of what I think of flamenco: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTu_npk4NFo

Not flamenco but a very influential scene with Tomatito and others for me from the Tony Gatlif movie 'Vengo'. THIS is an amazing movie. I loved the scene where they were standing on the road and one of the characters realizes that the tree they were standing near had 'duende' and they began to do palmas and jamming out. Loved, loved, loved it.

Whatever you do, don't give up yet, it's soon for that. Definitely give it a month at a minimum. 

I have no idea how or if your meds could be affecting you, I'm not very familiar with MS. But that's another distinct possibility. You don't mention your age. I'm sure you know that the older we get, the harder it is to lose weight (especially for us ladies). I'm in my mid-30s now and I long for the easier-weight-loss days of my 20s. I can only imagine it gets worse as we get older. 

But life is all about challenges. How are you feeling otherwise? Does eating keto make you feel good? Is it more convenient to be on the same eating plan as your boyfriend? Have you stopped farting? (Keto girls don't fart, after all) Until your progress shows on the scale, try considering the OTHER positives to keto and use them to keep yourself motivated. I save money on Keto since I cook at home more. I am rarely gassy or bloated. I also just don't pig out, I don't WANT to overeat on Keto. All things that keep me motivated when I'm not seeing weight loss or want to cheat. Good luck to you and hang in there :)","1364774610"

"pcmods","t5_2tj99","For the unpainted inside, use bare metal primer that will stick to and prep the metal surface, but no sanding is necessary first, but check the can that you are using for any special directions.

Wet sanding helps make a deeper look, like if you were to look at the reflection, it would appear deeper in the paint, does that make sense?  that may not be the effect that you are going for with a matte finish.

Wet sanding paper only comes in the grits you'd use, 300/400 or so would be fine, but you can go higher progressively for a smoother finish, but again not sure if that's what you want in a matte finish.  

Mine HAF 932 took about three cans of main color, two of primer (but i didn't do the inside, it came black).  The inside you could get away with probably one can.  

As far as brands, I like rust-oleum or Krylon, any of the brands that you would pick up at a big retailer (walmart/lowes/home depot).  If you want to go the auto paint route, Pep boys or autozone, most big car parts stores are going to have some kind of selection.  At auto-body shops you could even get custom color cans made for about $20 a piece or so.

Holes are going to get filled with paint and primer, so it can sometimes make getting screws in a bit tricky.  Screw spare screws into any holes that you are going to use later on so you don't have to worry about too much paint and primer gumming the holes up.  

Remember, the paint isn't going to hold up well to screws and stuff being tightened down on the surface, so go easy with newer paint jobs, make sure the paint has fully dried before handling them or screwing things back down.

Good luck!","1364774614"

"SRSsucks","t5_2uuwv","I appreciate the response. Also:

&gt; Pop music these days has become post-commercialist, they literally just sing about the money they made singing about the same stuff people always sing about.

This is brilliant. 

&gt; Is it actually harmless? Well, we certainly don't feel the effects of it. I have a lot of homosexual friends that are hurt when I use terms for homosexuals as derogatory language, but I can't say it's ever bothered me in their absence. 

I think there will be a shift in the future from a society that pressures people to not be offens*ive*, to one that pressures people not to be offen*ded*. Historians may look back at Donglegate and say ""Aha! That's when it started!"" 

Speaking as someone who's mixed race, with one of my parents being a muslim, I've never been offended in the slightest by terrorist jokes. Hell, I throw them around myself. So it's certainly possible to not be offended at jokes that take the piss out of your background or identity.

&gt; We are trending into a world where we care less and less about divisive politics, but we also care less about mutual respect for our differences. We're happiest thinking that we're all more or less similar, and offensive language is a joke we're all in on. Whether this is actually a genuinely positive direction to head, I honestly can't tell.

I think it is a positive direction. A world in which we are less offended is less stressful, and downright *funnier* than one in which we are pressured to be less offensive. 

What's more, when the pressure shifts and the easily-offended realise these jokes really *aren't* a big deal, they'll be happier too. And it's easier to stop being offended than to stop being offensive. In the former case you have to guard your response to a few highly specific statements. In the latter case you have to be careful about *everything* you say, considering as many interpretations of it as possible. It's stifling. 

&gt; This may be academia's first steps into what I consider regionalism, the beginnings of accepting that we're not universally identical (I'm not a philosopher, I've never studied it, I make up words to build my ideas on, apologies to all who are offended). I would argue that that sort of thinking didn't start with the boomers, philosophy has always been about finding undeniable truths. 

I'd have to disagree here. Enlightenment thinking was about universals, it's true, but the latter 19th century and early 20th century were all about differences - between nations, genders, and races. 

The postwar period saw an (understandably) massive rejection of this kind of thinking. You had behaviourism (the idea that all behaviour is learned) dominating psychology, and the growth of Marxist critical theory and constructivism in the Frankfurt School. This was ""tabula rasa"" taken to the extreme, and it was almost certainly linked to the experience of 1930s fascism.

&gt; Citation Needed I completely disagree with this idea that knowledge is going to win the future. If anything, I believe knowledge is in grave danger. For starters, consider how much internet debate is actually triggered by opinions over matters of fact. A lot of it. Then consider that when people are confronted with facts, they will maintain their positions despite it (http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/11/how_facts_backfire/).

Holy shit, it's amazing that you'd link *that* particular article. I've read it a number of times, as well as the research of Nyhan and Kuklinsnki that it cites (I'm working on a paper about the role of facts in politics).

I agree that the internet is going to create a flood of useless information. But that's precisely why we're going to start deferring to standards of filtering good information from bad information, and good methods from bad ones. Look at the celebrity status of Nate Silver - has anyone ever become so famous simply because they used a rigorous methodology?

Contemporary psychology, including Nyhan and Kuklinski but also Kahneman and Haidt is entirely focused on uncovering barriers to accepting information and making good decision. Cognitive dissonance, biases, etc. This will allow for discrimination between good decision-makers and bad ones, people who are open to the facts and people who are ideologues. We can see them already, of course, but things will heat up when psychology convincingly shows us how all these biases work, and what we can do about them. At the moment they've only established that they work. 

I expect we'll start to see deference not only to methods, but to *people*. There may even be tests to sort good decision-makers from bad ones, the closed-minded from the open-minded, etc. 

That may sound far-fetched, but I think it complements your scenario. A flood of useless information creates an urgent need for a specialized group of people who can sort the quality from the crap. 

&gt; Religion, for all it's faults, is still much stronger than it has any right to be, and you should always be most wary of actors in decline. Trying to insist that humans don't need religion is also, I think, a failed presumption. We've had forms of religion on this planet for as long as we've had farming, it precedes the notions of government or city states, it's responsible for some of the greatest achievements and failings of human kind. To see it as any less than one of the strongest forces on human history is ignorance, to suggest that we will shrug it off any day now is just silly. 

I think it's exactly as strong as it has a right to be. Religion retreats as urbanization and education advances. It may precede governments and city states, but that does not mean it will survive them. It's amazing to take data on peoples' religiosity and map it out alongside cities. No matter what country you look at, the nonreligious are *always* clustered around cities. So are liberals and left-leaning people. It won't collapse any day soon, and you're right, belief in the *afterlife* may last a lot longer. 

As for skepticism, the UK skeptics movement has undergone a kind of renaissance over the past 10 years. Local skeptic meetings in the UK have to hire entire function rooms now just to accommodate their local crowd, which is usually over 100. And that's just the *local* skeptics who are committed enough to turn up to every event. 

&gt; We are, as a generation, larger than the baby boomers, and will easily eclipse them in terms of political power in a few decades, but whether we will achieve anything meaningful or become an even bigger disappointment is clearly not decided at this point.

I agree. That's why it's important to influence this generation, to make sure we equip each other with the best facts and arguments, so that we won't fuck it all up when we do achieve power. Places like this are essential to that process, I think.

That being said we went down with two back packs and no jobs.  After a week of knocking on doors of  the institutions we both were hired.  If you have a degree and are a native speaker it's easy to get a job.  But you do need to be there to be hired.  They are weary of "" fly by nights.""   I found work at both TRONWELL and Instatucion de la Norteamericano.  Super fun experience.  You will meet great people.
We found jobs in Santiago but did not like the big city. We ended up spending the year in La Serena.  Good Luck!

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Ok, suppose we don't care which goat we pick, then by your own statement, we have 4 options:

&gt;1) Pick a door with a goat, keep door, get a goat.
&gt;
&gt;2) Pick a door with a goat, switch door, get a car.
&gt;
&gt;3) Pick the door with a car, keep door, get a car.
&gt;
&gt;4) Pick the door with a car, switch door, get a goat.

However, there are 2 goats, and only 1 car, so you have a 66% chance of picking a door with a goat, and only a 33% chance of picking a door with the car. This means that options 1 and 2 happen twice as often as options 3 and 4, so it's still better to always switch (because switching will get you the car twice as often as keeping).

Let's just look at the initial part of the problem, choosing a door.  Imagine you have a 6 sided die, with 4 sides having pictures of goats, 2 sides having pictures of cars.  If you roll that die, you have a 4/6 = 66% chance of getting a goat, and a 2/6 = 33% chance of getting a car, right?  Well, in this case, you have three options, 2 of them are goats, one of them is a car, so you have a 66% chance of initially picking a goat, and a 33% chance of initially picking a car.

Now if you pick a goat (either goat, it doesn't matter), switching doors is **guaranteed** to give you a car. So if you switch doors, the only time you'll lose is if you initially picked the car, which only happens 33% of the time, so you'll only lose 33% of the time if you switch.

"Neuropsychology","t5_2rhda","Re: Over-reacting to sensory inputs. I recently learned about Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), which is not a DSM-recognized diagnosis but rather a cluster of symptoms that is correlated with a few other possible diagnoses, such as ADHD and OCD.

I, my sister, and my mother, all have SPD. I will sometimes smell things so strongly that I actually taste things like perfume and hair care products - and that fucking antibacterial goop - even when my coworkers barely notice any scent at all. I can't wear makeup or jewelry or watches; I remember as a child putting on earrings and promptly forgetting about them, but by high school I couldn't any longer, and all day long I'd be pulling at my ears. 

And shaving? Just imagine *feeling* the hairs growing back within a matter of a couple hours, and spread that itching sensation across your entire legs and underarms (if you're especially masochistic, how about the groin area?). I have accepted that if I don't want people to stare rudely at me, then I must wear long pants and shirts with sleeves. I'm not a radical hippie feminist; I just can't understand why other women aren't crawling out of their fucking skin shaving all the time!

Anyway, I'm now in therapy for ADHD, and on Adderall my SPD symptoms are definitely better. My therapist believes that OCD may actually be a better diagnosis for me than ADHD, but we're going that route first. I'm almost ready to try wearing synthetic fabrics again!

While I haven't read anything about SPD correlating to thoughts racing, my armchair analysis is that it could be another symptom, unrelated to the SPD itself, trending toward either ADHD or OCD applying to yourself. And remember, it's not about having a named diagnosis to spout - I definitely don't go around announcing to people ""I have ADHD"" as if that makes me special - it's about drawing a line between the patterns unique to our individual brains that are especially useful (such as your ability to apprehend large amounts of data and remember it clearly), and those that become a hindrance (for example, I have to wear a ponytail holder AND a headband AND earplugs just to ride in a car with the windows down).","1364774620"

Yes, it would be *so* much nicer of them to get super close to him and in his personal space as he tries to sleep.

&gt; The whole Christian philosophy is to treat others as yourself and be morally righteous - none of which is happening here. This pic is the definition of hypocrisy.

Again, what do you expect them to do? You're ranting and raving about how awful these people are without giving an actual answer of what they should be doing.

ISPs can only see as far as the local exchange. They'll know if something goes wrong on their side of it, but not if something goes wrong on the other side. Slow speed is such a common and ""soft"" issue that they are slow to act.

We solved the problem by getting an engineer (it was British Telecom as they own the phone lines where I live) to come out on behalf of Sky and do a series of tests working backwards from our house to the box. It could be something as simple as a frayed bit of wire!

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Are there any real life examples if such systems and if so how did they perform? How many people would die between the collapse of the current system (which as you stated earlier would happen suddenly) and the creation of the new system?

Not sure about the answer to this.  In regards to the collapse that you mention I don't think it will be anything violent or sudden, I see libertarianism as being much more strong today (particularly in the US) than previously and that this is a byproduct of the increasing amount of technology each person has access to (something that will only increase with time).  

&gt; their were no national military what would stop protection servicers from warring each other instead of settling disputes caused from differences in their codes of ethics? 

They would be free to war against each other if they wished.  I doubt any agency that makes its money from voluntary interactions would take the expensive risk of trying to violently fight an opposing company, but if this does happen, they are paying out of pocket for their own destruction and if they want to be destroyed by it that is their choice.

Yes. She had an option out; it's not someone else's responsibility if she has religious or other views that cause her not to take it.","1364774655"

This makes sense in long-term because I noticed that going for the highest GPU you can afford pays off in the future. 

I have tested old 2007 machines with GTX 8800 and even its Ultra edition and they kick ass. Play BF3 on most settings on high with 900p res at 30 FPS lowest. It's pretty cool because we are speaking of a six year old GPU pulling all that weight almost alone - that run of the mill Core 2 Duo anemic Santa Rosa chip sure as hell isn't the one pushing the limits of the FPS.

However, the [Alcubierre Drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) (if ever capable of being built) moves the spacetime around the ship, allowing for a (currently theorized) maximum of 10C, without time dilation or any of the other quirks of acceleration. The ship's acceleration and velocity relative to the space around it is 0. The matter needed to build the ring is not currently known to exist, but theorized by many non-Standard models, and we have in the past 10 years brought the necessary energy down from the mass-energy of a galaxy, to the mass-energy of a planet around the size of Jupiter, to the mass-energy of a object about the size of the Voyager craft. Doing pretty good.

There are other theorized alternatives (such as imparting instantaneous velocity on an object without acceleration), but they are all pretty... out-there. I think something along the lines of the Alcubierre metric will prove most feasible within the next century or so.","1364774663"

Yes i've tried grace/determ. with Iron reflexes, the armor is very nice especially with Nullification and Inner Force which I see you've taken.

Obviously I can't comment entirely due to my not knowing which skills you'll be using, but what I can say is I wouldn't be comfortable taking a character with 148% life into maps. NOT to fret. You have gotten some other defensive things which can help make up for some of the lack of life, but I would certainly try to get it higher. Maybe in the 190-200%ish range atleast. Things like block and high armor/resists can add defensive value which can't be quanitfied quite as easily as a large %life You don't need a ton of offensive nodes to be effective. In PoE a lot of what will make your character do great damage is gear.

This, however, does not appear to be what is being discussed.  There is a very definite difference between staring and harassment, and an even more massive difference between merely staring and sexual assault; the latter of which being one of the most heinous crimes a human can commit against another.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","sexual. not sexist. I haven't seen evidence of any sexist jokes they made, neither in the fired guy's apology nor in Adria's blog. 

if you don't see public shaming as wrong, why do you try to absolve someone publicly shamed for public shaming? you might not see it as wrong, but other people do. you see the jokes as sexist, other people don't.

but anyway, you ask what the problem is with that. If you don't see anything wrong with someone with 10k readers posting to her feed a picture of two people while implying they harassed her, no, you openly admit that you see nothing wrong with the situation at all, then I fear you might not quite understand any explanation I could give either. 

But let me try to explain it with a non-sexual example: you are in a crowd, maybe at a conference. A friend is standing next to you. You see your friend's bag is open and you are afraid something might fall out, or maybe someone might steal something, so you take the zipper and close it. Your friend turns around, acknowledges you, and turns back. In the meantime someone has made a picture of what you just did. Instead of talking to your friend about it or telling someone with authority this person posts to his 10k twitter followers your picture and a comment like: ""Not cool.

The evidence for this is not physical evidence, but rather the collected narrative that allows people to come up with a picture of what the mythological Bigfoot looks like. 

From the stories of Christ, when he had risen, he still had the markings of his wounds, so he was still a corpse. However, he had not began to putrify. This tells us that he is not a ghoul. He was able to function with more control than barely shambling.  Zombie is out. Also as previously stated he was a corpse, and as such corporeal, this cuts out ghost and wraith. So what do we have, a necromancer, who after dying is still a corpse but with no signs of rotting, who possesses a greater suite of magic ability and professes on and on about allowing followers to ""live again."" 

Lich. Again it is not factual proof, but in the context of the myth of Jesus, the only term that fits is lich. Also it was a goof, a jest, a light-hearted stab at the most important Christian holiday. Chill brother. ","1364774673"

1. If he scouts my gas and pool before expansion, he will expect early aggression, yes. But the scout will be gone or dead before my baneling nest is up. From what I can tell, the scout is usually gone/dead before my speed starts as well, so he wouldn't see me potentially pull off drones.

2. Protoss seem to like doing FFE with an exposed pylon. There's no way he can cover his entire wall with photons unless he puts down 3-4, which would be incredibly detrimental to his economy that early on. Warp gate would be delayed. If he does throw down that many, I would just focus the pylon or two down with banelings.

These are two people who looked at the history of rape, torture, mass murder, they took a look at the death toll stretching into the hundreds of thousands and thought 

&gt;'I want to be the person who contributes to the overthrow of another democracy. I want to support dictators and murderers. I want to target human rights activists for death. I want to block the state department when they try to cut military aid to our favourite dictators. I want to see the guy who asked for basic safety in his factory to be forced to watch while we rape his family in front of him, I want to be the one who has given the advice about the maximum level of electricity to apply to his wifes genitals to make sure she doesn't go into shock, and I want to be the one who gives the approval to throw his family out of an airplane'

That is the background of a person who decides to work for the CIA. That is their motivation, that is what they have done that is what they do. The CIA is not an agency dedicated to defending freedom, they are a corrupt, evil, and traitorous organization, whose formation was the single worst policy decision in American history.

Oh I know, sure, for the past sixty plus years: they've earned the acrimony of every single president, they have been subject to numerous investigations, they have been shown to be absolutely filled with enemy spies, and they have committed hundreds of crimes against humanity, but we don't know about their successes which they can't tell anyone about. Now we might be skeptical about those successes largely because for the past six decades they've been shown to have been lying about every single one of them, but this time they mean it, they totally have successes, they just can't tell anyone about it yet.  

In twenty years, they'll still have no successes, we'll have found out about still more atrocities that they have actually committed, we'll begin realizing which of their most recent fuckups will doom us for another fifty years, but not to worry, this time they'll actually have had some successes.

We need to gain this sensitivity back.. how you do it is up to the individual. I would say go on a diet for a few weeks that avoids processed sugar goods AND fruit.

Vacarro is a good player, but he lacks high upside, and was rarely asked to play deep, which is where Phillips played. Plus one of our 4 safeties is going to work out.

Trufant was always considered a mid to late first rounder, and again plays a more important position that is also a need.

Many MRA's that have been protesting have been confronted in an aggressive manner by feminists.  The worst part is that feminists get a pass for any sort of violence of aggressive behaviour but any slight anger on the part of the MRM leads to the whole movement being dismissed.

Protesting won't do anything until awareness is raised further.

"QuotesPorn","t5_2spqb","&gt;Dogs and humans began their familiar pas de deux about 15,000 years ago. The fossil record supports this, as does a study of the mitochondrial DNA of the hair of some 650 dogs undertaken by the Swedish scientist Peter Savolainen. Another DNA study, by the evolutionary biologist Robert Wayne, put dogs and people together 135,000 years ago, which would mean that dogs were present near the birth of what we consider to be modern humans, but there has been no archaeology to confirm it, so the later date is more commonly accepted. What’s not in dispute is the domestic dog’s ancestry. A dog’s mitochondrial DNA differs from a gray wolf’s by a mere 0.2 percent. (Coyotes, in contrast, have a 4 percent difference.) In Robert Wayne’s estimation, “dogs are grey wolves.”

There is not really an ""ideal GPA"" that employers look for. That said, many employers will filter out candidates based on GPA, particularly if you submit your resume into the void of an online application. If there is a large volume of applicants, they need to filter somehow and GPA is often a starting point. The threshold GPA varies between companies and positions. I've heard as low as 3.0 and as high as 3.9.

In terms of major versus overall GPA, if your overall GPA is being dragged down by some non-major classes, list both on your resume. You should be prepared to explain the discrepancy, but you should showcase your major GPA if it is higher. Also, if you have a lower GPA, be sure to build the ""experience"" portion of your resume with internships and significant personal/school projects.

"gamegrumps","t5_2ulfu","Are you suggesting that no game is capable of making other people feel a certain way, when those people tell you they have? That's a losing battle.

Maybe it's like ASMR, where only certain people can experience it, but there absolutely is a definite feeling of authenticity that comes with some games that gives its characters, environments, and circumstances much more weight than those of other games. It's a fact of my subjectivity, and arguing against it is like arguing I like a movie when I really don't -- you're obviously wrong. Comparing it to tight mechanics and applying it to Tetris makes me think you don't know what people are talking about when they talk about immersion. It's about bringing the player into the game's world, and the elements of a game that help do that are not nearly limited to controls or interface, but include things like art design, VA performances, atmosphere, and many other things. The term is supposed to refer to a game that immerses a player into the world such that its stakes matter, and whether this difference exists for some gamers is not a matter of debate.

I can think of two examples that subvert what you seem to think immersion really is -- The first is Fallout 3. The mechanics of FO3 do not make me ever forget I'm playing a game. You stop time, decide where to attack, and succeed as a matter of statistics. But when I first played it, it really got to me when I let the mother of that biker gang kid die, I felt really bad. Not just because I had the choice to save her, but because they spent some time building these characters up and making the Vault community important to my character's upbringing.

Compare that to Metal Gear Rising. A lot of thought was put into making the controls feel like you're doing skillful swordplay, and that's great. But when it came to the hostages you could save, I didn't give the slightest ounce of a fuck. The game was so obscenely campy that I couldn't take its plot or situations seriously, and nothing mattered.

Immersion is about making me feel ""inside the game"" inasmuch as it makes what happens feel like it really matters when it doesn't. It's about making the avoidable death of a side character feel real. It makes my role in the game feel real. I think that what contributes to the effect of immersion is subjective (I'm referring mainly to open-ended quest type games, but I would talk about horror type games like Amnesia if I'd played them) but the fact that immersive/not immersive is a real category to at least some gamers is undeniable.","1364774706"

That's ok.  The physical intimacy and touch is (or should be) appreciated, the same way as when he rubs your shoulders or absently strokes your breast through your shirt.  It's an amazing feeling that definitely should be part of most physical relationships involving a penis.

That said, I've met guys who really don't get off on it much.  If that's your guy, then I wouldn't worry about it.  It's more about communicating and then acting upon what makes your partner feel good.

The stickers they put in your car follow the 3,000 mile or 3 months rule regardless of your vehicle or how you drive it. It's a very very low estimate designed to get you into their shop as often as possible (Where they'll then try and sell you over priced air filters and other add ons).

If you have a newer vehicle it might keep track of your oil life for you. For example, my car I reset the computer when I change the oil and it tracks it for me, giving me plenty of warning as I approach the limit and it's well beyond the sticker limit.

I also HIGHLY recommend changing your own oil. I've been shelling out ~$50 a pop every time and I finally decided I had enough of it and I could easily do it. It was extremely easy to do, and only took a few minutes. You just need a socket wrench, oil pan, new filter, funnel and a pair of jacks.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I like that Lombardi said, ""Washing feet was important to present the Lord's spirit of service and love."" Yup. I agree with that. Who cares if the Lord's spirit of service and love is to women or men? Keep in mind, things were a LOT different during the time of Jesus when this happened. Men were the sole providers. Women were TOTALLY subservient to men. Women were not ALLOWED to be intellectual or strong. In that respect, times have changed and I respect that the Holy Father can see that. I'm not saying women should not defer to their husbands - in some respects I can see that and even agree with it. However, Eve was made to be a companion to Adam, even though she lured him into sin. I still have problems with that, though...I always think of women as being more ""sensitive"" and more deeply ""caring"" for others than men. (There are few women who would declare war on another country if they thought their children may be killed.) Women are ""life-givers"" and I think in general, they prefer compromise and PEACE as a means to PRESERVE life. Most women, as I can see, are not power-hungry, as are men. So, why wouldn't the Holy Father include them in his symbolic acts as Jesus did? I have nothing but respect for him...Women are more than 50% of the human population on this earth. Why should they be shunned?  ","1364774736"

There is also a readme included that explains the settings for all the skins; read it. MSI afterburner plugin included, note: you will need MSI Afterburner installed.

Detailed notes on change colors and other things can be found in the readme (\Sabertooth\@Resources\README.txt)

[Sabertooth v2.0](http://namestwister.deviantart.com/art/Sabertooth-2-0-362964286)

Now includes full speedfan support in sidebar. All the settings for colors are located in \Sabertooth\@Resources\Settings.inc

[Sabertooth v1.1](http://namestwister.deviantart.com/art/Sabertooth-Update-362809623)

I finally changed my theme after about a year. I built a new computer so I thought I should make a rainmeter skin to go with it.

Martial arts is interesting. I had some martial arts training in the service, oriented on how to instill damage and death to another human being. But that sort of training is a far cry from traditionalist martial arts; indeed, MMA fights like UFC show the difference between perfecting techniques and locking down to hurt someone. Traditional martial arts are more akin to yoga than fighting training; great stuff, but not ideal if you're learning to maim and kill.

Interesting you bring up being dropped on; I expressed a [similar sentiment](http://www.reddit.com/r/guns/comments/1barl5/stay_armed_stay_vigilant/c95iu1q?context=3) here.

If that's the case, then f(x) is not continuous (unless it's constant). That's probably going to cause h(x) to fail to be continuous, unless your g\_i(x) functions are very carefully constructed. For example, consider some x-value where f(x) jumps from one value to a larger value. If the product of all of the new g\_i(x)'s that are now included in the big product does not equal 1, and none of the other g\_i(x)'s are zero there, the function h(x) is (probably) going to have a jump discontinuity.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","I have a piezo bridge in one of my electrics, and I never ever use it.  I've heard some people use guitars like the Taylor T5 well, but my guitar has a floating bridge.  There's a slight flutter in the pitch when you pick heavily on a floating bridge.  The immediacy of a piezo's attack really seems to exaggerate this.  It completely destroys the illusion of an acoustic tone.  Not to mention, I hate the sound of piezo pickups...

I play 95% acoustic these days, and my live rig is a few guitars in different tunings, a mic, and a small PA.  I have one guitar with a soudboard transducer, but that doesn't get plugged in.

I'm a firm believer that if you want an acoustic sound, you use an acoustic, and if you want it louder, you use a microhpne.","1364774745"

I feel for Morgan and understand that much of her situation may have been outside of her control, but she committed a crime and the details of her trial are going to be reported.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","In the morning Nikeos had kissed Muiri goodbye and left. He'd be back in a few days. Nikeos was a hunter. A real hunter. Almost every week he ventured into the wilds and return with bags of meat. Whatever he, Muiri and Sophie didn't eat, was sold to the shops in Markarth.

It was a hot day, as Nikeos crawled through the woods. His bow in his hands, arrow readied, sword on the left hip, dagger on the right. He let the arrow fly, and it soared through the air. At the last moment the deer raised his head, but he never saw the arrow coming. Nikeos walked up to the deer. It wasn't dead yet, but if left here, it would cetainly bleed out. Nikeos pulled his arrow out of the deer's neck and drew his sword. With one clean slash, the deer was taken out of it's misery. He sheathed his sword and used his dagger to cut off the animal's meat. It was his third animal today. An elk and two deer had been killed by the precise strike of Nikeos' arrows.

He looked around, searching for a good spot. There it was. A slightly open area, large enough for his tent and a small fire, to roast some meat. After cooking and eating some venison, he started setting up his tent. He threw some leaves over the floor, laid down, and closed his eyes.

He was abruptly awoken by a loud roar. He sat up straight in bed. There was no mistaking that sound. There was a bear nearby. Nikeos stood up and grabbed his weapons. The fire outside was still smoking, and stars lit up the sky, as beautiful as always.

He looked around carefully, making sure not to make too much noise. After searching for a minute or two, he saw it. It was gigantic. It was blacker than the sky on a starless night, and it's roar was enough to make even the Greybeards run away in fear.

Nikeos grabbed a few arrows, and put them in the ground in front of him. This way, he would be able to fire more rapidly. He fired his first arrow. It hit the bear in the back. It let out a roar and turned around as a second arrow hit it. Nikeos kept firing, hoping that the beast would go down, but it didn't.

The bear had seen him. It let out a roar even louder than the previous ones and started running across the mossy ground, straight towards Nikeos. Nikeos saw his life flashing before his eyes. Everything happened in slow-motion. He prayed to Akatosh, to give him courage and strength. He prayed to Mara, to give his wife the power to move on. And that's when he saw his way out.

He drew his sword, and pointed it at the bear. It was still charging at him. It was coming in fast now. 20 metres, 15 metfes, 10 metres, 5... The bear rammed him at full speed. Nikeos felt like a dragon had just landed on him. His chest hurt, his legs hurt, his arms hurt. But he was alive.

The bear laid on top of him, and Nikeos struggled to move it's body. It took him at least ten minutes to squeeze himself from under there. He looked at the bear. His plan had worked. The bear jumped right into the sword. It's tip had shown itself through the back of the bear's skull, while the handle was still below it's chin. 

Nikeos pulled his sword out of the bear's head and went back to his tent. He immedietly packed his stuff and walked to the nearest town. Never had Dragon's Bridge felt so safe and peacefull.","1364774748"

In highschool I invested a similar amount of money in safe blue chip stocks. I didn't know anything about valuation, compound interest or anything... just that I had a little bit of money that I wanted to turn into more money.

That ~500 made me intensely interested in finance. I began watching the indexes and absorbing information that I otherwise would have had no interest in. 

I was an idiot and sold the stocks to speculate.. and learned that I cannot time the market. That $500 taught me alot; I""m glad I learned that I am a buy and hold investor with only a $500 loss.

So, you can't really go wrong here unless you decide to buy scratch offs at the gas station. 

Invest it if you want, put it away for unexpected college expenses, put it in an emergency account, etc.

Just don't spend it... start the habit of wealth accumulation now!!

Good job on accumulating $500 and having a more responsible thought than most adults would have in this situation!!","1364774754"

Theoretically the idea is sound, the more credit you have used responsibly the better you look to lenders, so if you took out a loan and then repaid it that makes you look great, which is true for *proper* loans but not for payday loans. The problem with payday loans is they have a stigma attached, if a lender sees that you used a payday loan (even if you paid back on time, every time) you look like you're over extending yourself, that you're not responsible.

I tried to do this a couple of years ago, I have a high salary and wanted a good credit card but I had no credit history, so I took out a bunch of payday loans, repaid them the next day and then once they showed up on my credit report as fully paid off I thought great, I'm cheating the system I'll get a good credit card in no time! Unfortunately that didn't work, haha.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;The problem is more that most men that goes around and whines about friendzone-problems, doesn't whine about one woman. They whine about ""All women I meet friendzones me"". You can't really expect every fucking woman that talks to you to fall deeply in love and want to fuck with you instantly.

That's 100% correct. And because this is still a problem, women are obviously dealing with men wrong. This is how you do it: ""Sorry, I'm not interested. Also, I'm not your friend. I wish you luck in chasing other women.""

Now he doesn't have the excuse or hope of hanging around someone he's obviously attracted to all day. *Now* instead of wasting time and energy chasing a false hope, he'll move on to someone else. And if you actually care about him, point out where he could be doing better, and any other single women you know of that you'd be happy to introduce him.

Friendzoning is purely for the woman's interest and ego.

&gt;It's not fun to a week later get a ""You are a total fucking friendzoning whore!"" texmessage, just because I tried to be a nice person and talk to him.

You gave him hope where he had none. Then when reality sets in that there was nothing, he gets upset. Sounds like a perfectly normal reaction.

&gt;If I friendzone every guy I know that I don't want to date, if we're going by number of facebook friends I'm friendzoning several hundred guys right now. Not to mention the fact that I'm friendzoning over 7 billion people in the world right now.
It's easy for a person without a social life to think that ""I talked to her - now I want to be her boyfriend and not just her friend"", but for a female with a lot of male friend - not to mention ever female ever existed with a normal social live - that is not impossible. 

I'm assuming you meant ""Not possible"".

So, friendzoning should be cool because it's not possible for you to date everyone? There's absolutely no distinction to you, between the guy who is standing in front of you, trying his best to woo you, and 7 billion complete strangers, the vast majority who don't even speak your language?

How about this. There is a difference. But because of womens strong avoidance of any conflict, where even getting a harsh text message is too stressful, you handle the guy in such a way to make it the least amount of stress on yourself. 

Instead of doing the right thing.

&gt;Don't talk to me like I know nothing about men and don't imply that I'm a bad friend. I'm the best fucking friend you could ever have.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well, as he seems to be defining rational as valid, following any argument that is valid is therefore rational by definition.  I disagree with the definition of rational, but accepted it for the sake of proceeding with the discussion.  As long as we understand what we're discussing, it doesn't much matter what word we use.  So, by his definition which I'd accepted over the course of this discussion, it would be rational to accept the following argument.

&gt; The bible is completely true

&gt; The bible claims God created the universe

&gt; Therefore, God created the universe

That argument is valid, but not sound; the conclusion follows from the premises, though even most believers would admit the bible is not 100% true.  However, if rational is synonymous with valid, that argument is rational.

Personally, I don't think you're rationally justified in holding a belief that is unsound, but that is a point of disagreement between us, and as I said I don't so much mind the words we use as long as we understand what we're saying to one another, so it doesn't bother me that much that we disagree on the definition of the word.



**Edit:**  I feel like I should add something.  We often accept arguments with premises that have not been sufficiently supported, and the greatest evidence of this is that we often change our minds to new positions that are in conflict with the old one.  Necessarily, the old position, the new one, or both were wrong and therefore were not based on a sound argument.  In most things, we decide what is true or false based on a preponderance of evidence, much of it quite poor, and intuition.  We really cannot analyze every position we hold.  It's important, however, to realize that if a position is analyzed and found wanting, the tendency to accept things without sufficient evidence is not a justification to continue believing something that did not pass muster.

Now, when we have a claim like 'a soul exists,' it had been taken for granted for millenniums.  Few people thought to question it.  However, upon examination it becomes clear that the justification is primarily that we do not have a good explanation for consciousness and that the justification for the existence of a soul is an argument from ignorance; we don't know what's causing this phenomenon, so it must be this soul I've been told about.  What else could it be?  We finally know enough to start to suggest what an alternative answer might be.  Logically, the alternative should not be necessary as the existence of a soul has not been shown, but in practice people will have a hard time rejecting an idea they are raised with as fact without at least being presented an alternative.  We are, in large part, beings of intuition and intuitively we do not like replacing an unsupported answer with no answer.","1364774767"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","I found Le Havre really hard to understand at first.  I've played it a couple times and think I've figured out more, but who knows?  The game's pretty complex, even if it hides that well.  Some thoughts that might help:

There's an ""arc"" the game follows as it develops.  As later buildings and ships become available, more strategic avenues open up to produce and use different resources.  Sometimes it seems like you want to follow after a dozen different short term goals at once, but there's usually only a few that will be close to optimal- i.e., produce the ""most"" for you by the time the game is over, and it may take some playthroughs to identify what works best.  This is because as buildings are built, their functionality changes what you can do with goods, and therefore those good's value throughout the game.  For example, wood is a good energy source earlier, but falls off late game as coal or coke become more easier to make, and offer much more energy.  And because the value and use of goods varies over the game, there's an element of ""timing"" to the game.  You have to know, for example, when it's becoming too late to keep using wood as your energy source, and only playing the game multiple times will give you that intuition, to know at what stage of the game (what buildings are about to come up) you are in.

In general, keep in mind: 

Building ships and buildings is really good.  You will very often want to get them as soon as you can, whenever you have the resources to do so.  Ships provide food every harvest and points at the end of the game, while buildings offer new ways to use resources, sometimes an entry fee if other players use them, and points at the end of the game.

The usefulness and value of resources varies over the course of the game, and it make take some play throughs to learn when you have to stop collecting or producing a resource and use them to build a building, or ship or produce another resource (i.e. how the game unfolds).  

You cannot follow every avenue available to you, all the time.  Oftentimes it's better to follow a couple of sequences of short term goals that chain together and lead into one long term goal, rather than following divergent sequences of short term goals simultaneously,  that will only diverge and leave you with a variety of resources that don't fit together into producing anything.  

Actions that transform (instead of collect) resources should usually be done in the largest ""batches"" (i.e. fewest turns) possible.   

I really think the most important thing to know is that the game becomes more clear if you play it multiple times (with the exact same buildings/building order, if you have to), because learning how it ""unfolds"" (how the resources change in usefulness, when critical buildings may become available, etc) allow one to play with a greater horizon- being able to estimate the time and resources smaller goals require, and how to put together larger and larger goals from those smaller ones.

Nah, i'm not the ""sitting back"" type. If you want to find me when i play on my Infiltrator, the best way will be to take a second look at that ""teammate"" you just ran past.

If the game isn't about Score, why are you bringing it up?

My most used weapon is the carbine, because that's the weapon i use when i Fly, Tank battle or support my team. I might not get many kills with my Smoke Grenades, but i'm pretty sure i'm helping more than the random nugget who managed to kill one light assault :)

I use proxy mines as tactical support when infiltrating. Nothing a grunt like you would understand :)

Yep, i enjoy the game. And i play the game to enjoy it. I don't care about score or Battle Ranks. I'm more interested in having fun. And the way i have fun is not the most profitable style in the game. But i can actually live with that :)

* Funny, because most players who know me would agree that i am quite far above average. But that's nothing a grunt like you would understand. Infiltrating isn't all about the score, sweetheart.

* I can understand that a grunt like you don't understand the potential of the Infiltrator. But you see those 6 Prowlers on Prowler hill? You see how they are not there anymore? Yep, looks like Esmey took a swing by the enemy base. What did you do in the meantime? Fail to shoot down an ESF? Right :)

* Oh but i CAN back it up. I just did earlier, with a video showing me, for the first time ever using a very unique weapon, doing exactly what you 15 minutes previously had called ""impossible."" So yeah, Learn to play :)

If a newbie like me can do something that you claim is impossible, you have some issues.

I really couldn't care less what some skilless whiner thinks about me, because i'm pretty happy with the way i play now, and i know who the good player here is. And it's certainly not the one whining about his tools not being good enough :)

Now you just have to integrate. Since you did the first, i'll do the second:

F = int Fy(x,y) dy = int e^x cosy dy = e^x siny + g(x)

=&gt; Fx = e^x siny + g'(x) = e^x siny =&gt; **g'(x) = 0 =&gt; g(x) = C**

Therefore, F = e^x siny + g(x) = e^x siny + C.

I'll copy my concluding paragraph up-front for those that would rather skip to the point: I believe we all have an immense innate, untapped potential that can be cultured &amp; enhanced.  How to sustain that potential, or clarity, is a question I can only hope to answer.  Until then, the journey continues...

I'm 30 now and was recently diagnosed with ADHD.  In retrospect, I've likely had it since childhood.  Throughout high school &amp; college I didn't have to put much effort into getting good grades and would do my homework for one class during lectures for another.  Standardized tests always came easily...32 on ACT &amp; 850 on GMAT with about 20 hours of studying.  I went on to a 6-figure job after college but couldn't find a passion and slowly got increasingly bored.  

Boredom had always been an issue, I remember only finding fun in golf as a single digit handicapper when I'd put myself in a bad position behind a tree to an uphill green &amp; was forced into a high, drawing hook that must land softly in order to hold the green.  Those small challenges kept me going until it seemed even those small challenges became repetitive.  The boredom led to depression the sudden development of panic attacks, depression &amp; potential bipolar disorder.  Of course, only after 4-5 years of struggling with the symptoms of these disorders on my own did I see a psychologist.  

It's pretty easy to explain those 4-5 years.  I was addicted to anything that took me away from the repetitive uselessness of this world.  I destroyed relationships, isolated myself from the world &amp; even at the high points, went through the motions of life.  I'd multi-task the household chores &amp; get done in an hour what might take most four only to buy myself some time for one of my addictions.  Now, through this time people generally considered me successful.  I was promoted and considered a role model by many associates.  I'd done a pretty good job hiding the underlying monster that was growing.

Finally, I had a breakthrough.  I'd hit a low, unable to move from bed for 2 weeks, and on the verge of suicide, when I turned to great minds of the past...Osho, Aristotle, Jesus, Rand, Plato, Keller &amp; Nietzsche.  With their help I found clarity.  It's hard to explain how this felt but imagine seeing through a new set of eyes.  Imagine living at 30 like you were 2 again...discovering &amp; exploring, inquisitive &amp; creative but able to patch thoughts &amp; actions together with the savvy of a person who had 30 years of experience &amp; learning.  It felt like I was blind but now could see, to steal from the Bible.  I wrote songs, learned to play instruments, published three books, finished an MBA &amp; more...effortlessly.  I was sleeping like a baby &amp; my mind active.  I could feel every drop of water simultaneously when it touched my skin in the shower.  I could feel the energies of others &amp; quite literally read minds, which helped free demons of others.  I had one man tell me I cured his lower back pain after 20 years of taking pain medication.  While I gave him a few exercises &amp; stretches what he didn't know what I was able to cure the physical aches of his body through a subliminal reprogramming of his mind.  This period of my life lasted for about 9 months.  Note, I had started the MBA &amp; books earlier but muddled through them slowly &amp; accomplished in those 9 months what would have taken years.  More likely, I would have given up on the books and dropped out of grad school.

Slowly, I could feel the clarity slipping away.  And then it accelerated.  In about 2 months, I'd hit bottom again, sleeping away the days and back to old addictions.  My psych sent me to rehab.  I came away from rehab on a number of anti-depressants, anti-psychotics &amp; drugs that play with the central nervous system.  While trying to get the combinations working correctly for my body I spent about 9 months sleeping away the days, blind again to the world &amp; functioning, cognitively, at what seemed to be about 10% of my peak.  

My current regimen, Effexor, Klonopin &amp; Adderall, along with Green Vibrance, green tea, resveratrol, amino acids, ALA &amp; ALC, fish oil, vitamin D, vitamin B complex, diet &amp; exercise (I've always been an athletic 190lb 6'2"") has me functioning at what most would probably say is average to above average.  I still make 6-figures &amp; have been getting back into the social scene.  While very little interests me, as has always been, I'm semi-productive &amp; functional in terms of societal standards.  However, as hard as I may try to live in the ""now,"" I can't help but look back and remember that period of clarity.  I've had seconds or even minutes of it since, but nothing more.  I don't think I'll find it again while I'm taking the aforementioned prescribed medications.  However, were I to come off the medications, the massive highs and lows could return.  

Hopefully this was relevant to your question.  I believe we all have an immense innate, untapped potential that can be cultured &amp; enhanced.  How to sustain that potential, or clarity, is a question I can only hope to answer.  Until then, the journey continues...","1364774788"

I also kind of feel like these incidents stick in the minds of everyone else and regardless of style of dress and demeanor might actually affect the way certain people react to me (even if it's not made immediately apparent).

I know what's up, and though I'm not old enough to point to specific events that may have contributed to this, we all know that it goes way back, starts with the parents, the lack of opportunity, etc., and will take some time to be fixed (if it can be at all).

Go see a counselor, or go out and start talking to people u can relate to, and over time it will get easier and you will gain relationships and those will open doors to more.

The only thing remotely to what you are looking for in Christianity is Unitarianism(Not to be confused with Unitarian Universalism, which is a totally different thing).

Unitarians hold their origins in early Christian sects such as the Arians; all of which were distanced as heretical by mainstream Christians after the first Council of Nicaea.

You say you like your Christian friends more than your Muslim ones, but, from what I remember of your past posts, isn't your fiance a Muslim? And, really, isn't he your best friend :)?

But to get to the point, if you look to the Quran and believe it to be the Word of God, and you look at Muhammad(pbuh) and believe him to be the Prophet of God, then what would stop you from accepting Islam? Is it just that some Muslims you met you liked less than some Christians you met?

The reason why i think most people say this is because the effects are subtle and creep up on you. When I first started smoking I loved it and I still do. After a few months of smoking though, I began to have some of the anxiety issues this document lists. Since they didn't appear when I first started partaking in cannabis I thought it was something wrong with my personality. Now I know these feeling are directly related to marijuana, it just take a few months of daily use for them to appear. I wish more people knew about this before they start using marijuana daily.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","It's not a shortage of candidates.  It's a shortage of perfect matches for jobs.  There are jobs out there, as you've seen.

Lots of companies aren't willing to pay market rates and are trying to justify their need for H1B hires.  Never mind that most H1B's are dreadfully under-qualified, have terrible language skills, and can't get along with coworkers because of cultural differences (sometimes including the willingness to bathe regularly).

Yeah, I've had several bad experiences with H1B's.  I thought almost all of them were incompetent lazy assholes.  

There have been only two H1B hires I could work with - socially adept, excellent speakers, extremely intelligent and hard working but taken advantage of by their sponsors, who held out false hopes for green cards and eventual citizenship.  If it had been within my power to hire them, I would've in a heartbeat.  Sadly, both got sent back home; it seems they were too smart for their own good.  Last I'd heard they were still trying to come back.

Anyway, back to your problem - Why don't companies see you as an ideal candidate?  That's something you need help from friends and acquaintances to answer.  Is it a lack of any field experience?   Maybe no work history of consequence (entry level retail or food service)?

I would suggest a more targeted approach to getting a job.  Identify the top ten companies you'd like to work for.  Then identify the top ten companies which have listed jobs you're most qualified for.  Pursue those leads the most aggressively.  Find out who makes decisions.  Research the shit out of those companies.  What makes them tick?  What are their weaknesses?  How can you sell yourself to them as a potential solution to their problems?  Dig, then dig some more.

Get to know a few people inside the company by finding out where they socialize and joining them - learn the culture, identify resources. Don't get directly into ""I need a job"" - work on ""I'm in the field, this is what I know; you guys doing anything interesting or troublesome?""  Find or create a solution for them that they didn't think of.

Getting a job is almost always a matter of meeting the right people at the right time.  Give everyone you meet a hell of an impression, and someone will eventually come looking for your help.","1364774799"

At 18 or 20 you can't take credit for being rich or poor.

The best weapon a woman has? Attitude. Be a **gendered slur**. Be direct: ""Are you following me?"" Fake confidence. 

Better to be seen as a **female dog gendered slur** than be a victim. And I only use the B word because often times that's how many women feel. But honestly, it's okay to look like a crazy lady when there's a potential for danger.

In the seminars, I used to don the full body armor (helmet included) and then start following women around in a mock scenario. First they were to address me directly by being loud and direct, and if that didn't work and they couldn't create enough distance, then they had to fight back. And let me tell you, even with years of combat experience and weighing much more than some of the women in there, one good elbow to the temple will drop a lot of people. 

Basic movements can save your life.That motion where you scratch your shoulder with your opposite hand? Add in a twist of the torso, and it dropped me like a rock.

And you have 0 idea about what you are talking about in regards to Indiana. Oladipo has widely been considered one of the best players in the country. Zeller on the other hand has been great, but he isn't considered as effective of a two way player (he is marginally better on the offensive end but not comparable defensively) and **no one** is talking about him being player of the year. 

Also, which big games are you talking about? I don't think there was a single game of the season where he wasn't dominant on atleast one end of the court (his worst big game was probably the last one against OSU).

The reasons that they held the Medal would make you cry.

I had absolutely no respect for the United States' military commanders.

My payees that held the Medal never ever had to beg. I would walk into a bank and force them to accept the application of any poor SOB that held the Medal. They never were starved nor hurt by anything that I did.

One Medal holder came into my finance office desk. When he got his pay, I walked with him and ordered every asshole in line for pay that was bitching about him going to the head of the line, to right face and salute him. He held the Medal and everyone up to and including the Potus had to salute him first.

Embarrassed the hell out of holder. The second time that he came in the first louie in finance took it upon himself to order a salute. The poor guy did not know whether to shit or go blind.

When he griped to me, I picked up the papers at the bank on post and took them to his house. I paid him directly to his bank account. I could have given a rat's ass less if he was not on any military organizations's duty roster.

And when their airwaves become congested I do NOT want to hear ""well just use it less"" as an answer. That is unacceptable. I pay for unlimited service I expect unlimited service otherwise I am not getting what I paid for. The problem lies in the oligopoly that that has been created here. There is no competition so I can't just say ""I'm dissatisfied so I'm going elsewhere"" because elsewhere has the exact same bullshit. Hell I can't even up and leave Verizon if I wanted to tomorrow anyway because I'm locked into a 2 year contract. A contract in which Verizon doesn't have to hold up their end of the deal I might add.

I've heard that aside from medical/financial/criminal history, the next biggest reason for not getting a clearance is not filling everything out completely. In my case, I'm having trouble filling out pass contacts for pass residences. 

I've lost contact with pretty much everyone who i knew back then, even my roomates. I can't remember their last names to try to look them up online/facebook. On top of that, I lived in a college style apartment complex so there was no landlord that i can list and i didn't interact with any office people or neighbors. I had no friends that knew i lived there during that period. I think the only hope for me in listing someone, is if the apartment complex keeps on record the names of my roommate and they're willing to disclose it to me several years later. I haven't called my apartment complex, but I'm betting they're going to be unwilling to do so for privacy reasons. Though i'm sure they will have no problems releasing the names for an investigator. 

Do you have any opinion or insight into this situation? I can't imagine how this scenario could be too completely uncommon...

edit: would just like to add that my roomates are unlikely to be still living there since it has been ~2 years and students tend to move their residence around a lot or graduate. If they were, i'd be willing to drive 2 hours just knock on the door and ask for their contact.

He is nothing like Heskey, or Carroll, or Owen, or whoever else that you can think that either depends on their size or speed.  

The footballing world is full of quotes from legends of how Scholes is one of the greatest English players, or how he is the greatest midfielder of the past 2 decades (Xavi) or how he would fit perfectly in Barca (Guardiola), etc. We get them so often on this sub that even Scholes fans might be getting tired of them. How often do you see people praising Busquet's play and then comparing him to Carrick and vice versa? Carrick has been one of United's most important player's this season, and its his ability to calm spray passes even when under pressure that is perhaps is best asset (and protecting the back 4).

so todays number of Christians vs Ishtar believers means nothing.  he's simply stating Christianity assumed the date, just like Christmas of pagan  holidays, because it's easier for the simpletons that follow religion to accept a new sky monster when their off days line up apparently.

you said billions of Christians, i corrected you with population numbers of the time, and here you are again, bringing up todays Ishtar followers vs Christians as if it's relevant to anything.

A simple Google search of this ""company"" yields a number of other techs who have not received payment for their work. My emails and calls have been sidestepped and mostly unanswered. For $45 owed to me, my options are pretty limited. I want these people to stop scamming techs. What can I do? What can I do to make them pay(literally and figuratively)?

When I feed my tank my skunk cleaner shrimp will grab more food than it can carry and try to scurry away to his cave to eat it all but he has so much food that he drops a piece every inch or so and he has to stop to pick up what he dropped often dropping even more.

The best places were Kumily and Hampi, I was tracking in the jungle of kumily for Elephants, one night a boiling pot of Curry spilled over my hand.. Had to get out of the junge at night, surrounded by two elephant herds with babys.. also had to watch out not to get caught by jungle patrol, because staying the the jungle is illegal. Got so many crazy but great story's.. I loved it. 


Hospitals are amazing, I was there 3 times, had a doctor take care of me, get 4 meds including antibiotics, payed 2,5€.



Hampi is just amazing and very chilled.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This is a good representation on the church's position. This is the position that more followers need to be taking. I go to a catholic school and am in a position where I'm somewhat responsible for ensuring acceptance of all students. The argument that I see a lot that I absolutely hate is whether we should 'tolerate' or 'accept' homosexuals in the community. This is something that even other people of authority seem to struggle with. Without a doubt, you should not only tolerate but accept homosexuals, as you said 'embrace,' just as you would any other person. The church does not allow homosexual acts, but a homosexual person is just as much a member of the church, or any catholic community, as anybody else. 

Personally, I think homosexual love is love and I disagree with the church, among other things, that it is any lesser of importance to baby-making love.

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","No, I, personally, definitely think you have a point here.

Procedural generation (which is a term that I feel might be not completely accurate in this scenario, but that's a case of semantics only) still requires some manual generation in order to function properly in a puzzle-ish context. The map can be totally random each time, but the door ""puzzle"" we saw in this video has to, by necessity, be pre-made and causes certain events to happen. Now, there are still a few places where randomness can be added--but at the end of the day, the ""randomness"" is required to be a random selection of things from 1 to N on a table.

As a result, once I've seen the door puzzle once, I know it every time. Even if that's not the only door puzzle, there will definitely be hallmarks that allow me to recognize which particular one I'm working with on various playthroughs. In order to make the game REALLY worth more than 1 replay or, even make the game BEARABLE if you end up having to restart from scratch, the number N of manually-generated occurrences on the table of random selection will have to be VERY large.

There is definitely a risk there. A significant risk. That said, I think the reward is very significant as well, if they pull this off successfully.","1364774880"

http://bible.cc/john/20-1.htm    

There are more inconsistencies than mentioned in the OP's image.
What happened afterwards differs much more.

And there used to be more variation than is available today.

Mark is the first Gospel written in 60AD-69AD.
[The earliest surviving versions of Mark don't include verses 9-20 at all.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_16#Scholarly_opinions). 

In those versions the whole resurrection was originally  based on the word of the young man. The earliest books ended like this([verses 1-8](http://bible.cc/mark/16-1.htm))

""*And the sabbath having past, Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they may anoint him, and early in the morning of the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre, at the rising of the sun, and they said among themselves, ‘Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?’ And having looked, they see that the stone hath been rolled away — for it was very great, and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed. And he saith to them, ‘Be not amazed, ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise — he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him! and go, say to his disciples, and Peter, that he doth go before you to Galilee; there ye shall see him, as he said to you.’ And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.*""

Mark was written during the [first Jewish Roman war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish%E2%80%93Roman_War) around 68 AD. Perhaps the ending was just a way to call the early Christians to Galilee.

You should be thankful that American companies are using American technology to extract your oil, considering you don't have the expertise to do it yourself, let alone transport it and refine it and make it into a viable source of income. Nearly your entire economy revolves around business with the US, trade, investment, and diffusion of American technology into your own economy.

Nobody is blaming Canada, by the way. The reason that the origin of the oil is relevant isn't for assigning blame to an other country, it's because of the politically touchy subject of building new pipelines, which happen to be for Canadian oil.

It's funny how paranoid you Canadians are. You're so used to constantly pointing your finger at the US that the simple fact your country was mentioned makes you assume we're out to blame you, when it's usually your country that blames the US for everything. Every time something bad happens in Canada's political system, your default reaction is to pretend that it's Americans' fault.

 *VoxClamantis*:
Acc. to my understanding after having consulted the Catholic Encyclopedia, the forty days worth of fasting wasn't ""set it stone"" until later (though various Church Fathers of the 3rd and 4rd centuries refer to the 40-day fast as the ""apostolic tradition""). 
  
Eusebius of Caesarea (c. 265-c. 340), in his Church History, writes about the controversies of when to celebrate Easter: 
11. Among them was Irenæus, who, sending letters in the name of the brethren in Gaul over whom he presided, maintained that the mystery of the resurrection of the Lord should be observed only on the Lord's day. He fittingly admonishes Victor that he should not cut off whole churches of God which observed the tradition of an ancient custom and after many other words he proceeds as follows:12. ""For the controversy is not only concerning the day, but also concerning the very manner of the fast. For some think that they should fast one day, others two, yet others more; some, moreover, count their day as consisting of forty hours day and night.13. And this variety in its observance has not originated in our time; but long before in that of our ancestors. It is likely that they did not hold to strict accuracy, and thus formed a custom for their posterity according to their own simplicity and peculiar mode. Yet all of these lived none the less in peace, and we also live in peace with one another; and the disagreement in regard to the fast confirms the agreement in the faith.""
It became set in stone, apparently, because of the obvious symbolism of the ""forty day"" (the Exodus of the Israelites in the Desert, Christ's sojourn into the desert, etc.).
 
St. Jerome (born about the year 340-2; died 30 September, 420) writes in Letter 41 about Lent as we know it -- and in Letter 58 -- a letter that seeks to teach the recipient that pilgrimages are nice but not necessary for salvation or a good prayer life -- he mentions how Christian holy sites were desecrated by pagans, including those who of the Tammuz cult:
Those who say ""the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,"" should give ear to the words of the apostle: ""you are the temple of the Lord,"" 2 Corinthians 6:16 and the Holy Ghost ""dwells in you."" Romans 8:11 Access to the courts of heaven is as easy from Britain as it is from Jerusalem; for ""the kingdom of God is within you."" Luke 17:21 Antony and the hosts of monks who are in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Pontus, Cappadocia, and Armenia, have never seen Jerusalem: and the door of Paradise is opened for them at a distance from it. The blessed Hilarion, though a native of and a dweller in Palestine, only set eyes on Jerusalem for a single day, not wishing on the one hand when he was so near to neglect the holy places, nor yet on the other to appear to confine God within local limits. From the time of Hadrian to the reign of Constantine—a period of about one hundred and eighty years—the spot which had witnessed the resurrection was occupied by a figure of Jupiter; while on the rock where the cross had stood, a marble statue of Venus was set up by the heathen and became an object of worship. The original persecutors, indeed, supposed that by polluting our holy places they would deprive us of our faith in the passion and in the resurrection. Even my own Bethlehem, as it now is, that most venerable spot in the whole world of which the psalmist sings: ""the truth has sprung out of the earth,"" was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, Ezekiel 8:14 that is of Adonis; and in the very cave where the infant Christ had uttered His earliest cry lamentation was made for the paramour of Venus.Note that he says here that such desecrations were there until the time of Constantine the Great, who made Christianity legal (he did not make it the ""state religion"" like people say all the time) and whose mother went to the Holy Land to preserve and restore Christian sites. Doesn't sound like early Christianity was the sort of religion to incorporate ""Tammuz"" or ""Mithra"" worship, eh? Especially given the witness of the martyrs!

Sure.

[D14 winning by a huge margin against the EVO (not even the Plus)](http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/corsair_h90_review,12.html).

[Xigmatek Gaia running 0.4 degrees behind the 212 EVO when ambient corrected](http://www.maximumpc.com/article/[primary-term]/xigmatek_gaia_review). We already know the D14-SE2011 has a crappy mount that ruins performance, so those results aren't really relevant here. 

Basically, for mid-level overclocks the Gaia offers very solid performance with low noise levels. 

Just because I'm already here, I might as well drop down a few other suggestions on a price ladder:

$20 - Xigmatek Gaia

$35 - Enermax ETS-T40-TB

$50 - Thermalright True Spirit 140 (171mm tall, check case compatibility, no 2011 support out of the box) Arguably the best 'holy trinity' ratio cooler around. Crazy good performance [see here](http://www.xbitlabs.com/picture/?src=/images/coolers/xigmatek-prime-thermalright-true-spirit-140/zchart_diagr_big.png), solid price, and very very low noise levels.

$55 - Thermalright HR-02 Macho (will fit in a case with 165mm clearance, can run lower TDP chips (ie 77W IVB) semi-passively (ie with case airflow)

$80 - Thermalright Silver Arrow SB-E. Arguably the best air cooler on the market in terms of performance. You can see it and the Macho in the review linked for the True Spirit.

&gt;As to the motherboard, you may be right. I don't know as much about motherboards. I certainly didn't claim expertise there.

If you don't have enough knowledge, ask somebody, or google some reviews first. The first review that pops up, the [H]ardOCP review, would have told you all of that.

&gt;As to the ram - you don't NEED an SSD, a 670, or whatnot. It's a luxury, like 16 gigs of ram. But if all you dislike is the quantity... it's going to be his build, not yours. He can decide if he wants the 16 gigs of RAM, and I know we're here to help, but raging against everything I posted isn't going to help him, either.

Both the GPU and the SSD will provide highly noticeable real-world performance boosts. 16GB of RAM will not, especially with an SSD. That's the difference here.

&gt;On the hard drive - fine. Then what hard drive do you recommend.

The one I listed, the Seagate ST1000DM003.

&gt;As to SSD's, I did. The HyperX still beats the 840 non-pro anyway. And games tend to use large data files, making random less relevant and sequential more so.

Yes, the HyperX generally does beat the 120GB 840. The problem isn't the performance, it's the price associated with it. The regular 840, for $93, is a pretty decent deal. Performance can definitely bog down, but the high sequential reads are where game loading performance is going to show.

If I had to recommend a very high performing drive for a reasonable price right now, it would definitely be the [Plextor M5P Xtreme](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820249032) for $110.

&gt;As to power - (a) Thermaltake's PSU calculator says less than 400W with an overclock factored in. I don't know, then, where the claim of it not delivering enough power comes from. As to the connectors, having just built a rig for a friend with THAT EXACT PSU, I'd say it does in fact have the connectors.

The Corsair CX430 has a single 6+2 pin PCIe power connector. The GTX 670 requires 2x 6-pin connectors. While it does include molex to 6-pin adapters, those are not an idea solution.

If we just to a quick estimate of a medium level OC on the CPU (say... 115W), plus an OC on the GPU (~200W peak), plus the chipset and the rest of the motherboard (~60W)... oh, we're already at 375W, only 9W off the 384W rated on that PSU. And that's not considering the drives, fans, etc etc.

Would it run and allow a little bit of overclocking with the adapters? Probably. Is it cutting it way to close for a build of this budget, as well as ignoring the fact OP specifically requested a build capable of SLI?

&gt;Keep your discussion civil or you will be banned.
Great job on that yourself, by the way.

Thank you, I try.

There's a difference between build critiques and countering a suggestion with ""You may be a little AMD fanboy [...]"".

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","To be fair, the range of sizes at which somebody can be healthy, or ""reasonably healthy"", or ""not especially unhealthy"", is a wider range of sizes than the sizes that qualify as ""attractive to person X"". If that's what people are trying to say, then they have a point.

But there are limits. You make a good point too. The attitude of ""Healthy at *ANY* size"", like literally any size at all, is untrue. At some point (we could quibble about where exactly the point is), people pass from ""a little overweight but still healthy"" to ""unhealthy"". (And something similar is true for ""a little underweight"" versus ""unhealthily underweight"".)

Now along with all that, I should say the usual advice about how we should think twice about judging people, and they may actually be healthier than their body type would make you think at first glance.

But the idea that there's *nothing* wrong at all with *any* weight, no matter *how* extreme, is an untrue idea.","1364774912"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","For reference, I was a fried chicken cook at a fast food joint where I spent my days handling raw chicken and because of cross-contamination risk couldn't actually interact with other people. That job was better than this. I also drove horse-drawn carriages which involves a substantial amount of actual shit shoveling. That job was much better than this one.

High school temp job. Concrete factory. You know those 40/60/80lb bags of concrete mix you buy at the hardware store? That was what they made. The gravel and stone and whatnot are stored outside, so they need to be dried before being mixed with the cement, so those 80lb bags come off the conveyor belt at about 140 degrees. 8 hours of Grab bag from conveyor, place on pallet. Repeat. We were issued shitty gloves, went through a couple pairs a day. No respiratory protection. End each shift without the ability to raise my arms above my shoulders and caked with enough concrete dust that even after I quit it was 3 more showers before the water stopped turning grey.

So, physically the worst job I've ever had. And then... and then... the guy next to me decides small talk is the way to pass the time. He explains to me that he likes Hootie and the Blowfish even though it conflicts with his beliefs as a Klansman. I called the temp service that night and told them I wasn't going back.","1364774912"

personally, i don't like his particular brand of politics, but provided it remains legal it would be wrong to actively discriminate against him for it, and while i might like Sunderland less for hiring him that makes no difference, it's about results. i also doubt he'll be recruiting once the fans are onside, and don't expect a boom in neo-nazism in the Wearside area if they rocket up the table.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","That's a big problem these days that often goes untalked about. Bigger blogs (the ones that make a decent chunk of money from advertising) get inundated with emails on a daily basis. It takes a PR person who knows the blog owner to get through the noise to even get your stuff heard. 

The chance of your music getting onto Pitchfork or even a blog that has 20% of their readership are 0 short of you releasing a song and it blowing up some other way without the help of an email to the blog itself. Blogs write about A) What's about to be popular (new releases from top indie bands) and B) Things that get sent to them by people they trust. 

Getting on blogs in 2013 is way different than it was back in 2007 or even 2009. Music blogs that people care about get more emails than they know what to do with. So what do they do? They listen to the cream of the crop from known publicists, PR companies, and from record labels. You may get lucky and have an intern open your emails and be skyrocketed to fame, but for right now you'll probably only get traction on smaller blogs that get a handful of emails a week.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I think there are several reasons why it is not be the best approach. Quote from OP [**bold** emphasis mine]:
&gt;We believe that with this non-obtrusive sponsored content, we'll be able to properly motivate the **best responses** from scientists and **encourage the best moderation** of our community.

First, research has shown that price-based Q&amp;A (question and answer) systems do not lead to better answers. Chen, Ho, and Kim [[1]](http://www.yanchen.people.si.umich.edu/papers/google_answer_20081124.pdf) investigated Google Answers and found that offering higher prices for answers led to both more answers and longer answers, but not better or higher quality answers. 

Further, Jeon, Kim, and Chen [[2]](http://misc.si.umich.edu/media/papers/note0895-jeon.pdf) reanalyzed data from [[1]](http://www.yanchen.people.si.umich.edu/papers/google_answer_20081124.pdf), and from another study [[3]](http://nguyendangbinh.org/Proceedings/CHI/2008/docs/p865.pdf) (which found that answer quality was higher in fee-based Q&amp;A sites), and concluded that even though price is a factor in whether a question receives an answer, it doesn't effect the *quality* of the answer. These findings were confirmed by another study by Hsieh, Kraut and Hudson [[4]](https://www.msu.edu/~garyh/docs/hsieh-CHI2010-mahalo.pdf), which examined a separate fee-based Q&amp;A system.

Second, I think it is problematic in that it was implemented without feedback from the community, and based on the response so far, it goes against the culture of the community as well as the ways in which it has been socially structured. It seems that the community already engages in a high level of moderation both formally (moderators) and informally (community sanctions through down-voting or comments); so I am not sure how the sponsored content is supposed to ""encourage the best moderation"". 

Third, as others have mentioned, there seems to be a lack of transparency in how choices are made in regards to these sponsored threads, among other things mentioned elsewhere in the comments of this thread.","1364774921"

Balch: I lived there. Generally the rooms are larger than those in other dorms... unless you're stuck in a forced double. Which I was. This is where they put two girls into a single - sufficient space, but it's comparatively cramped. It was usually pretty quiet but it's not like you're completely isolated; I'm living with girls from my freshman floor. It's also closest to central campus. Unfortunately I found the dorm kind of smothering and disliked the study lounges since they were kind of dim. 

CKB: These were pretty nice and new. Rooms are grouped in blocks of 5 people and there is one shared bathroom, so you have the luxury of not having to deal with completely communal bathrooms. There are little kitchen/TV lounges on the ends of each hallway where I spent a lot of my time.

Mews: It looked a lot like CKB.

Donlon: Everyone was noticeably more social there and doors were almost always open - something you don't usually see in the dorms I listed above. 

HR5: I feel like this building is falling apart.

cannot say it did not happen because history is recorded.

Gad, you are an ignorant fool.  That isn't my argument at all.  

Simply put, the Book of Mormon is known to be false because the story it tells does not withstand scrutiny.  Linguistics, archeology and genetics all show that Native Americans are from East Asia, not the Levant, as the Book of Mormon states.  They have been here for thousands of years longer than the Book of Mormon says they could have been here for.  Etc, etc.

&gt; What do they say?

They're portions of the Book of the Dead, which bears absolutely no resemblance to the fraudulent Book of Abraham,  your ""prophet"" wrote.

&gt; You could tell me that stars are in space. I could tell you that you are deeply deluded, and that stars are an optical illusion.   In the end, my argument would be as foolish as yours, and even more ignorant. How can this mean whether or not stars are in space?

Simple.  Evidence shows the stars are in space.  Things like parallax and Doppler shifts prove it.  Were you to persist in your ""optical illusion"" argument in the face of the facts then you'd be behaving delusionally.  Similarly, 
you are deeply deluded because deny the evidence the Book of Mormon is patently false and persist with believing in the factuality an obvious fabrication.

It was dumping snow and only the base lifts were open due to the winds. My brother and I skied a few runs down bottom, but we were looking for something a little more. We decided to take the slow-ass double (same one OP is on) up to see what we could see. Lo and behold. The t-bar is open and is taking a massive line of people up to the top.

It was a 30 minute line in the freezing cold and a tranquil 10ish up to the top but we knew it would be worth it. Most of those taking the t-bar were just bailing down the faces. They didn't realize that the ridiculously high winds had turned the fresh and still accumulating powder into a heavy crust. Though it was his first time on the mountain, my brother knew where to go. We were halfway across the huge mountain but the traverse was worth it. It took a lot of energy and guts to get through and climb uphill with 50-60mph gusts, but we made it. We made it to bracket basin.

The trees were perfectly thinned. There was just enough room to make turns, yet it was still fairly difficult. The powder in here was sheltered from the wind and was light as a feather. I quickly overheated, despite the fact that I couldn't feel my extremities a few minutes ago. We couldn't believe that there were no tracks. Not a single person had been back there! As we descended farther, the ""DANGER CLIFF"" signs only egged us on.

There it was. A beautiful (approx) 10 foot drop into a fluffy cloud. There were so many perfect drops from that cliff. On each of the three runs we took into that woods, there was always another perfect spot to jump off. That was a glorious day. I'm still pissed that my contour had run out of memory.","1364774946"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","And you can state that most ""trainers"" wouldn't know what to do with what knowledge, exactly? Have you happened to take a look at our educational competencies or standards of practice? And while wikipedia states he ""reached into his neck to pinch the artery closed"", no other verified source does (you will notice there is no source). If you take a look at the video, he applied direct pressure to Malarchuk's neck with a towel and assisted him off the ice, where they were met by the team physician to then took over his care. Pizzutelli, the *athletic* trainer, absolutely saved his life that day with his quick response and his knowledge to apply direct pressure and do whatever it took to slow the bleeding. I am not saying that he didn't perhaps pinch the jugular to assist, but there does not seem to be much verification of this, and over the years this very easily might have become an urban legend.

Before you go disparaging an entire profession of highly trained, educated medical professionals, try looking at it like this: maybe Malarchuk is alive *because* an athletic trainer was present, rather than being lucky his AT was Pizzutelli.","1364774948"

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","So first, to answer your post specifically. I you are having problems remembering your thoughts, a Journal would be a good thing to keep handy and inventing your own style of short hand musical notes like how other people are suggesting. A voice recorder is also a solid tool; if it works for you, use it! In fact I would say that is the best general advice... find a methodology that works for you and use it abundantly!

Now for the way I work...

THIS STAGE IS A NEW FIRST FOR ME:
1) The biggest problem I have been encountering as I have been approaching music production more seriously lately is a lack of organization to my sample libraries. So, I have been convicted to do the painfully tedious task of dissecting my sample libraries, renaming the samples I LIKE from their general names (ie: kick 1, kick 2, etc) to names I can understand and click with (ie: club thump kick, fatty kick, etc). As I am doing that, I am draggin the samples into appropriate folders that I have created, deleting some that I hate, and keeping the ""meh"" samples in their original folders (and the only thing left in those folders are the ""meh"" samples. I am only in the beginning stages of this, so I can't tell you how effective it has been for me, but I can tell you that it's the way MY BRAIN works and I will always emphasize using a creative organization according to the way the Creator created your brain. I understand my methodology and everything in it is organized specifically from my understanding so I'll intuitively be able to find what sort of sound I am looking for. 

2) Make patches with my VST's for fun. Emphasizing for FUN! If it becomes a tedious practice, you'll learn to hate this stage and it'll show in the sound. Have fun with it. Groove to it. As you build, either build randomly or aim for recreating a sound you like from another producer. Sometimes starting with a preset that you like and then tweaking it to be your sound is good, sometimes starting from scratch is better. It all depends. Point is, ENJOY this stage and do it often. As you create a synth that you really like, save it and name it something that you can click with.

3) I am a Beatboxer, and have been for 10+ years. Like your recorder, this is a handy skill I use not only for remembering a musical idea, but creating musical patterns in the studio, seeing if other people like an idea and if it might be worthy of expanding upon in the studio, for sampling purposes, and for inspiring myself through writers block (and probably other ideas that I am just not acknowledging right now). 

4) Get inspired somewhere. This either happens from listening to music, playing around with friends and instruments, beatboxing, shower singing, etc. Just whatever gets me whenever it gets me. Ya dig?


Finally to get to studio time. I want to emphasize that for me sitting down in the studio is NOT the beginning of my work flow. It's almost the last stage! I first need to have sounds that match my personal sound tastes easily available so I can translate what is in my head to my DAW. Second, I have to be inspired to utilize the sounds I spent time finding/creating and this has to pop up many times during the studio sessions and in between studio sessions.

5) Take my inspiration and get busy with my sounds! If your samples and VST patches are well organized then you can get started quickly. Don't be afraid to tweak your sounds, you'll often need to. Maybe even save those tweaks as a separate patch with a similar name, but with an add-on that you'll remember it by.

6) Work in 8-16 bar loops to create a BASIC theme for your melody, harmony, rhythm, etc until feel what is in your head is now in a BASIC workable form on your DAW. I tend to start beat first and to do Spend a LOT OF TIME EQing and in general mixing at this stage. I feel it's really important to spend a lot of time making sure your stereo field is balanced properly and filled out nicely before moving on to arrangement.

7) Get re-inspired!! Go listen to music. If you DJ, DJ. If you tap spoons, TAP DEM SPOONS! Whatever you can do to get in a mood of intuitively understanding the way music flows (Breakdowns/builds/drops/intros/outros) and how to understand what makes a crowd react, DO IT!!! 

8) Then go back to the studio. Dissect the loops, expand ideas, and start layering and building the different sections of your song.

9) Repeat 7-8 till done.


Hope this helps. God Bless you. Happy Easter! He IS Risen

"technology","t5_2qh16","No, my day job is helping design supercomputers. The need for efficiency is driven by a few things. First, most new supercomputers will be placed into an existing structure and there's only so much improvement you can make to the cooling systems. They can remove a given number of kwh of waste heat while, all things being equal a faster computer throws off more heat. Most cooling systems still basically funnel air past heat sources and that limits how much heat can be withdrawn. More exotic ones may use liquid cooling but that has it's own problems. Second, energy is costly. Deals for the big systems are now including contract terms about maximum energy usage.

System speed keeps going up, believe me, but without mitigating the energy usage the power consumption would go up faster.","1364774962"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","You've got the right idea. The standard advice, for those who can't max out all their tax-advantaged accounts ($17,500 for a 401k and $5,500 for a Roth IRA) is to do it in this order:

* First, contribute up to the employer match in your employer-sponsored 401k
* Then, if you can save more, max out your Roth IRA
* Then, if you still have room in your budget to save after that, go back and stick as much as you can in your employer 401k up to the legal limit.

But if you can put $23k away in a year, then it doesn't matter what ""order"" you do it in, because it's all the same. 

The key here is ""contribute to the Roth after you meet the 401k match"" but somehow this advice keeps getting twisted into ""only contribute up to the employer match AND NO MORE"", which doesn't make sense. You only have a limited amount you can put in tax-advantaged accounts and you want to take full advantage of that if you can. You said you're already planning to max out your Roth IRA, so put everything else you can into the 401k.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","What you have to realise is that Charles V's empire was big. Really, really big. Yet he wasn't simply the Holy Roman Emperor - his lands included areas which weren't part of the Holy Roman Emperor - nor was he simply king of one single kingdom. He held the title of every individual kingdom or county he held. To administer these lands, he basically trekked around Europe all his life, visiting all his lands and giving them at least some of his time. I actually have the stats here: between 1519 and 1555, he spent 29% of his time in Castile, 10% in Aragon, 26% in the Netherlands (both what is now Belgium and the Netherlands), 24% in the Holy Roman Empire, 2% in Italy and 9% on lands that weren't his and at war. Needless to say, this wasn't an easy way to rule. Splitting up the empire would make it more manageable. 

But there's more to it. Because of the difficulty of ruling such vast lands, Charles relied on family members and such to rule in his place while he was in his other lands. For the traditional lands of the Habsburgs - meaning Austria - his brother Ferdinand got this position. In 1530, he was also named King of the Romans, which was the name for the heir elect of the Holy Roman Empire. While Emperors were elected, it was common practice for a ruling Emperor to name a successor. The main reason for this was that the ruling Emperor could use his political capital and his actual capital to aid his successor, which would no longer be possible after his death. Considering how hard Charles V had to fight to become Emperor and how much money he had to spend to do it, it's no wonder he wanted the transition to go as smoothly as possible. So, in 1530 Ferdinand was named heir and generally did the little work the HRE had while Charles was away. As to why Ferdinand was chosen and not Phillip, well, at the time, Phillip was only three years old and considering Charles' lifestyle, death lurked around every corner. He needed a heir that could retain the title and keep it in the Habsburg family (which was super-important for the Habsburgers), even if he were to drop dead in a year or so. It's also likely that the manoeuvring to get an heir elected started before Phillip was born, even. Besides, it would be more difficult for Phillip to hold the title, because he was basically Spanish, while Ferdinand was a True German. 

But because Ferdinand was now sure to be HRE once Charles died or abdicated, Charles couldn't just take the Habsburgs lands from him. You can't have a HRE who bows his head to someone 24 years his junior and aside from the Holy Roman Crown has no title of his own, who only manages some lands for his Spanish nephew. 

There's more to it, I reckon, but this is at least part of it.","1364774969"

"compsci","t5_2qhmr","Not only that, but there are situations in which negative indices are the most clear and concise way to perform certain pointer operations, such as retrieving the previous element of an array:

    int get_prev(int *array_element)
    {
            return array_element[-1];
    }

This is done without having to know the location of the start of the array or having to calculate any absolute indices, and should only fail if given an invalid pointer or a pointer to the first element of an array.

EDIT: Without negative indexing, it would probably look more like this:

    int get_prev(int *array_element)
    {
            int *prev_element = array_element - 1;
            return *array_element;
    }

or this:

    int get_prev(int *array_element)
    {
            return *(array_element - 1);
    }

which are still quite *concise*, thanks to C's pointer arithmetic rules, but I have never found C's pointer arithmetic to be all that *clear* due to the multi-definition operators.

If you don't even have the pointer arithmetic to rely on, it becomes even worse. **oh god these examples are stupid, why did I even bother typing them out**  
More concise version:

    /*
     * Assuming all arithmetic operations on pointers are defined identically to
     * arithmetic operations on unsigned integers.

    int get_prev(int *array_element)
    {

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","I think that GF is going to creat those remakes right after Pokemon X and Y. Here's my point:

Red/Blue were on the original Gameboy
Silver/Gold on the Gameboy color
Ruby/Sapphire on the GBA

The remake of Red/Blue were on the GBA. So GF ""jumped over"" the Gameboy color.
The remake of Silver/Gold on the Ds, so GF ""jumped over again"" the GBA.

So if we follow this idea, Ruby/Sapphire were for the GBA, GF ""jumped over"" the DS and are going to make the remakes for the 3Ds.

Moreover, on the GBA, they first made Ruby/Sapphire and AFTER, they made Red and Blue remakes. Same thing on the DS, we played Diamond/Pearl and then they made Soulsilver/Heartgold. So GF will release X and Y first and then we'll have Ruby/Sapphire.

That's only speculations, but I sure hope that my dreams will come true! :P

It's been years, and we've both moved on and are happily shacked up with awesome people, but sometimes nostalgia is nice.

The only thing of real concern, then, is her saying she tossed it when she didn't. I hate when people lie about little things like that and then get caught in it, but it's totally possible that she just couldn't bring herself to say ""hey, I really want to keep this even though it seems weird.""

If the U.S. was trying to play an imperial game that Japan and France failed at, but that lowly China was successful at in previous millenia, they aren't good at it despite all their advantages that those other powers lacked.  

Look at other areas they have failed, like in Korea, which is the most comparable example to Vietnam. What resources were they after then? Or look at the Boxer Rebellion. Where are the opium spoils of war that they won? Why didn't they take their sphere of influence like the other imperialists of the day.    

Another argument against this American Empire can be seen when we look at where the U.S. has not failed. Like in the western hemisphere. Was the Monroe Doctrine, made before the U.S. was even more than a backwater regional power to the titans of the day, really about resources and not about ideals?  

This idea is even more ridiculous when you look at the U.S. present day. What's stopping them from being Imperial Rome or Imperial Britain? They are the sole super power, with no rival. 

A much more accurate argument would be to not dismiss the ideals of the U.S. but to also admit that there are influential super-capitalists in the U.S. whose ideals are not the U.S.'s but to say that the ""US involvement in Indochina was not for any kind of noble morale ideology as you have stated, but for control over the region in order to manipulate the land and it's people for economic gain"" is just simply as myopic as the U.S.'s foreign policy.

So, the main reason that this isn't a backpass is that Sagna is simply clearing it, not trying to get it to the keeper.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","If you want the car to last and get great mileage DO NOT GET A PRIUS. The thing that people always seem to forget about is the batteries. They may have changed but when I looked at one about 5 years ago the batteries only lasted about 120k miles and then they cost about $4k to replace. I did the math vs a 25mpg car and you came close to breaking even.

What you want is  TDI(diesel) VW (jetta or Passat). I own one of each and they both get high 40's to 50 MPG. The advantage is that these engines last FOREVER. My newer one is about to roll 200k miles and runs like the day I got it and my older one has a little over 300k on it and runs just as well. I have a friend who just broke 550k on his. 

You can buy them new for 24-28k but I would recommend buying one that is like 3 years old with about 40-50k miles on it. That way you can get it for probably 15-18k and get the premium interior. By getting the interior upgraded you can be sure it will last for 10+ years and still feel new. My 04 jetta has the top of the line interior in it and I could convince you that it is only a couple years old. Also make sure you get the stick because they are more durable, last longer, and you get 3-4 MPG better out of it. ","1364774996"

"medicine","t5_2qhff","Melbourne for many reasons. Currently, I live at Noosa, on the sunshine coast (about half-way up the east side of Aus). Temperatures range from mid 30-40's (?80-100s F) in summer to about 15 during the day in winter (~40-50 F). I live right by the beach.

The problem here, is that the local hospital, while good, isn't truly world class...yet. A new tertiary level hospital is getting constructed, due to open around the same time I get my fellowship. My long term plan is to live here.

Melbourne offers a return to city-level medicine, with truly world-class facilities and mentors. I feel like I need to get that experience now, I've learnt the basics, and I want to really have my eyes opened.

I am choosing Melbourne over Sydney for the simple fact that while Sydney is a great city, it just doesn't feel like home to me like Melbourne does. The laneways, culture, ability to commute via tram and bicycle, all make it that much more appealing to me. Plus it's cheaper to live in the city centre.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in 5th grade living in northern New Jersey. We lived essentially an hour or so from the city and a lot of people's parents commuted. They didn't tell us anything, although the teachers would whisper to each other and a good number of students were pulled out of class during the day. Eventually we demanded to be told what was happening, or we wouldn't allow the class to continue. After we were told there was the initial reaction from most students, and every student who had commuter parents were dead silent. I wanted to call my mom and ask if everyone was okay, but I knew if anything had happened she would have pulled me out. I decided not to take up time on the office phone that other kids may have needed.

After school my mom took my sister and I to the highest hill in town, along with many other families, and we watched the dust and smoke rise.

*Bonus story from my dad's perspective:*

He watched the whole thing happen from the George Washington Bridge. He said that everyone was stopped on the bridge to watch the scene, but he sped off thinking that if they hit a building a bridge would be another likely location. We didn't know about the other planes at the time, of course. He said driving in NYC was one of the eeriest experiences he's ever had. The streets were virtually abandoned where he was. My dad worked on the big Toys R Us store that was being built at the time (a special effects designer). He and his boss had access to some video streams on Broadway and they tuned the screens to any news channel covering what was happening despite the orders of his boss's boss. (Or close to Broadway. I honestly can't recall entirely.) ","1364775006"

My four years at Berkeley were amazing and while I was studying under award winning professors I was also able to play a sport and be active in a fraternity- 2 things architecture students don't usually get involved in. Like you I always knew I was going to get my masters and if you work hard at Berkeley you can get into the top programs.

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","I like to suggest drinks because if things go well, there are probably things to go eat near by.  I also find night time more of a ""romantic"" setting than daytime, as well as the dimmer lighting.  It's also usually at a time (after dinner) where people don't really schedule anything after the date, so there's less reasons to leave early if things are going well.  Alcohol also makes things more fun assuming both adults are responsible and can handle their liquor.  In general, it's more conducive to a better date.  There are bars that aren't super loud.  If you are taking her, or being taken to a loud shot bar, then that probably isn't the best choice.

At a coffee shop, during the day, (as someone else mentioned), you aren't dealing with people around with the same objective.  You may have a study group next to you, people trying to look smart and read books, people actually reading books, loud kids or babies, families in general.  

Regardless, you want to be the best version of yourself on your first date, and this also means you want to dress a little better.  So does she.  This doesn't happen at coffee shops during the day.

TL;DR go have drinks for a date.  go have coffee with a friend.

I've only had one coffee date go well, but it was also at night and we had our own secluded table, and since it was at night there was not many people.  Other than that, the other coffee dates have all been bad.  Drinks dates have always turned out well.  By turned out well, they have always led to a 2nd date.","1364775007"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;The greatness which you appeal to is what is at question.

To quote blackstar9000

&gt;A point of clarification is important at the outset: ""Greatness,"" as Anselm uses the term, can only pertain to ontological greatness — that is, the quality of being. The later part of the book is dedicated to drawing a line between ontological greatness and other kinds of greatness, particularly moral greatness, but as far as the ontological argument goes, greatness pertains strictly to being. He is, as such, dealing with *degrees of being*, to the effect that a thing that could just as easily not exist as exist is understood to be of a lower degree of being than a thing that necessarily exists.

That's why its called the ontological argument. Read his full explanation of the argument [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zvyf7/can_someone_please_explain_to_me_anselms/c68awtk).","1364775007"

"Assistance","t5_2s25d","So I think it started when I was picked on for having a monobrow as a kid. I started tweezing it in like 2nd grade and it's evolved to be an obsession. It is tweezing, but even when I see just the smallest part of a hair. The result of this picture is from today, I saw a little hair, so I tweeze it. But it doesn't go away. I keep digging at it, and I can't stop until I get it. I'm pulling the skin. Blood clogs the tweezers and it's flowing good, but I can't stop until I get it. There's no shame until after. After I get it, I feel like ""What the fuck is wrong with me? Why do I do this?"" I start to panic a little. This time (and many others) I didn't get the hair, it was buried in my skin. I put the tweezer in to see how far I went this time and about 1.5 mm of my skin was gouged out. I still have an urge to pull it out about an hour later. 

I was really hoping that groupon was for real...

But anyways. I have tried waxing. The problem is, for all these years, I've kept the length to a minimum (these scabby episodes happen probably once a week to once a week and a half.) so whenever I try to let it grow to wax it, because hair needs to be like 1/4 an inch, I panic and tweeze to this point. 

I do eat it, too. I don't know if that's important... I thought it was just slightly abnormal.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","That is a fair point.  However *something* is clearly going on in the housing market which is strange.  Even Robert Shiller (of the famous Case/Shiller index) raised his own doubts about the recent uptick in the housing market:

&gt;What might explain this picture? It’s hard to pin down, because nothing drastically different occurred in the economy from March to September. Yes, there was economic improvement: the unemployment rate, for example, dropped to 7.8 percent from 8.2 percent. But that extended a trend in place since 2009. There was also a decline in foreclosure activity, but for the most part that is also a continuing trend, as reported by RealtyTrac. [[Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/business/housing-markets-future-still-has-many-clouds.html)]

So if it's not hedge funds swooping in and manipulating things, it's hard to understand what's going on since, as Shiller points out, nothing has substantially changed for the majority of would-be buyers since 2009.  Certainly we can't *assume* it's the hedge funds (and Shiller emphasizes he has no idea what it is)...but I found that consultant's statement thought-provoking in terms of the wider market.","1364775014"

I don't know much about the Multibit source code, but I suspect that it goes through the input transactions in chronological order to build up the inputs. If you look in the list of trnsactions, before the +100, you moved out all the coins that were in there (120 btc) so the wallet was empty. Then when you transferred the 12 coins, it wen to pick enough inputs to add up to above 12.

Right on.

Bottom line is this, too many assholes turn a blind eye to the bigotry and hate in their own ranks and benefit from those extremists.  The ""Not all of them"" argument is asinine justification and nothing more.  No one is implying that 100%, down to the last one, of *any* group fits any statement.  Saying ""Well there are exceptions"" is meaningless... no shit not everyone is the same.  All ""They're not all like that"" does is deflect.

If a person is supporting an organization which is causing problems, even if they themselves 'say' they're different, they're still supporting the problem.  

If it's a minority of 'bad people' who are guiding policy, maybe the 'good people' should leave the damn organization and quit lending their money and numbers to it.  However, when those ""Good People"" are directly contributing to the problem, *they're also the problem.*  And I'm not going to tip-toe around it and let them hide comfortably behind the idea that 'well I'm not *directly* doing it, so I'm a good person'... no, they're not.

I'm not saying everyone is *equally* guilty, or that everyone is *equally* causing problems... but if you're giving your money and voice to an organization that is... well what you would call it?  ","1364775016"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Honestly, I think the Loremaster's book for the One Ring RPG is pretty good. I thought that, of all the licensed products, that particular RPG was closest to the ""tone"" of the books.

Another officially licensed product that I thought gave nice perspective was the ""Playing Heroes"" section in the character creation chapter of the Lord of the Rings RPG. It highlighted the valorous/virtuous behavior of the characters in the novels (i.e. How Aragorn refused to ambush an old man, even if he was pretty sure it was Saruman), and I've always remembered and used those examples when I try to tell players what I expect from them in my LotR games. 

I've GMed a lot of Middle-earth games, and here are just some tips from the top of my head:

- Focus on the the things that Tolkien focused on: journeys, nature, sprawling wilder-lands, heroism, small but laudable virtues, and fate. 

- Manage expectations. Tell your players what sort of game scope you're going for, what races and cultures are appropriate, and how much you want to deviate from canon. Saying, ""OK, let's play a game in Middle-earth"" can mean a lot of things to different people, and poorly managed expectations can lead to aggravated players. Just say, ""OK, I want to play a game about Hobbits going on an adventure during the Third Age. I don't want to break canon, so there will be some invisible walls in the game if you go crazy and try to kill Gandalf or something stupid (I'm looking at you, Frank). Remember, Hobbits are pretty normal people, so we're all going to start out at max 3 skill ranks ((I have no idea what game you're playing, just a shit example)) in any one skill.""

- That leads me to a pet peeve of mine: set narrative limits to who and what you want to run the game about. The events of the trilogy were singular, and the ""adventuring party"" that is shown is also singular. Having a Noldo, a dwarf, a hobbit, and a king all hanging out slaying orcs lacks the sort of narrative consistency that's so satisfying about Tolkien's writing. If the game is set in Eriador, give a hard list of what cultures or races can be chosen for player characters. 

- In my opinion, magic is neither as absent nor as present as people seem to think it is. That is, people are going on about how unique wizards are and there are no magic users. True enough, to a point. But at the same time, Bilbo had magic cufflinks and the 13 dwarves cast magic spells in the Hobbit - so, you know, magic is around here and there. Use a light hand with it, but don't let it leave your game. Middle-earth will be poorer without it. 

- Give your characters a chance to be great heroes or great villains. Give them circumstances where the good choice is not an easy choice, and then reward them if they make the effort to be the good guys. Middle-earth is all about heroism. 

- Go read some Norse mythology. Tolkien basically just retold/reworked/reimagined Norse and Germanic myths. He littered Middle-earth with them. The references are overt. Do the same. You'll get the same tone. ","1364775017"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;The thing is most of people dont understand that specs =/= performance and durability.

And not once have I even alluded to that. Also, I would argue that specs ARE performance and durability if you look at the right specs. EG the material and build are still ""specifications"" of a part. Every quality related to performance or durability is a measurable ""specification"". 

&gt;Just because a mac with 16gb of ram costs 200$ more than a normal pc with that much ram doesn't make it worse. 

Given two identical computers and one costing 200$ more, does in fact make it worse. Arguing that one is worse because of other specs or design makes them not equal.

&gt;The things is the macs have better built quality,better materials and their OS is more fluid giving you a better performance.

It's better than ALL other laptops? I really, really doubt it. A lot of laptops have very good materials and build. The ""fluidity"" of the OS is a subjective opinion. I, personally, enjoy Linux the most but I would never argue that it is the sole ""best"" OS just because it best fits me. 

&gt;For example 500GB HDD are totally different from 500GB ssd.
Of course ssd is more expensive and obviously much better then regular hdd.

I don't get this argument. Of course one is better than the other. The criticism that Apple gets is that they are the same quality yet much higher in price. 

&gt;And Apple ships laptops using only ssd when every other brand usually uses hybrids with hdd and ssd to make their computers more affordable.

Every other brand? Really? I guess my laptop doesn't exist. A lot of the companies I looked at when researching my purchase allowed any combination of the two. I ended up purchasing one without an SSD and then installing one myself because it was cheaper. 

&gt;Also it has been showed that most of the people who criticize apple admitted in the end that they would buy an apple product if they could afford it.

Can I get your source on this? I'm not doubting it's true, I just wanna read the study, seems really interesting. I would definitely assume the opposite. It's certainly not true for me.

&gt;That's like saying a Ferrari is worst than a BMW because it costs 100 times more.

It is nothing like that. A ferrari has different specifications than a BMW. Its design and ""under-the-hood"" specifications are largely different. 

&gt;At this moment you can see samsung and other brands are creating ultrabooks very similar to the macs when it comes to price/quality. Why? because they're using top quality materials.

Or because people are willing to pay that much. At any rate using Samsung as an example is not that smart since some of their laptops are accused of the exact same issues Apple is.

&gt;Yeah... some people don't care if the enclosure of their laptop is made of aluminum, that it doesn't matter... but others do and they pay because of it.

I did not argue against this. Nothing in my argument was related to this.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","This site is amazing, and this post made me laugh out loud multiple times. A theory about Bran, Rickon, Jon, and Dany:

&gt;Hmmm, lessee now. . . They're trekking north because Maester Luwin said Jon would protect them. But Jon is a captive, about to meet Mance Rayder -- and his right-hand man Benjen. (A show had better give us that or I'm gonna be mad.) With Benjen to lend credibility, Mance will convince Jon of the virtues of fighting for the free people against the crumbling remnants of oppressive feudalism. 

&gt;So they storm the wall, all in the name of freedom, and, just when victory is assured, Jon is ordered to kill the last two defenders left standing -- Bran and Rickon. OK, Bran isn't standing but he's a pro with a bow. Oh wait... Well anyway, as Jon emo's and dithers, Ygritte offs the littlest Starks, and, since the end of the wall means the end of Jon's pesky vow, prepares to marry him. Thus sealing her own fate (by Osha's hand), since he is destined in the any self-respecting song of fire and ice to marry Dany instead. And since Dany learned a few tricks in the House of the Undying, she is able to bring Bran and Rickon back to life to serve on the Small Council, assuming they win the upcoming parliamentary elections now that Westeros is free and democratic.

&gt;So the three-pronged purpose of the trek north is: free Jon from his vow, get rid of the Ygritte impediment, and give Jon lots of things to emo about. ","1364775022"

You are in pain and dealing with disappointment, and *still* you're able to stand back and analyse your form and work out where you went wrong. Poor form + 10lbs too much: now you know where to be careful next time. And there will be a next time. I can tell: if you're analysing your form and problem solving, you're already planning ahead to your next deadlift.

Bodies are amazing things. They change and adapt all the time. Progress isn't a linear concept - you just build on what you have, and you keep building, and your body shifts the goalposts due to age or injury or circumstance, and you build on what you have then. 

It's probably a good idea to get your back checked out. Get some pain relief at least. For most back issues, keeping pain under control and continuing to move normally is most important. Pain relief is an important part of recovery (I'm sure you know this already, right?) and I bet some reassurance from a medical professional won't go astray right now.

Now, the reasons why the authors of the Constitution chose this method are something that a historian of the period can answer fully, but the glib answer would be that since the franchise was relatively limited at the time the rules were written, limiting apportionment to those enfranchised would have created a lack of representation.

Your question might be better framed as ""Why is the number of US House representatives STILL apportioned by total population, rather than some other method that better takes into account the nature of the modern electorate?""","1364775025"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Somewhat building off of this, here's a thought (probably fairly stupid and/or scientifically unsound) I've had:

All the thousands/millions of bacteria and enzymes and cells and everything in your body doing all these biological processes, and they don't realize that they make up a ""human being."" As far as they ""know"" (which I guess they can't really know anything anyway but for the sake of argument) they are all just individual cells or organisms living out their own life. But in reality they all work together in incredibly complex ways to make up a human. 

So, what if every person, animal, plant, planet, star, black hole, everything in the universe is just like all those cells and bacteria in the human body? What if the universe is just another organism, infinitely more complex than a human, just like a human is infinitely more complex than a single skin cell?

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Here is a good site: http://www.savingforcollege.com/

There is a lot of information, and it can be overwhelming, but take your time and read through some of it.

Most 529 plans have two options, a pre-paid tuition plan, and a investment account.  The pre-paid tuition plans usually cover the cost of an instate school, and if your child decides to go to a school out of state, it will pay $X amount towards the tuition for that school.  The investment account is much like a 401k, you pick from the available funds to invest in, and what you have available when your child goes to school is what you have.  There are pros and cons to both.

The next step might be to look at your state's (or the state you claim) 529 plan to see if there is any state income tax deduction.  The deduction might not be the sole reason to pick a plan, as your state plan may have high fees or something else that negates the benefit of the tax deduction.  You can invest in any state plan, or with companies such as Vanguard.

One of the things to keep in mind though, is to make sure you are properly funding your retirement first, as your kids can get loans or scholarships for school.","1364775039"

People rarely say ""retard"" in reference to people with mental disabilities anymore. Now, it just means someone who's acting like an idiot. Language changes constantly. So much so that I can't see it having an effect on the acceptance of a person's lifestyle. And like I said, I'm sure it offends people, but I've yet to be in a situation where I've offended a person because of the use of the word ""faggot."" Therefore, I can't really see it as something that truly offends people. Maybe our experience has been different because of the places we live in, or the way we grew up. I don't know.

But I guarantee you, the day that it offends someone, I'll stop immediately. I rarely use the term anyway, and I'd never want to offend someone like that.

"drums","t5_2qie5","This is one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite bands.  You're awesome.

I commented on this as I watched it (see below).  After watching, I think it was a pretty legit cover.  There were some spots where you didn't match the original fills and such, but overall it was solid.  You did a great job doing the primary job of a drummer—keeping time.  Though I would pay special attention to my 8th point(s) and consider it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm going to comment on this as I watch it:

1. Just to point out: in the introduction, Matt rolls up from his floor tom to his rack tom on the upbeat in between beats 2 and 3.  So, if T represents ""hands together,"" it's T T RL T T.

2. Most of your fills are *so close* to the original, but they're not exact.  If covering this exactly like Matt plays it is your goal, then listen just a little closer.  In general though, you did well keeping time through your fills and coming back out of them.

3. In the second part of the intro, I think you crashed on beat 1 too much.  You shouldn't do it on every measure.

4. You have a nice touch on your ghost notes, but I feel like something is missing from them.  Maybe try being a little lighter with them.  Let the stick drop from your fingers.

5. Great job keeping time through that kick roll at 1:10!

6. When blasting, keep a steady roll on your double kick.  Just a constant RLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLRLR.  FYI, most drummers play two beats on the kick for every blast with the hands (it would be the foot speed you use at 1:10), but on this song Matt plays one beat on the kick for every blast with the hands.

7. Take look at 1:39~1:40-ish.  When you hit your splash, you do it with your right hand even though your left hand wasn't doing anything.  Save some energy (and keep a consistent sound) by efficiently using both hands.

8. You're swaying from 2:09–2:20.  Count the subdivisions in your head.  While we're on that note (no pun intended), this is something that I figured out for myself recently and it might help you out.  Until recently, I would count in my head just like I would be talking or something.  The loud music still had room to overpower my mind.  Now, I SCREAM the beats and subdivisions in my head.  I sway a lot less from the beat now because my thinking is stronger, and I also concentrate more power into my strokes' moment of impact.  

8.1. If you've ever studied karate, you'll know that one key feature is keeping your body relaxed up until the last moment before you deliver your strike.  I think that can apply to drumming, too.  If you stay relaxed and focus all of your power in the moment right before and during your contact with the drum, you'll be able to stay on top of the time better.

8.2. As a drummer playing with any other musicians, it should feel like you're sitting your 500-pound butt on top of the beat.  Sit back, relax, and don't get too anxious.  Being excited and passionate is definitely part of playing great drums, but you have to be chill enough to not sway from the beat.  Practice with a metronome.  When you get good at keeping time with the metronome, practice switching styles while keeping the same tempo.  For example, set the metronome to 120 bpm; practice switching from a jazz-swing beat to a samba to a rock to a bossa nova to a funk, etcetera.  Fills and transitions are the easiest and most common places to lose time.

NINE. I can't tell for certain, but it looks like you could have better foot technique.  Even if you play heel-up, don't let the ball of your foot come off of the pedal.  The ankle should be a pivotal point and work in continues motion with the rest of your leg.  Perhaps you're already doing this, but it's hard to tell in the video.

TEN. I just noticed: it looks like you're holding your sticks too low.  You'll have better power, control, and all the good stuff if you get a better grip on those sticks.

ELEVEN. Overall, you did a fantastic job, man.  Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing more of your covers.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Connection latency would be terrible. Measuring latency in milliseconds for a machine like this is unacceptable. Typical HPC latency figures measure in nanoseconds. Milliseconds is a lifetime by comparison. Los Alamos security over a fiber run that long would also be a nightmare. Dedicated fiber would likely have to be run due to throughput and security requirements. Those machines move data around at hundreds of gigabits per second. Also, almost nobody in Alaska with the proper security clearance could service, operate, or repair the machine. Staff would have to be relocated and housed at enormous expense. Shipping and delivery of the machine and replacement parts would be cost prohibitive and require international paperwork, which sucks. Weather and accessibility would also be a priority. There's never any problem getting trucks up Los Alamos. The same can't be said for much of Alaska. There's also the issue of power. Can anywhere on the normal alaska power grid handle a constant draw of several dozen megawatts for what amounts to one customer? Doubtful without a dedicated power plant -- which Los Alamos has a few of already.

However, the confusing part is that when the host gives you every other door, he doesn't open them all at once. He opens the wrong one first and opens the right one at the end, after asking you if you want to switch. But since you know all along that he's going to open the wrong one first, it doesn't change the fact that 2 doors is better than 1. ","1364775059"

I know it's nit-picky, but there's also cryo-loops with oil, using epoxy to glue, tension pins, etc. Picking and mounting crystals are more skills gained over time and experience. I think its easier to teach someone about the matrix collection rather than look at this demonstration of the technique. 

It really bothered me when you said ""pure crystal"" instead on single crystal. I think you should introduce something about twinning, which I think is probably the most common problem when picking crystals.

When you talk about centering the crystal, you don't explain how you're centering. I know most people center by spinning phi 90 degrees 4 times and moving to the cross hairs. Perhaps you should say how you center and the theory behind it. Why does it need to be centered?

I liked the explication of predicting a lattice, but you dropped in systematic absence like it was a common term. You should probably explain it. 

In closing, I feel like your video tries to do way to much in to short of a time. I really think it would benefit you to break it into 3 parts. Do one on the theory of crystallography: braggs law, diffraction patterns, and the Ewald sphere. Then about what constitutes a good crystal: clean face, no twin, polarized light, Mounting, etc. Why do you use a glass fiber? For the lat part do your talk about matrix data. 

I dont know the requirements for the project, so I can't really judge, but I have a problem with the coherency of video. I feel like I ripped you a new asshole and I'm sorry, but I always get more out of it when people destroy my presentations. ","1364775072"

I still think the government doesn't necessarily need to have any hand in the matter of ""marriage."" What difference is there if I choose to live a fully monogamous life with a woman without ever choosing to get legally married and me actually getting married to that woman? In society's eyes? Virtually none. We can still have kids, we'd still live together, everything would be the same. But in the eyes of the government, for us to be treated as a domestic couple, we need to be legally married.

That seems pretty silly to me, whether it's dealing with heterosexual, homosexual or whatever else couples. I think the government should not be able to discriminate with regards to any sort of committed domestic couple, whether they're ""married"" or not.

That's the basis for me saying that I think the government should get rid of the word. Does that make sense?","1364775081"

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","The other way to think about this is to ask if learning style is nature or nurture. A couple decades ago, teaching started to change from being aimed primarily at learners who were good at getting information from sitting and listening to being aimed at people who learned better from group work and experimentation (enquiry-based learning). 

If you look at Kolb, he talks about learning as being a sequence of activities (feeling, doing, watching and thinking); you have to do all of them to really grasp the material, but people vary in terms of their preferences. To me, good teachers try to provide a range of activities so all the learners get an activity they like, but that's not always 100% possible.

To answer your question, successful learners can identify their strengths and weaknesses to the point where they can say ""Oh, this assignment is asking me for feeling and reflecting, which I hate, but if I approach the task in this way, I will be able to do it"". Oddly enough, the students who are most likely to be able to do this kind of meta cognition are the ones with learning disabilities, because they've had to think about the way they learn.

Can we learn to learn in particular ways? I think so, yes. High achieving students MAY be really self-aware, or they may be really bright kids who learn the way they learn, and are fine until they get to like 3rd year uni where they hit a wall.","1364775083"

Indeed, have we? I unsubbed from that place a few weeks back though, as it was trying my patience to an excessive degree, and had become thoroughly unproductive.

&gt;I agree that it could be interesting, but I also don't care for the idea of giving undue attention or indeed a platform to a man whose policies and perspectives I consider to be vile

Ah, so because you don't like what he says, and despite the fact that he's a fairly important man with views supported by probably a few million and an undoubted influence on the rightward shift the Big Two are taking on the policy of immigration, you don't want others to be able to ask him questions and learn more about his party - because you personally disagree with him?

I've got to say, views like that are a big part of the reason I left /r/Scotland. I really can not abide people whose solution to the existence of people they disagree with is to try and censor or silence those people. I don't know what you *think* you're achieving by such a thing, but all you're working towards is turning this place into an echo-chamber, just as anything political in /r/Scotland has become.

I've got big balls
And they're such big balls
fancy big balls
And he's got big balls,
And she's got big balls,
But we've got the biggest balls of them all!

And my balls are always bouncing
My ballroom always full
And everybody comes and comes again
If your name is on the guest list
No one can take you higher
Everybody says I've got great balls of fire!

CHORUS
Some balls are held for charity
And some for fancy dress
But when they're held for pleasure,
They're the balls that I like best.
And my balls are always bouncing,
To the left and to the right.
It's my belief that my big balls should be held every night.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Yeah it is still a choice, but anyways, if God wanted man to choose good, at least more often, he could have made man with Christ like qualities. Also, he could give man more reasons to be good and the intelligence for humans to see those reasons. That would not be denying man his choices in any way. 

It would still be a choice, just not a choice that he knows very few people will make. 

You seem to think that unless it's only being made by a few people, it isn't a real choice. If you believe that God wants humans to go through life and wants goodness to be a *hard* choice, then I probably couldn't argue against that. But I think it's just obvious at this point that God could do a better job of creating man if his primary objective was for man to choose good. He obviously could create better men if he wanted man to choose good. 

At this point, if we don't get somewhere farther in this debate, I'm going to have to abandon this. I feel like we're cycling over and over again through the same points and that this was pretty clear in the beginning, if God wanted man to choose good, he would have made better men. ","1364775097"

No. It reads ""Exxon's Canadian pipeline"", because this very pipeline was at the center of a heated political debate in not only Canada, but the US as well. So it makes perfect sense to not only designate which company's pipeline but also the pipeline itself, because Arkansas has its own oil fields.

Throughout these two months, it was impossible to find the guy. Told me to come in a specific date and time, and he wouldn't show up.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","Because it's not about any of the things you listed, it's purely about cutting the welfare budget and having the poor pay for something they weren't responsible for, all whilst the rich get tax cuts and have their welfare protected.

It's another poll tax, pure and simple, there are not enough smaller properties in existence for people to move into, therefore they will be forced to pay the extra money even though many are already living hand to mouth. In addition, benefits are being cut in real terms and being hit with a bunch of reductions at the same time which will increase poverty, child poverty, use of food banks, homelessness etc. - all of which are considered pretty disgusting in one of the wealthiest countries in the world in the year 2013.

The overall Tory welfare rhetoric is also particularly irritating because they're lying; creating another ""us and them"" situation by labelling everyone in receipt of benefits as lazy scroungers, despite the majority of the people being in work, the majority of people affected by this being disabled and the majority of the budget being pensions.

So in essence, this won't solve any of the problems you suggest, it will simply punish the poor to pay for the rich. That's not a left-wing hippy position; it is fact and that's why there's outrage. If they were serious about solving the housing crisis in the UK, they would embark upon an unprecedented housebuilding endeavour and THEN implement this by working with tenants to offer them a smaller place to move into BEFORE instituting the tax.","1364775112"

Is already in effect.  It is *already* the case that felons can't own firearms.  It hasn't had much of a positive effect.  What's more, when a felon attempts to buy a gun from a vendor, the federal government often doesn't do anything about it.

"occult","t5_2qhmc","One thing I gleaned from the ""refiners fire"" and something I've noticed with folks like Foucault, Heidegger and Nietzsche is that madness is a virtue.

In religion and mysticism these are the phenoms and prophets. In philosophy these are the ones that say radical shit and back it up.

Our society, culture and history is a trajectory that is led by the tangents of the mad.

In alchemy and secret societies, the charlatan reigns supreme.

It's not to say that there is not ""something there"" in mysticism and the sacred, it's just to say that some people ""get it"" (smith, Crowley, st. Paul) and some people bemoan the loss of ""purity"" or whatever while the gifted ones know that that loss is inevitable. Instead they are happy to relish the divine luck of being present at a special moment and will ride it to the bank/heaven.

There is a fabulous essay by Leo Strauss ""on Nietzsche"" which speaks to this.

There are two types of philosophers:

A.The ones that MAKE the law 

And 

B, the ones who merely interpret it.


The gist of the Strauss essay I mentioned is that a real philosopher knows that truth is a trap and to merely contemplate and ruminate endlessly on truth is foolish because truth is made, reality is a collaboration, but you must convince everyone that the opposite is so. 

Truth HAS to be transcendent and rooted in infinity to be free from petition.

In other words the really good philosophers/priests are A while appearing as B.

This is where the jews got wise to the Egyptians. The Egyptian gods were too immanent thus too reproachable.

By criminalizing images and icons and relegating ""truth"" to the ineffable and a text, they guaranteed god was transcendental thus irreproachable.

Joseph Smith may very well have been the last true larger than life charlatan of the alchemical tradition.

People like Smith, Hubbard, Crowley and the farm teamers like koresh and Jim jones are the ones that dabble in the magic, understand the ""real"" purpose (in their minds) of the psychological technology of priest craft and do what any fearless entrepreneur SHOULD do with that kind of information- start a cult. If their lucky it becomes a religion.

Crowley WANTED to do what Hubbard did and Parsons was merely the weird parasitic vehicle/vein being unwittingly used by Hubbard to graft Crowleys ""joussance"" onto his own.

The irony is that Crowley actually had principles and wasn't enough of a scoundrel to go full charlatan.

For Smith it's slightly different. He WAS a charlatan for all intent and purpose yet he had the magical ability to convince himself otherwise.

Mormonism is the quintessential ""American"" religion complete with a rough and tumble cast of grifters, puffers, carnies, spiritualists and westward expansion.

It's always what it was that is beautiful and charming. Never what it is.

This is the essence of the fight club metaphor in my opinion.

Nothing touches the magic of a cults/religions initial inception. At a certain point, standardizing forces take over and fuck it up.","1364775115"

That, and the super-micro-managing CEO (this is a one-office company with less than 10 employees, so it's not like she was actually important other than being the founder of the business) would visit the office and just fuck shit up every other day she was in the office, and it got to the point where we'd be more concerned with pleasing the CEO than we were with pleasing our actual CLIENTS. Plus, she was something like 70 years old, and her job knowledge was painfully archaic. She thought it was totally okay to go on job sites like Monster.com, copy-paste the posted resumes into our database, and then act like the people were now workers for us. She'd regularly encourage me to talk people into quitting their jobs (which I never did) so they could work some shitty temp job for us. Dropping the letter of resignation in front of her while she was on one of her ""visits"" and just walking out was one of the most liberating feelings of my life.","1364775131"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I remember when I was 8 years old, the good old days. I was at my early childhood friends house messing around with some jackknifes that we both had recently acquired. We decided to start throwing the knives at a tree nearby, not the best decision, and were getting very good. After about 10 minutes of throwing i decided to throw my knife extremely fast to see how many spins I could get. As i started to make the throw, I over rotated my throw and threw the knife right into the front of my shin. I can remember the sight of the knife sticking about an inch in my shin. I quickly started freaking out and gave it some pull, but it wouldn't budge. The knife was stuck in the front part of my shin bone. I started to tug even harder on the knife and could feel it lodged right in my bone. The harder I pulled the more it hurt. I could feel the tip just sticking in my bone. My friend decided to try to give it a little pull, the image is forever instilled in my mind, and all of a sudden he slowly ripped the knife out of my shin and blood started spurting everywhere.There was a small bone shard sticking out of the end of my leg as blood started squirting out of my wound. Went to the hospital and could barely walk for a week or so.

Several people took the issue up with administrators, and no one would even attempt to remedy the issue, even though my school has cameras fucking everywhere, so there was ample evidence. There is another mentally retarded girl who occasionally gives her teachers the slip and runs outside to the outdoor lunch tables and sits with random people, making them rather uncomfortable. Then, when the teachers finally figure it out, they walk outside and practically have to drag her back inside. Sounds innocent, right? Dead fucking wrong. One of the times that she slipped outside, she went to sit with someone who was playing guitar. Eventually she said she wanted to try it, and since he clearly believed the above theory, he handed it over. She smashed it on the ground, breaking it into several pieces, and ran away.

The way I pixel, instead of drawing lines and making line art and then coloring it, I draw with blobs of color and then refine it. It's more like painting, and I think that's the kind of pixel art you want to do. 

Also if you work small, then drawing wont help you much any way. It's more about technique.

I would suggest trying to get into drawing later, because it will probably help you out, maybe you can take a class in it. But it's not needed.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Thanks for the advice folks.  

Most of you have suggested that rotating my shoes will make them last longer - so maybe I'll buy a cheaper pair to wear a couple of days a week too.

A few of you have also suggested foregoing the AE's and looking for nice brands available in Australia.  I would be keen to hear where the Australians on here buy their shoes.  I don't live on the east coast, and so there is a serious lack of quality shoe shops and when you can get nice brands, they're outrageously expensive. Even if I buy in Australia, I'll likely have to order online.  Shipping for a pair of AEs from amazon is only $10, so it's not big deal.  Also, with the high Aussie dollar, they're not too pricey.  I'm not sure if everyone knows this, but when you sign up to the shoe department mailing list from Amazon, you get a 20% off voucher for your first transaction.  So a pair of AEs is only $250 delivered.  If anyone can suggest a better shoe for that price that I can get in (or get delivered to) Aus, that would be great.

Also, a couple of people have said not to get black shoes if I only have one pair.  The job I'm starting will require me to be in courtrooms every day.  There's no way I could wear brown shoes every day in court in Australia.  Things must be different in the US.  I also have one black suit (amongst some other colours) and so black shoes would be the most versatile for me.","1364775179"

Also, do you have to go to the other counselor (who sounds kind of crappy btw). 

I hope you don't mind me saying this but there is no shame in taking some medicine, even if it is for a short time, to stabilize your mental process. This will give you some time and space to learn coping techniques. Is that an option for you? 

Other things that have helped me have been: 
The audios of Pema Chodron's tapes. I'm not buddhist but it was very helpful to me:  http://www.amazon.com/When-Things-Fall-Apart-Difficult/dp/1570623449  In this same line, meditation practices and simple breathing practices (as used in yoga) have helped me carve out some time to have peace in my heart. I've found that the cheap classes at the Y have been better than the fancy yoga studios. This helped me kind of find some control over my body. 

I lost my little boy a few hours after he was born in 2011 and now I can't seem to stay pregnant. I felt like (and sometimes still feel) like I was drowning in grief. But it does get better. You haven't failed your baby or your family. You're trying to get better and regain your physical and mental health, which is what matters. Good luck to you and your family.

Its not noticable when you just look at me naked, but its something thats always left me feeling different from the other guys. Its something that became not only a hang up, but also left me categorizing myself as something ""different"". It basically has prevented me from embracing my own sexual identity.

During summer the weather is absolutely nice enough for you to walk the eight or ten blocks north or south to get to the train tracks (though there might be an occasional hail storm in August- keep an umbrella at work as they tend to sneak up on you during the afternoon).  There are two big grocery stores on the west end of downtown (Safeway on 8th Street and Co-op on 10th Street, both on 10th Avenue I believe), so you don't need to leave the center to buy groceries.  I'm honestly not even sure that a transit pass would be a good investment for you- do you think you would take more than fifteen trips out of the center (or on buses) each month?  You would need to make sixteen return trips to make the pass more cost-effective than individual tickets.

"Bioshock","t5_2shl2","The time traveller's paradox doesn't fit here. One would think: if she drowned him, she never existed and couldn't drown him. Paradox. But! If she drowned him, Comstock would've never existed and therefore there wouldn't be the NEED to drown him... Anna would never get sold/stolen, be imprisoned in the tower, burn the mountains of man beneath Columbia and the Luteces wouldn't regret any decision and get Booker to rescue her. It's like the whole plot of the game never happened. (Well there is a paradox here: if it happened and it's undone, it still happened although it's undone, but it's all about unbreaking the circle and by drowning him, all possible branches of universes where Comstock exists, get cut off the tree of universes (as I imagine the multiverse) and just exists as a memory or a fixed period in time not attached to any relevance) Also, and since this whole post is like the spoiler of all spoilers, I'll just go on: the Booker that get's drowned doesn't remember an Elizabeth. When all the Elizabeths enter this last baptism, he's like: 'Who are you?' And now there are two possibilities: A) since all the attending Elizabeths don't wear a pendant, these could be Elizabeths our Booker doesn't know, although he does know the one wearing the pendant. Maybe because the real Liz loved him so much she couldn't drown him herself. Or B) this Booker is the ORIGINAL Booker that hasn't ever heard of any Elizabeth. It can't be case B) because after being asked what name he's choosing for his life after baptism, one Liz suggests Booker DeWitt and the other Zachary Comstock and he replies with: 'I'm both'. If he'd been the original Booker, he'd ask: 'Who's Zachary Comstock?!' But he didn't. He knew who this man was. And therefore is the Booker that experienced everything that happened during the game, the one who knows he had to get drowned, maybe understanding that this is the only way there'd be no universe where his daughter had to live through this horrible scenario. 
How can this Booker take an end to it? It can't be the Booker that accepted the baptism because this one wouldn't remember... This is Liz's power. It's like sending him to the point where he gave his baby girl to Robert Lutece, where he actually can't change anything, but in the baptism scenario HE doesn't. They do. They change everything. And I think the 10 odd Elizabeths attending this baptism should reflect ALL Elizabeths because applying the multiverse theory if an Elizabeth decides to drown Booker there'd still be infinite universes where she decides not to. But since she's an omniscient and omnipresent being, after the siphon is destroyed (just like the Luteces), she'd let every and I literally mean every Liz drown him, or at least attend his 'drowning', if you want (except for herself (wearing the pendant), but she's the one who makes sure he gets drowned anyway). Leaving no chance for Comstock to exist. It doesn't impact her existence since she's omnipresent (that's important for a lot of people, including myself :D)

And they all lived happily ever after. (Except for Comstock :P)  

Edit: I'd like to correct myself: the ALL Elizabeths-are-there theory is not needed. Still imagining the multiverse as a tree where each branch is a possible universe, think of the scene where Liz and Booker enter the space that contains this multiverse. The space where all the lighthouses are. This is a place where a decision doesn't influence the tide of events the usual way. By taking him to this place, it's like giving him scissors to cut branches from the tree. It's a decision that doesn't result in two different universes, each representing a possible outcome, because there he's above everything. It's a place where a decision is less important in terms of all different consequences and equally more important because there you have the ability to completely delete universes. And even here the time traveller's paradox doesn't fit. If all possible universes where Comstock exists get completely wiped from existence there would be no need to cut them from the tree. You can't cut a branch that doesn't exist, and you wouldn't have to either. It's what this game is all about: unbreaking the circle. The time traveler's paradox is about a circle. Undo something, therefore no need to undo it, don't undo it, therefore need to undo it. But if you get to out of this circle (out of the universe and into the multiverse, with a pair of sciccors) you can just delete every possibility that you'd ever do it in the first place, there's no need to undo it.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;AMD could very well be the best, but I can't seem to prove it.

It's pretty easy.  Search for recent 7970 reviews.  Launch day benchmarks are pretty worthless at this point.  You're hung up on 7970 vs gtx 670 issues when the 7970 is currently performing at or above the gtx 680 for less money. 

&gt;Kind of a niche market to ask for updated benchmarks but I guess that's how it is.

It's pretty important if you're buying a card to know how it will perform at the time of purchase, not how it performed with old drivers a year ago.  [Here's](http://www.ocaholic.ch/xoops/html/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=942&amp;page=10) a look at how 7970 performance has improved over time.  For comparison [here's](http://www.ocaholic.ch/xoops/html/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=941&amp;page=11) the 680 over time.  [Here's](http://www.overclock3d.net/reviews/gpu_displays/club_3d_hd7970_royal_ace_with_crossfire_review/1) a recent review that compares performance in a number of games to various cards, including other cards with factory OC.  [Here's](http://www.hardocp.com/article/2013/03/11/asus_hd_7970_directcu_ii_video_card_review/1) a recent review that compares a 7970 with factory OC to a reference 680. [This](http://www.vortez.net/articles_pages/msi_r7970_lightning_review,1.html) review has reference and factory oc'ed 7970s vs a variety of cards, including the 7970 on older drivers.  Looking at charts that haven't been updated with results from newer drivers is a poor idea when drivers have improved so much since launch.

From your earlier post:
&gt;Also looking over newegg you are getting much better deals, before and after rebates and if you buy a nvidia card you get $150 game coupon for some nvidia games, while you only get bioshock and crysis 3 for free if you buy amd cards.

Right now a [7970](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150665&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) runs around 10% cheaper than a [gtx 680](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133469&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=10446076&amp;PID=3938566&amp;SID=) even after rebate.  I imagine most people would prefer Bioshock Infinite and Crysis 3 over $150 of in game credit spread out among three free to play games(Hawken, World of Tanks, Planetside 2), but obviously that's a matter of preference.  Since we've seen from more recent reviews that a 7970 has similar performance to a 680 for cheaper, and a [7970 GHZ edition](http://www.superbiiz.com/detail.php?name=AT-7970GHZ&amp;c=CJ) will tend to outperform it for a similar price, we can conclude that the 7970 is one of the top cards and better bang for your buck than the 680.  Now, it might get more interesting if we started looking at frame time issues with the 7970, though AMD's been working to fix these, and Radeon pro helps as well.

&gt;And remember even if you have the 7970 beating out the 670 by a meager amount, I don't think you can disprove newegg's price listing for both gpus as leaning towards the 670 as being infinitely cheaper 

Good thing it compares to the 680 and not the 670.

&gt;I'm pretty sure the HD7990 hasn't even hit shelves, while the Titan has.

You're correct about this.  The Titan outperforms the 7970, though at a massive premium.  The 7990 won't even be a fair comparison since it's a dual card like the gtx 690, so NVIDIA will hold the single gpu performance crown for a while though it is a $1000 card.","1364775198"

These are almost always things that observe the incredibly small, down to the level of electrons and even photons. So these devices observe and collapse the probability wave. However, no one has proof of what exactly makes it an observer. For a while, there was a great deal of concern that quantum required God to exist, because something had to be observing the universe for its wave function to collapse. Later experiments have suggested that an observer need not be human, or even alive, as quantum experiments where no human observed the results of the devices still indicated that the act of observation collapses the wave function. If you look up the two-slit experiment, it will help you get into the ideas of what the act of observing is.","1364775201"

US is the only real hot spot for fracking at the moment, you hear a lot about places like vaca muerta in argentina or llanos basin in colombia but they're decades years behind as there is no real infrastructure in place to support full-scale development like in the US. You need the full value chain--gathering, takeaway, processing, and terminals; takes some serious time and capital and time to build out and lack of domestic refineries/users will make it even harder. In addition, not many places are as water-rich as the US (obviously necessary for fracs, and with current technology limiting water use seems to severely impair economics).

But if he sees Walt murder someone or threaten Hank or if his family is somehow hurt as a result of his father's meth activities and that is how the truth comes out, he will be furious.

Generally I think his first instinct would be to forgive him, because he has built up this image of his father as a hero, or ""cancer saint"" as Saul puts it.

The different sounds of each factions weapons are very distinctive, so it's hard to be sneaky around experienced players. If there's a Vanu sneaking around in a TR controlled Crown, you'll know pretty much instantly thanks to the sound of his weapon. With these NS weapons you're able to possible stay undetected for a while longer, and that's a good thing, imo. But I'm a bit biased, since I play LA and I'm constantly behind enemy lines. It's still pretty hard to be sneaky in VS bases, because most use their laz0rs and will react to traditional gun fire. In that regard, I think VS benefit the most from all these new and upcoming NS weapons.

In terms of actual gun balance, I think these fit in rather nice, atleast the carbine since that's the only NS weapon I have experience with. It's shit compared to the Jag and Lynx in CQC, and the T5 AMC is almost identical for medium range and it's only 250 certs. Yet the NS weapons are decently well rounded and offer a fresh new feel when you're tired of your usual weaponry, without making any of the faction specific weapons obsolete (atleast for TR).","1364775209"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; In order to deny infinite regress it must.

Why?

&gt; [The Kalam] does not [state that there is no prior state prior to the first state.]

Of course it does: that there is no prior state to the first state is just what is meant in calling it the first state.  If there were a prior state than a given state, then that state wouldn't be a first state. The whole point of the kalam argument, as distinct from the cosmological argument, is the belief that there is a first state, i.e. that than which there is no prior state.  Hence why Craig is at pains to say that the causal event involved in the kalam argument is a simultaneous cause rather than a cause which is prior in time, i.e. because there is no prior state from which the latter kind of cause could be.

&gt; he three supports of the first premise are:
a) Intuition that no things comes are produced from nonexistence.
b) That ""nonexistence"" holds no preference as to creating universes
c) Disagreement with current observation of things (especially universes) not coming into existence without cause
These all presuppose that a state of ""nonexistence"" is a thing which it makes sense to talk about.

No, they don't.  The ""nothing"" involved in the statement, derived from the principle of sufficient reason, that something cannot come from nothing, is a logical nothing--it indicates a sheer absence.  You seem to be reifying this logical nothing into a positive state which is in some sense empty, but if it's a positive state then it's not nothing.","1364775209"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","While your insight toward the finance industry itself is interesting, I don't see how working IT for a finance company gives you insight into the workings of the NYPD and their worries about OWS. OWS required far more than ""babysitting"" by the NYPD. At the start, they were marching regularly with pretty big numbers. I'm fairy certain I watched as they marched across the brooklyn bridge and caused the bridge to be closed to traffic. 

I also disagree that OWS ""doesn't fucking matter and never did."" It's the only American social movement in recent memory to grab the attention of the national media and start a national conversation about income inequality. You yourself just used ""we are the 99%"" as an identifying phrase that everyone is now aware of and associates with OWS. Maybe people in finance didn't give a fuck, but those people weren't really the target audience of OWS's message. The idea, it seemed to me, was to get the bulk of the citizenry "",the 99%,"" to realize that they are the majority and that they don't need to roll over and accept rampant inequality. On the macro level, they failed at that, but I personally knew a lot of people who gave a fuck about OWS and still do.

Lastly, if we're calling the most prominent social movement in recent memory ""a joke"" and referring to the people who were part of it as ""the hippies"" - god help us. Our country is in bad shape, and we're mocking people who tried to do something about it, and in many cases, people who got physically abused in violation of their rights to protest because they believed in some sense of economic justice. I don't see how you can possibly agree with their message and also shit on them so thoroughly.

How far along are you in your career?  Perhaps she is just disgruntled because right now she goes on rounds practically as one of the MDs, only difference is she can't prescribe and even if she recommends/backs up with research a doc can still override her.  Even PAs and some nurses can prescribe.  It's really ridiculous when she has to go to one of them (who really dont understand whats going on) to get approval.

When she has a day off she always gets paged by the docs because she's the only PharmD familiar with the patient and they are paging her for recommendations not for drug interaction type stuff a staff pharmacist could do.

Can I ask what state you work on?  The places we have been so far clinicals were always salary not hourly and has never been paid overtime.  She only gets overtime/shift differentials if she picks up a staffing shift (non-clinical role) which is the kinda pharmacy job she hates but just does it for the extra $

There has also been a trend in hospitals moving away from pure clinical roles and going to hybrid.  Combine that with the last decade's hype of pharmacy and huge amount of pharmacists looking for jobs and you get a limited outlook on moving to a new location.  There are plenty of hospitals that she probably could work at, but she's type A and needs to be involved with a research level hospital to get some enjoyment :P


Anywho, my point was if you (you = kids in school looking at pharmacy) are smart enough to be a pharmacist, you likely have the aptitude to be another medical profession that pays significantly more.  

Granted many people select pharmacy because they don't want to touch another person, but seriously consider getting your hands bloody for triple+ the pay","1364775221"

I know that this is not a Scotch Whisky but is in fact an Irish Whiskey, however it’s about the only Irish Whiskey that I would keep in my personal inventory as a staple and worthy of a review.  The cask strength version is bottled at a whopping 58.6%, matured for 12 years in oak casks.  It is a single pot still whiskey, which means it is made from a mixed mash of malted barley and unmalted barley in a pot still.    
This bottle of Rebreast 12 Cask Strength is B1/12, which I’ve heard from some whiskey connoisseurs is inferior to B1/11, however I could not find this batch anywhere.  Purchased for $64.99.    
**Nose:**  Honey, vanilla, oak wood, cloves, allspice.    
**Taste:**  Very strong - deep honey glaze, spicy, slightly salty and sweet, cloves and wood.    
**Finish:**  Spicy and tangy at the same time, burnt plastic and buttermilk.    
**In Conclusion:**  I wish I had the chance to try B1/11.  Perhaps the next time I’m feeling like I need a bottle of Irish whiskey I’ll search more diligently.  This one was OK - It’s certainly strong and gets the buzz going fast, and certainly miles ahead of any Irish whiskey I’ve ever tried, but in the end nothing beats out a good single malt.    
**Score: 85/100**

"tasker","t5_2s0ro","You're messing up the order in which you want your actions to happen.

The State is what triggers the task, the task then runs **once**. So when you unplug your charger the task will run and disable wifi if the screen is off.

That'll obviously never happen and the task will not run at any other time besides the moment you unplug your phone.

To fix this you would need something like this:

State: Screen OFF

Task: Set Wifi OFF if ISNOT ~~Power Source Any~~

Apparently that's not possible so we'll have to do a workaround.

You will need 2 profiles

PROFILE 1:

State: Power Source Any

Task: Set variable %Whateveryouwant To 1 &lt;-- Make sure the first letter after % is capitalized because if it's not it'll be a local variable and only work in that single profile.

Exit task: Set variable %Whateveryouwant To 0

Profile 2:

State Screen OFF

Task: Set Wifi OFF if %Whateveryouwant is 0

Using variables isn't really something I'd advice Tasker beginners to do but as far as I can quickly tell there is no other way to do this because of Power Source or something similar not being available as IF thingy.","1364775223"

My dad and decided to go snorkeling  ASAP, and our hotel was located in a bay, so we walked down the beach and hopped onto the rock walls that lined the bay. When we got a good distance out, my dad said ""Make sure you jump in with me"". And I'm busy looking at all these dead crabs on the rocks and barely listen to him. I hear a splash and turn around to see he'd jumped in. So I thought ""oops better hop in now"". My dad had wanted me to jump in at the same time because of the tide; he jumped in right as it was going back out, so it pushed him outwards too. I jumped in right as they crashed back down. I slammed into the rockwall under wave and got a wicked gash on my leg, hand, and foot. I did way too many things like this when I was a kid that could have been avoided if I used my thinking box.

"keto","t5_2rske","All great suggestions. You CAN eat out keto, it's just harder and sometimes more expensive, because carb food is cheap and restaurants want to fill you up with them. 

Stock your hotel room. Buy hard boiled eggs, they can keep at room temperature for DAYS. Nuts, jerky too.

Don't lose your mind either. When you eat out, your carb count tends to be a crapshoot. Fillers in burger patties, weird glaze on your salmon, salad vinaigrette tastes too sweet, you sometimes don't know for sure what you're getting. Just do the best you can and roll with it. It won't be the end of the world if you get kicked out of keto. But you won't like how you feel if you just go crazy with sugar either. So do your best and enjoy yourself.

In addition to the cultural aspect have you thought of the economic side? Not everyone lives in a place where they have the time, money, or opportunity to eat vegan. buying a box of bullets and shooting a pig or deer can be a really quick and cheap way to get some protein for a few months. and i don't even hunt or eat very much meat, but i can understand that there are reasons people do things and can put myself in their shoes.

I'll add a follow up that I discovered a great truth about men because of one such pepper.  I was showing off some fresh ones at a coffee house to some friends, when a teenage boy asked me if that was a hot pepper.

Instead of lying to him and telling him it was mild, in which case he couldn't have been paid to eat it, I told him the truth, that it was a habanero, that it was better than he was, that it would really kick his ass, and if he ate it, within 5 minutes he would be in the restroom washing his mouth out with that nasty grainy pink hand soap.

I was then going to tell him how to properly taste test it without killing himself, but the dumbass snatched it out of my hand, popped it in his mouth, chewed it up and swallowed the damned thing.

At that table you could have heard a pin drop.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","RN here- finishing up a nurse practitioner program in May. I got my BSN and went back right away to get my masters degree. Total time in school for me was 5 years. Since I had a high gpa I got some scholarships toward my undergrad, then went to a state school for my NP. Many NP programs require you to be working as an RN which I have been l, gaining experience and money.  So at the end of it all, I only have about 25k in school loans which isn't bad.  The starting salary for an NP ranges depending on speciality and where you live. In my area, I can expect to start around 85-95k a year.  

With all this said, I never wanted to do the med school thing.  The idea of being in school/residency that long never appealed to me. 

IMO Nurse Practitioners aren't going to be having a hard time finding jobs anytime soon.  But, if you love surgery and decide you want to go the midlevel route you might want to look at PA school- they seem to have more of a place in surgery. Good luck!","1364775238"

I was in French class and had just been handed a quiz when an announcement came over the loudspeaker that we were all to gather immediately in the cafeteria.  I wasn't prepared for the quiz at all and remember thinking how lucky I had gotten.

In the cafeteria they explained the basics that there had been some kind of accident involving the WTC, but kept the whole mood pretty calm, didn't explain much.  I remember comforting my friend who's dad worked in the buildings, telling her I'm sure he was fine.  They never found his body.

Parents were all pretty much on their way to pick us up from school immediately, and we were shuffled into the gym to watch Shrek while we waited for them.  Everyone was still pretty calm as we didn't know too much, but the panic on my Mom's face when she came to get my sister and I made it clear something horrible had happened.

My walk home from school involved crossing multiple avenues (below 14th street) with a pretty direct view of the towers.  I remember looking up as we walked/ran back to my house and seeing fire and smoke.  People were running and screaming in a panic all over the place.  It was horrifying and still haunts me to this day.

Although I am mad that that happened to you!  It's kind of crazy because I believe that music plays such an important social role - that people who can make music are so important to binding a society together and spreading harmony (not just in the musical sense) and beauty and maintaining traditions - it's a sin to shut that down &gt;:(

My thing is composing.  My family is all amateur musicians, but I'm the one who continued to pursue it academically and then professionally - and since I was assigned the ""scapegoat"" can't-do-anything-right role, it drives my N parents *wild* that my skill and accomplishments surpasses theirs.  They're so angry about it, they undercut and discourage me every chance they get.  

What's super-gross now is they're trying to do the ""divide and conquer""/""golden child"" thing with my kid!  They laud the kid's talents and accomplishments and completely ignore mine - even though my life literally revolves around music, and I've managed to have a pretty awesome career.

And that's why I only talk to those people on birthdays and holidays! :D","1364775245"

That's unsubstantiated drivel that N8thegr8 was railing against. Do you actually have comparative medical charts/reports? If no, I highly suspect it's because you *think* you're healthier because of a 70mile bike ride.

Second of all, the 70 mile ride notwithstanding, if you are overweight, then by each respective margin, there are certain negative health factors and probabilities you have to contend with. This is exactly the point. Biking 70 miles isn't some sort of wonder cure for a lot of these ailments.

Thirdly, I do not want to judge you at all, just picking at your fallacious arguments as I'm wont to do. I have nothing against overweight people at all, you're free to do with your body as you will, afaic.

EDIT: Just to be clear here, when I'm talking about people who ""weigh too much"", I mean that as a function of excess fat. Not BMI (which I think is patently wrong), of course a bodybuilding woman will weigh more and have stellar fitness. There's a difference between ""weighing more"" and ""being fat"".

Even if he flipped on the deal, he's still a pretty pathetic person at that point to sink that low.  Even in realities where he was debt-free and had no reason to sell his daughter, he was still a person capable of selling his daughter.

I appologize if I implied that but I mostly mean it the other way around.  I would expect most  people to press better than they curl.  So if it's heavy enough that it's hard to curl but light enough that you can still press it, I'd say it's heavy enough that a person will get a decent amount of time out of that kettlebell.

"science","t5_mouw","They found (I think *palm tree* or *cycad*) fossil remains somewhere near Tasmania (Australia), which are dated back about 50 million years. At that time this area was very close to Antarctica. [Article Abstract](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7265/full/nature08399.html)

So tropical fossils have been found on former polar regions, 50 million years ago, in different (atmospheric) conditions and before the extended ice sheets were even formed on antarctica. (""Our ice ages"" are geological very new +-35 mya, before this there have never been such extended glacial sheets on the polar regions) Comparing this with todays climate does not really prove anything in that statement, because the current changes are about the relatively fast change of a ""polar ice climate"" to a warmer climate. This process **did not** occur **at all** when these fossils were still living plants. From 50 million onward you had the contrary, a (compared to current climate change) slow transformation to a colder climate!

You can look at any drug related death and say ""Oh, it wasn't the drug it was the product of this thing the drug caused to happen.""  I mean, if you want to be technical, Chris Farely drowned.  Was it the heroin (mixed with cocaine) that caused fluid (his own blood plasma) to fill his lungs? Sure.  But it wasn't he heroin that killed him, it was the fluid in his lungs!

So, no.  It's not a bad argument or even a silly one.  That's *how it is*.  Drug causes X to happen and  X causes death. Whether it be liver failure, burning to death in your sleep  (drinking + cigarettes or crack pipe + passing out), heart attack (cocaine) or just passing out and hitting your head.   That's how *all* drug related deaths happen.  **It's not about toxicity.  It's about the danger's inherent within the side effects.**","1364775278"

I've heard there are more assassinations than even AC1 and that they're going back to the original method of open level design and not handholding and level constraints, but by openess they could mean ""you can run in and use your two giant swords OR your 4 guns"" and by more assassinations they count boarding other ships as assassinations.

I am 401 lbs and have only lost about 10 lbs in the last 7 months. I feel trapped in my body because I can't work or do any of the things I truly enjoy in life because of my weight.  
  
I've got to ask, what is your meal plan? How many calories do you eat per day and is that amount the same as when you were around 400lbs?  
  
I am bad at trying new foods so I was thinking of eating the same low carb foods every day, 7 days a week. Did you do something similar or mix it up? Any other tips to someone else that is big? I've got plenty of exercise in, I just overeat every day. Thanks! Good job again!","1364775284"

* Every single one of those countries can unite on hating Israel.

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","Good if Monster Destruction effects from Monster effects are prominent in the meta.

Works against **Judgment Dragon** &amp; **Ryko** in *Lightsworns*, **Grapha** in *Darkworlds*, **Blaster** in the upcoming *Elemental Dragons*, **Atlantean Heavy Infantry** in Merlanteans, **Scrap Dragon** in Synchro Decks, **Tiras**, **Adreus** &amp; **Volcasaurus** in Rank 5 decks, and also **Night Assailant** and **Snowman Eater** in Tour Guide engines and such.

Thing is, these cards either aren't that prominent as they once were, or are specific to individual decks. **Forbidden Lance** provides safety against *all* damaging Spell/Traps that are usually run in every deck. It even protects against **Compulsory** which is damned hard to counter against.

Sure, **Forbidden Dress** also protects against **Dark Hole**, **Mirror Force**, **Torrential Tribute** as well as **Lance**, but you're going to find **Lance** to be more useful in each match than you are **Dress**. With deck room tight, you're going to want to use the card that helps the most. Yes, you could play **Lance** and **Dress** together, but you're going to be running quite a tight deck with dead-draws I reckon.

Siding it against certain decks (*Lightsworn*s, Rank 5's, etc have the most Monster Destroying Monster effects) might be an option, but Side Decks space is tight and these decks aren't that prominent. 

Currently, it's a card that is useful to exist for potential future use, but right now doesn't see much of a demand. It is a good card though, just overshadowed by better ones.

As a side note, I've seen people dislike it because it's target-prevention effects aren't understood by a lot of players. I feel that is an unfair criticism of the card. Yes it doesn't prevent **Effect Veiler** in response, but it was never designed to.","1364775286"

If the further complications can be cured, which through cardiovascular disease, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and many other diseases contribute to the deaths caused by smoking (arguably a greater problem than cancer, as cancer and cardiovascular disease are pretty much tied in terms of deaths per 100.000 per year, but it often causes a much longer and ultimately more expensive death process through the years of disability that are paired with it), then surely fixing something relatively trivial as addiction will surely be handled as well, but that might be more fit for separate discussion.

If you really could take away all negative side effects in some magical way, I still think there wouldn't be much of a revival. Many people have come to enjoy smoke-free environments, and only the smell is already a big turnoff for many people nowadays, let alone the health risks.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","There is a problem. When you have a bunch of monks who spend all their time writing and going to mass... sometimes they write down stories because they're bored. Beowulf is a good example of this. The narrator is a christian telling the story of pagan warriors. 

When writers are completely immersed in a biblical mindset they tend to write about people and themes within the bible. So we get a kind of biblical fan fiction, things have been written, for example, correspondences between Jesus and different kings of his time, we know didn't occur.

Why were they written? A monk thought Jesus must have been an important guy and he would have been sought out by power leaders for his council. We know this isn't true, he was fairly unknown at the time which follows in line with the whole message. ""For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."" He wasn't interested in spending time speaking with random rulers.


So we can reason using proper, secular, historical evidence that Jesus never corresponded with these people. Biblical scholars use these same messages to discount gospels which were written much to recently to be credible, are a complete 180 in terms of the message relative to the rest of the bible etc..","1364775293"

&gt;I should also say that once I moved to where I was and bought my first car, I've gone back to the same dealer and the same person every time.

And I guarantee you that you got ripped off, every time.

&gt;Never had a problem, never had excessive fees, and while I'm in the office the car was next door getting washed and detailed.

If the fees go beyond the cost to register the car (registration, taxes if your state works that way), you got ripped off.  The ""doc fee"" you most likely paid is pure profit for the dealer.  I had the general manager of a dealer look me in the eye and tell me it paid for ""nothing"".  Well, at least he was honest; must have been disorienting.

"cats","t5_2qhta","It sounds like he is lonely and wants attention. I know it is tempting but, you have to stop giving in to him. If he whines and cries and it makes you get up and give him attention, he gets what he wants and he just learns that whining and crying work and does it more. I know it seems harsh and difficult but, you need to ignore him and if he bothers you in person, shut him out of the room. You need to be consistent in doing this, giving in once undoes weeks of work. I'd recommend buying some ear-plugs and maybe using a white noise generator (you can get apps for it on phones) for while you have to ride it out. 

If he came from a house with lots of cats, it maybe that he hates to be alone. It might be that getting him a friend to hang out with during the night might help. Perhaps you could borrow a friend's cat to see how he reacts to sharing his space and see if it works. It might be that a small apartment isn't big enough for two cats. 

You could also try putting a video of moving animals on the TV to keep him entertained. There are special videos for this on sale online or free on YouTube. Finding toys that he can play with himself might help too. Something like [this](http://www.petvertising.com/bergan-turbo-scratcher-cat-toy-colors-may-vary/) or an automatic laser pointer toy (one of those ones on a timer that comes on and moves the laser pointer around for a bit so he can chase the dot). 

Another possibility is getting him a heated pad for him to sleep on and only turning it on at night. If he enjoys napping on it and learns that it only comes on at night, he might adjust his schedule. 

I hope this helps. ","1364775303"

"OnceUponATime","t5_2srt7","Rachel Van Helsing is my guess. An actual character from the Marvel universe (now owned by Disney). 

Abraham Van Helsing was involved with Dr. Frankenstein and Dracula. Rachel Van Helsing is his great-granddaughter. 

A Van Helsing - a monster hunter and vampire killer, would be the ultimate Human to get involved.

 I'm guessing since all Disney Princesses have some magic involved our combined Aladdin-Little Mermaid-Pocahontas connections are not well thought out. Alice has already been identified as the Mad Hatter/Jefferson's daughter, and cast in the spin off series. Dorothy and Wendy are great guesses, but Wendy's granddaughter marries Peter  Pan. Dr. Gold has already revealed that Bae is not Pan, that Pan is still a boy. 

This leaves Dorothy or my new theory. Dorothy's granddaughter is a great guess but would she be a murderer? - Possibly, the House did land on the Witch. 

Dr. Van Helsing hated Dracula, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and anything magical. Dr. Frankenstein is even involved in his tale. 

We know Dr. Whale/Dr. Frankenstein is not from the Enchanted Forest, Our World, or Neverland. He is from somewhere darker, like Transylvania. 

We also know that Dr. Whale is appearing in the series finale. 

Tamara hates magic, has searched for it, and murders anybody with Magic. I think it's because Dracula (or another Monster) killed her grandmother. Now she associates all magic with evil. She is a Van Helsing trying to get rid of magical threats. ","1364775306"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; The reasoning for the inclusion of the 2nd Amendment is quite important to understanding why it was not written to say musket.

The issue is not ""why it was not written to say musket.""  That's not what Morgan's claim is at all.  (He's not making a claim about how the 2nd Amendment is to be interpreted -- unlike his interlocutor.)

Even if the 2nd Amendment explicitly said, ""you have the right to use all weapons in use by others, now and at any future time, no matter what future developments in weapons technology,"" it would *still* be the case that the people who wrote the 2nd Amendment could not have in mind today's technology, because nobody in that time period accurately predicted 200 years ahead in the future of weapons.

Morgan's interlocutor offered an assertion about how the 2nd Amendment ought to be interpreted, which actually dodged Morgan's point rather than refute it.  Morgan responded by essentially saying ""citation needed,"" but he tried to do it in a clever way -- that was his mistake.

Morgan's attempt at sarcasm was met with superior wit, but the superior wit was in no way a valid argument.   The reason is that Morgan does not need to appeal to the meaning of the 2nd Amendment or to the intentions of its authors in order to establish that those authors had in mind the technology of their own era.  Instead, he needs merely appeal to the fact that the people of the 18th century did not have any way to predict the technology of the 20th century.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Cheating in a relationship. It doesn't matter if it's the guy or girl cheating, it infuriates me. 

It's never actually happened to me, but it's happened to my mom, and my older brother. My mom had been married to my step dad for eight years and he cheated, they divorced, it absolutely destroyed her for weeks. 

My older brother is an awesome guy and was in love with a girl, they were in a long-distance relationship, she cheated on him definitely once, he thinks twice. It happened when he drove almost 500 hundred miles to see her for Christmas or her birthday (I forget), there was a party at her house, he went to sleep with her in her bed. When he woke up she was in another room with some guy, the dresser was pushed in front of the door when he tried to open it. When he got home, he laid in bed and would barely talk to anyone a week after that.

Also, wine in a bag, as a storage method, is better than a bottle.  As far as quality, bottles are bad sometimes, and so are bags.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Interesting points and thanks for elaborating them. I can see where you're coming from, but I don't really agree on mosts parts and I think many other people also don't. But of course design is very subjective and all.

I purposely didn't give them any grunge or texture because they're supposed to be 'perfect'. The picture would have looked much messier had I grunged up the coins. Also if you were going to make a [real macro shot](http://cutcaster.com/photo/901217374-Macro-image-of-gold-eagle-coin-on-stack/) of coins you'd use newly minted ones. 

If 3D renderings have a place in design or if we all need to keep following the clean cartoony logo trend of the last years is very subjective. Many people do seem to like the visual aspects.

Your final point should have been thought of by Satoshi before he named it ***coin. Nearly all sites promoting or using Bitcoins display them as coin logos.

His argument is a tottering pile of suppositions and handles the (for him) awkward fact that Origen quotes this passage *as is* no less than three times particularly badly.

Josephus refers to a contemporary of his, James, and mentions how his execution triggered the deposition of the High Priest Hanan ben Hanan when Josephus was a young man.  This was a major event for Josephus' priestly caste, something that he would have remembered very well and something that he was in Jerusalem for when it occurred.  And how does he identify who this James was?  ""The brother of that Jesus who was called Messiah"".

In this far fetched scenario, she has lied about being born a man.  Much different.  It is not analogous.  

Sexuality is a genetic predisposition, not a choice, right?  And being straight my predisposition is to like women.  My partner would have knowingly deceived me.  It is not similar at all to finding out someone was a lapsed jew or catholic, because that fact would have nothing to do with my sexual preference, which is a huge component of marriage.

*Why go straight to divorce?*

Finding out my wife was born a man would be such a huge breach of trust that I would never be able to come back from it.  Are you going to argue against my personal feelings of this?

You just assume that I don't. Whenever I have a male friend who I notice has some interest for me that I don't have back, I always tries to fix him up with some other girl instead. 

I know it's easy for a guy on the internet to say ""You should tell him from the beginning that you're not intersted!"" or ""Tell him as soon as possible"", but as a female hanging out with guys I can't really walk up to every guy I meet and say ""Hello, my name is Horseniss. PS. I'm not going to date you"". I can't really say to a guy just randomly ""Hey, do you like me? Because just so you know I don't like you back then"". 

If that guy I would say that to *doesn't* have any interest in me, I would sound like total egoistic bitch that think everyone is in love with me. I don't want to be that girl that everyone talks about behind her back that ""Omg, she think she's really something, doesn't she. She thinks all guys wants her"".

I can tell on what you're saying that you don't have any female friends (and don't say against me, because it's really, really obvious), and I could go on forever why you're wrong with everything you say, but I know that won't make any difference, it would just be like talking to a wall.

But I just want to end with

I think nofap is going to help you a bunch, but it may or may not help you in the way you expect it to.

What's obvious to me (and you) is that you definitely need to do this.

So start doing nofap. It's going to be tough, but commit to it, and even if you end up relapsing at some point, it's not a big deal. Just get back on the wagon. 

It's not enough to do nofap. You're about to starve a neural pathway of dopamine. Your brain is used to getting this dopamine. If all you do is focus on not fapping, you're doing it wrong. Don't get me wrong. That's a good start. It's just not enough.

You don't say how much you fap to porn, but I get the feeling it's plenty. So use that time and energy you'd use for fapping, and searching for the right porn to get you off, and invest it in something productive.

Go work out. Jog. Learn to play an instrument. Pour it into your work. Read. Write. Learn to paint. Whatever. If there's something you used to be good at that made you feel good about yourself, go back to that. If there's something you've always wanted to do, take that up. 

But do something to make you feel better about yourself. That's the key.

In the meantime, let me just say this relationship you have going concerns me. She sounds like a wonderful gal, and good for her for trying to make this work. I'm impressed you've actually been able to unfriendzone yourself.

But dude. A 7 hour flight across the ocean? And you see each other 4 to 6 times a year? And you have this going on:

*""...my putting her on a pedestal after all these years; valuing her too much and valuing myself very little and creating an unfair, unrealistic imbalance in the relationship.""*

I actually don't mind the putting her on a pedestal part. I've seen a lot of successful relationships work out like that. But the other stuff scares me. And it really scares me when you're going to have so little face time with her to change the dynamic in any way, and any little change in the dynamic is liable to have her saying ""WTF?""

But I get that this may be one of those true love situations. I'm honestly all for people pursuing it when it comes to them.

You two obviously have some level of financial security at least, to be able to travel to see each other with some level of frequency.

*""...better realize the person who I want to be. Who values himself and is in control of his life.""*

This part is what has me the most excited. Yes yes yes. A thousand times yes. 

I have no idea what's going to happen in your relationship. Frankly, fucking her until she can't walk doesn't cure things. Plus, not only are you dealing with PMO induced ED at this point, but there's going to be all kinds of performance anxiety. With only 4-6 times per year to perform? What the hell, man? I hate this situation you're in, even if I do want it to work out for you.

The only thing I'll say is that whatever happens between you and her, she'll be a huge part of the reason you sought out nofap. I truly think this is going to be a watershed for you personally, no matter what else it brings to your life relationshipwise.

Keep us updated, in any case.","1364775332"

It is not currently available for your device, unfortunately, as AT&amp;T appears not to have approved it yet. You could install it yourself, but this is therefore *not supported*, so I think it may be better to upgrade to 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich instead. Should you wish to upgrade to 4.1 JB instead, please let me know.

As said, upgrades to ICS should absolutely be accompanied by a factory reset after the upgrade. All app data, such as contacts, bookmarks, texts, call logs would be erased. All data not on the SD card that you want to retain should be backed up. If you need specific instructions, please tell me what backups you would like to do.

For instructions on upgrading your device, Samsung has made available a page detailing the steps in KIES [here](http://www.samsung.com/us/support/SupportOwnersFAQPopup.do?faq_id=FAQ00047325&amp;fm_seq=51324) or look at [AT&amp;T's page](http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB414416&amp;cv=820) which is much more succinct.

I'm sorry, but there's no way you actually believe what you're saying. If you think that there's little difference between a computer's operating system from 2013 and one from 1983, then I really don't have anything to say, as you're only kidding yourself.

&gt; *This has absolutely nothing to do with what the guy was talking about.*

Of course it does. It has everything to do with what he's talking about. The entire computing paradigm has changed. That's the very definition of innovation. What you're doing is challenging the notion that there has been innovation, and then every time an example of this innovation is brought up, you just respond with ""that doesn't count"". The fact is that every aspect of computing has been revolutionized. Whether we're talking about hardware, software, services, input methods, interfaces, graphics, sound, architecture, portability, and everything in between, every single facet of computing has been revolutionized multiple times.

By the way, if you want to talk about hardware, it has radically changed as well. Whether we're talking about the shift from HDDs to solid state drives, the shift from CRTs to LCDs, local storage to cloud services, 32 bit to 64 bit CPUs, and even a current ongoing shift away from X86 architecture and towards ARM-based processors, the internal hardware has all undergone a radical redesign, as well. I mean, even things that we all take for granted - like the dedicated GPU - are pretty recent. And programmable shaders have only existed for a decade. The fact is that it's impossible to overstate just how much innovation has occurred in the computer industry over the past couple decades.","1364775341"

You want to wound your attacker to the point he can no longer act, or kill him. A 22 is not the gun to choose. The number of people who can survive even higher caliber shootings is surprising. There's a lot of very real rationale behind the federal government's choice of 40 caliber as it's round of choice. 50 cent (the rapper) survived being shot 9 times with a 9mm.

A 22 just doesn't do it. And you can tell when someone is pointing a 22 at you, the barrel is pathetically small. ","1364775342"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;My argument is that what you're referring to is an extreme egoism that Objectivism has little or nothing to do with. It's reasonable to see egoism that leads to harming others as immoral, it's popularly termed psycopathy.

Did you just make the argument that anyone who harms someone, because they're putting their interests first, is a psychopath? You've already stated that greed *only* happens in extreme cases, an incredibly dubious statement to begin with. To go on and say that greed only happens in psychopaths, and then define psychopathy as harming others by putting your needs first (which is essentially Objectivist Selfishness, but Objectivism doesn't make a value judgement on whether others are harmed) is simply rubbish.

&gt; So you're ""selfish"" in this sense when you do kind things for your husband, wife, children, or friends.

Oh, nevermind, we're playing the ""it's selfish but you do altruistic things, they're just not altruistic because doing them makes you happy"" redefining game.

Also, think about this, if you got these pictures, do you really think we *want* to look like an asshole?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh god, so I work at this hippie dippy green preschool and had never had any big ideological differences between my coworkers my boss and I. One of my coworkers quit recently and we just got a new teacher working with us.

The problem is one day the topic of evolution came up during nap time and my new coworker is telling a story and says the phrase ""my faith is very important to me"" and I start panicking internally going ohshitohshitohshit and then she finishes her statement with the worst case scenario phrase ""I absolutely do not believe in evolution""

I am on the verge of a full blown panic attack because I know I absolutely cannot have this conversation at work it just cannot happen, especially not with a woman who is much older than me. Luckily my boss was listening in as she always is and she swooped in and explained how my coworker absolutely can never ever say that evolution isn't real to a child because that is what we have to teach them and all that jazz and how it's a topic that is very important to her.

The entire time this conversation is happening I am holding this 7 month old infant babbling to him like a crazy person and pacing. It was just bag news.

Now I'm always worried that controversial topics are going to come up at work and our new coworker will not see eye to eye with the three of us. My biggest fear is that she will realize that my boss is a huge flaming lesbian and then there will be an ugly falling out and then she'll quit.","1364775354"

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Okay, that's a good question.

So here's what you have to do. Notice what your initial conditions are, and notice that you have a differential equation of the form:

**y'** = A**y**. Since you know that at t=0, **y** = [1 0]^T.

So, if you take this vector, now that you know the type of roots, you can use it to find the direction of the arrow.

Remember, what this differential equation says. You know that the change of the function with relation to time is proportional to the function at that particular time. In other words, **y'** = A**y**. So, now that you're thinking about it that way, why not calculate the derivative at time t=0?

You know your x and y coordinates. Remember that vectors in R^2 can be thought of as [ x y ]^T or, (x,y) (a single point in R^2).

Since you know the function **y**(0) = [ 1 0 ]^T you know that there is a point (1,0) where you can find the value of the derivative.

This is what you need to determine the direction. Multiply this vector by your matrix, and you have a happy solution.

If the derivative of the vector function is has a negative y component when x=1, then the arrow moves downward and goes in a counter-clockwise direction. The opposite is true if the y component of the derivative is positive. This is because the slope is going upwards at that point, so the circle must rotate counterclockwise.

That should answer it, let me know if it doesn't though. You'll have to do the work to see what I mean, but that's how you determine the direction of the arrows. This ""trick"" (its really noticing an important fact) works with real roots as well, its just easiest to teach with Im roots.

Edit:

The other way to determine direction is through use of the [Isoclines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isocline). You can find the equilibrium solutions of each vector (when the component derivative = 0. since **y'** = [ x' y' ]^T , so when one of them is 0, the other will most likely be infinity. So plot this as y'/x'. You'll notice that the straight lines (in this case coming from the origin) will all have the same slope magnitude in the y component (signs may change), since they are at **equilibrium**. This means that the Isoclines will all be going one direction or the other. The sign will determine the direction of the arrows to put on the Isoclines. The Isoclines **must** cross your trajectory, or bound it, so your trajectory goes in the same direction as the Isoclines.

There are always multiple ways to do this. The first method is easier to use in this case, but Isoclines works with non-linear differential equations (like the Lotka-Volterra predator prey model) extremely well. This allows you to draw much more complex and complicated phase planes with really weird and funky functions.","1364775360"

If problems persist, there are people who specialize in handling these problems to talk to that you can find through searching.

Another thing I wonder is though I feel like I did a decent job of noting and remaining present overall, when I was in the midst of such intense sensations, it was all I could do to just hang on, I did not have the ability to gain any insight into the sensations I was feeling at all. Would an ideal meditator be able to maintain equanimity in such conditions and continue to operate proper insight practice in such a state? 

Don't worry about what an ideal meditator would do. It's sounds like you handled your experience well, considering how intense it was. Just move on and continue practicing. I don't know any reason why you would need to be especially cautious.","1364775361"

When they find that Chen Lin is dead in A, Liz takes Booker and herself o A1, where this timeline's Elizabeth has already been taken to Comstock House. This suggests there are two Elizabeth's existing in the same timeline in A1, but that's fine because Liz eventually takes you and herself out of A1 to A2, where this Booker has died as a martyr. Ok, that explains what happens to A2 Booker, but what about A2 Elizabeth? Are both Liz and A2 Elizabeth present in A2?

Apartheid was a unique system. Those who lived under apartheid rule were governed by its rules and conventions every minute of every day. In Israel and the territories, there are tensions and divisions over citizenship, ownership of land and human rights – basic elements which one recognizes in the apartheid model. But to turn such recognition into affirmation that Israel practices apartheid defies logic and poses a basic question: Why, out of all the countries in the world in which national, religious or ethnic minorities claim discrimination, is Israel selected for the apartheid label?

"getdisciplined","t5_2uzju","The fact that you're having this dialogue with yourself (and with me and the whole community here) indicates that there is a spark inside of you somewhere, a small part of you that is rebelling against the broader apathy. Just like the CIA does to central american democracies, we need to advise, equip and arm that small rebel force so that it can overthrow the larger, more powerful force that it rebels against, and restore the balance of power inside of you. 

Make no mistake, it's a war, and it's fought inside your head. Ask a recovering drug addict or alcoholic or someone recovering from an eating disorder or obesity, and they'll tell you that it's a constant state of vigilance so that one side doesn't invade and completely take over. 

So there are two sides to this perpetual state of war inside of you, and they are in opposition. They don't necessarily hate each other. Life is not about balancing your internal hatreds. But these two sides, they are threatened by each other. It's a bit like Israel and Palestine - it's not that there is a 'good' and a 'bad' side (and we're talking here about the people, of course, not the leaders), but for reasons that are very hard to untangle, they're at odds with each other and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. So how do we manage the conflict between the opposing forces inside of us, so we end up with a Berlin Wall teardown in old age, rather than a Two Koreas stalemate or a Hutu/Tutsi massacre?

Consider body image. If you let the part of you that craves salty sweet fatty yummy stuff run rampant, you will be overweight, underattractive, and suffer medical problems until your early death. If, however, you let the part of you that cares about appearance and thinness run rampant, you risk ending up with anorexia or bulimia, or perhaps risking your health with steroids or heart-valve-wrecking weight-loss drugs. 

Even the 'get motivated and succeed' army inside of you - the part that you so keenly want to whip into a world-class fighting force - can run your life into the ground. Consider the workaholic lawyer that doesn't see his kids grow up because he's chasing promotion to partner, or the person suffering crushing depression and chronic feelings of inadequacy because they're merely good at what they do, rather than particularly outstanding. 

So it's all about balance. 

You need to talk to that small rebel force. What do they want? What language do they speak? What equipment do they have? What is their history - have they won major battles in the past, but recently been discouraged due to external events, such as a natural disaster or rigged election? As they say, confidence is the memory of past success. Do they have a morale problem? Are they a bit of a rag-tag army, in need of basic training and enforced discipline? 

You'll need to negotiate with them, of course. They won't just do what you tell them, some foreigner showing up with big ideas and a big mouth. They've heard it all before. They've already tried to defeat the other side - but the other side is so well armed, with some amazing technology. Deep fryers. High-definition television. Broadband internet. High-fructose corn syrup. How can they possibly fight against all of that?

You have to win their hearts and minds. That doesn't happen overnight. But it does happen. And once you know what makes that little rebel force tick, you really can change the regime. 

Right now you have no job. So your universe has a major problem. That rebel force inside of you, that's your only hope. ","1364775368"

I too have moments like this where stuff makes logical sense until I discover that there is a better way to do it. It is very true that the aid the States give to Israel stimulates the US economy. But that's like saying that stores should give money to their customers so that their customers will stimulate the stores. 

It's absurd. Why not cut out the middleman? Why doesn't US just keep *its own money to itself* and use the government money to stimulate industries that benefit the *US*, not arm a foreign nation. 

Ideally, they should be peaceful industries to improve the quality of life, not murder foreigners. But whatever, I am a realistic man. If the defence industry wants to keep inventing new toys to murder brown people around the world, let it be so. There is no need to create that extra step. You can give money to the US Army/Navy/Air Force which they will use to buy weapons that *benefit the US*. Republicans always complain that the US does not have enough arms.

It **definitely** isn't a cure for depression but it will push aside the horrible weight on your shoulders for a while.

"Fencing","t5_2r6ai","I would just like to throw two comments out there in response to this. Firstly, the flick has by no means made blade defence redundant, as that excerpt claims. Timings on modern scoring machines are also set to prevent the glancing blows mentioned.
Secondly, convincing a judge that you have made a hit that would realistically wound somebody requires a judge that has a basis for that decision. Not many people are around these days that have any idea of what that would actually entail. From my limited experience with attempts at classical fencing, reliable and sensible judging is the single largest problem, and it was this problem that lead to the development of electronic scoring systems in the first place. On a similar note, from what I understand, a duel was finished when somebody drew blood, which is where the rules of epee come from. It didn't matter if they go on to die or not (although the foil is a different matter).","1364775384"

(first thought was Ma, Pa, maybe grandparents and kids living in the area, but second thought, and looking a list, it could be a bigger family group living in the area, maybe even enough to pretty much be a small village on their own.) 

an 8 year old dying the day the twins were born, and one passing right away seems really mystifying/complicated... so maybe *I'm* miss reading her birthdate  wrong, and it's really as simple as her being the mother... but why wouldn't the headstone say ""mother"" or ""beloved wife"" or something? 
Paying by the letter? ) 





There's another Sallie who died at 58 in 1905 (May?) so she may be a bit too old to be the mother of the twins.  If Sally is a cousin to them, Sallie might be HER mom?

I said this for those that couldn't grasp the subject, such as yourself.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","It is an established an well-known principle, at least in [certain psychological schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavior_therapy), that the things you experience (whether internal or external) are not the primary cause of what you feel.  It is, instead, the lens through which you interpret your experiences - your worldview or belief system that is the primary cause.  A worldview that is inconsistent with reality inevitably leads to negative feelings.  And nothing is more inconsistent with reality than the gnostic worldview that would separate human being's body and spirit into two unrelated and opposed things.  

The ""pain"" the transgendered experience is not from what they experience internally - which is certainly real and is absolutely part of the fallenness of the world - but from the lens through which those experiences are interpreted.  A more healthy, realistic worldview leads to better, more positive outcomes.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","No problem, I main ADC and my username on leagues NA server is elyndar so if you'd like some help picking it up feel free to message me. Ezreal is a safe ADC, the best thing about his arcane shift is that if you start it before you get CCd no matter what happens it finishes. For example when a blitz uses their rocket grab on you, you can use the arcane shift to teleport out before he can actually finish pulling you. The same thing happens with Ezreal's ult so if you start it going right before the CC hits you can get free damage during stuns or what have you. Ashe is interesting, she's the queen of CC for ADCs so if you feel like your team is light on CC she's always a nice choice. Ashe is an AMAZING combo with blitz because if your blitz pulls someone for you they will never get away. Draven is pretty cool and he will for sure make you improve on your mechanical skill, as juggling two axes while harassing and not getting harassed is quite difficult. Your first games with him you will get roflstomped, but if you push through and truly learn him you will improve your playstyle significantly by the time you are through (I know it did for me and I only bought him last week). Tristana has a decent early game followed by a really weak mid game and an amazing late game, I can't really play trist so good luck with that if you choose that. Graves is my ADC of choice, he's basically an ADC mage. His specialty is getting up close and personal then nuking you down for ridiculous amounts of damage. Caitlyn is Graves counter and is always a fun choice. Her traps immobilize people and give vision on them making her a very powerful and difficult to catch target. Quinn is really strong early game but falls off enormously late game. Jayce is a cool character if you can perform his combo correctly. Both Jayce and Quinn are melee/ranged hybrids and as such can be difficult to play. As with any role there's a pretty decent variety in the style of each character it really depends on what sort of character you like to play. I might be able to help you better if you tell me what champs you normally play?","1364775395"

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","I am a clin neuropsych pre-doc, and though not an area of my research interests, I do use CBT and its variants in clinical practice. In brief, CBT does not just focus on evaluating the *validity* of dysfunctional and maladaptive thoughts, but also the *utility* of having those automatic thoughts. So, there are times when patients have reported well-evaluated and accurate thoughts about a bad situation to me. The next step would be to assess whether the specific (accurate) thought they are having is helping the situation or not. If it is not making the situation better, we would then brainstorm modifications of the thought in question, or completely new thoughts, that might be helpful to replace the original thoughts with (does that make sense... the phrasing is a little difficult?). Also, do not forget the B in CBT, as behavioral analysis and modification is another modality of the treatment that might be used if focusing on thoughts is hitting a dead end for a specific problem. Finally, third-wave CBT movements (e.g., ACT therapy) sometimes require assessment of whether acceptance of your inherent traits or the difficulties you have might reduce distress by ending your ""struggle"" to get rid of said characteristics. If you ever engage in CBT with a psychologist/psychiatrist, they should be able to clarify how what I have just said applies to your specific situation if you ask. Hope that helps.","1364775407"

Salmonella, oh the joy of nausea, vomiting, dehydration and other things I would rather not mention and unlike most food poisoning it lasted more than a month. A month of shoving liquids and food down my throat knowing they wouldn't stay down for long.

I think you are trolling but I'm going to try and reply the best I can.

First, Arenanet was responsible for 45% of the total sales as [this](http://massively.joystiq.com/2013/02/05/ncsoft-earnings-report-shows-healthy-growth/), [this](http://www.mmoculture.com/2013/02/ncsoft-guild-wars-2-continues-to-rake-in-cash-for-a-rosy-4q-2012/) and [this](http://www.vg247.com/2013/02/05/ncsoft-q4-guild-wars-2-accounts-for-45-of-total-sales/) shows.

Ncsoft's net income was obviously in the negative, basically because previous quarters (before GW2 launch) were terrible for them, so the only thing keeping them alive right now is GW2.

Then you can watch this (pretty interesting) [interview](http://www.twitch.tv/mmorpgcom/b/358339359), some key points:

* We are the fastest selling MMO ever made – to get to 3 million copies (maybe not including China). The game is doing better than we ever imagined it could.

* If you look at EVE, WoW, those are great examples of games that settled into their base population after launch and then every month start to grow a bit. All the other games that weren't as successful hit their base point and started to drop off a bit.

* We actually hit our base point with GW2 where for a month we saw the same login numbers and every week for the last 5 weeks it has being slowly going up and that is really exciting for us. 

* We definitely didn't expect to have this many sales, this many concurrent users, this many logins. Our goal is to hit our base user and then build on that every month and have it go up. We definitely seen that.

* The actual sales and actual numbers are much higher – a big chunk higher than where we thought we would be right now. Can't say the details.

Finally you can go [here](http://www.arena.net/#careers) to see the amount of people they are still hiring. Just so you know, most if not all failed mmo companies tend to do the opposite.

Oh, and one more thing, GW2 has the biggest subreddit of the mmo genre in number of subscriptions AND in activity. This probably doesn't mean anything but it's a nice stat to know.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; For the purposes of this discussion, I'm concerned with the first possibility and not the second. I disagree that parents are guilty of neglect if they knowingly refuse their child care. Many variables play into this. (I'm also assuming you mean traditional medical care. Many parents provide care on their own, or through non-traditional means, that should not be discounted. Parents should make thoughtful, informed decisions about their children's care, but this doesn't necessarily mean that they are liable if something goes wrong. Results can be disappointing even when the parents adhere to the ""scientifically reasoned and established medical theory."") But even if a parent offers NO care, there are sometimes good reasons for this. The vast majority of parents act in what they perceive to be their child's best interests. No parent wants to go through life knowing they made a mistake and their own child died as a result. That's why they should be given the benefit of the doubt if something goes wrong.

im not calling them neglectful if there weren't adequate warning signs, and there was an unfortunate series of events leading to the death, we are talking about IF hey recognized the child was ill, and did not seek any medical care at all, whether or not they sought ""care"" in a faith, spiritual etc setting doesn't mean there was any actual possible benefit to this ""care""","1364775415"

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt; Capitalism (working for my personal interest to earn money, normally)

Actually capitalism involves a small group of parasites (absentee owners) violently depriving many people in the working class of land &amp; natural resources unless they submit to exploitation.  

Under worker owned industry / socialism, the worker keeps the full fruit from their labor- they still work for their personal interest, but without being violently exploited by the parasitic capitalist class.  

All the ""capital"" such exploiters bring is the value created by the working class.  When they hire managers (workers) they are using the value violently  stolen from the working class to hire such.  

And if the capitalists could not own the land (via absentee ownership) they could not forcefully manage the rest of society.  

Without such parasitic violence (with ownership by the workers of a business, eg co-ops) workers could either manage themselves or elect someone to be their manager.  (and vote on what to offer someone in salary.)  

In other words, the capitalist contributes nothing overall.  They just violently steal from one group of workers to fund ""investment"" that may benefit another group of workers. .  But that is no more legitimate than a mugger ""investing"" his stolen loot, seeking further return.  The mugger is still a violent parasite, just like the capitalist / absentee owner.","1364775419"

The way the story is told throughout the game is done really well.  
  
Fans of Sworcery should like the art, music, and ethereal vibe of [**Finding Teddy**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finding-teddy/id593845428?mt=8). There's almost no text at all and I thought the puzzles were a bit harder than Sworcery (in a frustrating way), but it was still fun, solvable, and clever. There are a couple of times that it will be very challenging if you are somewhat tonedeaf - but I muscled through.  
  
Finally, if you haven't tried it yet, just know that [**Year Walk**](https://itunes.apple.com/app/year-walk/id555916407) is *completely* amazing. Gorgeous art, an incredibly delivered and interesting story, visceral sound effects. Try to avoid reading reviews... it's best if you avoid any and all spoilers. To boost the story experience, there is a free [**Year Walk Companion**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/year-walk-companion/id597879895?mt=8) app. Year Walk is easily the best game experience I've had in years; I can't recommend it highly enough.  
  
Play Year Walk in this order:  
  
* Read through all the content available in the companion app.  
* Complete Year Walk.  
* Go back to the companion app with the clue you receive at the end of Year Walk. You'll know what to do from there.","1364775421"

When it was all said and done, I was in for 8.5 years.  My ETS date fell within 90 days of the beginning of my unit's deployment window to Afghanistan and they tried like hell to stop-loss me for that one.  Luckily, I got out of it but only because my unit ended up being WAY over strength for my MOS.  My last two years were pretty miserable because I'd made up my mind to get out and was just riding out the clock by then.

My only advice would be to do your job the best you can, stay professional, and DO NOT under any circumstances let anyone convince you to stay in if you've really made up your mind to leave.  They'll dangle some pretty tempting offers in front of you to try and keep you.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I worked at a Hyatt for a couple years. This would not have applied there. 

We treated our guests requests seriously, and I was an operator - I took the calls, coordinated staff for those requests and followed up with the guest within 15 minutes for each and every request no matter what. If I received a call from your room and you asked for an item, we would attempt to deliver it. If there was a DND sign, the housekeeping staff would radio me, I would call the guest and alert them to the DND. We assumed that if you asked for something, you fucking wanted it. Your request acted like a 15 minute snooze on DND. If I had told the housekeeper to turn around and forget it because of DND, I would have been written up. Most decent hotels are not going to wait to piss you off and then fix the problem. Obviously, there are times when someone calls and leaves, so no you cannot deliver an item but this constituted perhaps 1/25 of my request calls. 

As for checking the room - we didn't do that. As long as your card was on file, you weren't due for checkout and we received no complaints, your room was YOURS. The only reason we would go inside is to clean, if you told us not to - you wouldn't have a soul enter that room the entire time. 

And phone calls, the Hyatt / Sheraton / Four Seasons in my area all treated them the same way - you can ask for someone by name but the number would not be released except by the guest. If you had the number, I would ask you to confirm the name. If you couldn't do that I would not connect you. 

tl;dr OP you work for an annoying and crappy hotel that has no common sense policies. Everyone else, check the policies of the hotel or just ask about their dnd policy at the front desk if you think you'll forget more than once during your stay.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The common criticism of that study is that it fails to ascertain whether the subjects of the source data were actually high when they crashed, or whether they tested positive for THC because they had smoked in the days prior to crashing. And it does a poor job of examining and dismissing alternative causal mechanisms.

It's also worth mentioning that the conclusion from this study, however shaky it may or may not be, isn't exactly that your risk of a crash doubles. It increases by 92%. For comparison, if you go right up to (but not over) the typical legal limit for blood alcohol concentration, your risk increases by 169%. So if this is to be considered good science, then it contains at least two conclusions, and the *more important* one is that the legal limit for alcohol is too high. Alternatively, if an increase of 169% is considered negligible (as it seems since it is allowed for by the legal BAC limit), then 92% is necessarily also negligible.

Or you could consider that the risk of a crash about doubles for every 3 mph you go above the speed limit. Roughly speaking, anyway. So e.g. 9 mph above the limit the risk increases eight-fold. This can help put the 92% into perspective, and perhaps illuminate why the BAC limits aren't lower than they are, as well as prompt consideration of whether the statement ""cannabis use doubles chances of vehicle crash"" is in itself a claim of *significant* danger. After all, do you expect more than a slap on the wrist if you're caught doing 43 in a 40 zone? More than a fine if you get caught doing 46? And what's the penalty for DUI? Do these policies make sense in the same context?

Here's more perspective: if your risk of a crash does double under the influence of cannabis, and driving, say, 5 miles while high is ""unacceptably dangerous"", then driving 10 miles when completely sober must necessarily be unacceptably dangerous, too, because it represents *the same risk of a crash*. Yet I see people driving much longer stretches than that and feeling good about it, and I see people who wouldn't dream of driving even a few hundred feet while high because of the *perceived* risk. Obviously, that perception is flawed, or the study you mention *severely* underestimates the danger.

Please note that I'm not drawing my own conclusion. I honestly don't feel I have enough information to decide that driving while stoned is a good or a bad idea. So on the rare occasion that I do smoke, I stay off the road as a precaution. I am, however, very unsatisfied with the way the research is presented and the random way in which it's being interpreted. ","1364775436"

It certainly lacked the epic scope of the first one - where did that massive training facility go? Where did the weapon tech go that the Baroness used (remember her twin guns?). Amp suits? Nanotech? Firefly's technology seemed to be one of the few examples of this... but even with the Joes reduced to just a few, there seemed to be an abysmal lack of hardware. I also enjoyed Zartan's smarminess in the previous one, but we only really got a second or two of CGI'd face here, and none of the attitude. There were some amazing set-pieces though, for example the cliff-top fight, the initial bunker raid... and the escape from prison produced a nice WTF moment when Snake Eyes 'spoke'! I hope the next installment brings back Duke and hopefully a little more budget and scope. It was entertaining... just not entertaining enough.","1364775437"

When it was just two people, you could use binary logic. With *n* people, the problem becomes dramatically more complicated. Boolean operators are necessary but not sufficient to solve it, and I'm not entirely convinced it's possible.

I can see working out specific solutions for 3 individuals, but 10? 1,000? 10^10 ? I don't know how you could ever resolve something like

&gt; 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 3

and be 100% sure someone would guess correctly.

Approaches like

&gt; Person B chooses the second-smallest possible choice if he sees at least 3 other people with different numbers

Just aren't going to work when you have a billion digits.

To Manually Reset the Passcode:

1) Install any desktop software for browsing the iphone filesystem (iPhoneBrowser/iFunBox/SSH/DiskAid trial version).

2) Navigate to the directory /var/mobile/Library/Preferences/ and delete ""com.apple.springboard.plist""

3) Then you can navigate to the directory /var/Keychains/ and delete ""keychain-2.db""

4) After deleting the last file, reboot the iphone.

To give you an idea on how this worked, the com.apple.springboard.plist file contains the setting of your passcode turned-on. Deleting this resets the toggles back to default (after the final reboot) and takes care of that part of the problem. But since a passcode was already defined, the ""keychain-2.db"" file contains that information and deleting it clears everything up after the final reboot.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Most modern screens are [liquid-crystal displays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display). Essentially, the idea is this:

Some liquid crystals have unusual material properties which cause them to change the amount of light they let through based on the electric current flowing through them. To produce a full range of colors, independently we shine red, green, and blue light through them. By varying the intensity of the current through the crystals, more or less of the colored light will pass through. There is a backlight behind all of the pixels which projects the light for them.

The result is that ""off"" means no light. To produce white, you need as much light as possible. Since we can't make something that project ""darkness,"" that's the way things are done.

Older televisions were frequently [cathode ray tubes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube) (Cathode rays are streams of electrons, just poorly named for historical reasons). A similar process was used. Hitting the fluorescent screen with electrons made it glow.

Rather than using a backlight, I have heard of screens which used mirrors and ambient light for display, though I'm not really sure how prevalent this is, if at all.","1364775450"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","He creates a huge network of lonely shepherds (who never contact each other directly, to stay lonely) to facilitate the spread and popularity of goat cheese throughout the cosmos. When they've gathered more resources, they start with ramen too. Once the cheese and ramen are widely spread enough, any of it eaten by people of political power kills them. Their positions are filled up by the shepherds. Though the shepherds are now forced to meet other people, they maintain shitty personal lives in reverence to their god, so he still has power over all of them. Eventually they reshape the universe into a lonely dystopia, where every being must care for at least 3 sheep and/or goats at all times, and anything greater than casual acquaintanceships is punishable by death. (Reproduction is handled by men donating their sperm and women being implanted) Everyone is now a lonely shepherd.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","That is a great point. The tea party had all sorts of types. But the point I am making, is that the OWS, so my theory goes was trying to accomplish something a lot more complex than the tea party. The tea part was made of a diverse group, but they mostly wanted small government, and they were generally using conventional forms of organization and leadership.

OWS was grappling with a much deeper problem. The depth of the problem could come to the surface with a simple question like ""where should we set up the bathrooms?"" or ""How do we know what time to meet for this event?""  Members of OWS were dealing with reconciling the practice of democracy itself. How do you honor an anarchist who is yelling, ""no fucking leaders! No one leads!"" without being oppressive.

One of the main issue had to do with lack of leadership and a false belief that leadership immediately implied hierarchy and therefor oppression. The Tea Party was not so conflicted. 

One of the most important aspects to the next movement is the framework for organization and leadership that bypasses this notion that leadership equates with oppression.

"neuro","t5_2qu9b","I would add some caveats to some of the stuff posted here.

First, this is indeed very exciting because you can now control cells optically, like many have said.  Meaning that if I can shine light in a focused manner onto a neuron or series of neurons, I have some control over whether &amp; when they fire.  

Also, it is very exciting because of something not much mentioned above.  Namely, the advances in cellular imaging, specifically with genetically encoded calcium indicators.  Right around the time that Channelrhodopsin was blowing up, so was GCaMP3.  Now we are up to GCaMP5, and 6 was shown at posters at SfN, demonstrating the first genetically encoded indicator that can report single APs (though this is in very optimal conditions).  Bottom line: genetically encoded calcium indicators are now as good if not better than top tier synthetic calcium indicators without the constraints those impose.

Coupled with things like halo and channelrhodopsin, this in principle means that you can image neurons using the calcium indicators, figure out what they do, then manipulate them using the transducers (channelrhodopsin, halo, chief etc. etc.)

However, there are still serious technical limitations.  For one, achieving precise enough spatial control to actually evoke responses in isolated neurons within a larger population is very difficult for photostimulation.  You basically have to either 1) use very very sparse expression using something like single-cell electroporation or 2) use 2-photon microscopy to elicit responses.  Technique #2 is really the only viable option for large-scale (i.e., many cell) studies, and though demonstrated in principle using several approaches (e.g., by Rickgauer and Tank, or by Emiliani's group), none have been employed in a real awake/in vivo experiment, the context where this really becomes interesting.

In the end, 2-photon activation of rhodopsins will be difficult because delivering the necessary energy in a short timespan is not at all trivial.

Also, temporal control of channelrhodopsin is not so great.  Typically, jitter on the order of 10 ms is present, meaning that action potentials, which have a duration of ~1 ms and a precision to match in many systems, are smeared out in time.  This will get better, but what this means is that you still can't count on precise timing.  

Other problems include rebound, cell pathology due to channel overexpression (Dan Feldman had a nice paper on this, though they were expressing INSANE amounts of protein), etc.  

But yea, the stuff kicks serious ass.  ","1364775466"

* a statistical analysis of many packs bought over time showing deviation from what true randomness would produce (this is really just a large-scale version of the above)

It's just a release. In those moments, I don't think we were people to him, much less his own children. We were just ""things"" that he ""needed"" to hit.

"trackandfield","t5_2ry5t","It was certainly a fun race but much more difficult than I was expecting. I know everyone was telling me how difficult it was going to be but you can never completely understand until you've experienced it for yourself. The first few laps of the race felt really slow but I thankfully decided not to push the pace.

I really didn't get much of a chance to practice the hurdles before. Our club doesn't have access to any so I waited until about an hour or two before the race and practiced on the ones the officials had set out on the side of the track. After practicing for about 15 minutes I got yelled at and had to stop. I also never had a chance to practice on the water jump. My original plan was to step on each hurdle as I went over but once the race started I ended up hurdling the majority of them. I found it was faster/easier than stepping on and pushing off each one. Regardless, my hurdling form was atrocious. I could tell from my shadow as I jumped as well as from some pictures my friend took during the race. The water jump, especially, was tough. For some reason, I couldn't stop myself from landing on both feet and slowing down a lot. Overall, with a little work on form, I'm confident I could drop 15-20 seconds without any change to my fitness.

Our former club record was 11:53.xx and I ran 10:4x.xx and got second place. So I was happy with that. It still is a pretty weak record but not nearly as bad as before.

Thanks for everyone's advice. Much appreciated.","1364775482"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It is not an easy job.  Being a client facing business, your boss's primary job is to make the client happy and close the transaction.  Since we are advising CEOs, CFOs and boards, a liquidity event (M&amp;A, or selling shares as part of an equity offering) or a financing event is one of the most important times in the clients' lives.  For the technology businesses we dealt with, that usually meant they would be walking away with tens of millions of dollars after the transaction closes.  That means that you better be there when they need you.  If not they will hire another firm/

Also, fees are generally success-based - meaning you will not get paid as a firm if the deal does not close.  A typical deal at a middle market investment bank brings in over a million dollars in fees (from a 3-5 person banking team), and you close several of these per year, so it is easy to justify working an analyst or associate into the ground to make sure the deal closes or to make sure you win a pitch.

Half of banking is about the team you work for.  My boss was awesome (actually seen as a hard ass at the firm), had been in banking for 30 years, and understood that if he wanted his resources to do a good job, they have to have at least a decent life.  I worked much more than most of my friends that did not go into banking - as an analyst, anywhere from 70-100 hrs a week and as an associate anywhere from 60-80 hrs a week), but was able to have a decent life outside of work.

The hardest part about it is being on call ALL THE TIME.  I had two phones to keep my life sane, but emails at midnight from my boss were not out of the question.","1364775484"

For instance, reactors are a form of capital. The most basic reactors are constructed out of rolled sheet metal (along with many more components, but we'll ignore these). By extracting metals from the earth, refining and alloying them, stamping them into sheets, and then using the sheets to build a reactor, capital can be created. Yes, most often capital creation requires other forms of capital, but that's obvious and is part of the reason the world today is so specialized.

Are you suggesting communism? If I use my own money to buy a reactor (to produce chemicals or whatever) and one day my company grows to be a large corporation, do I at some point no longer have a legitimate claim to the capital that I purchased?

If I was doing it I would proberbly make it similar to a normal draft: by making sure each pack got a rare and 3 uncommons like normal. Consequently you'd want at least 24 rares, 72 uncommons and 164 commons. And possibly double that so it doesn't get too predictable - so 48/144/328. 


I say you definitely want some cards in multiples, too. Especially some of the more crucial commons and reasonable removal. And consider if you want to keep each set separate, or just smush them all together.


Anyway: this seems like a top plan. I'm pretty keen to chuck together an Innistrad cube (with assorted DA and even some AVR for good measure) after rotation when I can get stuff for cheap. Maybe even Saga, Masques or Onslaught blocks if it goes well. Hooray for nostalgia! :)","1364775487"

But more importantly, is he capable at all of getting the points and fighting for a WDC? I don't know. He has seems to have been improving steadily since last year so we will see how he performs as the year goes on. I think the chances are still slim to none though regardless of who he drives for. Don't get me wrong though, I would love nothing more than for Felipe to continue to improve. I think it would be absolutely fantastic. As for Webber, his best chance is at Red Bull as they've had what is undoubtedly the best car for the past few years. I'd be surprised if either of them could go to another team and develop it into either a championship winning team much less a championship contender.

Another important question is, is he a driver that can be #1 at a top-tier team? Probably not, and I don't think Webber could be either. ","1364775489"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","No problem at all. I'm not even entirely *sure* myself - I'm an engineering student so I don't really use the term 'cognitive dissonance' much at all. A reasonable amount of people seem to have agreed with me though, so that might point to me being correct?

If I interpret your understanding correctly, you're saying that were using 'cognitive dissonance' to mean 'difference in thoughts'. Usually that would be completely fine and still technically makes sense. However, I believe 'cognitive dissonance' is also more specifically defined by psychologists so it creates some confusion, in my opinion. If you'd not come across this before, its an easy mistake to make, I guess.

In fact your use of the term still works (as the literal definition *and* psychology's definition) for people who think **both** that 'believe what religion teaches' **and** 'what actually seems like the right way to treat people and live' because said person holds two contradicting beliefs. However, for those who don't 'believe what religion teaches', the psychology definition doesn't apply.

... if that makes sense? Its 1:15am and I've been eating Easter eggs and playing 4 way chess and poker all day and my brain is about done. The engineer in me wants to draw a diagram :/

1. She's immidiately sexually attracted to you.  
2. She's had few sexual partners (you can click that blue arrow now)
3. She comes from a healthy family, preferably with parents still married.
4. She's been in a commited, long-term relationship before that functioned well for the majority of the time.
5. She doesn't ""hang out with the guys"".
6. She initiates sex and rarely refuses it, especially without a valid reason.
7. She's a little bit jealous.
8. She never ever disrespects you in public nor tries to undermine your position and always sides with you.
9. She tries her best to please you.

But basically, if she behaves like she wants to be your queen and you to be her king, with all the respect, loyalty, belief in your strenght and gratitude to be at your side it implies, she's a keeper. If she treats you like a girlfriend whom she occasionally allows to penetrate her, run.","1364775501"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Kids, I'd like you to learn a thing or two about the [euphemism treadmill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism_treadmill#Euphemism_treadmill). Words for traits that people perceive as negative often get used as insults to hyperbolize flaws. When people campaign for changing language, they are not getting rid of a slur, they are creating one by reassigning the socially acceptable word to some new euphemism that will be used to insult people in the future once the previous euphemism is forgotten as being the politically correct word. Instead of trying to change people's language, like what happened with ""nigger"" and ""retard"", you need to change people's perception of the named group. A good example of how to do it right is the Homosexual community's co-option of the word ""gay"" and distancing from the word ""faggot"" (""gay"" is now used as a non-insulting descriptor and ""faggot"" is used as an insult without actually being associated with homosexuals).

With ""retard"", this poses a significant problem because even the most complex and progressive euphemism can't mask the fact that it defines a class of people that everyone views as inferior and nobody wants to be. Every word you try to use will be turned into an insult because of this. The best you can do is to try to have people identify their condition more specifically rather than classing all disabled in the same group. Many of them will still be used as insults (like Downs and Autistic), but it is a much better step forward than trying to kill every new euphemism that pops up.","1364775502"

Except Aragorn, and everyone else.

&gt;Galadriel, whom everything she does and says is prophetic by the nature of her character

Source it.

&gt; I've proven that.

What you've done, technically, is throw about the word 'prophecy' and 'foretell' until you are blue in the face, but you done nothing to prove that any uses of those words by you are accurate. You say Galadriel is giving prophecy because all her stuff is prophetic. You say since it didn't happen yet, the marriage gift that I've literally quoted as being able to be given before a marriage, foretells the marriage. You can't just say things and expect people to treat them as facts. These are not facts. These are you repeating rubbish over and over and over.

&gt;which is also why she had forsaken her immortality

You have yet to show that Arwen forsook he immortality at this point. Nothing you have quoted shows this. Your favorite quote actually takes place from a reference point more than a century later.

&gt;We know the jewel can heal the bearer

Nothing says that. Source it.

&gt;it's protection only came from prophecy

There is no prophecy, and even if there were a prophecy, it would not stop a blade aimed at Aragorn's chest, and is therefore not, as you originally said, the case that ""Aragorn can't die until the time is right"".

&gt;I've cited lore

And I *quoted* that lore, and you'll note it did not say what you said it said.

&gt;but you still don't

I understand what you are saying. It's simply that practically everything you are saying is wrong, and you keep using the small bits of things you say that aren't explicitly wrong as proof, somehow, that everything else that does not follow from them are correct. This is not how logic works.

&gt;Some people are perfectly happy with their narrow and limited interpretation of the story.

Fighting *has* made the fat go away for every single person who actually put in some effort to educate themselves about nutrition and worked up enough discipline and mindfulness to not have five breakfasts each day.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","There are a few issues here. Firstly, the likelihood of soft tissue of any kind, cancerous or not, is minuscule. Very explicit conditions have to be reached, and the most common preservation method is an anaerobic state, at least in north america and europe, variable temperatures, and a relatively high level of precipitation prevent the almost all organic tissue survival (Renfrew, C and Bahn, P. 2008). It must be noted here that lung cancer does not display on the skeleton. Secondly, I don't know the exact number of bodies with preserved soft tissue off the top of my head, but the number will not be enough to support your argument - you would need a large enough number of bodies to be representative of the general population; preservation on this scale happens nowhere.


I would like to counter in the same manner; despite it's other uses, The earliest known use of Cannabis is chinese, and from 9000BC, it was used as a narcotic (Gale, R and Cutler, D. 2000). I'm willing to risk a little speculation in saying that there is no evidence of lung cancer in burials of the period either, admittedly, i haven't looked into it, but it seems a pretty safe bet - for the reasons outlined above.

I had a similar problem on windows 7.

I have a wired controller and a wireless one.

I bought my receiver of eBay for $10.

http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-controller-for-windows

On windows 7 you need to Dow load this driver.

Need to go into controller settings and select a driver. 

I cannot remember the exact process but google it and you wil find the process to follow, basically need to add a driver from the standard windows drivers.

If you still having trouble let me know and when I get home I wil find the full walk through.

Some states call it ""domestic partnership"" which generally has less rights than either a civil union or marriage... but then some states call it ""domestic partnership"" and have the same rights as a civil union.

But the biggest issue is that same-sex unions are only recognized on a state level. Which means if you leave the state, and go to another that has differing laws, it means nothing. On a federal level, same-sex unions aren't treated the same when it comes to taxes/social security/medical benefits (again, because they're recognized on a state-by-state basis).

You're looking for something that fits (most important), has a ""slack"" geometry like that Surly LHT that electronjohn mentioned and will fit wide tires.

The slack geometry is important because you're not trying to go fast or make extremely quick direction changes.  A race bike or a trendy ""fixie"" (track bike) have aggressive geometries that make for quick acceleration and direction changes at the expense of comfort.

The wide tires are important because there's crap on the roads and wide tires handle it MUCH better.  Both normal handling and flat protection (more air = more pinch flat protection)  The trend for fast bikes is skinnier and skinnier but if you look at the numbers the tires themselves don't roll much faster and there is definitely a point of diminishing returns.  I like 700x32 and 26x1.25 for ""road"" bikes.

At 5'2"" you probably don't even want a 700c bike (road bike wheels), look for 26 or even 24 inch wheels (on a mountain bike).

A really good urban bike is an unsuspended mountain bike that's been equipped with ""slicks"" or smooth tires.  Hard to flat, rock solid geartrain and typically pretty cheap.  I personally hate flat bars but lots of people like them.

GL.  Used bikes are crazy priced in markets like Austin so be sure you know what you're getting.","1364775524"

The same theme is played out and quite prevalent in all presuppositionalist thought or even say 'American exceptionalist' arguments. There's power in pretending you're the source of social institutions or behaviors you're not really responsible for maintaining and you didn't originally create, just look at the Kim's Dynasty in North Korea for a regime who uses this propaganda tactic ad nauseum for remaining legitimate, to further justify it's existence, to the masses.

For example you can't be stealthy when wearing 10 tons of armor and every weapon made in the whole world but then you can take a lot of hits. But you won't be able to dodge or climb. But if you have no armor and only use your hidden blade you could actually sneak through the crowds and you can climb. You could also dodge in fights but you would go down after a single hit.

This would even add replay value to the games, making them non-linear. Because at the moment AC seems to be the only linear open-world-game on the market. Of course there's this big city but you can't really do something. It's just running from mission to mission which are scripted as fuck. They even give you a shitload of tools you can't use.

It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus.

To this day I do not do deadlifts or cleans of any kind, I'm just too scared. My lower back still gets weak or tweaked when I go marathon shopping or do my squats funny. I try to do weighted glute bridges and those swimmer things on my stomach (can't think of the name) to keep my lower back strength up. Maybe it's wrong not to do those lifts, but whatever, it's been working for me.

It may take a while, but this will get better! Focus on what you can do:

1. Stay positive

2. Eat light while you recover, you might even lose weight

3. Go to physical therapy, do everything they tell you to and work it on your own at home

4. Get some sleep, things will not seem so bleak in the morning.","1364775544"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","A good torque converter automatic is smoother under a wider range of situations. A dual clutch by design is always trying to guess your next gearchange - and doesn't always get it right - which leads to nasty clunks as if driven by a newbie stick driver (I've tried the A3, M3, 911, 458, and FF versions - the FF is the best of that bunch). It's other failing is that it has to step down or up through each gear (has two shafts with alternating gearsets), unlike a single clutch auto, torque converter auto, or manual, where you can skip-shift as needed. In the M3, the gearbox in early versions was unable to downshift quickly enough, which led to engine stalling, then after a software change, it would just hang in neutral until the mechanicals could catch up, which led to dangerous lapses of power flow.

So while a dual clutch is very fast and very smooth under ideal conditions, in the real world it's not as clear cut a winner.","1364775553"

Go for Titans instead, Also I would reccomend you look into building several LGA2011 based machines or a couple Dual Socket 2011/1366/Opteron machines to run a Virtual machine off of.

TBH the perfect balance between work and play would be an EVGA SR-X with a couple 2687w put into it, if your lucky with straps you can get a 3.5GHz clock up from 3.1GHz(locked multipliers on all 8-core LGA2011 CPUs, due to thermal limits).

Our country is now accountable for financing and aiding an organization who's intent is pass an ethnic cleansing on Egypt.  Everyone here seems so content to be upset with other being outspoken against other government supported acts of violence, but they let this one quietly slip under the radar. Why?

Instead read the Qur'an. Its historical value (if you are willing to believe in God and miracles) is solid. It was not meant to be written as a fictional piece, but rather a complete handbook for life, telling you what is forbidden, what is allowed, what are other people's rights on you and vise versa, and stressing religious aspects. The Qur'an also has much in the way of science. (All off the top of my head, so please don't quote me) The Qur'an suggests the Big Bang Theory as the origin of the universe, it correctly identifies that the human body is primarily composed of water, and gives a brief explanation of how the human sperm and egg create a fetus. The Qur'an also hints at the fact that day and night can exist at the same time (understood as there can be day in one hemisphere while the other hemisphere is in the middle of the night), at the possibility of space travel, and at the process of  formation of clouds.

All this even though the Qur'an is not a book of science, nor of history, but of religion. The Qur'an teaches, instead of ""prejudice, cruelty,  superstition, and murder"", it teaches kindness, honor, integrity, self-control, and equality. Instead of taking what the Western media says for granted (we all know its biased and very agenda-driven) read the Qur'an for yourself. Its a lot shorter, more interesting, no fillers, more mind-engaging and thought-demanding, and has no contridictions as the Bible infamously does. You won't regret it.

No. The Pirates payroll this year is the highest it has been in years.

&gt;They would lose money if enough of us stopped going. And even if that's not the case, they would make less money if more people boycott.

You've completely missed the point here. A boycott of a team because the team does not spend enough money is asinine. Let's cost them a bunch of money so that they will spend money! That is completely irrational and absolutely no-one who runs a business would want to sink more money into a team like that.

&gt;Why assume the buyer would want to take them to another town? The MLB would have to approve of it first and surely they know we are a great sports town with great fans who have had to suffer under bad management. I don't think the Pirates are at risk for leaving town. Also...didn't they sign an agreement to not leave for many more decades for the funding of the new stadium?

I'm talking long-run scenarios rather than immediate.

&gt;Umm....the product is always bad are you admitting I am right to boycott?

No. I'm simply stating that this is a complex scenario in which the fans are the victims.  A boycott of the team would cripple any chance for future success but at the same time most fans should not be eager to start spending a lot of money on this franchise.

The situation with the Pirates has been a long and frustrating cycle of failure.  You can firmly place the blame in two separate places: the structure of Major League Baseball and poor general management on the Pirates end. 

The structure of the MLB is the largest problem for the Pirates.  The Steelers are an incredibly successful NFL team from the same small media market as the Pirates.  You can chalk their success up to the same two areas where the Pirates have failed: general management and the structure of the NFL.  In the NFL the size of the media market of a team has little impact on that teams success or failure in the league.  That is why you see teams in Pittsburgh and Greenbay be able to win championships at the same rate at those in larger markets.  Why is this? Revenue sharing. The NFL collectively negotiates its TV deal as a league and then splits that revenue from the several networks that broadcast its games evenly throughout the league. This leads to a situation where the spread of revenues from the richest to the poorest teams is much thinner than in the MLB. With revenues that are much closer and a hard salary cap a team from any given market can compete in the NFL.

In the MLB the spread is much greater because each team negotiates its own TV deal. Large market teams like the Yankees and Dodgers are able to negotiate tv deals worth billions of dollars while smaller market teams like the Pirates and Royals must settle for deals that are exponentially smaller.  The MLB has tried to remedy this situation by implementing a small amount of revenue sharing on those TV deals but the overall spread between rich and poor MLB teams is huge. This is why teams like the Pirates and Royals will *never* be able to be able to use a strategy of spending money to win games until the MLB changes its policies. 

What the Pirates really need to do is to find a general manager who can put together a team that is able to play good (not great) baseball for several consecutive years on the budget currently available. If the Pirates can put together a few seasons that put more seats in the stands and more eyeballs on the TV's they can negotiate a better TV contract and earn more revenue to be able to do the kind of spending that will win them championships.  Fans who boycott the team for not spending money are signing the teams death warrant. Less viewership means less revenue. Less revenue means less spending. Less spending means a shittier team.

Even if there is no official organization in mapmaking, certain sites such as TL could easily lend more visibility to the mapmaking scene.

After all, while officers are instructed to shoot-to-kill when firing their guns, do we really need to make extra sure that those hit by police bullets die? I'm sure the families of the long list of people shot by police who are at most guilty of less than a capital offense -- let alone innocent victims of overexuberant policing -- might disagree with that approach.

&gt;Well, one reason that law enforcement sources cite for their use of hollow-point bullets is that they tend to stay in their targets, thereby reducing collateral damage from bullets exiting a victim and hitting someone else. Fine, but doesn't that same logic also apply to criminals shooting at rivals in the street? Isn't it better for their intended target to suffer more damage if it might save other innocent bystanders?

I'm sorry but this is just not true. That's not to say you can't get great internships at great companies if you go to a less well known school, but going to a prestigious school has massive advantages. The main advantage is on campus recruiting. Ivy league schools will have people from software companies Google, MSFT, and Amazon, or banks like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, or hedge funds like BlackRock and DE Shaw, coming to their schools for you to meet and interact with. This is a huge advantage when applying for jobs. Often the hardest part is getting your foot in the door at larger, more well known companies,  but being at a school that is actively recruited offers huge benefits when searching for internships and jobs. These companies will always go to these schools because they know that the quality of student is typically better than anywhere else, and these companies only want the best, so they go where they think they can find it. There are also some really excellent state schools where these places recruit too, but these state schools that also very prestigious. ","1364775570"

At the intersection, we pulled up next to each other, and once again glanced over at each other. I proceeded to give my engine a light rev at her, and then took off to the right. 

Why the hell did I rev my engine? What could I have *possibly* gained from that other than looking like a complete tool? At the time it seemed like the coolest thing ever, but in retrospect, I must have looked like such a retard revving my engine in my shitty little Honda. ","1364775572"

If they should have left Sandman out, then the story would have centered quite easily around Peter's conflicts with Venom and Harry.

Implied in that premise is that individuals who are given this stimulus spending will spend it in a way to help themselves or put it to generally productive uses so that the economy will be spurred.  My challenge, which is obvious if one takes more than .001 of a second to think about it, is to show the underlying problem of giving people access to free (or cheap) money. 

If given free or cheap money (low or near-zero interest rates) moral hazard will rise, not productivity.

So instead I decided to try the Egg, one, because it seemed fitting and, two, because I wanted to get rid of it to make room in my infused/Naturals bags. 

It tasted pretty good all throughout. As you might expect it got pretty hot and the burn was wonky, but the construction was solid throughout; it never tried to fall apart.

I'd say its a good smoke for when you want something novel, but its not the most flavorful or exciting smoke either. I probably wouldn't buy another one. Just too damn big for my liking.","1364775593"

&gt; Uh, no offense, but that's by far the worst advice I've every heard. When you first meet a person, you never know how they will react. It varies on person to person. This is why people like meeting new people, to discover new personalities. Everyone reacts to everything differently, most of the time. Risks, believe it or not, can be taken. They can also have a positive impact. I can not tell you how many times I've made a joke about one team to a random stranger, just for them to either agree or disagree. Did one ever freak out? No.

Trash talking includes borderline insults (and insults when between friends). You don't meet a new person and then right out of the bat insult them, that isn't ""taking a risk"", it's being a dick. All trash talking is (between strangers), is an excuse to insult someone and pass it off as a joke. The big issue arises when the other person isn't OK with it, and you'll never know until after you said it, when it's too late.","1364775595"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Everyone here seems to be pushing everything off onto your husband here, but I'm seeing a fundamental disconnect in your relationship right from the start:

&gt;  I have never, in my entire life, wanted children but was willing to have a child for my husband or adopt at some point in the future.

If you had come here before getting married, most people would simply tell you that this is a deal breaker, or that there needs to be a lot of couples counseling before going through with a marriage.  Not wanting kids shouldn't be something you do to please your partner, regardless of the situation.  

What is he doing now?  He is sabotaging the relationship.  He has lost all control over what the outcome of your marriage will be, as you are both the breadwinner and get to choose when he gets to be a father.  

My saying this isn't an attack on you, but I'm guessing at his internal thought processes.  By doing all of these things, he is gaining a measure of control, even though it is a bad way to go about it.  

One option is couples counseling, and trying to work out the differences.  Honestly though, I suspect that divorce is the simpler solution.  You are both young enough to find someone that fits more into your expected lifestyle.  

You should ask yourself how you would handle this situation in 2/4/6 years, where you would need to put your career on hold for 3mo to a year for pregnancy+nursing, plus having to schedule your time around a new baby.  ","1364775602"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","A lot of Catholics struggle with this issue. Its unfortunate. Considering your confirmation is around the corner, it's a bit too late to give you a sudden conversion on the matter. So here's my suggestion: avow yourself to trust your mother church. Tell God that you're struggling with this issue, but you want the Church to guide you. Ask God in the next few days, and especially during confirmation, to grace you with the knowledge and open mind to see the correctness of the church teaching.

Basically, this is the mindset you have now: I'm right, the Church  and its 2000 years of teaching and doctrine and writings of saints are all wrong. The attitude you SHOULD have is : my conscience is not adequately developed to see the Church's light on this issue, and I need to pray and do research until I can accept the Church teaching.

That's a difficult concept. This is effectively you telling yourself that you are wrong but you cannot even see where you're wrong yet. Do not identify as pro-choice. Identify as a Catholic who is struggling with a Catholic social teaching of abortion. But it is important that you DO NOT STOP prayer and research until you agree with the Church.

In short, don't go to confirmation saying ""I disagree with the Church"". You need your new mindset to be ""I need to learn to trust the Church"". Ask the Holy Spirit to help you in your confirmation to see the Church's truth on this. NOTHING in our doctrine is arbitrary or baseless or hateful. Everything is founded on scripture, reason, and love. Everything.","1364775611"

The question is legitimate, and to me sounds like the kid has picked up on a rare medical phenomenon from somewhere, perhaps a television program, or perhaps he's been told by a relative that this was the case when he was born.
It is not common, but children can be born with rectourinary fistula and end up with faces in their bladder. Passing of the meconium (the first excrement of the newborn) in the urine is a telltale sign.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I OBJECT!!! 

I can't speak for every Chinese restaurant including yours but that is not how fried rice are made in any of the Chinese restaurants I grew up with (at least 15+ considering how big my extended family is) and the ones I run. 

The glaring misinformation to me is that babies mice will not be able to move overnight after birth. So it is impossible that this particular baby mouse dug itself and suffocated while other baby mice migrated. 

Additionally, to give rice its ""individual grain texture"" the secret is the brand of the rice, the ratio of water and rice, and the cooking time. Considering the size of the average rice cookers made for Chinese restaurants, the average restaurant go through at least 3 rice cooker worth of rice a day. There is no time to leave tubs of rice overnight to obtain that desired consistency. Also rice left overnight are stored in the walk in cooler in my restaurants because rice go sour if not cool properly. Also, rice dehydrate fast, any rice left outside is surely not consumable. Freshly cooked rice are substantially easy to fried than old rice, so dehydrated old rice out overnight would not be time efficient considering most food are made to order in Chinese restaurants. I also want to mention that according to health department regulations, all the rices in my restaurants are labeled and used up within 4 hours (or else it is trashed unless it is priced in the walk in cooler after just finished cooking).  

I feel sick for two reasons: 

1. what kind of ghetto restaurant did you grow up with that have this kind of food prepping practice.

2. people believe anything posted on the interest and your comment is the highest voted one. ","1364775616"

Let's say you build a new nuclear power plant for $12 billion and then employs 500-1000 people who make over $100k a year. Or you could build a natural gas fired power plant that can have the same power output, be built for $1 billion and employs less than 50 people. This is where things get political. Natural gas is cheap and doesn't come with the consequences that nuclear power does. But nuclear power and the electric markets made deals a long time ago to be partners, no matter what. Giant electric corporations and companies like Westinghouse also lobby state and federal government officials to see that the partnership continues. Is nuclear power cheap? Yes.

When I was first speaker I made it exactly what it sounded like. A summary of everything in the debate. For example, last month on the China topic if I was pro I'd go over generally what the other team said, what my partner said to defeat it, and why our case was supreme.

It can also be used when your partner doesn't get back to your case (when you're second speaker) so the other team doesn't say that you dropped your case completely.

But it can work as a second rebuttal. The key is confidence though, especially at the TOC. Just remind yourself that you're the only one that can show the poor judges the way of the truth!","1364775624"

Gotta realize: the Saints would have been a POWERHOUSE in any other division than the NFC West and having to share it with Montana and Young's 49ers. Arguably, the Saints would have hosted more playoff games back in that late 80s, early 90s period and most likely would have won back then. To the point that one year, the Saints had a 12-3 record and the 49ers had a 13-2 record...the best and second best records that year.","1364775624"

You have a good look on people and a lot of people will find that attractive, some with take advantage of it as well. Don't let it get you down just rise above them and keep that good head on your shoulders. 


Yeah parties are fine to go to, i went to my fair share of them in my teenage years, they are fun and good for introverted people to open up. Talk to everyone, women and men a like. People are a lot more accepting than you would think. I use to be a super awkward teenager and scared to talk to people, i worried what they were going to think about me to the point i couldn't even get the words out of my head. I'm 29 now and the last 10 year's of my life have been amazing after i stopped worrying about myself and what others perceived me as. 


So, just casually introduce yourself to women 99.9% of the time they will be more than friendly and if you connect with one just ask her out for lunch or coffee sometime and go from there. Not every girl will take your offer but some will. Rejection is healthy.","1364775626"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I think you are missing the point here, nobody is suggesting everybody goes to college, they are suggesting those that get accepted into college get it for free. The issue here becomes retention of wealth, if you cannot afford college, you cannot go to it. Even though there are loans, they can be so crushing to the point where people go to lesser schools than they are qualified for because they cant afford it, while it is best for the society as a whole to have top students going to top universities. In a pay for system, there is a larger retention of wealth because people will avoid going to the best institution for them to save money, while it does not matter to the upper class who's parents are paying for them regardless. It allows for the best of us to do their best, rather than the parents who did the best to do the best. 

As for motivation, you can certainly institute penalties on drop outs to incentivize them to push through, although there really is not much of a pattern between drop out rates in pay for countries (the US has about a 50% before degree drop out rate) vs free/almost free countries (Europe has significantly less on average)

As for tax rate, it would be the same if not a little less although it is send to the government first rather than it coming directly from you/for your child. ","1364775641"

Back before I was born my mother was in a terrible car accident where a doctor that pulled over to help declared her dead on the scene. Two missionaries had also pulled over and gave her a blessing. She had been ""dead"" for over ten minutes and had no business being alive, but sure enough, when the took their hands off of her head her heart started beating and she started to breath again. After a long recovery including facial reconstruction surgery, skin grafts, bone grafts, and many other surgeries, she made a full recovery. No brain damage (Which is almost 100 percent the case when someone is ""dead"" for more then a few minutes) and to this day she looks amazing and you'd never guess how she'd been in a wreck. If there is a god then I have no doubt he was there with her through every step of the way.

Kept making a scene about how the plane was going to crash. Really upsetting the other passengers.  His wife is with him, and she assures us she can keep him calm.

All of a sudden, we lose one of our port engines. The crazy guy is going berserk, because he can see it from his window. Some flames shot out of it when we lost it. We were too high for a bird strike and it was night, so I assume something just came loose and fouled it.

The guy somehow got a weapon from the air marshal, pops open the emergency hatch and starts firing the gun out the door. I can't believe he didn't get sucked out. The whole time he's screaming that there's a man on the wing and he's shooting at him.

We made an emergency landing and fortunately no one was hurt, but I'll never forget that day.","1364775650"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","History police to the rescue: a ""witch"" in Puritan New England (or anywhere in the Colonies but it was most prevalent with spectral evidence in the theocratic Massachusetts, wasn't necessarily a woman. Any one could be accused of being a witch and many men were hanged for the crime of witchcraft. 

This wasn't relegated to North America either. The crime of witchcraft wasn't limited to women in Europe either. Boethius and Christopher Columbus (off the top of my head) were two high-profile men both accused of witchcraft on either end of the Medieval period. Boethius was even executed for it. 

Also, burning at the stake never occurred in North America for the crime of witchcraft and was not necessarily the only method for executing a witch. In Boethius' case, he was sentenced to house arrest for two years before he was bludgeoned to death. 

Philosoraptorically, this is an asinine question. Witches were accused of witchcraft for making a pact with the devil and circumventing divine grace in favor of unholy power. Christ, this ""magical man,"" was in the strictest sense, God, and in a more interpretive sense, endowed with the powers of the divine. In simpler terms: the spiritual power of Christ was not comparable with witchcraft and it has absolutely nothing to do with sexism.

If you try to build a NAS yourself with a proper RAID card, you'll still not beat the price of a drobo, though the performance increase will be huge.

Then again, are there really 75 different blu-rays that you really want to watch? And at that point, i'd sooner have a single BRRip of the blu-ray because I literally never go into the actual features, nor do I need all 15 languages in 5.1 surround.

Also, blu-rays are 25gb/disk, 50gb for dual layer, and 100gb for BDXL disks, which im fairly sure arent really even used that often. So after stripping all the random languages and special features and being left with a full resolution ISO containing a single native audio stream (DTS-hd or w/e) you are really looking at a minimum of 122 blu-rays per drive. And a max thats much higher. Plenty of people can make an H264 rip thats 5.1, dual audio, full 1080p and is about 6-10 gigs.","1364775651"

A long form assault on feudal japanese society, mores, violence, fatherhood, and just about anything else. 

Uncanny X-Men by Chris Claremont

Soap opera comics done right

Preacher

Funny, touching, gruesome, poetic.

Scalped

The best crime story to be found in or outside of comics.

THE comic book run.

All-Star Superman

A love letter to Superman. I challenge anyone to read this without enjoying at least one part of this epic end of days saga.

Akira by Katsuhiro Otomo

a classic thriller with a lot of meat

Swamp Thing by Alan Moore/Bissette/totleben

you admit that it is a world that most would not want to sleep with a trans person. who are you to judge what makes their reasons valid?

It can be quite a process and takes a lot of research and practice to expedite.

Ticking away the moments
That make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours
In an off-hand way

Kicking around on a piece of ground
In your home town
Waiting for someone or something
To show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today

**And then the one day you find
Ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run
You missed the starting gun**

(Solo)

And you run and you run
To catch up with the sun
But it's sinking

Racing around
To come up behind you again

The sun is the same
In a relative way
But you're older

Shorter of breath
And one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time

Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines

Hanging on in quiet desperation
Is the English way

The time is gone
The song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home
Home again
I like to be here
When I can

When I come home
Cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones
Beside the fire

Far away
Across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell...","1364775664"

I see what you're saying, and I think of public opinion could go either way, and it just depends on where it happens, what the community is like, who the victim was, who the accused was, etc., etc.  My main concern is people who actually DO consent to the act, and then later on--perhaps--get caught by their boyfriend, and they say ""Oh, no, he raped me, I didn't sleep with him,"" just to avoid the fight.

Or some people, such as in the case of my ex girlfriend, want people to BELIEVE they've been raped (notice I didn't say want to BE raped: I want to make that clear for anyone that is unclear on it) because it gets them sympathy or attention.  

It's just a really touchy subject, and they're are definitely good arguments for both sides, because there are scumbags that ACTUALLY rape women, and there are definitely people that are accused falsely.  And you can never be sure.","1364775668"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The thing is: looks helped Katy, singing/songwriting ability helped Adele, but what's hypocritical is that Adele also needs looks to *stay* on top. Every pop artist needs to stay appealing to the crowd. Adele isn't going to lose the weight because she's so proud and happy for herself, but she does have to wear her make-up and clothes a certain way in order to be as attractive as she possibly can be. 

No doubt Adele has incredible singing and songwriting talent, more-so than Katy and most other artists, but she honestly isn't relying solely on that to do well in her business, which she's implying that that's what Katy is doing (and that wasn't very cool). Katy still has to write catchy, fun songs and she has a pretty alright singing voice. While some artists do suck, I honestly don't think Katy is one of those who only relies on her looks.

Cooked foods are not sterile, they have bacteria in them, and they thus are subject to bacterial spoilage, which slows down at refrigerator temperatures under 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, we refrigerate cooked food so as to be able to store it for longer. Even wrapping the cooked food in plastic doesn't prevent the bacterial spoilage, because they are already present, and continue to grow and metabolize.

This is not true. Many people have fun playing with netdecks. Of course some people don't like it, and that is fine. Most people are not good at building decks, and there is no shame in using a deck that someone else built. In fact even some of the top pros don't build their own decks.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Here an interesting story (that relates to this in a way), I used to live in a Orthodox (to the max) Jewish area. The clothes, the hair, you name it. Just getting groceries I stick out like a sore thumb, and they made sure I knew it. Thankfully I lived in a building full of Filipino's else I'd probably go mad. God damn they are so nice. Anyway, on my way home from the Metro, I witnessed a man get hit by a car. The lady made a left hand turn into a side street and must not have seen him crossing. He landed on his back, feet way up in the air. Thankfully he was fine (no broken bones, just bruising I assume), but I stuck around to give my witness statement. I thought hey, why not? The man who got hit was Jewish, the woman who hit him was Jewish, the volunteer fighter fighter who arrived first was Jewish, and the Rabbi's who ran over from the nearest synagogue (someone likely called them) were obviously Jewish. 

They did not bug me until the police arrived. I think the only sane one there was the volunteer fire fighter really. He took my statement, saying I could leave if I wanted. He grabbed a Rabbi to write my number down. He wrote it down on I kid you not, the back of a cheque. I shouldn't have given my number to him, but I wasn't thinking at the time. When the police officer arrived he started to question me first, doing the usual run down, whatever you want to call it. The entire time this poor officer is trying to just write down my information and the Rabbi's, and the man who even got hit (and even his brother who came outa no where) kept badgering the officer to question someone else. They even said to question the brother...who wasn't even there. Police officer had to threaten to arrest them 3 times until they finally left us alone.

Soon enough we finish, I ask the officer to make sure the Rabbi destroys my cellphone number, which we also had to argue about. It happens, and then I go on my marry way. 

TLDR: Stuck around to give a witness statement in a Orthodox Jewish area. They made it very clear they didn't want me there. ","1364775681"

So instead of one funny joke, you have one funny joke that rests on everything that came before and you can't explain it to anyone because they'd need to watch the whole show but you'll quote it wherever you can.

Unfortunately, it was cancelled in 2006. Most likely because a show that makes no sense if you catch it in the middle can't possibly get *more* viewers but it got quite popular after it ended, so much that Netflix itself decided to directly finance a new season (which we'll get this spring) that will be followed by a movie.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Indeed. An interesting conundrum of Elizabeth's revelation during the ending is that every single playthrough of the game is *technically* canon. What I mean to say is that once you acknowledge that reality is split into infinite variations of itself superimposed upon itself, it means that literally *anything* that happens in the world technically could've happened.

Every bullet fired, every vigor used, every time Booker died at the hands of a Fireman or a Motorized Patriot, every time you stole cash from the register or didn't... And every time that Booker succeeded. All variables within the larger constants. Hell, you could so far as to take this exponentially higher by saying that every single copy of the game presents its own continuity. I think that's what it means to say with its ambiguous little cut after the ending... But then again, I might just be talking out of my ass here.

I'm just saying that by the game's definition of its infinite realities, then it has happened/can happen/will happen.

They only jump on it when people like you go in and start bitching about it, but their intent isn't to offend each other, since they already know pretty much every 4chan user won't even give it a second glance.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","I mean, yes, when you transliterate Yiddish orthography into Roman orthography, there are several different transcription systems, but to imply that Yiddish hasn't undergone standardization in the writing system is ignoring a very, very significant part of Yiddish history, mainly, the push for Yiddish to be accepted as a language in its own right around the late 1800s, early 1900s. This movement occurred around the same time as other language standardization movements in Europe, and was fueled by the same desire for a unified, national identity. Part of this push was standardization of both the writing system and the language. ","1364775698"

"lowimpactlifestyle","t5_2wrx1","&gt; balcony is facing north

Really depends on the exact orientation of the balcony, and how much shade is present. Over a nice weekend or day off, make note of how many hours of direct sunlight your balcony is getting. Plants simply don't grow without sun!

&gt;what are some basic things to do to ensure they grow? 

Water, quality soil, and sunlight. Each plant will require different amounts of all three, so make sure you do your research before you decide what to grow.

&gt;Like how many hours a week would it take?

Your largest investment of time will be in research and setup. Plants in a relatively controlled environment actually require very little work beyond watering, and the time spent on that is negligible.  I've never had to weed a potted plant.

"lotr","t5_2rfb9","That it did not have Elrond's blessing is a dubious claim, for Elrond stated that Arwen would wed no man less than the King of Arnor and Gondor. Elrond in no way states that such an event would not come to pass.

The *only* prophecy concerning the Elfstone is:

&gt;You shall hand it on when the time comes. For before you grow weary, and at last forsake Middle-earth one shall come who is to retrieve it, and his name shall be of that of the stone: Elessar he shall be called.

That's it. There's no, ""And he shall be impervious to blade and arrow."" There's no, ""And he will, for certain, reclaim his crown. Galadriel fulfill's Gandalf's words, fulfills her role in giving her blessing, *and that is it.*

While much that Galadriel does is prophetic, not everything is so. To say such is over-exaggeration. Furthermore, prophecy is not the same as certainty. If it were, it would violate free will. Prophecy in Tolkien's mythos is a combination of wisdom and faithfulness to the will of God. **Nowhere** is it suggested that the characters are certain of victory -- indeed doubt and fear are strong throughout the work. The Mirror of Galadriel shows visions of the future too, yet, ""Some never come to be.""

However, for a sampling of where prophecy does not equate to certainty:

&gt;'At least none can foretell what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take . . . Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope.'

'The Council of Elrond'

&gt;'I have spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.'

'The White Rider'

&gt;*The days now are short. Either our hope cometh, or all hope ends.*

'The Passing of the Grey Company'

&gt;""If these two wed now, hope may be born for our people, but if they delay, it will not come while this age lasts.""

'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen'

I have provided textual evidence, so I ask that you do the same. Provide at least one quote where it explicitly states that victory is assured and that Aragorn will succeed in becoming the King of Arnor and Gondor.

&gt;You're right about Idril, but I'm still right about Arwen.

Again, I have provided explicit and clear textual evidence for my claims. I ask no more or less than you. You assert correctness without provided evidence for it. Sorry, but that's not how good debate and discourse works.

&gt;It would seem that way, but it doesn't, because she didn't. She stayed and remained mortal for Aragorn. What I quoted spells it out. That is the story. 

Your logic is flawed. The quote you provided only states that she chose the doom of Men, and that choice was made long ago. It makes no comment on the specific reasoning for that choice -- that is, it does not say that because Arwen wed Aragorn she accepted the Doom of Men. That Aragorn presents the possibility of repentance suggests that Arwen may go back on that choice. Precedent suggests that the two choices -- of marriage and of Doom -- are independent. They are only linked in the emotional wishes of the chooser.

I've tried having the great date debate many times but it doesn't really get anyone anywhere. A lot of the stuff you mentioned doesn't really resonate with my own personal dating experience, so I can't really speak to it. Also I'm aware that saying ""this doesn't apply to me"" does not make it untrue.

I'm not a perfect specimen by any means but I've had much more luck in dating than I'm ""supposed"" to have based on the rules that I hear people throw around. I also tend to search hard for men with good hearts and similar interests (and I have one - super lucky!) rather than status/money/alpha/whatever. Like I said though, this doesn't make these statements untrue - I just don't know how to confirm or deny them really.

I understand the statistics too, as I've viewed the ""studies"" OKcupid has done.

Its irrelevant. You have to be capable of doing something for it to be done. I am incapable of dunking a basketball, there is no way I can accidentally do it. To do something, you must be capable of it.

&gt;I'm sure that it was a momentary lapse of judgement on your part where a part of your humanity managed to break through and do something useful for once.

Yep, which is also why I created a sub for helping people, and moderate one for helping people, and work in an industry to help people.

All must have been accidents.

Me not wanting to help YOU and other lazy people does not make me incapable of helping people.

How so? I mean, I suppose if it was all I did, I could agree, but you and I are both in the same place right now (on reddit), only one of us has done something productive on this site. The other hasn't. Who is really sad here?

I have a successful career and successful relationship. I have great friends. I train in a sport I enjoy, make regular progress, and am bettering myself and work to help those around me who also have similar interests. And I spend a small portion of my day clicking a macro which seems to offend idiots like you. 

What exactly do you do that isn't ""sad""? I mean...if my life is sad, id really like to know what ""happy"" is, as I thought I had been doing it right all along.

Nah, I take enjoyment in arguing with people like you who have no idea what they are talking about.

There is no error in sitting, it is no more useful than anything else.  There is a question of the health benefit of sitting compared to moving meditation, or compared to what I read about in that crazy guy book where they sit and then run laps and then sit.

The error is found in making a religion of sitting.  Those who defend sitting have gotten the sickness, those who have no interest in discussing it, perhaps they sit sometimes, perhaps they don't.

If someone makes a religion of building straight standing walls I will knock on their door as well... but generally useless things are not made into religions... it is only those things with some benefit which are made holy, and thus worshiped as more then they are... like forgiveness.","1364775710"

"WhereAreTheFeminists","t5_2umhp","&gt; And there you have it.

What, exactly?

&gt; Analagous to the labia minora is what?

Not my question nor relevant, ...

&gt; What's your point?

... since what I am saying is that there are subtypes of FGM (female circumcision) other than ""Lopping off the organ"" that are similarly or less destructive than male circumcision, and that those are thus very much not as incomparable as people often believe it to be the case.

With regard to the cutting covered both by Types¹ IIa and Ia, this comparability is especially warranted by the fact that, as said, there are women electively choosing it (as professional procedure, i.e. not done in the amateurish ways so common in Africa).

Of course FGM *as a whole* is not analogous to professional male circumcision (and Celda failed to clarify any of this), but again, that's exactly why I narrowed it down to Ia, IIa and some of IV.

&gt; If by ""zero-sum game"" you mean that [...]

No, I don't. I meant that ""pointing out that some of FGM is less destructive and comparable to male circumcision"" does not imply that one euphemizes or even condones either -- and I don't (notice, for instance, that I don't euphemize Ia or IIa as ""cutting off excess skin""). Unfortunately that's not obvious to everybody, thus the note.

¹: Those types aren't ""mine"", btw, they were introduced by none other than the WHO (as revised 2007). I don't see what your literature quote adds to that, either.","1364775723"

&gt;You take the top of the earth, and the bottom of the earth. What more clarity do you want? And I excluded the diagonal line of the probability formula to please your needs.

That doesn't really matter when you exclude the diagonal (but else the width and always the projection of the map turns out to be a problem). 
Without the diagonal and without artifical coordinates who were invented by another culture centries after Mekka was founded then there would be 2 parallel lines (with a total length of around 80.000 km (less)) who all meet the requirement. Else there are 4 points.

&gt;My mistake... but then the margin of error is even smaller. The guy stated the margin of error for us.

Do you realise that you can't accept such a big margin of error (which was caused cause we can't calculate it exactly and don't really know where that point is)? The error is so big that even when the Kaaba would be included in the area - we still wouldn't know if the real point is actually in there.

&gt;I'm calculating the probability that it would be in the golden ratio of earth. 

The problems are that the margin of error is so big that we can't know where the exact point is and that the Golden Ratio is really nothing special. Every distance contains 2 points where the Golden ratio could apply and there should be more than one town close to that around 80.000 km long area.
Small probabilities are nothing special by the way. The probability that you get a certain distribution of cards in Skat is 1/2.753.294.408.504.640 - Does that make it magical? You will always get a distribution and there will always be points who fit the Golden Ratio (even though we don't know which in this case).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","There actually *is* some serious discussion about whether Jesus was real or not, or if he was a compilation of several different ""prophets""/teachers that existed around the supposed time of Jesus.

Several well-known Jewish historians were present during the time of Jesus, even living in Jerusalem when Jesus was supposedly crucified, yet they do not mention anything about him, the earthquake that supposedly occurred, the sky ""going dark"" during his crucifixion, the celebration that occurred when Jesus arrived at the city, etc.

Yet they record far more mundane things, and even mention other prophets and religious leaders.  Why would they choose to not record probably the most amazing thing to ever happen to their city while mentioning lesser prophets?

It's possible that the physical Jesus never existed and the account of him in the bible are an amalgamation of different folktales and stories of other prophets that were just lumped under the name Jesus.  This would explain why the gospels all widely differ from each other, and why nothing was even written about him until 50-70 years after his supposed death.","1364775729"

You have a good look on people and a lot of people will find that attractive, some with take advantage of it as well. Don't let it get you down just rise above them and keep that good head on your shoulders. 


Yeah parties are fine to go to, i went to my fair share of them in my teenage years, they are fun and good for introverted people to open up. Talk to everyone, women and men a like. People are a lot more accepting than you would think. I use to be a super awkward teenager and scared to talk to people, i worried what they were going to think about me to the point i couldn't even get the words out of my head. I'm 29 now and the last 10 year's of my life have been amazing after i stopped worrying about myself and what others perceived me as. 


So, just casually introduce yourself to women 99.9% of the time they will be more than friendly and if you connect with one just ask her out for lunch or coffee sometime and go from there. Not every girl will take your offer but some will. Rejection is healthy.","1364775731"

Unless there is some specific information pertaining your laptop &amp; booting, I suppose a conversational approach would be most effective in this case.

First off, the laptop; I guess instead of a dv6-z 7200 it's a [dv6z-7200](http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0003&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5327910)? In that case, there is one [user review](http://reviews.shopping.hp.com/8843/ENVYdv6z_series/hp-envy-dv6z-7200-notebook-pc-reviews/reviews.htm?sort=rating&amp;dir=asc) that seemingly describes a working dual-boot setup, and the only issue mentioned is Wi-Fi. That's hopeful.  

Secondly, I was wondering which guides you have used. There's little to go wrong with the combination live USB + installing GRUB, but if you could link to the guides we'd know exactly what you tried, which might help.  

Third, it should be possible to boot your partition from any GRUB menu, including the one on your Live USB. It involves using the GRUB menu's interactive mode to enter the correct boot parameters. In all likelihood, those are already defined on your Mint partition. We can dive into that if you'd like to use it as a temporary hack.","1364775741"

Edit: Wow, huge surprise, instead of rebutting just downvote. 

Literally, others declared it a libertarian paradise, not libertarians, and there are many reasons Libertarians didn't. Lets count the ways;

* Andrew Ryan embargoing the outside world (libertarians would be vehemently against this) and thus there was a monopolization on nearly all products that lead to a revolt. 
* Andrew Ryan banned religion (he imposed his lack of religion, again this is against the non-aggresion principle and clearly against freedom of religion)
* Limited speech
* Limited travel
* Inconsistent / Corrupt justice system

You can't call this anything but a authoritarian dictatorship, regardless of how Andrew Ryan frames it. In conclusion, no libertarian would claim Rapture, before or after its fall. 

And look, not many political systems can survive ***PEOPLE SHOOTING BEES OUT OF THEIR HANDS!*** The overwhelming reason it *did* fail was because of supernatural addictive genetic splicing that turned people into monsters.

Doing trivial problems you have no difficulty with has little value and only wastes time and gives you a false sense of security since you've done a large volume of easy problems. The hard problems will reflect how well you know your math and therefor, how much time you should spend on it.

Some converts need extra support and can unfortunately be easily turned off by rigid attitudes. We should never join or leave a religion based upon its followers, but rather because it is the truth. Converts are in a process of understanding what it means to submit, and without guidance, they can fall astray. 

It's important to give them the space to figure it out on their own while being the best possible Muslim you can be around them so they have the support they need. ","1364775747"

You are extremely beautiful. Much higher than average. If you are truly having bad luck in the relationship department it isn't due to your looks. 

There is only one critique which I could give, and that is to lose maybe five or ten pounds. DO NOT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY. I am not saying you NEED to lose weight, I'm saying that if you wan't to attract the largest amount of guys, then you should lose a little. This isn't necessarily a reflection of my own opinion, but rather an mean of ideal body types. Some guys like really skinny women, others like a little fat and muscle, and others like more plump. When I say you should loose weight I'm saying that if you lost maybe 10 pounds you would be in the golden zone that would appeal to all of them.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","So, I am a LigaMX fan and follow MLS fan just to keep an eye on ideas and players that develop over here.

It all comes down to what you mean by ""saving"" Chivas USA. Is ChivasUSA doing badly? I don't think economically they are doing bad as people make it out to be. It is probably a  good asset for Chivas as it can keep a pretty low budget with minimal risk (due to no relegation) as it develops players and gives them more playing time than the Chivas organization could in Mexico, it can then sell the players to any market.

You want to fix the attendance? Have ChivasUSA play in LigaMX rather than in MLS.

You want ChivasUSA to have better attendance while staying in MLS and maintain its ties to Mexico? Relocate it to a town with no entertainment options. El Paso or Eagle Pass or some other industrial border town might fit the bill. It might still not work though.

Honestly, if I was Vergara, I would try to maintain the free ride that MLS is providing. Not the ideal for MLS, but MLS has no choice as there are still very few ownership groups with the interest and capital to own a team.

If I was a Mexican living in SoCal I would be pushing to have a LigaMX team in town or have the smaller teams (Puebla, San Luis, Atlante...) play against Chivas or America in Los Angeles rather than Guadalajara/Mexico City. Those games draw very little in their respective cities, but would draw lots of attendance in the USA.

If I was running MLS, I would start doing some tinkering to figure out a way to get some dirt on Vergara and Chivas to make sure that when the time comes to have them sell their MLS franchise, it is at a discounted rate.","1364775751"

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","What are you switching FROM? 

I use Novopens (version 4, IIRC) for both my Levemir and my NovoRapid. I also used the Lilly equivalent, years ago, when I was on Humulin/Humalog -- I switched because there was a shortage of one of the insulins locally, and it was easier to switch brands entirely than go back and forth. I can't say I've noticed much difference between the pens in terms of accuracy or anything. I have never used anything BUT insulin pens -- I never used a bottle and syringe, for example.

In terms of the needles, I currently use BD UltraFine III. I think the product lines are different depending on what country you're in (I'm Canadian), but it's an 8mm 31-gauge needle. I used to use the longer 13mm 29-gauge needles, and I much prefer the shorter needles. I haven't tried the 4mm version, as they are really new on the market here. 

How big is your biggest dose of insulin? If you're just taking a few units at a time, then I really doubt you would feel the gross 'liquid under the skin' thing even with a 4mm needle. The volume of liquid injected in most vaccines is substantially higher. The largest dose I take daily is 40 units of Levemir, and even that doesn't equal the amount of liquid in, say, a flu shot.","1364775752"

"politics","t5_2cneq","As an older redditor, we used to laugh at Hitchens in the 20th when he was a phoney leftist (it was controversial and sold papers) because we all knew what an intellectually lazy racist he was. We all had to shake our heads in the 21st when he shed the patina, and just went full on neo-con shit bag. And it was hard to respond with anything but horror when we found out a new generation of young people, intelligent and educated, were taking him seriously. The rest of those guys aren't much better. I entered one of the nations best philosophy programs (Pittsburgh) in 99 and I don't think anyone in the field I ever talked to about ""new atheism"" wasn't like ""those racist neocons? No thank you"". Also, it takes only a little bit of work to uncover the origins of British new atheism in British old Islamophobia. Remember that Britain's contentious relationship with the Muslim world is much older than ours here in the states. British New Atheism's material roots lie in nativist anti-immigrant movements against the Pakistani's in the 70's and 80's. They aren't flirting with Islamophobia. They are an historical institution which began in Islamophobia. The fact that they've expanded their horizon to include the European faiths shouldn't fool anyone. Anyone preaching fear of the ""other"", whatever surety of rationalism they may claim, is a con man, and probably a nativist prick. But like I said, outside of internet forums for teenagers, everyone knows these guys are intellectually shallow instrumentalist neo-con social darwinists. There are probably some more pejoratives I could tack on there, but I've got to get back to work.","1364775756"

On the one hand, it had some very good writing moments, such as the whole neighbourhood-to-airplane-to-tomorrow scene, whilst Clara is still holding the same cup of tea, warm. (Although it became increasingly obvious that the cup was empty, even though we did see it steaming when they were outdoors) Controlling people through the wifi, and the flow of how the actors were jumped was great, that waitress in the cafe was SUPERB. (Seriously, that posh voice she did was like honey.) The casual evilness of Miss Kilser was great too. 'He's going on holiday, kill him when he gets back. Let's not be entirely unreasonable.'

But, I didn't like the whole 'Amelia Williams book writer' thing, I just want to finally move past Amy. If they MUST reference her, then at least do it Rose-style, with posters of her books in the background, where they don't get a special shot, or with newspaper articles like Vote Saxon and whatever. I also cringed horribly at the 'anti-grav motorbike'. And as for the hacking, ok, they couldn't show what ACTUAL hacking would be like, that would bore many people. That London Riots comment felt really low, for some reason. Lastly, the Spoonhead Server Doctor felt pretty awkward to me. He goes from not being able to get past the basic system and only being able to freeze one of those robots to being able to control one flawlessly. It felt very shoehorned.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; What is being said by the argument an umbrella term that encompasses both imagined fictions and described facts within conception.

No, what is being said by Anselm's argument isn't either one of the horns of your false dilemma.

&gt; If the intention of the argument is to not make a distinction, it doesn't matter because it simply is one of these things...

No, it's not either of the horns of your false dilemma.

&gt; and if all possible meanings of a word end in unsound arguments, then appealing to the umbrella term doesn't help.

But ""all possible meanings"" of the word *don't* end in an unsound argument.  Only your two meanings do, but Anselm doesn't say either of the things you would misattribute to him.

&gt; That's not what I've said at all. I'm saying that they can be unaware of if they're describing a fact or imagining a fiction.

Which is exactly what I said you're saying... : ""you deny that anyone can ever think about something without knowing whether it exists--a possibility you explain away by saying that they've really either asserted it exists or else asserted that it's merely imaginary, but just don't know that they've done this.""

&gt; It doesn't necessarily preclude asserting or denying anything because the person engaging in these thoughts may just not be aware of which process they are engaging in.

Or indeed they may be engaged in an entirely different process, as is the case here.

&gt; Once again, they don't have to know if it exists or not, because they can be unaware of if it exists or not, but regardless of their ignorance they are doing one or the other.

No, Anselm isn't doing either, as has been explained.

&gt; And this fact of reality changes the nature of your mental process.

So retrocausality then?  But surely that's insane.  When I look in the box and see a cat, surely we all agree that there's no occult mental process that travels back in time and was the cause of what I imagined in the past.  Then surely we all agree that that your position comes down to this is sufficient illustration of its bankruptcy.

But faced with the objection that you've given a false dilemma, you seem to simply repeat the false dilemma over and over again.  Naturally, my response every time you repeat your false dilemma will be to object that it's a false dilemma.  At a certain point this will start to look like a pointless exercise, so I hope there's something you can say here other than to repeat the false dilemma as if I haven't already objected to it repeatedly.

Because your dilemma is false, it's no defense against the charge that you've straw-manned Anselm, and because your objection is a strawman, you haven't given any compelling objection.  So this seems to me like a lot of words for a very simple point: according to you, the problem with Anselm's argument is that the first premise either asserts god's existence or else asserts that god is merely imaginary.  But the first premise doesn't do either one of those things.  So your objection is simply and straight-forwardly a strawman, and that should be the end of the matter.","1364775764"

Kids do it because they are kids. They bond over the idea that one kid is wierd and they should exclude him because they are young and not aware of the consequences what they are doing. You probably don't realise how many people actually liked you. When you mature you realise that everyone has different ways of living, ideas, backrounds, goals, etc. and move on with your life. Not everyone will like you, but there will never be such a thing as being ""the one everyone hates."" If someone dislikes you for anything that you were born with they're an asshole.

In fact, in my country over 80% of the population does.  We have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world (over 80%.)

One of the interesting things is that we essentially all the same floor-plan, which can add to the social fabric bonding us all together.

We have one of the highest GDP per capita, 2% unemployment, great school systems and one of (if not the #1) lowest crime rate in the world.  One of the reasons it's so low is that there is a cop shop on the ground from of every so many buildings.  

The cops are so respected people give them they keys to their place sometimes when they go on long vacation.

It seems to work well, but is **not socialized.**  The housing can be bought and sold on the market.  My little 3 bedroom currently is listed at about $800,000.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The answer is simple.  Congressional seats are apportioned by population instead of voting registration because in the 1780s, when the Constitution was written, most (all?) states did not have voter registration. 

Pre-registration to vote is largely a product of the post-Civil War period.  Prior to that one would simply come to the polls on election day.  In rural areas eligible voters were largely known to their neighbors; in more urban areas you could bring a witness or your paperwork with you to the polls.  As more people started voting through the middle of the 19th century corruption started leaking into elections more, and delays at the polls caused by people trying to prove their citizenship could be enormous.  So, states added registration procedures to fight these problems.

In some places prior to the Civil War a voter did not even have to be a citizen, they simply had to declare their intent to become one.

Check out Alex Keysar's ""The Right to Vote"" if you get a chance -- it explains how and why such shifts happened more fully.","1364775784"

1 Shame language detected, 2 Not true, there's lots of organized meetings as of late. How do you the UoT event came about?

&gt;It's embarrassing. Yes, feminism is (by and large) just a bunch of people infighting and shouting about things that don't matter... BUT, it wasn't always that way.** Originally, at the beginning, feminism was a well-organised force for good (surely no one here can argue against that)** and they still have that legacy which is why they get listened to. Their movement has lost its way. **We need to take advantage of that. We cannot resort to their tactics and behaviors.**

1 In fact I could. Google ""feminism + Rothschild family"" sometime. 2 I fully disagree. We should get more political and seek out new politicians who are running on a campaign platform of pro-fatherhood and pro-equality. That's what they did and that's why women have so many laws that favor them. I also have no problems with us doxxing them. They have destroyed entire **families** doing this, I say we should give them a taste of their own medicine. We simply need to use this tactic in good faith instead of going nuclear with it like they did.

**Until we can get our shit together, stop focusing on other people and BE MEN, we're never going to make the gains in society we need to.**

I'd feel better if the rice was kept in the fridge overnight, not out in the open. Indeed, the recipes I find in my cookbooks all say keep it in the fridge.

If restaurants are keeping it out in the open, they probably should be shut down...","1364775794"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","in my opinion your body was adjusting to the low levels of sugar and carbs you had been eating before keto. Two weeks is roughly the time it takes for your body to get into ketosis depending on your carb intake before starting keto. However, there is another explanation. It might simply be that you were not taking in enough electrolytes (sodium, potassium etc).  I did not face this problem, but I have read that drinking chicken broth does wonders to get rid of the headaches, and you should consume salt to ensure you get enough electrolytes.


SUMMARY: I think the problem was not blood sugar. You probably were not taking in enough electrolytes. Alternatively, and the less likely reason, is that your body was simply on its path to getting rid of the sugar addiction. The headaches would in this case, be similar to the withdrawal symptoms one gets after giving up smoking.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","This is a total aside, but people don't seem to understand the 3/5ths compromise. They say ""making black people count as less than a whole person was evil"". What is missed is that the abolitionists needed slaves to count as less than a whole person, so as to make any headway.

You see, regardless of whether slaves were counted as a person or not, they could not vote. Furthermore, even if they could have legally voted, plantation owners would have simply refused them the means or time to go to the polls. The issue was that the Southern plantation owners wanted the slaves to count as part of their region's population.

If every slave counted as a member of the population, the Southerners would have a vastly greater population than the North. As such, they would have had far more representatives than the north, and would have been able to railroad any legislation they wanted.

Meanwhile, not claiming slaves as part of the population would have allowed the Northern abolitionists to have greater legislative power, and would have likely allowed them to end slavery much sooner. However, it would have been political suicide to anyone put in office on an abolitionist platform.

The 3/5ths compromise managed to keep the South from railroading the North, and allowed the North to maintain some semblance of believing in the humanity of the slaves. It, in fact, was an important step forward, despite the ridicule it receives today.","1364775795"

"Neuropsychology","t5_2rhda","So I'd like to tell you all a story of my life. It certainly pertains to this thread.

About 3 years ago I was playing soccer. It was the first day of my senior year of high school, and the first soccer game of the year. I played defense, and at some point in the game I slide-tackled a ball away from an offending player while he was at the 18 yard box--in the middle of his shot. While I removed the ball from the path of his foot, I replaced the ball with my head. I took the full force of his shot directly into the back of my head, knocking me out for about 5-7 seconds. 

What happened after this was one of the most interesting experiences I've had in my life. I watched as, over the course of the next 15-20 minutes, I slowly went blind. It started as I went back to the bench to search for my bag (as I was being taken to the ER) and realized I couldn't find it. It quickly happened that not only was I not able to find it, I was no longer able to see or recognize numbers. Soon enough I could barely make out the outline of the bag, or the faces of anybody. Within 5 minutes, I was blind. I was completely and utterly unable to see anything, whatsoever. To me now this makes complete sense, as I was hit directly where my Occipital lobe was located, and the following 20 minutes resulted from the swelling that had followed. 

So there I was, after spending my whole life with flawless, perfect vision, completely 100% blind in a matter of about 20 minutes. I was being driven to the emergency room by my father, to whom I asked a couple of times ""am I going to be blind forever? Am I ever going to be able to see again?""  He's told me later that that was one of the single most terrifying moments of his life, trying to reassure me that I'd be okay. He had no idea. But this drive to the emergency room was very interesting... I was completely blind, so far as I was concerned, but my mind was still registering information.  While I was unable to see, at all, I could still know where a street sign was and even --read-- it aloud to my dad.  I could not SEE the street sign, in-so-far as vision is concerned, but clearly some other part of my mind was still registering information.  

So there we went, driving the way to the emergency room. I held my sanity by reading off signs and trying to register as much information as I possibly could, to convince myself I wasn't going to be permanently blind. 

At the end of this all, I ended up being blind for about three and a half to four hours. They gave me plenty of anti-inflammatory drugs which helped, and I slowly regained my vision to a state where it was mostly back to normal.  Sadly enough, I retained permanent damage from that concussion.  Sentences are now slightly harder for me to form, my word recall is worse. My vision is odd at this point, in a way that's hard to describe. 

All I can say is that I'm happy I've regained my vision, although this odd experience of seeing my brain interact in a completely different fashion from normal was quite intriguing to undergo.  The mind is a pretty incredible thing.","1364775806"

The ""previous Liberal government"" tried to save the Canadian  submariner program by purchasing what were the best non-nuclear submarines available, on the advice of DND, who vetted the craft and signed off.

But the subs were duds. So if you want to point fingers, point them at DND, not at the people who diverted money away from much more worthy social programs, to weapons systems they were told by DND we had to have for Canada's security.

Ever since General De Chastelain left, it's been one catastrophe after another. Upper management at DND appear to consistently get it wrong. The subs, Rwanda, Iraq, armor, helicopters, heavy lift, fighter jets, arctic vessels...

"Reprap","t5_2qq91","I did not use anything other than eyeball for current adjustment, as in, no computations, other than I pointed my heat temperature laser gun at the motors and sampled operational temperatures until it was mostly satisfactory. The heat reader gun was being sold right next to the digital caliper (handy!)  Think I stopped at X/Y working at about 50 deg C.  IRC people said that's not ideal, but that I should worry if these things hit 70-80 degrees.

Not sure about linux, but kernel probably needs some way of mapping the USB connector to a /dev/(COM port). For me, in XP, I plugged the arduino in and the beep recognized a device and wanted drivers. I installed the arduino IDE and drivers folder inside it took care of the puzzle, creating a COM3 port.  I downloaded the sprinter package from github I think, edited configuration.h inside it, hit save, and in the Arduino IDE, went to file -&gt; upload.  45 seconds later, and it was done.  Think I did this adjustment/edit/upload step a dozen times. Here are my dead configuration skeletons (last line is most recent one):

    // used to make 2 calibration cubes
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 650}
    // recalibrated E to 909.0909
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 909.0909}
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 811.6883116883117}
    // accurate for 31mm and about 100.1mm, without nozzle
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 835.2037572816795}
    // lets aim for 1k, this is too spongy
    //#define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 1000}
    // try web: http://reprap.org/wiki/Triffid_Hunter%27s_Calibration_Guide
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {80, 80, 2252.944188428059, 625.7}
    // try makerfarm
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {78.7402, 78.7402, 200*8/3, 760*1.1}
    // z seemed off ---- this E = 836.  tried hot nozzle, hit 60 times, got 50mm
    // #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {78.7402, 78.7402, 2252.944188428059, 760*1.1}
    // recomputing via measurement + calculator
    #define _AXIS_STEP_PER_UNIT {78.7402, 78.7402, 2252.944188428059, 1003}

As you can see, I went 650 -&gt; 909 -&gt; 811 -&gt; 835 -&gt; 1000 -&gt; 836 -&gt; 836 -&gt; lastly **1003** for the extruder.

Best to take this one step at a time and sleep on problems. If you got all the stepper calibration done and X/Y/Z accurately reflect 50mm move in either of 3 directions, you should be accurate enough for a print.  

However, the E calibration was tricky: so many things could and did go wrong with it.  Starting from a mechanical slip (things not aligned), to a mechanical configuration slip (things not tightened) and working my way down to discovering my unique PLA's proper temperature, lowering retraction rate, and accurately. matching steps/mm for the extruder.

Something to ponder: toward the end of my calibration days, I realized that I was barking up the wrong trees. My printer was calibrated well enough, but I kept trying to print downloaded projects which I didn't fully understand. So the ""malfunctioning"" prints I basically identified as false positives- errors when the error was in the design.  Worse yet, I didn't understand the print settings to make these designs try to work better. After a night of good sleep, I realized that I was ready and should just start with simple solid objects.  Solution was to reduce speeds (including retraction to 10mms, thanks to spacexcula), increase perimeters and pay attention to the object.

Hang in there, and best of luck. Be patient: there's a rational reason why something is inconsistent.","1364775807"

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","1. I am JP (a very distinct name, I'm sure people I know who are on /r/teenagers will stalk my account, now), I am 15 and from North Texas (wut wut guns ftw)

2. If money were not an object, I'd either play all the guitars of famous guitarists or spend my life with the girl I still love (even after I became ""just friends"".)

3. There are way too many things in the past that are crazy. The lightest of the list is that I've drunken my pee.

4. Hmm. I don't have a song that *describes* it, but I definitely like to wake up to ""My Body"" by Young the Giant, because it's just so *mmph* and *pow* and inspiring and such.

5. I want to visit New York, after hours of playing GTA IV. I just want to see how similar they are.

6. I'd like to visit Ireland if I had a plane ticket. Because I'm Irish.

7. Fuck Pepsi, that shit tastes weird. My grandparents always had packs of Cokes whenever I visited, and those were quite the stuff. The only downside is it makes your teeth feel like they got splashed with acid.

8. I keep my desk very organized at home, and I even built myself a poor man's cupholder in the drawer so I could pull it in and out whenever I play my games and take a sip of whatever. At school? Damn, I get stress itches cause it's way too unorganized.

9. Dogs. Man, the only pets I've had in my 15 year lifetime were dogs. They're loyal and they got a personality. All cats do are sneak around you and hiss at you. Screw them.

10. I usually like to be early, it's better than on time, most of the time. Plus, I have to go to school where my mom is a teacher, and she get's up *early.*

11. I read the Lightning Thief in 4th grade for summer reading, and I got hooked to the series. It was like Harry Potter to me.

12. Well, I have been told by some attractive females of my age that I look like a younger Logan Lerman (which I think is a good thing,) so maybe him for my later years. But shit, I dunno. I don't look similar to most people.

13. Dang it, CLEAN JOKE. My life *depends* on inappropriate jokes. Well, time to *dust* off my act. Get it? I made that up just now, don't screw with me.

14. I started loving it as a kid, still love it. Sushi. I can eat it everyday. But that would be called obesity.

15. My number 1 played song is Under Cover of Darkness by The Strokes. I can't understand what he's saying, but man, it's catchy.

16. My favorite quote is ""I just blue myself,"" Tobias Funke. Arrested Development is the shit.

17. My favorite indoor activity is something that I don't want girls to know about. My second favorite, though, is guitar. I'm currently learning to play Classical Gas by Mason Williams, and it's hard. My favorite outdoor activity is biking. That feeling of wind in your face as you speed down a beautiful hill is just *mmmph!*

18. I hate folding clothes. It just feels so long but it takes 5 minutes in reality. Man, I just wish wrinkly clothes looked good.

19. Like I said above, my favorite form of exercise is biking. *Mmmph mmph.*

20. My favorite time of the day is 5 o'clock. The sun is almost down but still out, and I go biking around that time. My favorite day of the week is Friday, of course. My favorite month of the year is October. It's when my favorite season, fall, starts, and it's my birth month. Oh, and Halloween, too.

21. My least favorite mode of transportation is train. It's just absolutely *revolting*! It's positively *disgusting*!

22. There is a sound many guys love that I love too, but like I said, a girl I know may see this, and it would be offensive to them * sexual moaning * , wait what? I mean, sensible phoning. I love when girls call me on the phone. Just kidding, but I do love the sound of popping joints. Ugh, that *feel!* *Mmmph!*

23. If there was any scene I could paint a picture of, it would be of my neighborhood. The houses are sort of old, but really nice, and they look over some ponds and trees with a lot of nature around it. It's like a suburban garden.

24. If there's any age I want to stay forever, I want to stay 6. I was so happy at that age, I still had innocence, and I didn't really care about anything. Heck, I'd stay generally a *kid* forever.

25. If the world were ending January 1st of next year, I'd be as great of a friend with all my friends I don't talk to enough. I treat my friends like shit.

26. I'd pick Michael Bluth as my mentor. I don't know why, I guess I'm just a great fan of Arrested Development and he's a pretty hard-working, smart guy.

27. If I could witness any past event, I'd actually witness my 15th birthday, although it is a personal event. That night was amazing. It was my birthday, my brother's last show before he left for the Air Force, I kept my role in my play, and most importantly, I met the girl I've been in love with for the past half-year. She doesn't talk to me anymore, but I still remember that night. I did introduce her to Reddit. I hope she sees this.

28. If I could learn to do anything, it would be to seduce any girl I know. Or simply how to get the girl I like back.

29. If I could work on one project the entire year, I'd execute my film idea. It's a fake documentary (sort of like Project X or Paranormal Activity) documenting behind the scenes of a slasher-movie, sort of like Psycho. It mainly follows the person in the role of the killer. He decides to learn his part using method acting, but he gets so much in character that he starts to kill people behind the scenes. Eventually, in the end, he kills everyone on set, including the person filming the documentary, steals the camera, and takes it to his hideout. He accidentally leaves it filming as the cops break in and arrest him, then a cop confiscates it, shuts it off, and *the end*. Yes, I want to be a filmmaker.

30. I'd jump off the Grand Canyon if I were immortal for a day.

31. If I were to change my first name, I'd change it to Jack. My real name is John, but I don't know, Jack sounds so cool. (By the way, JP stands for John Patrick.)

32. I would meet Chris Farley, basically my role model for acting. He was such a funny man. It's a shame he had to go.

33. I would go buy fast food if I won the lottery. Food before anything.

34. Man, I'd be reincarnated as an ice cream sandwich. Do you see how fucking badass that is? It's a mother fucking ice cream sandwich. Everyone loves sticking an ice cream sandwich in their mouth.

35. If I could get the answer to any question, it would be ""Which girls think about me or do stuff beyond that?""

36. I would be freaking John Marston. He's as badass as an ice cream sandwich. He's tough as hell, too.

37. I don't get mistaken for a celebrity, but like I said earlier, girls have told me I look like Logan Lerman.

38. I want to be either a director or a lead singer for a popular band when I grow up.

39. I usually play guitar in my free time. Or do the thing that most guys do that I don't want to say (because of possible girls that I know on Reddit.)

40. I'd name my autobiography ""JP: There's no fucking explanation to his estranged mind.""

41. Some songs in my soundtrack of life are ""Blood"" by Middle East,  and ""First Day of My Life"" by Bright Eyes. The first because it reminds me of my grandfather, and the second because the girl I liked and I pretty much had that as our favorite love song without even knowing each other.

42. No, a picture isn't worth a thousand words. You can't fucking read a picture without looking like a dumbass. Just saying.

43. Where's Waldo? Fuck, I saw him in the car next to me the other day, but who knows where he went.

44. The best part to waking up is knowing this day will be different from the rest. Save it up.

45. Well, I don't like being brown. And I ain't even brown *or* a cow.

46. Nothing much, just chillin' and finally freaking finishing this stupid list of questions.

Well, that's me. If you know me, give me a call and tell me you saw me. If you want to know me, I can PM you my number. If you don't want to know me, fuck off. Anyways, so long, and thank you for your time.","1364775809"

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","seriously, it's a matter of health and safety and that's it. If you think your anxiety might come in the way of driving and might cause an accident then you are just being a responsible adult if you decide not to drive. Deal with your anxiety, take as much time as you need, then think about technicalities, like getting a driver's license. I understand that it's annoying and an inconvenience, but so are other things. Your health and the health of other people is more important. I do have a driving license, but only ever drive when I KNOW anxiety isn't gonna hit me suddenly. Otherwise it could be a real risk factor. My family also pressured me into getting a license, now it just seems like a waste of money. There are more important things in life. 

People might disagree with this, but let's for a minute compare it with epilepsy. For people suffering from it there's a real chance that they might have an attack. If it is under control they can drive, if not they are not allowed (at least I think). For me, having a panic ATTACK is also very unpredictable and I can't just get over it or something.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;You people take it way too far. Nobody is taking your guns away.

What this ban is trying to take away is adding different aesthetic features to otherwise legal guns.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/GpWqIch.jpg) is a picture of a woman who would lose her gun and her sport due to the ban.  The vast majority of these weapons are used by law abiding citizens for lawful purposes.

&gt;That is the Sole intent of those type of weapons.

Wrong.  They are widely used in sport shooting and hunting.  That is the primary purpose.  

The AR15 is the most cited ""assault weapon"" (probably because it is the most popular) but is one of the most light weight, accurate, low recoil guns available which makes it ideal for hunting/sport shooting.

Further, in the most deadly school shooting in the US (Virginia Tech) ""assault weapons"" were not used.  Neither were they used in the Coumbine shooting.

Even 1 death is too many, I agree.  Why are we focusing so much on preventing 1%?  Why not try to enact legislation that will affect 100%?

This ""assault weapon"" ban is frivolous at best.  It does not solve anything and takes away the rights of so many.

Finally, [this FBI report](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-11) shows that in 2011 there were 323 murders with any type of rifle compared to 496 with a hammer or club and 1694 with knives.  ""Assault weapons"" aren't the problem.

Clearly we have differing views and we wont change each other's opinion and that is fine.  But that is one of the great things about living in a country like the USA.  We can all have our opinions and voice them in public forums.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;it was highly scripted and not dynamic at all. if you shoot at a building reload the scene and do it again the destruction will be the same the debris will be the same the building will react the same.

No, that's not true. I'm talking about the original Red Faction which had completely, 100% real-time and dynamic destruction. I've been doing level design for RF1 for years and know exactly how those levels are set up and how geomod is managed and it's entirely dynamic. You can just set regions to *not* be destructible to avoid players digging their way into a void or other gameplay issues. It was *not* limited to ""buildings"", you could, for example, dig an entire tunnel, freely from one side of a level to the other. The only limits were artificially set (probably for RAM reasons and added polygons) and explosion stopped creating holes after maybe 100 or so explosions (don't know the exact number) but that was enough to *seriously* alter the environment.

I don't need this to be done with much logic/photorealism, either. It would be a great idea for an indie shooter with rather simplistic graphics but *tons* of destructibility, taking advantage of modern hardware.","1364775819"

We run to either renaissance or viking here in Ansteorra, it seems, so drinking horns are good, too.  You just can't put one down without emptying it. They make a holding strap of leather and keep them on their belts when not in use. Mostly people seem to get tankards at thrift stores or garage sales but there are several sources online.  I have not bought one so I cannot tell you which sources are good.  My ceramic cup is pretty sturdy and has survived well with only a few chips.  It is a thick slipware thing bought from a local merchant.  As far as research, check out Karen Larsdatters site. She collects pictures along themes and posts the source links on her site.  She has a surprising range of subjects related to the middle ages.  This is her [list of merchants](http://www.larsdatter.com/feastgear6.htm) but take the time to explore the rest of the site. 

edit: to finish answering the questions.   I lose silverware fairly regularly so I usually go with my belt knife and a spoon.  Some day I would like one like those found on the Mary Rose but for now any old spoon will do.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The source I list below shows mothers as abusers in 64% of cases.  I looked up how many children are raised by single mothers, single fathers, and both parents, and found that if you assume that each child is equally likely to be abused by each of their caregivers, 59% to 62% of child abuse would be perpetrated by women and 39% to 41% would be perpetrated by men.  (The equations are nonlinear resulting on a +/- 1.5% when considering a rate of abuse per parent between 1% and 50%).

Now, I found a source that put children as being 1.7 to 2 times as likely to be abused by single parents, and properly taking this into account results in a figure ranging from 61% to 64% of children abused by mothers and 36% to 39% of children abused by fathers.

So basically, with a simple analysis we can see that the 64% figure is basically compatible with the idea that single mothers and single fathers abuse their children at the same rate and that married parents also abuse their children at the same rate simply by considering who is raising the children.  

This is still great news - we want to dispel myths about mothers more effective parents than fathers without not spreading new false rumors that mothers are less effective parents.

Source for 64% figure:  http://www.americanvalues.org/pdfs/researchbrief7.pdf

EDIT: I made a mistake with the likelihood of being abused by single parents vs married parents which changed the adjusted range from 62%-66% to 61%-64%, and I corrected it above.  Also, keep in mind that the higher figure is more likely to be accurate, if I was being less conservative I'd put it at 63%-64%.

EDIT2:  It looks like 64% is dead on accurate - according to the source I list below, 1 out of every 58 children is abused, which works out to almost exactly a 1% chance that a married parent as an individual would be likely to abuse their child.  And a child raised by married parents would be 1.99% likely to be abused (2*rate-rate^2), and a child raised by a single parent would be 4.04% likely to be abused.  This 1% statistic corresponds with my upper bound estimate at 64% of women would be abusers if women and men in similar circumstances are equally likely to abuse children.

I forgot how much I love probability and statistics.","1364775833"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Years ago working a sales job making house calls to retirees, a colleague and I sat on an appointment with a lovely early-retirement couple (early 50s) in Vero Beach, FL.  This was a gated beachfront community, and the acre of land the house was built on was probably worth 7 figures alone, not to mention the 4000+ sf house and huge pool, etc.  So, the guy basically had no need for what we were selling, but we sat and made small talk and drank iced tea for a bit since it was on our appointment calendar.  We discuss what he did before retiring, his daughter enrolled at the U of Florida, and other chit-chat.

As we're sitting, with myself and my colleague facing the beach and the couple across from us facing the house, a young female (who I'm assuming was the aforementioned daughter) stands up into view.  She'd been hidden by the sand dunes, but when she stood up I could see her from the knees up, and she had clearly been tanning nude as she had nothing on but a sheen of sweat and lotion.  She wasn't supermodel gorgeous, but she was definitely attractive and had a shapely body.  She stretched and made her way casually down to the water (which I also couldn't see) in a comical bobbing-step like someone pretending to be on an escalator while actually behind a couch, then returned in a similar manner a brief time later, now dripping wet.  After stretching again, she laid back down and disappeared from view.

Her parents had no clue we saw anything.  It was all I could do to not react and try not to stare.  My partner saw her too and it was all we could talk about the rest of the day.","1364775835"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was just accepted to medical school for the class of 2017. Given that I can't say if it will be worth it or not but its sad to hear you've heard so much negativity around the profession. With any profession you will have to hear the pros and cons but for myself I have had an overwhelming experience hearing the pros. This isn't a job for the weak hearted or minded and that's a personal question your going to ask yourself. The system is flawed not broken and its going to take dedicated and emotionally invested health care workers from doctors to PAs to nurses to make a change. You've experienced the hospital and most likely only scratched the surface of the social, economic, and political issues that surround this field. I hope this question brings some information and opinions to the surface for yourself but ultimately this answer lies within you and I hope you find it before you've gone to far. Outside the unsettling reality of drug seekers, non-compliant patients and the fact shit rolls downhill in hospitals, I am welcoming my future with open arms and unyielding excitement. For those eager to quell my desire to be a doctor by telling me I don't know the half of it and I'm naive ill stop you there, I very aware of the pressures and frustration that await me but its all worth it knowing I've found the comfort in a job I love and am passionate about.

It's a mind fuck. The after effects I probably still deal with on some level.

It makes perfect sense to me.

Whatever else he's done, Assange leaked those cables, and whatever else he could, because he wanted to make the world a better place. See justice done, and stuff like this.

Many people, including myself, think that our democracy is broken - that the invasion of Iraq, for instance, was illegal.

You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to think what I've just said.

I suppose conspiracy theorists are going to desire leaked secrets and they're going to adulate someone who ""stands up"" for freedom by leaking state secrets.

Nevertheless, Assange was previously a hero to plenty of people - to plenty of people who think that the invasion of Iraq was illegal, that think governments do nefarious things all the time, and that it's wrong that they get away with it.

So there's cognitive dissonance to all those people if they accept that he did the crime - he can't be an hero and a rapist both at the same time!

Add to that the date-rape element of this - that it's ""not real rape"" and that the Swedish charge isn't actually rape (or is something like ""second degree rape"" or something) - and you have a perfect recipe for public denial. ","1364775851"

People also fail to realize what the Iron Dome is; a way to field test technologies that are crucial to the next generation of foreign weaponry. Effective, fieldable missile interception is a massive hurdle, and starting small with intercepting medium range missiles aimed at our ally is a mid-point step to designing a system to intercept Chinese-made  anti-ship ballistic missiles, aka ""Carrier-killers"". It should be noted that there is currently no working defense against these, and without one the US navy would be extremely vulnerable in a protracted fight in the South China Sea.

It should also be noted that most foreign aid to Israel isn't just money handed over in a briefcase. It is aid that is attached with a guarantee to purchase military and defense aid from the US.

Trust me, I'm autistic. Give ways to write and I can make it very clear what I feel... Ask me in person and I blank out. The psychopath feels very little besides their own satisfaction. They have no moral boundaries, remorse or anything. The likeliness there is a link between your Aspergers, your antisocial tendencies and your appreciation of a socially ostracizing styles of music and you going on a rampage are very thin.

From the comments: ""For everyone that was calculating the costs of running the computer, a quick googling found the commercial electricity rate for Los Alamos, NM is only 6.13cents/kW. Using that it would ""only"" cost $1.2 million to power the system 24/7 for a year. Probably have to triple that in reality to include lighting, A/C, and whatnots.""

Okay, why is it more efficient to disconnect something that cost $120M when it only costs $4M (tops) to run it after only 4 years of using it?  Looking at a lifespan of 10 years (optimistic, I know), and assuming you can get the same computing power for 1/3 of the price and 1/4 of the yearly cost, you'll end up paying a total of $40M up front and $1M per year, with a final bill of $50M compared to keeping it running for a final cost of $40M.

Also the katana wasn't really a weapon of war, usually it was spears and arrows all the way when they actually fought. It was more a mark of nobility and wealth that you had one.

Every friend I ever made between 1985-2000, I haven't seen them in a decade. Not even Facebook friends.My closest friends are guys/girls I met (beginning) in the year 2001, start of 12th Grade. Shit that happened after 2001, I remember like it was yesterday. What time, what the temperature was, ambient sounds, the wallpaper, the gas prices, the big movie that came out that month, the new CD I was planning to get...in immense detail.Everything prior to that is like a distant memory, like it happened to someone else and I read it in a book. Surprisingly, I also think of my life in terms of pre/post-9/11, but not for reasons most people would say.It didn't affect me personally but it's a good point of reference that quickly separates my my mostly innocent childhood and my teenage rebellion and complete personality change.","1364775870"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I believe that a number of gay people do this not to ""put on"" a voice but to make themselves visible. If you belong to one of the many other special interest groups out there, chances are you are quite visible. You're black, or female, or whatever. But being gay is invisible unless someone is really paying attention. 

So I propose to you the notion that the ""gay voice"" and other mannerisms associated with gay culture are not an affectation but instead a public declaration. 

Some people really need to do that. They may have come out of a very conservative background, or had a personal struggle with accepting their sexual orientation. I suspect many of them are just really happy to have a group to belong to, and so adopt the culture of that group (much in the way people who get into heavy metal suddenly break out in black jeans and spiked wristbands). Anecdotally speaking, I know at least one gay person who ""acts gay' specifically to remind the hetronormative majority that gays exist. I think it's safe to assume at least a few others think that way too.

+1, or +2 means that is the number of phases for memory power delivery.

For instance, 6+2 is 6 CPU phases, 2 Memory phases.

More phases means better regulation, meaning power delivered is more consistent, meaning with higher overclocks your overclocks will be more stable. Electrolytic Capacitors and higher quality Chokes also help achieve a similar effect.","1364775881"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be perfectly honest with you, I couldn't care less what your income is, what certifications you have, or how old you are.  YOU and the school of thought that people like YOU carry is what fuels misinformation regarding nutrition.

Body shape has nothing to do with weight.  This isn't even relevant to the conversation.  We were discussing WEIGHT.  I'm not even going to take the time to respond to that, as it is utterly irrelevant.

(EDIT: of course body weight has to do with shape.  What I meant was you saying ""age+hereditary=body shape"" has nothing to do with the argument of weight loss/gain. Apologies for the misunderstanding.)

Moving onto weight, what is this magical age that you are certain exists?  Am I going to one day wake up, as a 43.25 year old man and just realize, ""Well, shit, this is the day that my weight is completely out of my control now!!""

No, this is absolutely bullshit.  You do not break the law of thermodynamics and neither do the ""thousands"" (referencing your other posts) of other people that seemingly hit this magical age.

CALORIES IN is less than CALORIES OUT is. all. it. takes.  Do low carb, do low fat, weight lift, walk in circles 8 hours a day, do whatever the hell you want, actually, as long as your calories are less than you burn in a day and you will lose weight.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Gamestop, i worked at one of the bigger gamestops here in Oslo, i got the job through a friend who was quiting the job to work in his father's restaurant, so i accepted the job and started working. Management was horrible, there were many days when i was the only one working there, so heading out for lunch or toilet was impossible, so i had to pack a lunch before going to work, and if i needed to take a shit i had to hold it in for several hours, generally pretty bad. But the worst thing was all the nasty costumers dropping by and asking me idiotic questions i never thought i would get asked. The gamestop also had a lounge, with a fancy couch and an xbox connected to a 50"" flat screen, so people could play games on it before buying it, this one time, this huge ass fedora wearing fella walked in with his girlfriend who looked like a mix of the ""gingers have souls"" dude and Rebel Wilson, at first they were hanging out just looking at different games and kissing each other, at one point he started rubbing her tits and vagina, i was of course disgusted, but i didnt want to talk to them, it was 20 minutes before closing time, so i started gathering all the change and so forth, and getting ready to close the shop, he then comes up to me and asks me where he can find ""Hunted: The Demons Forge"" i looked it up in the system and told him that we had 3 used copies somewhere on the shelf, and he told me to find it for him, but i was kinda busy counting the money, but i couldnt say no, so i went over and looked for it, after 5-10 minutes of looking i found it, he then asked me if he could try the game in the lounge, i said that it was a pretty bad time since i was about to close. He told me he would only play for 10 minutes to see if the game was any good, so i popped the game in and gave him the controller. He started playing, when i finished counting the money i put them in the safe and went over to make him leave since i wanted to catch the bus home, he said that he was still playing and told me that he would finish any second, so i started turning of the lights and went for a quick piss, when i came back, he was making out with his girlfriend on the couch and had his fucking hand inside her pants, it was fucking disgusting. I clapped my hands and told them to leave the store he didnt respond his girlfriend looked at me with a irritating smile, so i told them that if they didnt leave i would call the police, they stopped and he took the game out of the xbox and told me that he wanted to buy it, i told him that it was to late and that i closed the register and bank terminal. He looked at me like i was fucking dickhead and threw the game at me and walked out with his girlfriend, i was so pissed, i srsly wanted to go out and kick the shit out of him. The morning after i come to work, and find my boss there. He told me that he received a complaint from that dude, and that the guy wanted me fired for bad service, my blood started boiling and i almost blacked out, i told him to check the recordings from last night, he did and, we reported it to the police, those fuckers were fined.

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","If you can rationalize from several hundred perspectives you would be look up to as a Philosopher, If you could write past the barrier of reality and observe the meaning of your zeitgeist writers would consider you intelligent, If you could memorize abstract concepts apply them and teach them while being nothing but objective scientists would appreciate your skills. they all have their own take on intelligence so there is really no point trying to conquer the idea itself since  you never will and nobody really does.

To me, In the real world intelligence means prudence, there is no great idea of intelligence but several ways to be wise. 

More importantly it is the ability to act appropriately no matter where  you are to get the best out every scenario. If you are not a scientist, writer or philosopher... if you are a cashier, then you can be intelligent from that point too, you can make you career progress from that very point, you can learn about people and life, and learn the kicks of the business. There always ways to get the best out of everything. Eventually you can move to something bigger if you so do desire and act appropriately (proper upscale planning). 

But In order to do so you need to be conscious, organized, objective and mentally stable. Ambitious, patient and focused. All without forgetting your close ones who you are supposed to care of (in reciprocity of course). 

Intelligence is about balance and clarity. 

I don't believe in idolizing others, or even caring if others are more naturally talented. Or if they were praised by genius from square one. Yes, anatomically speaking some may be benefited more than the average in some ways, but whats the freaking point of measuring  ourselves against others as if it would make any difference? Poor self perspective its a greater disadvantage to carry than the advantages renown people have. 

It's all about being individualistic and accepting your position in the world so you can be objective enough to make plausible clear goals and projects,  aim at them and at least attempt to be wherever the hell you want to be.

I just want to underline. That being patient, hard working, keeping your perspective clean, organized and hard work can almost always 100% of the times better your situation in life. But those virtues are all skills of their own that need to be learned and polished over time.","1364775887"

"technology","t5_2qh16","There are a lot of caveats to how you define ""distance"" here. It can get pretty complicated. For example, sometimes the ""cost"" incurred by the traveler is not the amount of distance traveled but the amount of money it would take to fly him there.

I don't even need to get so creative. If you're only allowed to pass through the city A once, then imagine A-city is surrounded by a really large wall. Going from C to A to B would be 6 miles then, but if you go B to C *without going through A* you'll have to go all around the wall, or through a particularly twisty tunnel, and the distance you'd have to travel would end up longer. 

Hope that makes sense. More broadly, though, in the computer science application, the ""costs of travel"" can be a wide variety of things and they don't necessarily have to follow easy definitions of distance.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","A 6th degree polynomial will be of the form `[;y=a(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)...(x-b_6);]`. We know that 3 of the b values will match up as well, since there's a repeated root. That means we can rewrite it as `[;y=a(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)(x-b_4)^3;]`. Since all the roots are real we also know that each b is real. From the acting like -5x^6 we also know that a=5. The last condition is that we have y(0)=3. This creates another condition, which we can find by substituting in x=0.

Doing so gives us: `[;3=-5(-b_1)(-b_2)(-b_3)(-b_4)^3;]` which is a condition on the values of b we can choose. It's also important to make note that all the values of b must be distinct from each other, otherwise you'll get extra repeated roots.

Sure, the probability that a Fukashima type event is very, very low but the consequences are devastating. I don't see it as a smart choice in the future. I'm open to the idea of Thorium reactors, which China and India are pursuing, but I don't think we should be building any more conventional reactors here.

"gamegrumps","t5_2ulfu","Jon's point about Samus is incredibly simple and I have no idea why Arin, who is an intelligent guy, couldn't seem to understand it: *her gender has no bearing on her character* (excepting lolOther M). 

Think of it this way: when you consider Mario, do you view him as a good protagonist, or as a good *male* protagonist? Most of us will probably say the former -- other than maybe rescuing a damsel in distress for kisses and cake, his gender doesn't play a role in the story in any meaningful way. The same can be said of Samus. 

There are plenty of strong female protagonists and have been in video games for a long while. Terra. Celes. Jill. Lyn. Even more obscure stuff like Asha from Monster World IV. There's plenty of silly sexualization that demeans women (Bayonetta being a prime example, ""ironic"" or not), but there are *so many* similar cases for males. The dumb, lumbering soldier, the shallow smooth-talker and womanizer, etc. are all extremely common tropes. Finally, it's worth mentioning that video games are a largely male-dominated area, so having male protagonists makes market sense if nothing else. 

**tl;dr** Jon's point is that Samus' gender doesn't add to her character in early games. There are shallow, stereotypical female characters just like there are shallow, stereotypical male characters. Why only questionable depictions of women in gaming gets talked about is something I'll never understand. ","1364775894"

I always hated them for doing that, so I befriended her and defended her from the others without her knowing that. Some years later she turned to be the most beautiful girl in the class and she had a lot of friends at that moment.

people dont abandon the dollar because they are forced to, by law and with the threat of violent imprisonment, pay their taxes in it. And oil is also exclusively traded in Fed Reserve Notes. *edit* if there was any legal alternative for the payment of taxes, (like MTN Hours, or a complementary currency as espoused by [Bernard Leitar](http://www.lietaer.com/) or a Government issued debt free currency as espoused by [Bill Still](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Still) The Federal Reserve Note would be forced to be sound and not the current state of fuckery.

when i can pay my taxes in bitcoin, ill consider incorporating it into my portfolio. As it is, i see no value in adopting it whatsoever since i dont buy drugs or hire hitmen on deep web. anything else can be bought with regular money online. Bitcoin is nothing but a novelty and is nothing consequential, it is not even close to being a solution to the current money creation system. Which is fine, so long as its fans dont circle jerk like their fighting the system or threatening the power base of the establishment or being revolutionary in any shape sense or fashion. 

Im not hating on bitcoin, im hating on the people who want to proselytize and convince people to trade their hard earned promissory notes we are forced to pay taxes with, trade their blood sweat and tears for fucking bitcoins. If your wealthy and want to dabble in bitcoin market and stuff thats fine, but there should be no rhetoric arguing for it to be a replacement to the current system. It is not a suitable replacement, as there are plenty of alternatives to the debt money system that we should be focusing our efforts in raising awareness.","1364775898"

2.  You assumed that pure democracy will always result in slavery, genocide, and persecution.  It won't - not necessarily - since even purely democratic systems have checks and balances.

Neither Inception nor The Dark Knight really impressed me. Both entertained me for a couple hours, but I wasn't blown away.

"Neuropsychology","t5_2rhda","I went untreated for severe anxiety and depression because I was convinced I could fix it myself. Symptoms worsened until I snapped. 

Depression symptoms were the usual: loss of appetite. Insomnia. Crying every night without a reason. Feeling hopeless. Wanting to disappear. That turned into wishing I was dead, which turned into suicidal ideation. When I hit rock bottom, I couldn't function. No point in showering. No point in eating. No point in even getting out of bed. No point in leaving the house. No point in going to school even though I had paid $5k to be there that year. No will to do anything. 

The not-so-obvious things were: difficulties with memory recall. Reading comprehension began to lower - I had to read things 2 times instead of one to make sure I got everything, in the beginning. I had trouble focusing, where I used to be able to focus on a task in a busy, loud room full of people without a problem (library, cafeteria, cafe).

schmeiser saved his seeds and replanted for 40 years. with 60% of his crop contaminated he had no choice but to either replant seeds with the RR trait or not plant anything... or pay monsanto for licensing rights to seeds that contaminated his field in 1997. there was no other choice he had. would you have schmeiser destroy all of his crops and lose all of his annual income due to contamination?

See the way computer chips are made it works more or less in this format. Human design machine A, with Aid of Machine A we build Machine B, which is then used to Make C, C is used to make D. Now D is so complex, so mind bogglingly complex we barely understand it. 

D is used to make the chips, which are another order of magnitude above D. And thus even far more complex.

Sure we have the blueprints and the logic gates, but to truly understand this stuff, you REALLY gotta work your brain at that level. Most everyone does not, we merely follow preconceptions and so some minor innovations on the design.

The easiest way to understand what I am talking about is Seed AI. This relatively simple AI make a more complex one, and that another more complex, and so on until the level becomes so complex that we no longer understand or recognize the design at a human level. 

Actually I am finding trying to explain this rather hard, it basically means it gets progressively more complex every level. Chips are very, very complex machines.

I would rather set the bar high. People who are motivated by justice will be motivated to set the bar for rationality and fairness at a high level -- that simply follows logically. Such people will seek to make logical arguments from first principles. People who are not so motivated will either set the bar at the level of their opponents or will claim that they are somehow justified in abandoning rationality and fairness.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Here is the reason they don't want to make that point. 

Once you teach someone who's played FPS games how to properly hold a rifle, they are usually pretty good shots and have a very good time. Concepts like leading your target are already something you understand. 

They want to argue that there is NO transfer of skills between video games and firing guns, and that simply isn't true. Gamers generally do better once they get the fundamentals down like a consistent stance, because they already know how to hit a target.

It would open an avenue of argument that could undermine their point. Better to go with the emotional ploy, and expect people who can see their bullshit for bullshit, to be smart enough to realize violent video games really don't make school shooters.

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","The attachments are what's taking up the space, the com.apple.MobileSMS cache is just so Messages.app loads faster. (I think, not sure.) The problem with clearing the SMS Attachments folder is that if you can't figure out what folders are being used, and wrong ones get deleted, you could have problems if you ever want to see the attachment. NOW. If you take the SMS.db and find a way to scan it, the text you receive in the message will actually be the pat of the image. (If that makes sense.) basically when you get a message it'll save the attachment but in the message contents it has the path where the image is stored. It'll then load that image. If no image, nothing will load. So you'd need to scan SMS.db and use the findings to rule out the folders currently being used. I believe I was first to find the bug in 6.0 beta 1 back when it came out and I have looked pretty far into it and ways of clearing the cache on non-jailbroken phones, but I have no experience in coding for the iPhone really, so creating a tweak for this has been rather impossible. I've approached several well known developers and none have answered me. If you have anymore questions, I could probably answer them.

"Favors","t5_2re6a","Yes, it is a must, as it is used in 95% of all programming... Plus, it will make your life easier.

The best way to describe it is through an analogy. Imagine you want to customize a laptop. You start off with a model, which provides a template and set of rules for how you can customize your machine. You can chose the options that best fit your needs, but no matter what options you pick, you always have the same options available to you (RAM, screen, HDD, etc...). Your machine is based off the options available to that model. When you begin to customize your computer, all the options and settings are blank (you didn't select anything yet).

This is exactly how object oriented programming works, the language is just different. The model is referred to as a **class**, which describes an **object** (computer) in terms of what **properties** (customizable options) are available.  This is a key part of understanding OOP: the **class** is simply an empty template; it doesn't contain any specifics. In order to customize your computer, you create a unique setup based off the base model. However, customizing your laptop doesn't change anything about the base model. The next time you customize a machine, you start off from the same blank template. In programming, when you want to create a unique copy of an object, this is call **instantiation** or creating an **instance** of a **class**. This **instance** is a unique copy of the **class** that you can change properties on without effecting the template or other copies.

**EXAMPLE**

**Class**: Computer
Name
RAM
Screen
HDD


**Instance** Computer 1
Name: macwiz1220's Laptop
RAM: 8GB
Screen: 14.1""
HDD: 128 GB

**Instance** Computer 2
Name: Snoo
RAM: 16 GB
Screen: 24""
HDD: 1 TB


Notice how each instance follows the same exact format and template of the class, but the values are different.

It gets more complicated than this, so if you have this down, we can go a little further and explain the other major concept of OOP: inheritance.","1364775928"

Shine a desk lamp of the side of your face that is visible in the mirror, ensuring that it illuminates your entire face. Now, turn your head to look away from the mirror. Notice how this stretches the skin that is visible in the mirror, removing wrinkles.

Move the desk lamp such that the majority of your face visible in the mirror is in shade, but a bit is in direct light. Now, without moving your body look directly at the mirror, you will note that this increases how wrinkled your face and neck are, the parts that are visible in the mirror that is.

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Thank you so very much for taking the time and trouble to share this information. 

I have a fairly good handle on the options that are available. One of the things that makes it particularly difficult is that mom is completely bedridden due to crippling arthritis. She cannot stand or walk at all, and has both a cathater and colostomy (from a previous, unrelated surgery). It makes taking her to any type of day-care facility pretty much impossible, as she cannot get in or out of a wheelchair, and needs to be transported by ambulance.

Also, she is relatively lucid most of the time, but strangers in the house tend to really upset her and leave her extremely agitated for days thereafter. It makes taking advantage of in-home respite care.

However, she tends to go to sleep for the evening around 8 PM like clockwork and, at least for now, usually has no episodes of wakefulness or major confusion during the night time hours. My children are 17 and 19 now, and always insist that I get out of the house one evening every few weeks or so to visit with friends, go out for a late dinner, etc. So I do have an opportunity to just get out and unwind when I need one.

We used home hospice for my father when he was in the final stages of cancer, and they were incredible. If at some point I am having too much trouble with things like bathing her, etc., I will definitely be turning to them again in the future.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to share this information with me. It was a truly lovely thing for you to have done. ","1364775932"

I'd assume it changes between many medicines. It's also possible that the ""name brands"" that owners find in stores are from the cheapest manufacturer but marked up ridiculously high.

I think growing up in the US does automatically predispose someone to a different view of time, in part because in daily life we don't encounter landmarks from a very long time ago. There's very very little recorded history in the Americas older than 5 centuries. Many people living in Europe live in relatively close proximity to things like castles or monasteries or what have you which were built several centuries ago. With [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Castle) or [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_Castle) or [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London) in the middle of your town, one is almost forced to view 1776 as being recent. In the US, apart from Boston/Philadelphia/a few other East Coast cities, there's very little architecture that's even from the 18th century, and almost none from the 17th. Many states barely had Europeans in them at all prior to the 1800s. American schoolchildren often have US history classes which start in the 1770s, and before then there's sort of a gulf between that and a vaguely imagined medieval period with knights and castles.","1364775935"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The way it's supposed to work is students should be placed in the lest restrictive environment possible.  At the school I worked at (junior high school), there were several different levels to this.  There was the completely isolated room for those with the most disabilities.  They worked with a special education instructor and several aides.  

Some students would spend part of their time in this kind of classroom and part of their time in a regular classroom.  They would attend a regular class (usual something like art or PE) with an aide (sometimes a student) and could stay as long as they weren't distracting the other students.

All of my special ed students in my regular class (humanities) also attended a academic support class.  Mostly this was homework help as well as life skills.  These students had largely the same assignments, just usually shorter.  They were also allowed extra time and a quiet environment to take tests.

There was also a humanities block that was co-taught by the regular humanities teacher and the special education teacher.  This block had more of the special education students and sometimes a slightly different curriculum.

I also had a few students that were still on special plans (called 504s).  These students usually did all the regular assignments without modifications, but might have other special accommodations.  This was usually priority seating (near the front, or by the teacher).  Some of these were also in place for students with medical issues in case of flare ups (one student needed to be able to use the bathroom whenever he needed to).

**TL;DR if done properly, special education should be done in many different layers depending on the needs of the child.  Funding and people are what usually make this impossible.**","1364775943"

Only the one has to be a multiple of 3 and the remaining one just to have an option left to choose a nice looking solution.

f = -5(x-a)^(2)(x-b)(x-z)(x-c)(x-z*)

with z* being the complex conjugate of z.

y-intercept means y(0) = 3 so

3 = -5(a^(2))(b)(c)(z)(z*)

choosing z=i for simplicity, so zz* = z^2 = 1

make it even more simple, a = 1

3 = -5bc

now maybe: b = -1/5

3 = c

so

y = -5(x-1)^(2)(x+1/5)(x-3)(x-i)(x+i)

that would be one possible polynom that satisfies the 5 conditions.","1364775946"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Firstly, the usual disclaimer, I'm all for gay marriage. I'm repeating a view other than my own.

The position of the Catholic Church is not against gay people, its against gay sex. The Catholic Church is against sex before marriage, and their definition of marriage requires a man and woman. This means that sex between two people of the same gender is a sin in their eyes.

In theory, if two Catholic men or two Catholic women wanted to live together in love, as celibate people, they would not be doing anything wrong. This is discouraged because its a situation of extreme temptation, but in theory, it would not be a sin.

Every Catholic person, Priest, Sister, Brother or in fact the one Bishop I have spoken to in regard to homosexuality is extremely accepting of gay people. They didn't look at ""practicing"" gay people as any worse than anyone else engaging in sex before marriage. Granted, I lived in one of the most liberal regions for Catholics in the world. Still, I never heard anything I found offensive out of them, I've never heard it said that a gay person is intrinsically bad or worse than anyone else. ","1364775950"

"arduino","t5_2qknj","you can run them at any voltage above their rating(with a dropper resistor). What happens is that when you apply voltage to the led, it will do all it can do keep it at that voltage. if you apply voltage lower than it's rating, it will simply do nothing, if you apply voltage higher than it's rated(without a resistor) then the led will conduct as much as it possibly can to try to keep the voltage at it's rating until it dies. If you do have a series resistor, then the led will drop it's rated voltage, and all the rest of the voltage will get dropped by the series resistor. So let's take a typical circuit, 5V supply, a standard 2V led, and a 220ohm resistor. So the led will drop 2V and the resistor will drop 3V(since 5-2 is 3). Doing ohms law, 3/220=0.0136 which is 13.6mA. There will be 13.6mA going through the resistor and led. Lets say it's a 3.2V led. Then 5-3.2=1.8. 1.8V/220=0.008 which is 8mA. Typically you want to run an led at around 5-20mA. You can run them lower and higher, running them lower won't hurt them but may not be visible, running them higher can kill them so you need to check the ratings. If you run 3.3V to the led, and it's rated for 2V, then without a resistor it will die. So to calculate a proper value resistor take the difference and device by desired current. So 3.3-2=1.3. 1.3V/0.01(10mA) =130ohms. However running a 220ohm would be just fine as well, it simply won't be as bright. For the 3.2V leds running a 3.3V supply may be a bit tricky. why? because the resistor you need is going to be a stupidly low value. 3.3-3.2=0.1. 0.1V/0.01mA=10ohms. This would be the proper way to do it but you may be able to run the 3.2V led on 3.3V just fine depending how much current they will draw. So yes running a supply voltage closer to the led rating means you won't waste as much energy by the dropper resistor, but running it so close may cause other problems if you don't know how to deal with them.

There are other ways to do it as well by driving a transistor and using its beta to control the current flow but we won't go into that.","1364775959"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Architecture changes are already responsible for almost all of the improvements in computing power in the last couple years. We hit a wall in sheer power (ie. heat) / unit area, which rendered the usual ""design the chip to run at a higher frequency"" paradigm (which had driven the majority of performance increases for a long time beforehand) basically useless.

This triggered a shift towards improving parallelization, at every level. Instead of making the cycles faster, do more each cycle. This will likely continue to be the dominant paradigm for a while.

The advances in manufacturing processes at this point enable increased parallelization through the ability to put more on a die, but this has to be balanced with the inherent increase in power density as the features become smaller (this restricts clock rates in most cases).

Once it is set the camera does adjust the aperture automatically, but I have found that when in liveview it won't change the aperture unless it is set/turned off/turned on. If the shutter is triggered, the live view turns of/on and the new aperture is shown. This is good for stills, but not for video.

With the kit lens that came with it the aperture is automatic and easy to use, but I still have to turn liveview off and on to get it to accept any change in aperture when recording video.

I do have a question though.  Do two wrongs make a right?  If fornication is a sin and homosexuality is a sin, then is it not one less sin to have married homosexuals rather than fornicating homosexuals?

I also would like to point out that moving to Canada to escape gay marriage would be a bit counter-productive, as Canada has recognized gay marriages nationwide since 2005.  I don't see any evidence that their society is in a moral decline.","1364775962"

Don't let 'love' destroy your religion and your hereafter. Rather, separate yourself from her and the situation in general. She'll find someone else and you'll always have Allah (Subhana Wa Tala) and His Prophet (Sallalahu Alayhi Wassalam). I'm the worst culprit in terms of sins but I can say this: improving one's relationship with them through salat and salawat is more worthwhile in the long term. ","1364775963"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The point was that 83% of applicants have clinical. Of those, 40% get accepted to one medical school. Not having any clinical puts you in the bottom 17% of a pool that has the average applicant rejected from every school they apply to. Is that a position you want to be in? 

And other EC is less necessary to be certain, but clinical is pretty important. This is from talking to adcoms in California and Virginia, but I expect it is pretty similar across the state.

"politics","t5_2cneq","While I agree with you that good lawyers can (and should be able to) pick things up and learn as they go, most lawyers tend to pick a practice area and become experts in it. There's no use in being a jack of all trades because you can't differentiate yourself that way and won't be as good an advocate because learning the tips and tricks to be a great attorney in X field only comes from experience doing that kind of law. 

I don't know what various AGs' hiring policies used to be, but currently, the AG in my state is hiring ~5 people into their honors program and it is nearly impossible to get one of those slots. The DOJ is in a hiring freeze and is not taking any more interns for summer 2013. I don't know the state of the current DOJ hiring program for their new attorneys honors program, but you can bet that it is on the list of possible things to be cut as a result of sequestration. 

Your plaintiff's side securities attorney friend learned on the job and that is admirable, but it is in general difficult to get hired anywhere without a demonstrated interest in the subject area that you are applying for. Also, your friend could have gotten the job for a variety of reasons which could work together such as (1) having high grades which justified the pf's side firm taking a chance on teaching him/her the ropes (2) having a history of plaintiff side/public interest work so that the firm felt confident that your friend would stick around and maybe already have demonstrated litigation experience.

I think your analysis of why BigLaw poaches successful government attorneys is spot on. But the reason why successful government attorneys leave likely is more complicated than just money. For example, bureaucracy and red tape can drive any ambitious, Type A person up the wall. Or a different political party has taken over the White House and they do not  want to execute the policies of the new party in power. I don't doubt that the money is a huge factor, but it's never just the money when you are a top notch attorney.","1364775964"

I played high school football with a guy that almost the exact same thing happened to him, it was pretty tragic. But nonetheless his leg healed fine and to give you a timeframe, he broke his leg in mid august and was playing full speed in the second half of the basketball season starting around mid january. Even better, he went on to accept a scholarship to play division 2 football.  It will be a tough recovery but is by no means career ending.","1364775964"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; So If I understand 1 Corinthians 6:9 correctly, idolaters, adulterers and the sexually immoral (who gets to decide that?) should also not be allowed to marry, right?

The verse doesn't say anything about rights to marry, and I consider that a secondary issue. It's just saying that these things are morally wrong. Idolatry, adultery, and sexual immorality are wrong. The way I understand it, the sexual immorality term, (the greek word is Porneia) is a way of generalizing the sexuality laws given in Leviticus

And yes, Romans 1 is a history lesson, not a commandment, but it does tell us that homosexuality is still immoral. The tense is one that we don't have in English, and so while it's in past tense, it is implied that it is still happening. It's a way of explaining why some people are still immoral. ","1364775965"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Because most 'Jews' have no ethnic ties to Israel. For example: Eastern European Jews. Are they Israeli? They're Jewish so they are given the citizenship. But did they're forefathers live there? Most were probably converted at one stage in their lineage. 

Think of it this way: What if the world decided to take Italy away from the Italians and formally make it a Catholic state? Would you believe that Ethiopians, Argentinians, Americans, Irish, and so on have the same right, as a native Italian, to have patriotic ties to Italy? Does just being Catholic give one the right to claim they are the rightful heirs of the Italian Peninsula and even the right to challenge native Italians for control of it?

I'm all for native Israeli Jews for having patriotic ties to Israel. They have a right to be proud of their heritage. However, I do not think any people should be given the 'divine right' of citizenship of an area of which they have no ties, besides it being the birth region of the religion that they follow.
