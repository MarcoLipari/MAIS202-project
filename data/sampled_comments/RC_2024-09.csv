"dividends","t5_2qsbv","23M, paid a decent salary but I'd like to retire as early as possible. Looking to inject cash of about $150-$300 into my portfolio every month.

My portfolio makeup looks like the following:

G - 23%, NKE - 19.6%, KR - 17.2%, ALG - 10.9%, ENCH:CA - 8%, CNR:CA - 7%, GCG:CA - 7%, NTES - 4.7%, ACN - 3.4%

(I rounded up/down here and there)

I've done some reading and all these companies seem to fit a dividend growth 'compounding machine' investing mindset. They're all companies that grow dividends at > 10% a year, have been growing dividends for (at the VERY least) 5 years, are companies with clean earnings profiles (i.e barring COVID years, are companies that have been increasing revenues year over year), and are all low in debt.

I read that concentrating your portfolio into a handful of companies is a good way to make outsized returns, and I seem to have made a good judgement call with the companies I chose to concentrate much of my money into - they've all gone up and pretty much in the order I've bought them in. That being said, I think I've under-performed against SPY, though I've only owned these companies for about 1.5 months.

Also, I purchased shares in all these companies during times when the dividend yield was much higher than its 5 year average. I think that's a good signal that a company might be undervalued. That being said, my portfolio is actually lacking somewhat in yield - only about 2.7%, but the dividend growth rate of the portfolio is about 16%. I don't have a single stock with a dividend growth rate of less than 8%, I think.

I'm just looking for some advice and criticism. Make it harsh, I need to learn. It's better if I make mistakes now while I'm young, rather than when I'm old.

inb4 SCHD/SCHG : I've thought about it. But I'd like to try my hand at picking stocks before resorting to buying into an index.",1725148800.0
"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Notice how you focused on one specific thing I said that was presented in a larger context as a way of further avoiding the confrontation with your own views that you would need to engage in if you truly responded to what I said. You also projected a view onto me that I don't espouse as a form of attack. These are further indications of attachment to views and a defense mechanism when they are challenged. At this point, we could entirely forget the refusal to answer, and the analysis would be the same. 

As I explained, the issue is not the refusal to answer itself, it's what appears to be driving the refusal. I made certain to use the words ""seems"" and ""indicates"" to ensure that I wasn't presenting this as absolute fact, as it's not possible for me to truly gauge your intentions. 

I am assuming you do not think that you are on the same level as the Buddha. Refusing to say that the cessation of a psychotic delusion is a less obfuscated view of reality than a psychotic delusion is not the same as the Buddha refusing to answer whether there is a self or not because it would be misunderstood or refusing to say that actors go to hell because it would be painful for the actor to hear. 

I think it's pretty clear that we both agree that non-psychotic delusion is less obfuscation than psychotic delusion. Saying you won't admit this because it would make me appear correct is why I said it appears to be based in clinging to views. If you were to admit that in this specific instance the medication led to *less* obfuscation, even if not *complete eradication* of obfuscation, it would ultimately challenge the view that medication is inherently obfuscative. To me, it appears that's the reason you didn't answer.

But of course maybe I'm wrong. 

Anyway, be well.",1725148800.0

But the medication has made it much easier to progress in therapy. My therapist’s approach is more CBT. But, I am going to start seeing a therapist who does parts work and IFS work to help me really work on the trauma. Now that I’m much more regulated, I’m ready to dig in.

All the same stuff I described above except Viserion wasn't taken by the Night King because they didn't do the stupid trip over the wall.

Night King toots his horn to bring down the wall.  Word travels.  The white walkers start taking over the north inch by inch.  Dany hears of the wall falling and the whitewalkers coming and decides in her deluded state that killing them will make everyone love her.  Whatever is left of her army and her travel north at haste but arrive to watch Winterfell... Fall.  The survivors and the army are pushed back to Moat Cailin.  They learn Jon is a Targ there from Howland.  He rides Viserion, Dany rides Drogon.  

Dragonbinder is tooted, they lose Viserion and assume they lose Jon.  Dany is in despair watching everyone die.  Drogon is mortally wounded fighting Viserion, Viserion dies.  The Red Priestess starts whispering about how the ultimate sacrifice would save them all.  Dany eventually succumbs to the idea and stabs herself.  In a cheesy TV moment, Jon pulls the sword from her and it lights on fire.  Prince that was promised etc.  He stabs the Red Priestess with the sword first, you know, just to test it out.

Arya and her wolf army fights along side of Jon, protecting him to get him to the night king.  She could have some cool battles with the generals that aren't Anime stupid shit but instead water dancing.  Jon gets to the Night King, they fight and the night king dies of course and Ghost at some point saves Jon and you think he's dead but he isn't because he's a good boy.

Bran ends up on the throne but not in a physical form but in a spiritual form, sending visions to whomever is on the throne or something.  I don't think he's leaving the north north.  Not sure who actually physically would end up on the throne but maybe Gendry since Dany was stupid enough to name him Baratheon.  

Arya marries Gendry, doesn't sail off the side of the planet, so she is now queen trading places with where Sansa originally started.  Sansa can still get Winterfell and Jon, being the shell of a living man, goes with the Wildlings back north with Ghost.  Bran is in a tree somewhere.

I tried planning outings but I’m not the one with money so I can’t really plan to go places (full time college and high school student so no job). Any time I ask them to set aside time at home to do things with me they use that time to do things on their own.

1) GR1 Heritage 26L w/ QAP in Dark Oak + DFNDR Level IIIA Handgun Rated Backpack Armor 10.5x16.5 low profile. Hoping to sell together. Asking $500 

- great condition. used for office & travel. Zero issues with zippers, straps, threads, etc. 

2) Pair of Sand Kettlebells, black, 44lbs. Asking $100. 

- barely used but stored in garage. No issues with condition. 
- probably goes without saying but local pickup can keep the sand, otherwise have to dump sand before shipping.",1725148804.0

Personally I still find it problematic that you have an issue with it, but you let your opinion be known before she decided to take that job.  She then took the job without telling she did, at this point, I'm totally in your court.  A relationship is supposed to be a partnership, when she joked about getting a job as a stripper and you told her how much the idea bothered you, she seemed to agree getting one was a bad idea.

The way I see it, she told you she wouldn't do it to placate you, which makes things worse.  She needed the money, and I get that. Also, she very well may be honest in seeing it as just a job to her.  Personally, I think it's fucked up that university students need to take jobs they otherwise wouldn't in order to make ends meet just so that they can get an education.

So, no, to summarize, I made a snap judgement, but after reading your full post, you're NTA.  She's a dishonest jerk for lying to you and the system is an asshole to saddle her with debt and expenses that require her to take a dodgy job make ends me.",1725148804.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Nothing. I don't think it would have the effect you may be thinking of.  

Let me explain:  

Growing up my parents taught me a variety of things. At the time I ""got"" what I was being taught. I understood things to the best of my abilities.  

Yet, and this is the important part, I didn't have the *life experiences* to see the bigger picture!  

I got what they were teaching me. Yet it was only much later in life as an adult that I got a glimpse into the lives of other people that I experienced a much deeper appreciation of what I had been taught.  

Think of experience as fitting more pieces into a jigsaw and you stepping back a little bit more. You see a bit more of the picture. Each time you gain more experience you add another piece to the puzzle and see a bit more of the bigger picture.  

Telling my younger self things would be just part of the process. Without the experience that information would be incomplete.  

It would be just the same if my future self travelled back in time to today and told me something. It would only be part of that process. I would lack the experience to appreciate it.  

Throughout life we may be presented by opportunities to gain that experience. We have to recognise them and learn from them.  

Learning is a never ending process. That's how I look at it.  

Sometimes we look back and think we were wrong, or didn't fully understand something. Then in years to come we do the same again. We look back and think we didn't fully understand something. And so on...",1725148805.0

If 25 babies died in my care in that timeframe you'd have to send me to a mental health ward. 


I'm going to go with the NICU nurse when they say these sudden deaths are not statistically insignificant. Generally in this field we defend our colleagues from these sorts of accusations because we know what it's like to do everything right and still lose the patient.

"TheMoneyGuy","t5_4mra67","Haven’t seen this mentioned yet but it also really depends on the internal expense ratios of the 401k plan that you’re in and how good the fund choices are… 

Great article by Nick Miguilli on this if you google his name and max out 401k. He explains in the article that the percent gain (all things equal in both accounts) that the tax benefit only equates to .73%.. which in his example amounts to 114,000 extra in the 401k after long term investing (30 yr period I believe).. BUT it also means that if the ER in your 401k is higher than that (a lot of plans have ER’s in the 1.5-2% range) then it negates the tax advantages of that account. You’d have more money in the brokerage at the end and have more flexibility to use the money before 59 1/2 should you want to. 

All a long term tax game and really depends on the costs of the plan. Ideally you would do both and and have Roth covered to have 3 buckets to control your taxes in retirement. 

I’ve heard the money guys say there’s nothing wrong with a Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage. Still shoot for 25%.",1725148806.0

OK .... please take this as constructive criticism .   
One of my pet hates is how these circuits are constructed. Literally, they are rat nest waiting for errors.   
This is not your fault it how the circuits are designed - I mean thrown together.   
There is some really dodgy soldering.   
If you have the time I would start this whole circuit again.   
  
Be patient and take your time and never accept a solder joint that you feel is ugly. Redo it   
  
Tools required   
A good solder paste   
Soldering Iron   
Side cutters   
Wire strippers   
And a good quality solder paste   
Magnifying glass .... yes I am being that pedantic.   
Small file or coarse wet rub   
Some cleaning alcohol   
Solder Wick  ---- this is your savoir.   


I refer you to what is a good and what is a bad solder joint

Draw a diagram of how your pots are wired up - label cables etc   
Remove all wires.   
  
Then do the following

How to clean your guitar pots

The best way to wire strip is to use a tool that is for that purpose.   
In the event that you don't have a wire stripper a sharp utility knife will do   
[https://www.instructables.com/How-to-strip-the-shielding-off-of-a-small-wire/](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-strip-the-shielding-off-of-a-small-wire/)

Clean the bare wire  with alcohol to remove any oils... your fingers are oily.   
[https://www.instructables.com/Strip-and-Tin-Wires-Like-a-Pro/](https://www.instructables.com/Strip-and-Tin-Wires-Like-a-Pro/)

Once this process is done you can methodically go ahead and rewire your pots. 

If you question a solder joint because it looks ugly or it is not smooth and shiny use your solder wick braid and remove the solder and start again.   
[https://youtu.be/htrcZuK\_ZsY](https://youtu.be/htrcZuK_ZsY)

By the way .... I would also inspect the guitar jack and redo the soldering there as well. 

The time and effort put into the soldering is well worth the reward.   
Once you have done a excellent job on the wiring you will never have to question that your guitar is the source of the issues.",1725148806.0

"naturalbodybuilding","t5_2vx10","Your experience & the physical sensation of each one should tell you if there's any difference between the two. I wouldn't try to guess the differences on a machine I haven't actually used. 

When you know what to look for, you can analyse yourself how two different exercises differ. On a freeweight, it's gonna be hardest when the joint which the muscle is responsible for moving is going directly against gravity. A barbell hip thrust is hardest at the top because your hips move in an arcing motion when you thrust - the start of the ROM you're coming up but also moving your hips forward, (plus you may have a little stretch reflex you can benefit from), but near the top you're moving almost perfectly up, directly opposite to gravity. PLUS, the muscle is naturally a bit weaker at the short position as a rule, so even if you did a machine which had you apply equal force throughout the whole ROM, it's gonna be slightly harder at the top due to this. 

On a machine, look at the angle of the pieces of metal that move when you lift the weight. When the angle is parallel to the floor, perpendicular to gravity, you have to apply the most force to move it there, whereas when it's more angled, more vertical, less force is needed. A hip thrust machine where the bars are about parallel at the bottom of the lift, & as you do a rep they get more vertical, that's fantastic. It biases the lengthened position, which is super important for growth, & it compensates for us being naturally a bit weaker in the peak contraction. 

Take a look at the hip thrust machine & the angles of the bars that move when you lift the weight. You should also be able to physically sense if it's harder at a certain part of the ROM compared to barbell. Unless a real moron designed the machine & they made it even harder at the top than the freeweight version already contains, then I'd potentially opt for the machine version. Same reason why I opt for Tbar rows over barbell rows, or barbell/dumbbell/smith pressing over a hammerstrength press which gets harder as you get closer to lockout.",1725148807.0

"cats","t5_2qhta","It is totally fine. I feel like a lot of people think that soaking the tick before removal is the way to go. One can absolutely remove a tick safely at home, just don't soak it in anything. 

In general, don't touch the tick with your bare hands if possible. Don't squeeze the tick while it is still attached (it may increase the risk of infection). Don't soak it in anything (alcohol, nail polish, dish soap etc.). Don't do anything to make it ""back out"". All of those methods don't really work and just increase the chancesof getting infected.

And under no circumstances should you try to remove the tick with your hands/fingers. It is better to wait a little until you have access to tweezers or tick removal gadgets. Don't worry, the chances of getting infected by the tick is pretty low if it gets removed during the first 24-36 hours after attachment. 

To remove the tick use tweezers or the tick removal gadget. Grasp the tick as close to the surface of the skin as possible and gently (but steady) pull it upwards (don't twist it). After removal disinfect the area and dispose of the tick safely (don't crush it with your bare hands). 

If the head/mouth part of the tick breaks of in the removal process, don't panic. The head/mouth part on it's own is not contentious and cannot transmit the Lyme disease. Let the head/mouth be. It will eventually become dry and fall out on it's own. Or you can try to carefully remove it (like a splinter).",1725148807.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When my lil' guy (childhood cat) was getting on in age, he was on the line of ""not suffering but not really doing well either"" for years. He was diabetic and lethargic, kindof dirty all the time, mostly slept, ate, and shat. But the vets kept saying as far as we can tell he's not in any pain, the diabetes is managed well, etc etc etc

We agonized over whether it was time for a few years. All we wanted was a sign - from him, from the vet, anyone. Someone or something to finally tell us definitively ""he is just fine"" or ""it's time to let go"". We finally got a vet (we went to a clinic that was shared by multiple vets, idk if that's normal) who said, ""Hey, cats aren't meant to live like this. It's true he's not in pain and he's not suffering, but it's likely he's not happy. Cats are fastidious - if he's given up on cleaning himself, he's given up"". 

I was living away by that time, so I went home for a week, we pampered him, fed him as much of all of his favourite foods as he would eat, I slept on the floor with him by his food bowls every night (he seldom left that spot except to go to the litter box), and then we brought him in, said our goodbyes, and sat with him while he passed.

That vet did a tremendous service to him and to us in a time where we felt entirely helpless.

I'm sure it's brutal to do it over and over and over again, but for those of us with pets, you're a godsend. Thank you for what you do. All we want is the best for our little dudes.",1725148808.0

We see Frida pulling someone out and I assumed it was Sara because she had been tied up, but the big reveal was that it was Slater. I thought it was so bizarre watching Frida just hand Slater the knife then sit on her hands for no reason as Sara is about to he killed. Frida wanted Sara to die because, I have to assume, Sara would be so fucking not cool with Slater not facing more direct punishment. The reason that pan out shot revealing she saved Slater goes so hard because I think we are meant to infer she left Sara to die. Frida says ""I knew I forgot something."" The joke being she ""forgot"" Sara in the fire. Like the look on her face when she looks over to see Sara is one of kind of genuine surprise. And the interaction feels too bizarre to be real.

Again, please tell me I am a silly man, but thematically it fits. Geena Davis' character also chooses to benefit from her situation, albeit in a different way, which is why her confrontation with Frida heavily involves a mirror. The women in peril band together when it is for their best interest, but the second they can get a leg up, it turns out we all suck.

# How to verify?

Please send the following to us via a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/cock): A post that has at least 2 colour photos of you, one with your penis soft and one hard. Hold a sign that includes the following:

- Your Reddit username.
- The date that matches the date the message was submitted.
- The name of this subreddit.
- The paper must be slightly crumpled and straightened but still readable.

**IMPORTANT**

- Tell us your Flair preference. Choose between Cut/Uncut + Tiny/Small/Average/Large/Extra Large.
- You have to clearly and entirely show your penis. 
- We will not accept your verification and you will be asked to resubmit if your paper is not crumpled (this means wadding your paper up or folding it and then unwadding it or unfolding it).
- NO pictures in the dark Your photos need to be well lit so that we can actually see them.
- Low quality photos will not be approved. 
- Do not use any filters.
- If you're having issues uploading to Reddit, trying using an alternative host like Vidble.com, Redgifs.com, or any from [this list](https://reddit.com/r/SubredditRegulator/wiki/index/approved-hosts/). Do not use Imgur as they don't allow NSFW content any more.
- Upload an album, make it private, then paste the direct album link (or 3 direct image links) into a message to the mod team. Please do not message any of the moderators privately via direct message or chat, use only modmail (the link above). If you have trouble with uploading the image, you can choose to upload it to another host of your choice.

Remember to check out our [Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/cock/about/rules) as well.

"ExperiencedDevs","t5_e0gez","As someone who has bounced around backend and frontend for around a decade.  I honestly think it makes more sense on the frontend, at least conceptually.  Not saying it's the best option but it's at least applicable.


You have unavoidable state on the frontend:  OOP embraces state and attempts to handle it with a divide-and-conquer approach.  Some frameworks feel more natural than others for that style (Angular for instance) but that's mostly because of the idioms and patterns recommended.


Most backends are written as stateless APIs these days or some kind of collection of cloud functions.  In practice I think it's clear now OOP doesn't really give you much of anything in this arena.  Even in Java where I've been working on and off for my while career and where OOP is like a religion, the frameworks (mostly I mean Spring Boot) tend to give you opinionated boxes to put your code in (mostly Singleton services and the like).  The actual code you write tends to be kind of procedural unless you just want to be fancy / feel smart.  


A large minority of devs in Java land pretty much only embrace OOP in name only.  Very little inheritance, very few custom abstractions, thin domain models that do not contain any business logic at all, looks at dogmatic things like DRY, SRP, or SSoT, more as tradeoffs that should be considered alongside other things (dev velocity, readability, performance, etc).  Not afraid of long procedural style methods, but does try to limit the places in code where things like I/O and side effects can happen.


Basically, they write code kinda like Go devs but have to do in it a way Java will let them.",1725148809.0

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","It depends.

Since dream games are often larger in scale, and hold much more content than your typical small projects, I highly advise you get a basic understanding of programming like a Senior Developer. This doesn't mean having knowledge so much as having a way of thinking about how you will set your code up to be able to scale. 

 [This video](https://youtu.be/jwCW446hoPk?si=cdChStK_z2hVSveT) offers an insight into that kind of thinking by way of example. Replace the idea of a ""Book"" here with its  properties of ""author"" and other methods with anything that is an abstract idea for a over arching class. Like an ""Enemy"" or an ""Item"" for video games. 

This is so important and its devastatingly understated in typical gamedev tutorials BUT, 

###OPEN FOR EXTENSION CLOSED FOR MODIFICATION

Seriously. Learn about Orthogonal Design and the principles of making code scalable and modular. Indie devs wanting to make their dream game come true NEED this ability to set up early frameworks and systems for future selves to actually be able to complete their game within their lifetime. 

Unless you manually want to code everything from the ground up. 

Understand how to identify areas in which interfaces are necessary, like when you are repeating the same kinds of logic more than once or twice. 

Making decisions that a senior dev would even if you dont fully know how to get that point.  

The Blackbox method is a great way to imagine tackling new problems. Where before you write a single line of code, you come up with abstract logic systems. This layer of abstraction allows us to break massive problems down to smaller and more manageable ones. You cannot bog yourself down with bad code architecture, unless you plan on burning yourself out of completing your game because your bashing your head through walls just to get code to do what you want.",1725148810.0

Ben was DRAGGED THOUGH THE MUD after he won, he was public enemy #1 on the island, and sorta became public enemy #1 after the game too, dispite him just playing the cards he was given (and while those cards may be questionable, that isnt the fault of Ben)

He knew he wasnt playing a winning game, remember these are winners, and they are very aware of the social dynamics and how the game is going, this isnt an example of poor social awareness. So instead of being dragged to F3 and get roasted by the jury, he saw it more fit to just join the jury and contribute to the winner

I'm not saying i LIKE it, but i do understand it, this time, he made relationships and built camaraderie, a very stark contrast to his first season where he was constantly the target and had very few solid relationships.

He got his bag, this time he made the memories, and i love that for him

(not to mention I dont think Ben miraculously slamming on the gas F7 onward makes the season any better tbh, I think the Sarah/Tony FMC climax beats out anything that Ben could've done to change the season at that point)",1725148811.0

"democrats","t5_2qn70","> It’s okay to change. It’s okay to receive new information and form a different opinion of someone or something. 

But in this case it's not.  It's the sunk costs fallacy.  Every time they justified one of his outrageous actions they took on moral debt.  

They could have abandoned him when he called all immigrants criminals, but they didn't.  They could have abandoned him when he talked about grabbing women by the pussy, but they didn't.  They could have abandoned him when he made fun of a disabled journalist, but they didn't.  *AND* they would have had to admit they were wrong about the immigrants thing and the pussy thing.

Every step of the way they could either admit to all their moral debt and admit they were monsters, or they could just turn a blind eye and take on a little more moral debt.  Each lie accepted was a tiny little step deeper, but made turning back that much more impossible.

Eventually you've driven your kids away and your wife has left you, but you can't just say ""my bad"" at that point.  It's easier to just dig a tiny bit deeper.  They could have changed back in 2016.  But with each successive lie they became more and more complicit, and now there is absolutely no turning back.",1725148812.0

"abusiverelationships","t5_2ua08","As someone who works in healthcare with a specialty in Domestic and Family Violence who regularly screens, refers and has lived experience, this is absolutely domestic violence.

Like everyone else has said, this includes emotional abuse and coercive control through the use of threats ""if you do X I'll have to do X"". He's gaslighting you. If he genuinely wanted to discuss the issue he would provide his alleged evidence. He's doing this to mess with your perception and attempt to exert control over the situation.

Perpetrators of domestic violence will typically attempt to establish themselves as the only source of truth and correctness by acting in ways that cause the person theyre perpetrating against to question themselves and their perception of reality and generate a sense of dependence on the perpetrator, and this is exactly what he's trying to do.

Please do not entertain him, and if you feel you are safe to discuss this further I'd be happy to help you figure out some support networks that are suitable for you if you feel that would be beneficial for you.

We will review your following post in accordance with our rules as we want to prevent an unexpected Redditor from spiraling or send them to the ER: Hi. I'm a 21 years old woman and I've been having mild headaches and neck stiffnes everyday for almost 8 months now and eventually got spinal stiffnes as well and occasional nausea and diarrhea. I plan to finally go visit doctor once my health insurance is sorted out - it'll probably take around a month or 2. Since the symptoms won't go away, I'm worrying more and more it's something dangerous - even started worrying about having a brain tumor, chronic meningitis, etc. I don't know what to do, it's keeping me up at night and I can't stop worrying about it. Is there anyone that was in the same situation and how did it work out at the end? I'll be so grateful for anyone that takes their time and responds and I apologize for any possible grammatical mistakes since english isn't my first language.

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","**If you missed the full set of required built request questions, please copy them from here and answer them in an edit to your post:**

- New build or upgrade? 

- Existing parts/monitors to reuse? (List with models/links) 

- PC purpose? (Gaming, editing, etc. List apps/games) 

- Purchase country? Near Micro Center? (If you're not in a country supported by PCPartPicker, please list some local vendors) 

- Monitors needed? (Number, size, resolution, refresh rate) 

- Budget range? (Include tax considerations) 

- WiFi or wired connection? 

- Size/noise constraints? 

- Color/lighting preferences? 

- Any other specific needs?
        

**Here is some additional helpful information about build/upgrade/parts list requests:**  

- Build requests only include hardware. You are responsible for budgeting for and providing your own operating system (Windows, Linux, etc) and other software.

- Don't forget to budget for peripherals. Since these are very much personal-preference influenced items, we do not include peripherals like keyboards, mice, headsets, etc in parts lists. 

- We strongly recommend posting a build request only if you're ready to buy now or within a week or two at most. Part sales regularly rotate, and a part list today can quickly become out of date.

Also like someone as mentioned I definitely wouldn’t invest your hard earned assets into a family venture that you have basically no say in.

As someone on the outside with only the information you provided here, it’s plain to see that your friendship ended as you knew it around the time she went off to college. 

Naturally (and to no fault of your own), you held on to your friendship with the same regard as when you were kids but she moved on and was not kind enough to be upfront with you about it (this is why I said you were assuming instead of communicating; she clearly wasn’t going to since in her head your friendship was downgraded to associate). Given how she’s acting as if she didn’t pretty much kick sand in your eyes, I’d said it best to move on from her. Cherish the times you’ve had and accept that your friendship is over. 

You deserve people in your life who keep you as a priority and respect your feelings and your ‘ship (be it friendship or relationship). You shouldn’t have to beg or chase people for their time, attention, and affection.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Maybe the question is just not meaningful, because the word ""growing"" suggests that only one party is ""active"" in that process.

Say you  ""grow a plant"". What do people mean by this? They refer to you putting seeds into fertile earth and then constantly provide resources, mainly water. Your active part is to plant the seeds and provide resources at intervals, this is ""you growing the plant"". At the same time, the plant developed new cells and more complex structures all by itself, it used the resources provided all by itself, so from that perspective, ""the plant grows itself"".

Essentially it just boils down to, ""things are happening simultaneously and the end result is a human"". Trying to assign a primary entity and a secondary one is simply not meaningful, if anything it misrepresents this relationship. Seed is provided via sex (usually), then the mother's body generates resources to be used by the child. All while the child uses resources to develop. Neither is in the driver's seat.",1725148815.0

"MurderDrones","t5_4o056g","Ok so sorry, I never saw the notification of your  reply (wasn’t ignoring you, it just simply never popped up. yay thxs Reddit, so reliable). 

Ok so things being as they are. The finale is only just over a week old, it’s not like the wound isn’t fresh. The horse is still kicking and it isn’t dead yet. 

It’s inevitable that this was going to happen (the finale being what it was or actually being good). It was the end and there are going to be many posts about that… It’s just part of being a community. People talk or complain about the most relevant thing the most. 

Also, people don’t need to “get over it” on your time table. They’ll get over it when they feel good and ready to. Everyone takes any event that happens in their life differently, if you don’t want to be part of it, the best thing you can do is ignore it. And I’m not trying to be an asshole, but this is a you problem. You can either engage with the posts, or ignore them. But you’re not going to stop them.

I don’t see how any of these posts have been pathetic, maybe annoying to you and others who enjoyed the finale, but I don’t see why it’s pathetic? The show ended on for many people not the best note, and with something that a lot of people enjoyed up until that point. It feels like sort of a betrayal now I said, sort of, and feels, not that it is. 

No, I’m not going to defend the person who doxxed Liam, that was petty and uncalled for. People on the Internet are going to be horrible people sometimes, but that isn’t all of us… I for one was largely disappointed with the ending and wish for so much more (and I’m not calling for the death of the dude) 

So please don’t chalk us all in that camp, it’s unwarranted and rude.",1725148815.0

I finished the archon quest yesterday, today I did the tribal chronicle of the water tribe, and I also finished what I could from the graffiti event while doing the other things. 

I generally like doing everything close to when it comes out because the hype is still there, and because not splitting up the various quests means that the information in them is still fresh. These reasons are also why the addition of encounter points, as good as it was, led to me enjoying this game much less, because I felt ""forced"" to slow down if I wanted to skip the repetitive commissions. While I usually complete everything really quick, i still haven't explored or completed the quests of Chenyu and Petrichor, and still don't feel like it, even though Chenyu is one of the best parts of Genshin imo.

Honestly right now I'd look into something like the Seasonic Vertex 850. If you're in the US it's actually a little cheaper than their current Focus ones. The benefit is that it has a native 12vhpwr cable in addition to all the ports the focus has, and since it also has the 10-year warranty if you grade to a gpu that needs one of those cables you won't need a adapter. I'm running the 1200w model (yeah it's overkill, honestly) on a 7950x and 4090 plus custom loop setup. They're very nice PSU's, possibly the best at the price point. Remember to NOT cheap out on a PSU, whatever you do. And 850w should be a nice ""size"" for you.",1725148816.0

Of course, I also put humans over non-human animals in terms of importance, but that doesn't exactly justify torturing and killing animals for taste pleasure. If aliens twice as smart as us came to Earth and started factory farming us, we would be right in saying that just because they are superior to us, that doesn't make them justified in their actions. 

>We can argue all day whether we think it's cruel or not but the Lord never condemns the eating of animals.

The Bible doesn't condemn slavery, either, and yet we have realized that it is immoral regardless. The Garden of Eden was vegan before the fall, so even if the Bible doesn't directly condemn eating animals, it does seem to support that the most ethical diet doesn't involve animal suffering (especially in the way that we slaughter them today, such as putting pigs into gas chambers)",1725148816.0

"MeidasTouch","t5_2ugay9","Do not forget that at a recent rally, an attendee went after journalists. After years of dogwhistles from rapist don'Old trump, Sean Shitweasel Hannity, Laura ""goebbels"" Ingraham, Jesse ""sex pest"" Watters and more finally are getting the violence against real journalists they openly begged for.

This is the stochastic terrorism that the Groupies of Putin wants. No cemetery, rally, house of worship, school, or government building is safe while the Groupies of Putin control the news media. 

Journalists, while in the field, please work on your situational awareness. Editors and news room executives need to step up and protect their journalists better. Adam Mockler has been surrounded multiple times by openly hostile people. A fat rappers tiny little thug wannabes, for example, stepped up on multiple journalists recently, including Adam, on video. Ron Filipkowski and others, please create safety systems for your teams if you have not already. Fred Wellman has resources to help with training. Also help other independent news journalists who may not have the benefit of mentors in a news room. I know you all saw how amazing the creators were at the DNC.  Support each other and help them with the parts they don't know yet. So they can be safe too and keep reaching more people. 

And most of all. The Murdoch Murder Machine propaganda network needs to be constantly called out for begging for the violence and the abhorrent actions from trump himself and his Groupies of Putin. The Murdoch Murder Machine propaganda network also needs to have its public forced subsidies ended. People in the US pay them in carriage fees, cable, satellite, internet, and other fees without disclosure or permission. They take this money and openly lie to the point of 500k excess covid deaths. It is time to sue the Murdochs for endangering the public and causing death purposely. We've seen the texts. They knew better.

 The Faux Nooz/Fox News talk show hosts LARPing as journalists need to be removed from the air. Replaced with journalists like Jessica Tarlov and Marie Harf with pro journalist backgrounds and ethics. They are not even left wing they just state facts and get screamed and cackled at by the scabborous scuzzbags they have to sit with who are not journalists.

 Worse, they are made to sit with admitted sex pests like Jesse Watters, who don't just strand women by disabling their cars. He advocates for the sexual assault of a sitting vice president. He should be pulled from the air and fired. A literal sex pest Jesse Watters sitting on TV every day tricking people into violence and lying to them about anything he wants. Then he sells them boner pills. Grotesque. 

So everyone keeps your eyes open for each other. If you see your colleagues or others in unsafe situations, be the helper. And if you can't help, then go get it. Put the dam phones down and go get help.......

There's nothing worse than being nearly killed in front of people who just watch. 

No longer accept mainstream media silence. They are at risk, too. Dead First, if you listen to don'Old' as he's going to publicly execute many day one. Remember Chris Licht ran CNN straight into the Faux Nooz/Fox News territory on rapist don'Old's behalf and don'Old still can't wait to kill nearly every cnn anchor.

Chris was shown the door, and more CNN anchors now speak truth to power. It's time to let the rest do the same. No more lies and obfuscation for the Groupies of Putin. 

Time to show all of them the door that feel publishing propaganda for a 78 yr old dementia patient who worships Putin isn't beyond the pale.

Watching pro players will give you a bad impression of what the game is like for the majority of people. Most people are playing undergeared, against the odds, and struggling. Lots of people like the unfair aspect of the game because it makes it truly dynamic. There is no feeling that compares to being the naked mosin man that outplays a juiced up squad.

However, that is the goal. That is the end game, not the meat and potatoes. The core revolves around overcoming struggle and you will always struggle. If that isn't appealing to you, that's okay. Being a new player is 99% struggle and 1% success but that 1% is such a high that people will endure the 99% to find again",1725148817.0

"Ultralight","t5_2s7p2","Depends on the weather.  But if I am doing multiple days I bring three pairs of socks (two to alternate for hiking and sleep socks) and two pairs of underwear (this includes what I am wearing).  And a base layer to sleep in (either light or mid weight).  I also have a super light silk set that is basically a glorified nylon that I might bring if it is pretty warm.

After that my clothes are situational.  I generally will have an insulating layer or two (puffy and/or alpha fleece).  But I am PNW and generally high up.  If I was in the SW in summer, this would not be needed.  I also pretty much always bring my lightweight rain jacket.  It also works for wind and it is pretty light, but not great for sustained rain.  Though I have never had a problem with it.  But I have not pushed it that hard and it sometimes gets marginal reviews (OR Helium fwiw).

If it is going to be wet and cold I step up my game.  I then go to two clothes bags.  One that is Ok to get wet and one for camp.  Camp bag is my baselayer to sleep in, my puffy, sleep socks and my alpha pants (that I rarely carry).  Camp bag goes in the pack liner with my quilts.  ‘Day’ bag has hat, gloves, alpha top and probably a second light weight base layer to hike in.  Everything in this bag can get wet and still keep me warm.  Rain jacket and pants ride in an outside pocket for easy access.

But yes.  Clothes weight is not insignificant if you are being honest about the conditions you are going in to.  You can push this down by just trying to hike every second of the day and then you can skimp on warm layers.  I personally think this is a bad idea.  But people push all sorts of things I think are bad ideas.  Like I think everyone should always have a paper map and compass.  Because electronics fail for unforeseen reasons.  Like if you are going to ditch one, you should ditch your phone and keep the map.  But that is definitely not the behavior of most people out there.",1725148817.0

Just a note, you've given all your felines very canine body shapes. That deep chest and shallow pelvis look is not really cat shaped.

Their bodies also tend to be longer and their legs shorter than those of canids, especially in the feet.

"TheBear","t5_6abpyt","The food montage was incredible, not just for making me hungry but for showing Sydney's all-in mindset for the restaurant. It's reminiscent of the summer of fine dining she did while in culinary school, where she spent every cent she had on trying every dish in New York. That food binge led her to Carmy back then, and she's doing it again for a chance to work with Carmy now. I *love* that callback. 

So many people in this thread are hung up on Sydney not having a financial stake in The Bear, but isn't that the point? Because she didn't put money in, because she's not linked to the place by a dead brother, because Carmy is ass at communication, Sydney realizes that despite calling herself a partner the whole episode, she's just an outsider who could be dropped from this project a lot easier than anyone else. And that triggers her insecurities because Sydney is deeply emotionally invested in this place, which is why she couldn't walk away for good in the end of season 1 and why she's committing way too fully now. 

I thought it was a great setup but I'm also hoping the payoff isn't another blowup that doesn't fully address those insecurities like her season 1 quitting. C'mon Sydney...",1725148818.0

"warcraftlore","t5_2s5rg","These were exactly my thoughts too. We literally see none of the Council after Dalaran is teleported the subsequently destroyed. The closest we find alive other than Jaina is Aethas.

The Council likely wouldn’t have left the city until they got as many civilians out as possible, much like Khadgar didn’t. This kinda plays into the theory about him still being alive, but captured, seeing as the nerubians were kidnapping civilians.

The Dark Heart absorbs arcane energy, which is exactly why Xal’atath was in Dalaran to begin with, and why Khadgar could do nothing against her. What if the Council, who are considered to be some of Azeroth’s most powerful mages, are being used right now to absorb more power, Khadgar included? Xal’atath has been posing as Drenden for Light knows how long, so she likely knows A LOT about the different members of the Council.

I’m kinda surprised no NPCs have spoken about it, but given the destruction of Dalaran, they probably assume they are dead to begin with. Alleria probably thinks that seeing as she was the one who saw Xal’atath pretending to be Drenden. 
Then again, the NPCs hardly mention Khadgar either post destruction (other than Alleria, and to a lesser extent, Anduin), and given who he meant to a lot of people (Jaina, Turalyon, etc), you’d also expect a bit more…talk about his loss, and the rest of the Council as a whole?

Ever since this controversy surfaced, everyone has been waiting for him to address the situation, even though he hasn’t been directly accused of anything. Yes, he adjusted the schedule to his liking, which some found unacceptable, but at least he’s out there, present and accountable. From day one, Lalettan has been in the spotlight, and we expect him to speak up.

But where is Mammootty? Why is there total silence about him? He’s stayed hidden away at home, as he has so often in the past, and no one seems to care. Why isn’t anyone demanding that he come forward? Why is the public so quiet about his absence? Could it be that Ikkachi’s fans are working overtime to stifle any criticism that might reach Mamooka? Or is it the PR machine working to shield Mammootty while targeting Lalettan? At this stage in his career, Mamooka owes it to everyone to step up and show just how much of that so-called ‘software update’ his PR team keeps bragging about has actually happened",1725148819.0

MCM no es David ni la pesubre es Goliath. Es una percepción equivocada de la realidad. No es eso lo que está sucediendo. Todo el trauma social que hemos vivido y ahora agudizado el último mes es evidencia de la ineptitud de una élite saqueadora que sólo es eso, una banda de rateros inmorales. No son estadistas, ni gerentes ni planificadores de políticas públicas. Nunca harán progresar al país porque sencillamente no sabrían hacerlo. El mojón del socialismo del SXXI es una narrativa que consumen ignorantes y fanáticos. La cúpula seudo chavista (el chavismo murió con el Mortadela) realmente es oligarquía socialista totalmente conscientes de su quehacer criminal. 

Por eso tienen que salir. 

No es un David y un Goliath. Es una cúpula y una ciudadanía. Que la cúpula tenga poder no la hace Goliath. Es perentoria en su misma entropía de la codicia. La cúpula pesubre es un tumor haciendo metástasis, era cuestión de tiempo y de atomizar el descontento del ciudadano decente y pacífico. Ahora ese tumor está avanzando aceleradamente y hará colapso sin que nada lo detenga. No somos Cuba, somos Venezuela. La libertad que tanto hemos esperado está cada vez más cerca.

Por todas estas razones no cabe la analogía de David y Goliath aquí.",1725148819.0

"darkestdungeon","t5_2znp4","For act 3, do your best to hoard shimmering powders combat item as the stealth it grants hard counters the seen tokens the boss generates. As for the party, I haven’t played a ton with the new MMA and Jester so I can’t give you much advice on those hero paths specifically. However MMA’s guard is pretty useful in case someone else unintentionally got the seen token. Jester’s Fade to Black will also grant some blind tokens to help with the fight and cause focused fault to miss and clear seen tokens on the hero it missed on. 
Do your best to avoid 3 seen tokens as the boss is guaranteed a crit on Limerence (72 damage unblocked or unweakened and will copy your tokens). Also avoid more than 3 positive tokens on any hero without seen tokens and the boss will potentially copy them and have a chance to blind and stun. 

For act 4, hoard Clotting Poultices and the two stagecoach items that generate Clotting Poultices (head to the hospital, you’re more likely to find them there). This will help hard counter the last phase of the boss. Rank 1 will be suffering for a bit unless people are getting shuffled around (which isn’t great for your party) but holding onto healing combat items will help too. PD’s blight is invaluable in this fight, as you’re gonna need to be constantly hitting through positive tokens on the boss.

#NEW VIDEOS AND AUDIOS (Updated Weekly) (All Content is 18+ Only)

##SPH and Feet JOI

Sigh, I cannot believe that you are hard… AGAIN! Alright, I guess I will allow you to jerk off in my presence. Get down on your knees and start to touch that pathetically small excuse for a dick. What does it take, two fingers to stroke it? Haha! Well, spread your legs and smack your balls, as I might as well also enjoy myself and that sound is like music to my ears. You know what, I’ll even shove my feet into your face and let you lick them, I might as well torment you in whatever way I possibly can! Now, do you think I'll actually allow you to cum today?

##Surprise Bully Pegging

I know I've bullied you in the past, but you don't need to be afraid today, let me explain. You see, I've started to feel really guilty and bad for you, so I want to help. Since you're such a loser, I know you must still be a virgin. I was thinking that I could help you out by taking your virginity for you! Great! Now strip down for me and then lay down with your eyes closed. And... Surprise!! Oh, haha, you thought I meant THAT virginity? No, no, I'd never do that! I always meant that I would fuck your ass with my strap on instead! Awe, but it still seems to turn you on, how about I make sure you cum all over your face while I pump and tell you about how I'm going to share your ass with my friends!

##My First Uncircumcised Cock

I didn’t expect to go home with this guy and for things to progress this fast! But I do have to say, his bulge isn’t quite as big as I was expecting, especially with his confidence. Wow, now that it’s exposed, it’s longer and more curved than I thought… And he’s uncut, my first time with one! The head of his cock is also so large and round, a true mushroom head hiding under all that foreskin of his. I’m a little nervous, but kind of excited to play with it and learn. I’m excited to pull back that foreskin and play with that sensitive head of his. I am definitely looking forward to making his covered cock cum and getting to see it leak out the tip!

##Interview With a Ballbuster

So you want to know what being a self proclaimed ballbuster is all about? Well, I suppose I could tell you two different stories of times I have taken my pleasure out on testicles. The first was when I was younger and at a playground. I saw someone get their balls busted for the first time, and trust me, I felt incredible, like I had been given a divine purpose! And then I'll tell you a story of when a young man grabbed my ass at a store, thinking I was his mother. I squeezed and popped his nuts in a bathroom stall to show him that he shouldn't behave like that!

##Size Insecurity Gone Wrong!

Part 1 - I know I said that your dick was unbelievably massive the last time I saw it, but I have actually been training myself to be able to take it. Wait... You did what?!? You felt insecure about your size and decided to do a trial for a penis enlargement pill? Well, I guess I'll give it a shot anyway, but I don't think I can take your dick now, even with all that training! Nope... It's waaaay too massive, you need to stop the trial!! Part 2 - I cannot believe that you had an adverse reaction to that pill trial and kept going with it for 6 months!! Your penis is so insanely massive that now you can't even fit inside a house! Luckily our size queen friend volunteered to care for you, but you had to be dropped off by a flatbed and a crane is needed to move you into her backyard!

##Small Cock Cop 2

Alright, let’s get this over with. (I can’t believe I got the job of re-measuring disgusting small cocks today…) I will remove your chastity cage, stroke your cock (Ewwww, I hate touching these insignificant things!!) and then re-measure your penis size. If you are still under the minimum cock size set out by our government, you will be locked back up and labelled as “too small” (As if my co-worker would have measured wrong and he's bigger now…) So let’s get started, I guess?

##Roommate Gives You SPH JOI

Oh… I guess this was bound to happen eventually… So yes, that is my dildo that you found. Um, are you serious? You’re asking if this totally average 6” dildo is my biggest?? Haha, cute joke! Instead, this here 9” thick bad boy is my biggest one! It’s also the one I use the most frequently. Why are you so surprised by their size? You can’t be that small…. R-right? Oh, wow, I didn’t expect you to be like 3” and thin! I actually have an idea, how about I stroke this massive toy of mine and you can jerk off for me while staring at a real man-sized cock. Make sure you follow my instructions!

##The Ballbusting Cheerleader Sisters

You maybe know me as one half of the ballbusting cheerleader sisters! My sister and I started out just thinking that this was a good way to get back at my ex that cheated on me and the guys who would be so, so annoying… But as time has gone on, it has become an obsession, something we need to do! I love to kick a guy in the groin with my platform boots, the sound and feel is absolutely amazing! My sister prefers to punch or smack a guy right where it matters! I do believe we inherited this trait, maybe we were just meant to do this! Our mother is also a force to be reckoned with!! If you want to meet her and be a part of our lives, you are going to need to be trained and your poor balls are going to get beaten up like crazy.

##Spanking Sarah in Public

I cannot believe that I am having to make this call and you are just incapable of properly disciplining your own wife!! Sarah slapped a nice older woman at the town cookout today, so I needed to take control and spank her, again! I took her to the middle of the park, bent her over my knee and spanked her thoroughly. After a bit, that lovely older lady brought me a nice heavy, old style hairbrush and I went to work trying to get my hand prints off of her ass by making the whole thing, and even her asshole, red! Once Sarah pleaded with me that she would do anything to make it stop, I told her that she would need to suck off my husband right then and there. She needed to do that and take more spanks in front of the whole crowd, even if they were watching and taking pictures. This is going to keep happening if you cannot improve your wife’s behaviour!

Lebensjahr Jungs sich in der Grobmotorik in dieser Phase schneller entwickeln als Mädchen. Dabei wurde beobachtet, dass die Mädchen entwicklungstechnisch vom Altersversetztem Spielen beim Fußball deutlich mehr profitieren. War ganz interessant; findet man beim Pädagogik Lehrstuhl der Uni Würzburg.

> **It appears to ask for moral judgment or judgment on your actions.**

&nbsp;

Per our [moral judgment rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivahe5/meta_autoremoving_moral_judgment_threads_also/), any requests for moral judgment (generally any yes/no questions) will result in the removal of your post even if you ask for specific advice as well.

&nbsp;

Your post is a moral judgement if it contains any of the following:

* Is it...?


* Am I...?

* Any variation of “Am I The Asshole?”, including AITA

* Who is morally good here?

* Does anybody else...?

* Should I…?

* Am I justified…?

* Would I be right to do...?

* Am I overreacting?

* Is this a big deal?

* Is this reasonable?

&nbsp;

Please remove any questions that ask for judgment of a situation and instead request specific advice that could not possibly result in a yes/no answer. Any variation of ""Am I The Asshole?"", including AITA, also falls under this rule.

Were you on antibiotics lately?  And if so did you replenish your gut with probiotics?  

Also have you looked into eating low fodmap?  

I ask cause I have had to go low fodmap a few times of late to fix gas/bloating/pain issues (once from mounjaro, or mounjaro + maybe some gluten) the last time from a stint of azithromycin.  With the azithromycin I thought my probiotics should have worked fine - needed to switch up the probiotics and now am fine but had a rough couple weeks.  

Fodmaps are foods that make us prone to be gassy (in general)

Low histamine + low fodmap definitely not a fun time restriction wise, but it could help you figure things out / calm the shit down…",1725148820.0

That's not to say there won't be imbalances between demand/supply at times.




I think there'll be enough homes to house at least 2.5M (in next 10 years) up to 22M+ people (next 25 years) by 2050 without additional building.




Alot of baby boomers (either as widow/ers or even couples) live in homes bigger than their needs with multiple empt bedrooms, if my neighbours are representative.




Similar can be said for interwar & greatest generation.

It's cheaper for them to live in their own home than move to a retirement home (which costs $4.5-6.0K+/m in GTHA) and they get to stay within their establialshed community.







Unfortunately, high prices also makes downsizing to life lease residential condos unaffordable/doesn't make financial sense when they can cost more on PSF basis than their SFD & have $1000+/m maintenance fees.

In the future, those SFDs will house other families or could easily be converted to multi-unit dwellings.







In 2024, there were 7.6M (~19%) people aged 65 years and older, and that number continues to rise.




More than two-thirds (67.6%) of people aged 65 years and older were members of the baby boomer generation.




The remaining third were members of the interwar generation, born between 1928 and 1945, and the greatest generation, born before 1928.




The current life expectancy for Canada in 2024 is 83.11 years.

• Life expectancy for male was reported at 79.12 years in 2022.

As for the CZ, I own the C (compact) and the S (subcompact) models. I did the Dept of Homeland Security concealed carry qualification course with my bone stock P-10S. I outshot every other agent who were all using larger, red dot equipped pistols in the course. I shot a 248 out of 250 (my two misses were close to the A zone but didn't quite break the line).

Think of all the angles and God himself being proud of you. Think of your damnation if you continue to sin until your heart is hardened like Pharos, think of your future spouse and what you are robbing them of. Most importantly, fix your eyes on Christ. I say these things as someone who is going through what you are going through. Also forgive yourself, we are all sinners and miss the mark but do not continue to sin, repent and make a conscious effort.

It's not a bad system for learning kanji and has some really good mnemonic methods to remember them.

"BreakPoint","t5_3ceyj","I’d like to see ammo types that effect gameplay and capabilities. 

Example

•Shotguns 
Slugs for shotgun could increase accuracy and effective range out to 100m. Additional damage to engine blocks, vehicles in general
Breaching rounds would allow an alternative way to breach doors/gates without C4 that would otherwise be inaccessible without a key. 

•Assualt rifle / LMG
Tracer rounds would be so effective, 1 every 5-10 rounds or so. Especially for players who prefer little to no HUD. 

•Sniper platforms 
Anti material/HE rounds for additional damage to fortified positions, armor, vehicles etc. 
Maybe normal rounds offer higher accuracy for less damage. 

•SMG/Handgun
Subsonic rounds for increased noise reduction 
Options for Hollow point and ball ammo with respective perks and drawbacks. 

Ideally ammo types would provide a noticeable benefit and fit specific use cases to further customize gameplay and increase immersion. Add the ability to carry multiple ammo types at once for increased capabilities. (3 mags ball ammo, 1 mag anti material) or (16 slugs, 8 buckshot, 8 breacher rounds)",1725148823.0

My family went on a camping trip. My dad had a pickup truck with a camper shell over the bed of the truck. You could see into the truck cab from a window that the truck had and an up-openable widow that the camper shell had. We were driving back from the camping trip, me and my 3 sisters were all in the shell cover truck bed. I remember banging on the window telling our parents that it smelled funny, now I know that it was exhaust from the truck. They told us ""we'll be home soon..just lay down and take a nap"" so we did. We almost didn't wake back up once we got home a few hours later.  I don't know if it was because of where I was in the truck or what but I definitely got the worst of it. My mom talks about how blue I was and how hard it was to get me to wake up, how I walked in the house and stood at the edge of the table and passed out, hitting my chin on the table on the way down. I don't remember anything after telling them it smelled funny. I only remember waking up in the front yard with my dad, tears in his eyes telling me that if I raced him he would take me to get all the ice cream I could eat. My parents almost lost 4 children in 1 day. You can hear the fear and regret my mom has when ever she tells the story.",1725148824.0

"ElderScrolls","t5_2s2ja","Marukh was one of a whole species of funny ape men who really, really wished they could be as posh and cool as the High Elves. Like, not bothering to wear clothes but definitely bothering to wear swag as hell cloaks because they're *ritzy*.  

Marukh, specifically, went on a *deadly* Catholic Guilt Trip in which he believed that Alessia herself spoke to him. He wrote ""her words"" in his own blood on the side of a rock, quite a lot of people believed him and they're called the ""Seventy-Seven Inflexible Doctrines"". 

Beyond seemingly uber-conservative moral values, the Doctrines insist that there's actually only one God, mostly for the sake of casting *elvish* deities as Akatosh getting confused (by elves). Solution? Crusade against the elves, obviously.  

That worked for a while but unsurprisingly people got sick of it and rebelled, especially in Colovia. Meanwhile, a sect called the Marukhati Selectives hatched a plan to ""fix"" Akatosh by dancing the Auri-El out of him (somehow aided by the Towers, at least white-gold). They, uh, *actually* did something and Akatosh was presumably *actually* fucked up for a while. Cue dragon break, time didn't exist and life was just inexplicable horror and madness. The Elder Council officially chose to say that it took Akatosh 1008 years to get his shit together but that's a bit contradictory.

So yeah, fuck Marukh. Fuck people using Alessia's slave rebellion to justify mass genocide generally.",1725148824.0

"TheWire","t5_2reco","McNulty: is a civilian employee at a suburban PD near Baltimore, an administrator in charge of the forsenics lab and surveillance tech, despite knowing practically nothing about either. He mostly approves purchase orders for DNA testing or other expensive lab work that can’t be done in house, but uses his position as gatekeeper for such stuff to do police work behind the scenes (“Tell me why you need this test. Is it really going to help the investigation?”), much like the way he could set investigative priorities when his serial killer scam was ongoing. Is mostly sober, but goes on binges roughly every eighteen months. Had a kid with Beadie but is no longer seeing her.

Bunk Moreland: retired. Now is owner/manager at a high end cigar store. Has had to pick McNulty up more than once after he bottomed out from a binge (“You happy now, bitch?”). His kids are all in grad school for different engineering fields.

Lester and Shardene: still a happy couple. Lester took on apprentices for his doll house miniatures business and it’s now a mid-seven figure a year operation. Shardene became an RN, and now also has an academic appointment in the Nursing School at Johns Hopkins.

Bill Rawls: passed away from AIDS five years into his tenure as Chief of the State Police, although his death was publicly attributed to cancer.

Landsman: rises to the rank of Major and is now in charge of the homicide squad. Lost weight, no longer reads porn or the Victoria’s Secret catalogue at work. Will retire in another year or two.

Kima: passed the sergeant’s exam with flying colors but decided she’d rather stay a detective. Has the highest clearance rate of the detectives in the squad. 

Beadie Russel: shortly after McNulty was expelled from the BPD, signed up at the police academy. She realized she enjoyed her time with the homicide squad and wanted to be a regular detective. While she was with McNulty, she squeezed him for his knowledge and insights, which he happily provided because again it gave him the opportunity to do police work behind the scenes. What ended their relationship wasn’t his drinking but his urging her to cut corners on one investigation, and she was having none of it. Is now partnered with Kima on the homicide squad.

Nicky Sobotka: rumored to be a dockworker in either Los Angeles or Long Beach CA under another name

Daniels: became a highly successful defense lawyer for white collar criminals. This allowed him to keep away from defending drug dealers. Also noted for pro bono work for victims of police brutality or frame jobs. Gets intel for this work from Ellis Carver.

Carver: took command of the Western District after Dennis Mello retired. The Western now consistently has the lowest numbers for violent crime of all districts, likely because he instituted a Hamsterdam approach to policing without creating a Hamsterdam: quietly turning a blind eye to drug corners as long as the crews on the corners kept the peace, did not hassle civilians, etc. To maintain appearances, every so often it was one crew’s turn to get busted, but the charges didn’t stick. And any crew that didn’t maintain the peace was shut down for good, not least because other crews would provide intel on the unseemly one that led to charges that would stick. 

Herc: still Maury Levy’s investigator, still feeds intel to Carver. 

Colvin: after a few years being a consultant to various educational researchers at colleges and universities in and around Baltimore, got the job as head of security at U. Maryland College Park. It doesn’t pay as well as the John Hopkins one, but well enough, certainly better than being a consultant did. He takes long vacations with his wife every year, staying in luxury accommodations. Checks in with Carver regularly. 

Marlo: Acquired a vigilante rep for taking corners from drug crew and then doing nothing with them and was shot trying to take another corner shortly after the show’s end. A final indignity: these exploits are now attributed to Omar. 

Avon: out of prison and now running the West Side in the same extremely low key way Prop Joe ran the East: his cover is that he’s the owner of several small grocery stores. His rapport with the Greek is stronger than Prop Joe’s, and the Greek has had Vondas has move against challenges to Avon as he should have done with Marlo. 

The Greek: still not Greek.

And also many Turkish people wouldn't even know that they are Oghuz. Many people take pride in and name their children after famous Kipchak and Karluk figures (Baybars is a very popular name for example), not because they believe they are Oghuz, but because they were Turks.







I understand many people from other Turkic countries do not share our understanding of ethnicity and often primarily identify with their respective subdivisions and I respect that, but I believe we and certain other groups such as Iranian Azerbaijanis deserve respect for choosing to primarily identify as just Turks, too.

Now, because of the facility of computers, they can easily revise either the track or the picture interactively, and work on both picture and sound at the same time, or record talent remotely.

If you work is for healing, positive communication, and work, or creative writing, it’s great. 

Here’s the point I wish to make: It’s not that planets/times are *bad or good*, they just make certain rituals work better with the natural flow of energy.

And I would report that it appears Trump is trying out different stands on reproductive rights, and give examples of different statements he has made in the last week or so illustrating his flip-flopping and making promises about IVF that he could never deliver, and shouldn't.
I would also report on statements made by his campaign staff, which conflict with some of his recent comments. And I would note that his pro-life supporters have pushed back, and he is apparently towing the line now, as evidenced by his 'I'm voting no' statement. 
It seems to me that the press would approach a situation like this with almost any presidential candidate. Are they with Trump?",1725148827.0

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","I watched the games against the Leo as Reina and the games against Jin as Bryan. You use a LOT of highs and high commitment moves and seem to rely almost entirely on just overwhelming your opponent with offence (which admittedly Reina is very good at). Your Sentai options were always Sentai 3 or Sentai 3+4, both of which lose HARD to ducking, so try to work in some of the safer sentai options as well as FF2\~nothing. If you watch the replays, you can see you get launched for this a lot. I think adding in some use of the DF1 strings to control movement and prevent ducking would also help a lot. 

You also don't seem to have a clear idea of what to do when you get a knockdown. Either try to lab this or look up a video.

When you wake up, you seem to use spring kick a LOT, which again, can really get you punished.

You seem very, very inclined to mash during opponents skills, so try to take some time to figure out both how to mash more effectively and when you can instead sideestep or should just block. This relies a lot on learning your opponents strings, so it will take a long time. 

If you don't mash on defence, you tend to just hold back, if you just want to block, you should almost always just backdash instead.

There were multiple occasions where you did 1,1,2 which can get you absolutely murdered if your opponents punishes are good, so you could work on hit confirming that.

Generally, I think you'd benefit from starting matches by using your safer options to condition your opponents then mixing in more and more of the risky stuff as you scout them out. You also almost always press on an immediate timing when you block, trying to take your turn back. It can be really beneficial to vary your timing as well as mixing in movement and slower moves.

Your Bryan had very similar problems to your Reina, you didn't really use much DF1 or QCB2 to try and control your opponent, instead relying a lot on jabs and the BIG moves.",1725148827.0

If your positive thoughts are shallow and baseless than it's a superficial method.


If your positivity thoughts are objective and based on your individual strengths than they have the power to help. 


No thought will bring about true transformation. That comes from behaviors.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","If I get smacked with a bat I would greatly appreciate those ladies calling the police; their ""comforting"" does absolutely nothing to undo the cracks on my skull though - that is what I'm saying. 

Unless those ladies are trained Emergency Medical Techs who can tend to my cracked skull while other paramedics arrive *then* you can say they're actually doing something for me. But if all they are doing is ""offering sympathies"" then they are not actually doing anything other than watching me bleed out. There is absolutely no need to stay with me until an ambulance arrived, but if they just wanna stay and either ""sympathize"" or gawk at me I'm fine with both, it's human nature either way. 

The disingenuous part is where women convince themselves that ""Feelings"" = Actions. 

As if *feeling sorry* for me while I'm on the floor bleeding to death - while they did absolutely nothing to stop it as it was happening - is somehow in the same ballpark as confronting the schizoid *as the attack is occurring.* It's not the same, not even close. 

Jumping into a dangerous situation to save someone else, while risking your own skin, is not the same as ""feeling"" sympathies after the fact. You need to take action *before or during* the dangerous event in order for it to count as genuine heroism or sympathy. Otherwise, all you're feeling is the same emotions as when watching a movie and you just feel bad for the fictional character.",1725148828.0

"autism","t5_2qhs6","I would agree if OP lived there because they have to, not because they want to. It's no different than telling my teenager they can't have a tattoo. My home, my rules, and I say no. When they move out and get their own home, they can make their own rules, and I'll follow the rules of their home while I'm in it. If I don't like their rules, I'll leave. Until then, while they live in my home, they follow my rules.

I lived at home until I was 19 because I was allowed to stay free of cost as long as I was in college. That was the rule, and I was expected to abide by it and the other rules of the house. My parents were letting me stay there, so they were doing me a favor. They had no legal obligation to let me stay and could have told me no.

After my mom passed away, I got into a disagreement with my stepfather about a rule in the home. He told me that if I wanted to stay, I had to abide by his rules. If I didn't want to, then I could leave and get my own home. So, I did.

This is the way the world works. If you go to work with pink hair, even though policy says no pink hair, you can't just do as you please and still keep your job. You want pink hair? Fine, but you gotta find a different job. OP wants a new tattoo? Fine, but she's gotta find her own place to live.

Nothing is free and everything comes at a price. That's the trade-off we make for the things we want or need.",1725148828.0

I buy gas at the Costco in Fairbanks.  I keep 40 gallons on hand in old 5 gallon cans that I buy at estate sales.  Most of the year I don't run the generators at all.  It's only during the dead of winter and even then I'm only running the generator once a week for about 5 hours.

I keep 4x 20lb propane tanks on hand.  I have a full size propane GE stove like you would find in any regular house.  It was originally setup for NG but GE includes the nozzles/regulator to easily convert to LP.  I get a full 6 months out of a standard size propane tank and I use the stove a couple times a day.",1725148830.0

[Dagon specifies that 70% of his Domain's ""power"" was directed at Naobito whereas the remaining 30% was directed at Nanami](https://mangajjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/5-7.jpg). Maki was actually entirely excluded from the sure-hit effect after Dagon first tested his sure-hit against the three combatants, which also showcased that Maki could still be recognized by sure-hit effects prior to Mai taking away the rest of her CE if there were any doubts on that point, before unleashing it in force. Later on, Dagon threatens to subject her to the same fate as the other two, as well, only for Megumi to luckily intervene just before he could make good on this threat.

The only Shikigami that attack her following the initial testing of the sure-hit effect weren't a product of the aforementioned effect but instead moved to intervene when she moved to attack Dagon, with Dagon having probably summoned them just before she could him in the same manner he continued to summon individual Shikigami after Megumi cancelled out his sure-hit effect and against Toji. 

[While there's a lack of clarity in the paneling, the anime makes it overtly clear what's happening.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMuivuLmcU0)

Most likely, right after you unpack the .zip file (the first download in the link in the comments), whatever antivirus you use is immediately quarantining that file, and it is most likely missing from the extracted folder.

I wouldn't recommend it - the virus threat could be real and it might really be a trojan - but if you really want to trust this download, you should check the protection/quarantine history of your respective antivirus and choose to restore the quarantined eco\_launcher.exe, adding it to the allowed threats (or whatever your antivirus calls its exceptions) list. At which point your file should return to the folder, and you might be able to run it. If not, you'll be able to download eco\_launcher.exe from the second link on that linked website and re-add it to the folder once it's made an exception for your antivirus.

His sister has a history of toxic behaviour in social settings, and while she can acknowledge it, that doesn’t mean she’s changed.

You’re under no obligation to introduce her into your social circle, especially in a group trip setting as the first time.

"YarnAddicts","t5_2t1hd","it looks like some sort of 'thick and thin' single-ply yarn. the twist collects in the areas of least resistance, which happens to be the thinner sections, leaving the thicker sections *barely* spun. the fibers in those looser sections puffs up easily without the twist to tame it. that's the appeal of these yarns. 

1) if the whole ball/skein looks like this, that is how it was *intentionally* spun. some of the looser sections can pull apart if you breathe too hard, so just be gentle when handling the fiber. 

2) if, however, the rest of the ball is *consistent*, with this section of chaotic thick and thinness, then it's a problem of (significant) inconsistency in both the twist and the thickness of the yarn. 

i'm inclined to think it's the second case, because most thick and thin yarns tend to be...well... consistent in the spacing of the sections, like [this example](https://www.reddit.com/r/knitting/comments/qx9t55/came_across_these_thickthin_and_wavy_yarn_for/) i found from a Google search. the first image shows the single-ply, and the second one shows it plied up. i've seen them spun longer spacing between the sections, but that should be consistent across the whole ball/skein.

Racism isn't just calling someone a slur, it's the ability of having systemic power over said group you're prejudiced against. In example: you don't like blacks so you unfairly sentence them in comparison to your own race in the judicial system, racially profile and commit police brutality, pass laws that you know for sure will impact specific groups. 

None of this has ever happened to whites in an unsettling and blatant manner...


I get what you're saying but this is a ""hypothetical"" situation that hasn't happened and has yet to happen. I'd rather deal with reality and not borderline impossible hypotheticals so if this were actually happening to whites, you'd have a point BUT why would you want to proclaim white pride when it already has a dark and twisted connotation to it? 


It's funny though that the only argument that can be made against the cruel reality that black people go through is a hypothetical of whites could potentially go through, which would only be possible if white supremacy doesn't exist 💀",1725148832.0

I’ve had amazing communication with the doctor and the mochi support folks. I haven’t had any issues thus far and I’m really happy with picking Mochi. Im sorry you and the others are having issues. They even decreased the pricing to $99 a month for the semiglutude for old patients and new (used to be $175) I’m also located in Texas so I wonder if that has anything to do with me getting my medication on time thus far. Based on my experience, I encourage others to initially try Mochi but of course at your own risk. I took a risk and it worked out thankfully.

This results in irreconcilable disagreements about what is true, correct, authentic Orthodoxy, which has already been ruled on, irrevocably, by the 7 Ecumenical Councils. When questions arise on how to rule on unknown science or technology the councils did not rule on, a local or representative number of Bishops, Priests, scholars and experts form a council and decide how to apply the Orthodox Worldview.

No tiene una definición única y la usan liberalmente (típicamente pero no exclusivamente, izquierdistas) para etiquetar todo lo que estigmatizan. El hecho de que uses esos términos como “argumento” demuestran tu ignorancia sobre economía básica. Regresando al punto inicial (que por cierto, aparentemente ya se te olvidó lo de que vendieron CFE): Los procesos de subasta, también perfectamente documentados, son para ver quién haría la exploración y explotación. En su momento, algunos observadores internacionales pensaban que era el inicio del proceso de privatización (lo cual sólo los profundamente ignorantes como tú), lo cual obviamente estaba equivocado. La reforma jamás consideró la privatización de nada, sólo la coinversión y cooperación entre PEMEX y cualquier empresa privada que quisiera entrar. Cómo se determinaba con cuál empresa privada? Adivinaste! Con las SUBASTAS. Para eso eran. Nuevamente, todo esto lo puedes consultar libremente. Ya van como 5 veces que te digo esto pero te rehúsas a hacerlo.

Curiosamente, en el periodo de 2012-2018: 
PEMEX vio sus números rojos disminuir, es decir: Sus pérdidas. Su producción también subió…sigue siendo un muerto andando
CFE por primera vez en mucho tiempo fue RENTABLE. Ahora, nuevamente, estamos subsidiando su ineficiente operación, y pagando un alto precio en contaminación.

"neoconNWO","t5_3kcxv","> There is functionally no difference between an atheist and someone who accepts the existence of some deity but does not have concrete religious beliefs and practices.

But that is not what Deists were, which is notably why Paine, who had no reason to try to conceal his true religious views since he had already pissed everyone off and burned all bridges with his acid critiques of Christianity, still very clearly stated his belief in the existence of God and the immortality of the human soul. Voltaire rebuked atheists like d'Holbach and went out of his way to answer to atheist tracts, confirming that he agreed with their criticisms of the Abrahamic religions, while fervently defending the existence of God even on practical grounds. And Robespierre [actually to make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Supreme_Being) a replacement religion for Christianity with very ""concrete religious beliefs and practices"", as a response to the previous ""Cult of Reason"" which was a purely atheist initiative from the Hebertistes.

Again, it seems like you're taking for granted that the label of ""moralistic therapeutic deism"" can be applied to all non-Christian enlightenment authors who were nonetheless still theists, because they're both labelled as ""deist"", but frankly, that's just because deist is just an umbrella term that describes a very wide array of religious positions, which may have significant differences with each other.",1725148833.0

If your Lightning doesn't yet have the Tesla Supercharging OTA to support Plug-n-Charge, you *must* install the Tesla app on your phone and activate the charge session.    You drive up, put the NACS to CCS1 adapter in your truck, start the charging session in the Tesla app, then stick the NACS plug into the CCS1 adapter.

I can sort of understand how researchers give mice various physical diseases. But what about mental or developmental disorders?

Being said, if we're going to have to MC to get good squire builds, i would stand to argue that system would be inherently flawed to get the talents that feel natural to a class arch. Like weapon mastery on a barb. You'd think even a simpleton would know how to pick up a stick and bonk, or dagger pointy end is sharp. Also at base squire you get a shield , but have to buy a 1h from a vendor? There's something just wrong with that. You'd think you'd have a weapon with that already....",1725148834.0

"DBZDokkanBattle","t5_384a7","Trunks in standby was the best character in the game back in the day and still is pretty strong. My man got the same defensive stats as Broly post intro (and maybe even higher since Trunks stacks def) when he standbys pre-super. Post super Broly is ofc far superior, but both can tank almost everything post super anyway

The RNG in base form and lack of crits can hurt, especially since they started increasing bosses def and some bosses need crit hits to be hurt, so he's quite dupe dependant, but I'm still using him from time to time and he never sold me any run

VB was released on a meta of short fights with a kit made for long fights, which of course came with the anni alongside powercreep. So when they finally get their content they become dodge or die

With the anni Zamasu finally got a domain that does something (extra damage to super class), but now he has the problem of having 50 different domains on his teams, all better than his. But if he doesn't use his domain he can't transform and might end up dying

Better than being denied the opportunity at all through tickets being unaffordable in the first place!

>Though frankly, I don't think ticket prices of £355 are really 'limiting who can go to a concert to the rich and wealthy': it's just a bit pricier than you'd like.)

I disagree, £355 for an evening's entertainment is crazy money for many, although these were not the least expensive tickets on sale. 

>This is a morally neutral statement:

Indeed, and sorry if I came across as antagonistic.

>Your problem here is to define ""face value"" in a legally watertight way.

""Face Value"" is the price the ticket was originally sold for. This is set and standardised for the same type of ticket for a whole artist's tour at each venue (so a standing ticket in Manchester costs the same as a standing ticket in London).

To the rest of your comment with various scenarios, people for more knowledgable and experienced in writing laws would definitely be able to draw something up that suitably covers it all. 

> I don't believe the government should get the right to ban consensual commercial exchanges at a fair market value,

I absolutely disagree (and appreciate you recognized thus) as they are taking advantage of a situation where there is extremely disproportionate supply to demand ratio. The artist don't see any of the profit the scalpers make and people who actually want to go to the concert suffer greatly due to not fault of their own. The scalpers aren't contributing anything to the supply chain here, just pocketing profit, so they can do one.",1725148834.0

The change in odour in the nether regions during this time is caused by oestrogen decline. 

There is no doubt that sweating happens in warm climates. If the sweating has increased, drenches the crotch but not so much other areas, and stinks differently than it used to, then this is a classic sign that oestrogen declines are happening.

"OrthodoxChristianity","t5_2qra3","1. There are also scholars that believe the gospels WERE written by their traditional authors. Regardless of what any scholars say, **every** single ancient source says that the Gospels were written by their respective author. Additionally, most of the people that wrote the documents that attest to historical Gospel authorship were martyred for their beliefs, which included that the Gospels were written by the Apostles. Scholars know this. So they say that the traditional authorship cannot be correct because of the “differences in the Gospels.” There are tons of videos on these peoples’ claims of contradictions within the Gospels, but it doesn’t take a genius to put down their claims. You might even be able to understand why they are wrong upon reading them yourself. (Bart Ehrman and his bull. Muslims really like him too lol). But in the end, just remember who these scholars are working for and who is paying them. Who’s paying off all the official institutions, and mass media and etc. and remember how they mock God but not the Islamic God. Their artificial intelligence bots will make offensive jokes about Jesus but will **never** say anything about Muhammad. 

2. Morality within Christianity has not changed. Especially not in the Orthodox Church. But the morals of Christians have changed. Instructions for certain things being allowed or done issued to an ancient group of people does not constitute changing morality. There’s a lot more to this stuff though for both Islam and Christianity and a lot of clear differences. But i do kind of agree with you on moral arguments being ineffective against Islam. To an extent. But you don’t need to even go to hadiths to disprove Islam. The Quran has numerous screws ups and stolen stories. I can go into detail on some if you like.

3. If this is all you’ve got against Christianity, you’ve barely reached the surface of the garbage that dawahgandists try to throw at Christ and Christians. Trust me, I was a Muslim for over a decade, and out of all the religions there are, it is definitely not Islam.",1725148835.0

You can beg for it, you can hope for it, but you won't, so far as we can tell now, get rid of the impulse to rape or abuse children.

Some people just have it.

So what we've found out is that if we don't stigmatize the thoughts, we are more likely to have that person seek help and thus prevent any harmful behavior.

Because if you care about not having your sensibilities offended, this is the shit you're gonna react to.

Bravo 3a leikon kelkon.

If you actually care about preventing real harm from innocent people, often defenseless women and children being targeted by organized crime with weapons and full control, then  at the very least the people who want help and want to get better and change and deal with these feelings, we should be congratulating them for opening up about such a dark demon.

Indeed, what a terrible day to know English because the amount of ignorance in this post is alarming.

But I don't blame anyone, there are many problems I am ignorant over. And we have to many problems to know the nuances of all society's woes.

It's just always predictable these are the kind of reactions people get.

Including someone saying to me now ""oh, are you one of those people who are like the guy who sent the message and that's why you're defending them?"".

No, I just have empathy And I know what it's like (mental illness) to live with something you didn't choose and that is a struggle to overcome.

So yeah you are both predictable humans acting predictably to a complex situation.

Maybe you may both think about this differently, though. Because originally, I held the same view shunned people like the guy in the OP's message.

Until I realized that was doing more harm than good, and being open both about our urges, and the abuses we face (for example most victims, me included btw, of abuse remain silent for life - we are too ashamed/scared to talk about it) all around is probably better for healing, and to prevent it from happening or at least to stop it from before it goes too far.",1725148835.0

I understand the sentiment for finally switching to PC. Since I now play in VR only I had to choose between the HP Reverb G2 and PSVR2 one year ago. Since I enjoyed the shutoku experience a bit more than the ‚limited‘ GT7 experience, it was not justifiable to spend the same amount of money on the PS5 headset. 

Fast forward to today, Microsoft is dropping support for a headset, that I paid full price just one year ago. But luckily, Sony released their adapter that makes the PSVR2 work with the PC.

So now, I am back to having one VR glasses that work with both.

And since I missed GT7 so much, I just can‘t forget about it.

So for me (sadly) it‘s about enjoying both systems to their full extent and not abandoning one :/

Too bad, things can‘t just be as easy as on PC :(",1725148836.0

But I can understand that and different life experiences with it. I'm autistic and I don't really understand what draws them other than learned stuff and making your personality shine. I don't say it to boast but I suppose I used to be one of the ""bad guys"" and I couldn't have a stable relationship but slept around and dated around. And it felt more hollow, I'm still not super well set but knowing myself more has helped me be with people I'm happier around though.

It made me feel so bad. To the point I felt like a horrible mother, and I blamed myself. My son also struggles with writing and tying shoes.

One day, I realized the only reason he started speaking clearly was because of me. He learned to read because of me. 

My son was on a waiting list twice to receive services, and by that time, my son learned things because of me, yet I don't ever hear anyone say that I  did a good job.

Chatbot:

Project 2025 does emphasize enhancing individual protections against overzealous local governments, particularly in the context of law enforcement and public safety. The agenda advocates for increased federal oversight and engagement in jurisdictions where local authorities are perceived to undermine public safety and the rule of law. It suggests that federal resources should be directed to support citizens in areas where local prosecutors fail to adequately enforce laws.

A key proposal includes using federal laws to prosecute individuals who local jurisdictions allow to escape accountability for criminal conduct. Furthermore, there is a call for initiating legal action against local officials, including District Attorneys, who deny citizens equal protection under the law by refusing to prosecute based on certain pretexts.



Overall, the document aims to reinforce individual rights and protections against potentially arbitrary or selective enforcement of laws at the local level, suggesting a broader federal commitment to ensuring the rule of law is upheld for all citizens.",1725148840.0

"raspberry_pi","t5_2syto","We understand that getting started with new projects can be exciting and sometimes overwhelming. However, posts asking general questions like ""how do I get started"" often lack specific goals and personal engagement. They tend to be overly broad and don't provide enough detail to foster meaningful discussions.

Such posts can appear as if the poster is seeking validation or looking for an easy way to build their resume, rather than genuinely engaging with the material. This approach often results in vague queries that don't contribute to the depth and quality of our community discussions.

To maintain a focused and valuable forum, we encourage users to start with the basics using available resources like the official Raspberry Pi website, tutorials, or our [stickied helpdesk thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/about/sticky) at the top of /r/raspberry_pi. Once you have specific questions or encounter particular issues in your projects, our community will be more than happy to assist you.

"BlackMythWukong","t5_30k8uf","While these are certainly features in Souls games they aren’t features that are nearly exclusive to the genre; lots of games from lots of genres have set difficulties and lots have heavy emphasis on resource management. 

Take for example Monster Hunter, which predates Demons Souls by several years, it has both a fixed difficulty with no adjustable settings and a heavy emphasis on resource management.

It is not a Soulslike. 

Like I said above what set Demon’s Souls apart wasn’t its overall difficulty, lack of difficulty settings, or even its resource management because these were features you could find in other games. 

It was the risk/reward gameplay loop that forced you to decide whether or not you should chance moving forward and potentially losing everything or going back to a checkpoint, leveling up, and resetting the gauntlet of enemies; it’s that gameplay loop that defines what Soulslikes are at their core, and that loop is ultimately a combination of the 3 features I listed working in tandem.",1725148840.0

Ever since this controversy surfaced, everyone has been waiting for him to address the situation, even though he hasn’t been directly accused of anything. Yes, he adjusted the schedule to his liking, which some found unacceptable, but at least he’s out there, present and accountable. From day one, Lalettan has been in the spotlight, and we expect him to speak up.

But where is Mammootty? Why is there total silence about him? He’s stayed hidden away at home, as he has so often in the past, and no one seems to care. Why isn’t anyone demanding that he come forward? Why is the public so quiet about his absence? Could it be that Ikkachi’s fans are working overtime to stifle any criticism that might reach Mamooka? Or is it the PR machine working to shield Mammootty while targeting Lalettan? At this stage in his career, Mamooka owes it to everyone to step up and show just how much of that so-called ‘software update’ his PR team keeps bragging about has actually happened",1725148841.0

Wow thats huge news to me, i thought i can go rest at any time whenever i want without any consequences. I explored the map a lil bit, went to the druid camp, wanted to do a side objective, managed unitentend to do a main quest where the goblins had the druid bear captured in a castle, killed all the goblins with the bear and had 2 long rest for now. **So how should i handle long rests?** From what i gather its best to not use them at least regulary?

Posts and comments not following the rules will immediately be removed!

Have you tried using the search bar?  
Many questions are asked daily, and your question may have already 
been answered!  
If so, your post will be subject to deletion.

Please refer to the following commonly discussed 
topics:

1) No one can predict whether or not you will purge! 
Statistically, most people DO NOT purge.  
That is what the science and medical literature says.

2) No one can predict how long your purge will last 
nor when it could start. 
Be patient, the purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - 
you can too!

3)  Any questions related about dosage MUST include DOSE and WEIGHT(lbs or kg).  
Otherwise, that is considered LOW EFFORT and will subsequently be REMOVED.   

4)  Most people DO NOT replase when Accutane is taken until cumulative dosage is reached.

5) HOWEVER, cumulative dosage is a guideline.  
Everyone is different.  Some may need more Accutane, and others may need less.  Your dermatologist 
evaluates you as an individual.  
This also applies to your prescription.  Everyone is different, so no comparing of doses or asking why your dose is low or high.
If you do not trust your dermatologist, you should find a different one.

6) When in doubt, please consult a medical 
professional(dermatologist, doctor, pharmacist).  
DO NOT solicit medical advice from this subreddit.  
Remember Reddit is a bunch of strangers on the internet.

Don't ever try to measure yourself against someone in a generalised sense. Know your strengths and weaknesses, know that others have different strengths and weaknesses. What we need to do as a society is respect when someone else has a strength where we have a weakness and listen to them. I know my strengths lie in the tech space, but I'd never presume to tell a football coach how to strategize for the big game!",1725148841.0

"buffy","t5_2sd68","Not to the police no, but Buffy wanted them to go to Giles, and from Faith’s perspective that would be getting her in pretty big trouble with the Watchers Council. Ultimately of course Buffy was right that going to Giles would have been the best course of action, but then Buffy knew Giles as someone who she could actually trust to go to with this, while to Faith he was more Buffy’s Watcher more than anything else. He never took more than a passing interest in Faith and her living situation, even when Ms Post in Revelations would seem to suggest that it wouldn’t have taken an awful lot to break through to Faith and make a connection to her   

And it’s not to say that I don’t understand and sympathise with a 17 year old Buffy telling Faith that they can’t just ignore this and hope that it goes away, that she’s been left feeling sick and dirty over the killing, I’m just not sure how much that attitude actually helped Faith. It came across that the more cornered Faith felt on Buffy treating the accidental staking as this terrible life changing thing, the more defensive she became about rationalising it as not even being a big deal in their line of work. And then you got to Angel’s misguided (in my opinion) attempt to help Faith by relating to her on the level of what a power rush it can be to feel a life snuff out by your hands, how it makes you feel like a God, but she should know that she’s on the path to darkness and ruin. All a pretty big contrast to how Buffy’s friends immediately rallied round her in Ted and said words to the effect of we know you couldn’t have meant to do this, you’re not a bad person.",1725148841.0

"ROS","t5_2s5r6","I did something similar for a rubics cube:

1. got the pixel coordinates in camera frame from YOLO (you can use aruco markers or something else to get better results as yolo detection might suck for your use case)

2. convert pixel coordinates to 3D coordinates using the intel realsense API, as I used a stereo depth camera and the library is really nice to use. For that there is a function called deproject_pixel_to_point. You will need the camera matrix and depth image from your camera for this.

3. then using tf you transform from the camera frame (this is where the coordinates from the previous step) to the gripper frame (or base frame of your robot as moveit usually uses that when you send a goal pose to the manipulator). The function for that would be transformpoint. In tf2 that would be the transform function from the Buffer class in. You pass in the point and the new frame you want to transform to.

4. now you should have the right coordinates with respect to your frame you want to use. All you do now is pass the point to moveit. But don’t forget, your gripper will try to move INTO the cube. So you either create a frame in between your grippers that has no hitbox to use as the end effector for moveit OR you subtract a certain amount from the right axis so your gripper doesn’t try to move into the box.

I recommend creating a new frame in between the grippers. Doesn’t take much time in the Urdf and you won’t have to make stupid calculations that might not work in other cases. This way your manipulator will always have the box in between the grippers",1725148841.0

I'm not set up for that.  I'm sure someone could,  just not me.  I'll admit it.  I'm not in the tire business.

Weridly the gun thing does not apply to older style guns or Starcrafts fights. I guess if you ""can"" take a hit it's makes me more comfortable making characters fight straight up.

Has a useful encyclopedia, complex planner (with auto build options), extends what the PHQ can do allowing you to be fully independent if you wish, makes piracy more viable, the dynamic relations keep the game state from getting too stale and add a little more gravity to your decision (though these can be disabled if you want), the new drone carrier class is amazing (keep a fleet of repair drone carriers on standby in your staging system to quickly repair boarded ships and patch your own fleet after battles…)

"neverwinternights","t5_2umg9","Bard makes a very solid base for a blackguard. You can qualify by 8, if you're pure class bard or I think 7 if you decide to dabble in fighter or some other BAB class. However, I would honestly suggest wearing the heaviest medium armor you can with 10 or so dexterity (and Cat's grace), with a shield and a morningstar/mace/shortsword until you unlock all those proficiencies with blackguard  (just take off your armor to pre-buff before a fight). Go in on pumping your strength and just planning to mostly be a bruiser, and you should have Haste if you pure classed bard. Now, at Bard 8/Blackguard 2, you have your pretty good charisma to all your saving throws, proficiency in all weapons and armor, a bull's strength from blackguard that stacks with the bull's strength you get from bard (freeing up an equipment slot for a +Str belt). By this point, you have the base and can build however you want. Your HP will be a little lower, but you'll have a lot more spells and skills than if you went with just Fighter>Blackguard, including access to valuable skills like tumble, discipline, and use magic device. 

Recommendations: I would go at least one more Blackguard level for Turn Undead. At least four to set yourself off to have 4 attacks by level 20 if you otherwise decide to pure class. Take those blackguard levels on feat levels so you can grab Divine Might and Divine Shield (which turn undead completes your requirements for as you should already have Power Attack because it's needed for cleave). Then, I would go hard into bard, pumping your perform and primarily strength (or charisma to 16) so you can keep adding on new spells and increasing bard song, which is bonkers at high levels. I would also get a level of cleric for Extra Turning to make you have many more uses of divine might/shield. 

Other options: I'm not a fan of RDD cheese, but it's cheese for a reason: It's really strong on most things you dump it on, and not mentioning it as an option would be a huge oversight. You can also go heavier in on blackguard, but I think it's less powerful than going more in on bard or RDD.",1725148845.0

I tell him to get everyone out of the house and I'm on my way. Her dad was asleep in the bedroom (he works nights), and he was trying to wake him up. 

When I get there, the dad is awake and we come to find the house doesn't have any gas appliances. We all had a chuckle about it, and chalked it up to teenage overreaction. I carry on with my errand running and hit the pharmacy and grocery store while I'm out. 

I was finishing at the store when I get a call from her dad. Apparently my boy went from laughing and carrying on to a 103.6 fever in the time it took me to get ice cream (cookies and cream Blue Bell, if you're wondering).

I come back, scoop him up and it's off to urgent care. Negative on covid and flu (I thought it must have been flu).  Doc said it's a gastro bug that's really running rampant since school started.

They also did open surgery instead of minimally invasive, I actually felt a thousand times better right after this surgery than I did the first under the same general anesthesia. Anyways, anyone whether active/not as active that has to face the challenge of a torn Achilles knows it can get depressing and VERY boring for a recovery process especially at a young age. Just keep your head up and keep yourself entertained the best you can. It’s okay to be more active and mobile during recovery, just don’t be like me and re-rupture lol.

Based on the title of your post, it appears you're looking for a forgotten series. **When you find the series** you are looking for, it would be appreciated if you added the title of the series as a Flair by leaving a comment that says `solved = series name here`. That way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves. Do please avoid adding additional formatting to your solved comment though as I read based off the source of your comment rather than like a human being. 

If you're looking for a hentai/pornhwa, please take the request to /r/HentaiSource as this subreddit does not allow porn series as top-level posts. If you suspect it may be, please try /r/HentaiSource instead of gambling here.

“Herpes is passed directly from the affected area of skin (which could be the genitals, face or hands), by direct skin to skin contact, with friction, when the virus is present. (See also asymptomatic shedding, below.) It may come back at or near the place the virus was caught. That means that when you catch it genitally, It does not travel through your body and appear on your face; it won’t be in your saliva.”

Better than being denied the opportunity at all through tickets being unaffordable in the first place!

>Though frankly, I don't think ticket prices of £355 are really 'limiting who can go to a concert to the rich and wealthy': it's just a bit pricier than you'd like.)

I disagree, £355 for an evening's entertainment is crazy money for many, although these were not the least expensive tickets on sale. 

>This is a morally neutral statement:

Indeed, and sorry if I came across as antagonistic.

>Your problem here is to define ""face value"" in a legally watertight way.

""Face Value"" is the price the ticket was originally sold for. This is set and standardised for the same type of ticket for a whole artist's tour at each venue (so a standing ticket in Manchester costs the same as a standing ticket in London).

To the rest of your comment with various scenarios, people for more knowledgable and experienced in writing laws would definitely be able to draw something up that suitably covers it all. 

> I don't believe the government should get the right to ban consensual commercial exchanges at a fair market value,

I absolutely disagree (and appreciate you recognized thus) as they are taking advantage of a situation where there is extremely disproportionate supply to demand ratio. The artist don't see any of the profit the scalpers make and people who actually want to go to the concert suffer greatly due to not fault of their own. The scalpers aren't contributing anything to the supply chain here, just pocketing profit, so they can do one.",1725148847.0

You're right, the are.

>Squatters are people who inhabit unused building or land. If they do so notoriously for X time they are able to possess the deed to the land/property. 

That's one of several definitions recognized by the State of California, yes. There have been instances of caregivers being fired but remaining in the home waiting for the homeowner to do so they could claim it. However, ""squatters"" is also the name given to people that aren't looking to take over a property so much as just have a place to stay.

>Tenant rights are rights a tenant, a person who has an agreement with an owner to inhabit a property, have. They do not allow for adverse possession (becoming the owner) but they do prevent illegal eviction.

It’s enough to fat fire in a LCOL/MCOL at your age and given your future family / life goals.

2. I question the wisdom of leaving a role where your gross income is still more than 1/10th your net worth at an age where it’ll never be easier to make this money and balance a life with it. It’s ~25%.

"Glocks","t5_2v6xn","This is why I went with a 42. 43 would’ve made more sense for ammo compatibility, but then the 43-43x grip difference isn’t very much especially if you use a pinky grip/plus 1 mag. Then for that, going from a 19 to a 43x is only 1/4 width and while that would matter a lot for a skinny guy like myself, I felt like I wanted smaller in all dimensions so the 42 made the most sense to have a drastic difference. Now that I owe a 19 and a 42, I know that I do want a 43x for my sweet spot with shorter muzzle for my small body to avoid poking like my 19 can do, thinner profile to help with concealment because despite what people try and say the width does matter on a skinny flat person with no chest, but with those concealment requirements I like the longer grip for drawing.

I’m not mad I ended up with a 19 and 42 first though, they give me extreme opposites for concealment needs of the day, but those have led me to realize the 43x will be my Goldilocks when one day I get that. Then I can get a Micro Dagger C1 slide to slap on when I’m feeling froggy. lol",1725148851.0

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Your post has been removed for multiple reasons. Please make a new post, and be sure to correct all of the errors below:

* Missing location
* Missing r4r tag

Each of these is explained further below; read on if you need clarification.

---

Your post has been removed because you didn't include either a recognizable location, or specify you're seeking only #online, *in the title*. In order to facilitate meetups, you need to specify where you are located. This can be a city, state, region, or country, as long as you're willing to meet people from the entire area you specify. You should include further details on travel arrangements if your search covers an area larger than about an hour's driving distance; posts that fail to do so may be removed!

**If you are not seeking an in-person meet,** please make a new post, but include the #online tag in your post title. Location is not required for Online-tagged posts.

**If you are looking for a meetup,** please make a new post with your location in the title, and be sure to tag the location with a **#** so it is not missed; we recommend the format **#City, State/Province**. For example:

> 22 [f4m] **#Philly, Pennsylvania**. Seeking a hiking partner

In either case, you should delete this old post after you have posted the new one.

---

Your post has been removed because it is missing your age and/or the r4r tag in the title, or the tag provided was invalid. These are required to allow people to quickly identify who you are and who you seek.

Some examples of valid tags include: 22 [f4m], [m4r] *(Redditor/All)*, [F+M4A], [FtM4T/A], [NB4NB] *(non-binary)*;  
See the [community rules](/r/r4r/about/rules) if you need more details or definitions of these tags.

**Common errors include:**

* Don't abbreviate **For** as ~~F~~; this creates ambiguity with the **Female** tag, so use **4** instead
* Don't put ages, traits, emojis, or any other extraneous text in the middle of the tag; age should go before the tag, e.g., **21+23 [MF4A]**
* Don't spell out words in the tags; e.g., use **NB4A**, not ~~Non-binary For Anyone~~
* Don't use ~~W~~ in or before tags, because its meaning is ambiguous; please use **F** instead
* Ensure your age is written, as a number, immediately before the tag; e.g., **30s [M4M]**, not ~~[M4M] in my thirties~~

And I've done my ear stretch journey alone. Definitely bad that I used acrylic originally but that's why I switched to glass and started dead stretching after 0g. All my stretches have been relatively painless from 2g-12mm and it's taken me about 2 and a half years stretching to where they are now from 14g. I always made sure to have a decent amount of months between each stretch and let them heal fully before going up a size, using warm water and jojoba oil for the stretch. The glass is from a shop on Amazon that sells strictly gauges and mock gauges and had really good reviews and all my glassware from them has felt wonderful in my ears. But I do massage them with warm water, nonscented antibacterial soap and jojoba oil every day and on top of that already have naturally oily skin so I've started to draw up the conclusion that I think it could have been a clogged pore that developed into a cyst/abscess or a moisture bumb that occurred over vacation as we went to a couple water parks and spent all day there and my wet hair was tucked behind my ears most of the day from those 2 days.",1725148851.0

This is my attempt to gerrymander as many of the 50 states as possible to be as friendly to Republicans as they can be. Some states will have quite a few competitive districts so that Republicans have the chance of obtaining the maximum number of seats. Others have more safe seats to preserve a strong Republican delegation to defend against large shifts in voter preference. Others do a mix of these.

Please note that this is intended to be unfair, so many of the districts did look wonky. I also had the goal of not making the districts too obscene so that they look like spiders that stretch the entire length/width of the state (in most instances at least).

If you want to examine any state more closely, please drop a comment and I'll reply with a link to that state's individual map.

Both of her kids...my grandchildren whom I dearly live and can no linger see were hospitalized a year apart for ruptured appendix and had complications which kept them each in the hospital over a month w 3 more surgeries in their bowel each.  To not be able to be there for that, ir their birthdays or just to see them, not to have Christmas with them has been a nightmare.  
I saw something on facebook a year ago with my daughters name stating she was missing.  My gut dropped.  I almost threw up.  I read further and realized it was someone who shared my daughters name and middle initial. It took a while for me to settle down.
You can't get back what you miss.  
So what.  They knew someone in your family wasn't honest about their relationship.  Someone u knew and cared about, yes. But what would it have changed if you knew?  Nothing between your son and you or your daughter and you.  The only relationship that should be affected by that affair is the people involved in it.  Not the people on the fringe. Don't let that happen.  You are the father here.  Its up to you to show your children how to love, how to forgive and how in families, you have to forgive a lot to keep a family whole.  You can't change your family. You can keep it good and healthy by being a good leader.  Good patriarch.  That's your job.  Do what you have to do to find forgiveness. Dig deep.  You only get one life to get it right.

As you can tell from the video they weren’t surprised, and neither was I. I wouldn’t expect a CZ shadow to pass either.

Also the reason no one makes double stack 1911s with firing pin blocks is because it makes the trigger worse. It’s a common modification to remove firing pin blocks on CZs and other guns as well. 

With all that said if you are worried about it replace the firing pin safety, it will take much more force to cause it to fire. At least one person has been killed by a CZ because of this.",1725148852.0

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This gets asked a lot, so a quick search can get you a lot of answers. 

Ultimately though, the short answer, as I understand it, is empathy.  I don't need to be taught ethics by religion because I can make judgements through reasoning and empathy, I don't like being hurt, so I avoid hurting others, I don't like having my things stolen so I don't steal, and so on.  I don't behave because I fear retribution, either social, legal, or divine.  I behave because I don't like doing things that upset or harm others.   
  
Humans are a social species, and as such there is an evolutionary advantage to being able to cohabitate with the group peacefully.  If we aren't fighting each other we can focus on finding food, fending off predators and so forth.  You see similar behavior in other intelligent social species like elephants, dolphins, wolves, and so forth.  We trend towards working together because it makes all our lives easier, and ethics arise from behaviors that strengthen the group, and foster peace and cooperation within it.  That's kind of the broader thing at play here.  

Which is to say...in a way, the duty option is probably the closest to what I understand the current scientific consensus to be.  We have a duty to be good because that's what helps the species survive.  If we all work together, we all have a chance to thrive, and thrive in our own way.  If we compete only the most vicious and strong survive, and that makes it much easier for an outside force to come at us in a way we can't adapt to.  A mad max world of strong men may have no scientists, and get wiped out by disease, or poor agricultural planning, or something of that nature.  A warlord can be the best killer in history, that won't protect him from lack of water, or melanoma.",1725148852.0

"aniwave","t5_3oqvb","Honestly the most sad thing of my year actually this site had features that no streaming service has or cares to implement, the community comments, being able to find anime i would have never heard of to begin with, auto skipping and auto next, i even found a way to auto full screen its saddening now that its shut down i think the only anime i will bother to keep up with is one piece now because im on current episode. Farewell everyone this is where my anime journey is ending sadly despite not wanting to, im tired of streaming and constantly hunting down what i want to watch and even then sometimes can never find high quality, this combined with most of the old youtubers leaving, getting arrested, or just plain not uploading same content anymore on top of most movies being dog shit nowadays or remakes of old properties but changed to fit agenda nowadays its just disheartening.

Everyday it gets harder and harder for me to find something thats actually worth watching without being told to shill out money for stuff ill barely enjoy anyways. 

My only solace now is playing old games i remember from my childhood for nostalgic purposes, i do stream them and upload them to youtube in order to fill my time but once thats done and im winding down for the night i go back to having the problem of what the hell am i gonna watch tonight. 

I also like to put things on while doing chores but i end up giving up after 30 minutes of scrolling thinking to myself i could be done already it takes longer to find what to watch than to do my chores its sad truly.

Btw streaming is actually ludicrous position rn because say you have a movie that made 4 movies, there is a chance that they will all 4 be on different services. Even then they also wont stay on them they keep getting traded. If you want more info on streaming and how bad its gotten please go check out gaming dunkeys video he made about it.

And if you just happen to be interested in whatever random games im playing at the time i am HomnixHD on youtube and tiktok i stream on tiktok and upload on youtube and no i dont use the vertical setup i have obs and its 1080p 60fps they are all over 1hour each since its a live stream.

I love you guys and this community i hope you all are able to find a suitable replacement maybe in time i can rekindle my joy of finding a show to binge but as of rn its not worth the effort see you guys❤️",1725148852.0

>#**The Galactic Hub Project**

>**Largest & Oldest Active Civilization**

>11,000+ Player Bases, 78,000+ Subreddit Subscribers, 13,000+ Discord Members

The Galactic Hub Project (r/NMSGalacticHub), founded October 2016, is Euclid's multiplayer hotspot. With a greater concentration of players than anywhere else in No Man's Sky, there's no better location to experience **Civilized Space gameplay**!

A few of our features include:

* **[Chapters](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Project#Chapters)** - The Galactic Hub has a variety of sub-organizations called Chapters, like the GH Exobiology Corps (focused on fauna), the GH Defense Force (focused on defense & combating griefers), the GH Star League (focused on hosting multiplayer ""simulation sports"" competitions), & more!

* **[Colonies](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Project#Colonies)** - In the Hub, colonies are communities of multiple players collaborating in some way. This always includes building bases, which are often built under the same theme. Colonies may be as big as a whole system, or as small as a single trade post. The most active colonies are managed by Governors. Governors are interlopers who volunteer to run a colony. A governor's main focus is keeping their colony active - this often involves writing missions or hosting events for their colonists. Some colonies even have Mayors, which manage even smaller communities known as Territories within a Colony. Anyone may set up their own colony in Hub space and act as a Governor! 

* **Multiplayer Events** - From laid-back [Social Nights](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSGalacticHub/search?q=Social+Night&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) to the NMS take on eSports [Star League](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Star_League), the Galactic Hub has multiplayer social events nearly every week - sometimes multiple each week. Come meet your neighbors!

* **[Economy](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/HubCoin_Economy)** - The GH has its own native currency, [HubCoin](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/HubCoin). It is rewarded exclusively for activity representing the Galactic Hub on various platforms (Reddit, Discord, Wiki, YouTube). HubCoin is never available for sale for dollars, pounds, etc - ""real world money"" is never required or involved. HubCoin is used to facilitate a metagame economy. For example, to earn coin, players can open their own Businesses with in-game locations in Hub space. To spend coin, players might browse our Discord server's Marketplace and buy goods like custom ships, custom companions, services-of-convenience (ie construction materials), or even 100%-free real-world Hub merch. (Real-world merch availability may vary.)

* **[Canonization](https://nmsgalactichub.miraheze.org/wiki/Galactic_Hub_Project#Canon_References)** - Hello Games was kind enough to canonize the Galactic Hub. In other words, we're official in-game content! The ""Pilgrim"" title can only be unlocked by visiting our old capital planet, **New Lennon**. Our emblem can be purchased at the QuickSilver store as a base decal or player banner. We're also referenced in the Mission Board and the dialogue of a Traveller, as well as being referenced in the Waking Titan ARG! 

That's just a quick look at some of our features. We also have interactions with other civilizations, we're a founding member of the **United Federation of Travelers**, and much more - but above all else, what really defines the Galactic Hub is our thriving and friendly community.

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"literature","t5_2qhps","I use the phrase in the most general sense: understanding written communication, interpreting it for others, and to some degree codifying it for more efficient use and broader application. 

For example, a workplace might have process for handling customer orders. Each person knows their part of the process. But if someone talked to the people and studied the documentation, they might come up with a more efficient process, eliminating hand-keying of text and data. Simple tools like excel and access were built to handle numbers, but can be used for text as well. 

There are more automated technologies as well, but they tend to remove the possibility of human interaction, which is the point of communication. When tech can be used to help one person understand a larger volume of communication and then communicate their understanding of it to others more effectively, it’s a great tool. But the thing of value is the human understanding and analysis and interpretation. If there’s a shortage of people with those skills (there is), they become more valuable",1725148853.0

When U was like 13 around Dead Space 2s release I played both the first and the second one. 
It was cool as heck but didn’t scare me aside if 1 or 2 jumpscares.

"FASTNU","t5_2gaque","Yeah, by usually he meant that some universities do take 2nd year results into account given that the results have been announced. For example, fast takes entry test before second year results have been announced so they don't take it into account for admission, but you do need to submit the result once it's been announced and you'll be kicked out if you've failed a course. You'd be safe as long as you pass. On the other hand, there are some universities like maybe Karachi university (idk when their test happens just giving an example), their test happens after the results have been announced, so they do take 2nd year results into account.


TLDR: The second year result being counted only happens if the university entry tests happens if your result is out before the university's entry test",1725148854.0

There's a very subtle hint at it almost being supernatural in a way. You can interpret it however you like. Maybe in the end he was swayed by her confession, realizing he was getting angry at her for nothing, that she wasn't maliciously cucking him, she was just a hedonist enjoying life to the fullest because that's her nature. Maybe she has some kind of insidious ability that makes people fall for her, and after spending so much time around her he finally succumbed to it.

It has been a while since you had a real break, so you decided to go to a hidden beach to get some time to yourself and away from the hustle and bustle of being famous.
But as you got onto the beach you discovered someone was already there and you began to brace yourself for a fan to bombard you with questions or asking for an autograph, but instead it seemed he had no idea who you were nor did he care to find out.
So you decided to make the most of it and see how life would be if you were just a normal person.

Hopefully you like the idea, if so feel free to dm :)

2. Don't get hung up on a singular objective. If something seems to hard for you right now - go find something else. Running away is a top tier strategy.


3. Upgrade your weapons. Not all your weapons but when you find something you like to use, upgrade it as much as you can.  There will be more upgrade materials as time goes on and weapon upgrades will be some of your biggest damage jumps.


4. There are 5 main stats your weapon will work with - strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith or arcane*. I recommend you pick one of strength and dexterity and one of intelligence or faith - then focus on those while not buffing other stats. This will help keep your stats simple and effective with little waste early game - you can always change them all later with a respec.


*Arcane is great but it is a bit less intuitive in what weapons will work for you and their availability. The stats can be more difficult to manage. Use it if you want to use bleed weapons.",1725148855.0

Hello readers, welcome to OCpoetry. This subreddit is a writing workshop community -- a place where poets of all skill levels can share, enjoy, and talk about each other's poetry. Every person who's shared, including the OP above, has given some feedback (those are the links in the post) and hopes to receive some in return (from you, the readers).

If you really enjoyed this poem and just want to drop a quick comment, to show some appreciation or give kudos, things like ""great job!"" or ""made me cry"", or ""loved it"" or ""so relateable"", please do. Everyone loves a compliment. Thanks for taking the time to read and enjoy.

If you want to share your own poem, you'll need to give this writer some detailed feedback. Good feedback explains from your point of view what it was like to read the poem, and then tries to explain how the poem made you feel like that. If you're not sure what that means, check out our [feedback guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques), or look through the comment sections of any other post here, or click the links to the author's feedback above. If you're not sure whether your comments are feedback, or you have any other questions, please [send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FocPoetry).

**If you're hoping to submit your poem to a literary magazine** and/or wish to participate in a more serious workshopping environment, please consider posting to our private sister subreddit r/ThePoetryWorkshop instead. The best way to join TPW is to leave a detailed, thoughtful comment here on OCPoetry engaging seriously with a peer's poem. (Consider our [feedback guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques) for tips on what that could entail; this level of engagement would probably be most welcome here on submissions tagged as ""Workshop."") Then [ask to join TPW by messaging that subreddit's mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FThePoetryWorkshop), including a link to the detailed feedback you left here.

Como alguien que ha vivido cerca de una persona adicta y se ha destruido la familia por sus adicciones te digo que hablas con mucha benevolencia hacia las drogas.

El problema no es la desicion personal de drogarse o no, el problema es cuando no la tienen o ya no pueden pagarla y todo su entorno y hasta los ajenos pagan las consecuencias por eso y de lo que hacen estando drogados.

Una persona con adiccion qué no puede sustentarlo, cae en cualquier cosa. Desde robar, golpear, extorsionar hasta matar, pierden su vida su trabajo y todas las relaciones que puedan tener.

Todos y sobre todo el entorno más cercano vive en un estado de terror y angustia constante, no solo de lo que haga a otros, si no a sí mismo.
Cuando están drogados también es un problema porque no tienen ni el más mínimo control de lo que hacen ni de a quien dañan. Básicamente arrasan con todo.

Y gran parte del problema es que todos creen que pueden controlarlo hasta que no. Y cuando se dan cuenta es tarde. Es como los que piensan "" a mi eso no me va a pasar"", hasta que pasa 

Las drogas son altamente adictivas porque afectan el sistema de recompensa en el cerebro  y en la inmensa mayoría de los casos pasa de ser una recreación inofensiva a una adicción totalmente dicha en menos de lo que canta un gallo.

También muchos creen que hay drogas más ""inofensivas"" cuando no siempre es así. Hay gente que hasta la más ""suave"" los pone violentos y paranoicos, al igual que con el alcohol, que a algunos les pegara bien o para la diversión mientras que otros saldrán a golpear a quien se le cruce. Nunca sabes como te va a pegar pero el daño que genera es inmenso. 


Muchas familias viven en ese problema, no lo románticemos, si fuera tan sencillo e inofensivo,no habría los problemas de adicción que hay hoy en día.",1725148856.0

In all fairness, she really was too adorable and I understand what they meant once I met her. 

Most of my clients travel for work and often don’t have time to respond so I usually stick to 1-2 updates a day with a pic or video and for dogs with poop problems I keep them posted on specific poop info in case they need me to give meds for diarrhea or whatever.

I’m not a vet but I would say don’t cut the skin until it’s dried up and dead which should happen naturally and the raw pad should start to toughen and look normal again but it can take a couple weeks. I personally wouldn’t go overboard with wrapping it either. I use dog or toddler socks and put some vet wrap at the top to keep it on.

It’s super common issue especially with hunting dogs. Hunters will often use things like Tuffoot spray to toughen up their dogs pads a couple weeks before hunting season. It’s likely this injury will keep happening if their pads aren’t used to it so you could try the spray to treat minor abrasions and prevent slipped pads in the future.

To the point that I would get lost in conversations because I was focused on the persons face and trying to mimic their expressions, “they’re saying something funny, smile/laugh now”, “they’re saying something intense, look pensive”, “surprising, raise eyebrows”, “maintain eye contact”. 

People used to think I was very ditzy. It was really frustrating because I knew I was smart and don’t understand why I struggled and came across the way I did. I earned degrees in biology and chemical physics in college and had a 4.0. Not the smartest in the world but certainly not dumb 

I’ll say this too. While I absolutely hate this aspect of reality - I’ve accepted that NTs especially, care about people’s appearances. 

I work very hard on my outward appearance and “blending” because it gives me a little more wiggle room if I miss a cue or say something odd. Believe me I recognize how sad this is when considering the world but it’s a survival mechanism that gives me a little breathing room.",1725148857.0

You can worship a god because you feel a connection, because they represent things you respect or admire, or which you need help with in your life, or for no other reason than you want to. You don't need their permission.

You don't even need to give up Christ, if that's a concern, though you might need to be a bit creative about Biblical statements that there's only one god. There's a whole community at r/christopaganism who don't see a contradiction between Christianity and paganism. From our perspective, Christ is as valid as any other gods, of which there are many. It's Christianity that has the hangup. But if you don't want to worship them, then that's okay too. The gods don't *demand* our worship, and even if we want to, they don't demand we submit to and obey them the same way Christianity does, and won't judge you for leaving if it's not right for you.

Suspect some of their polish/optimization has been lost in patches. I ran D4 well in gptk on that 8gb air too, right up until Microsoft, sorry battle.net, axed that option. I know it’s not as demanding but with the translation layer, that’s impressive. I think you went the right route with GeForce Now.

The MMC is so. damn. cute. Somehow, the chapter in which Clementine sees the younger Iwan for the last time (chapter 37 - The Last Goodbye) gets me the most. It is so sad. The golden afternoon sunlight. Those stupid pidgeons sitting on the AC outlet. Clementine telling Iwan that his future self is going to be amazing. It hits you right in the feels.

Price marked is for the small pots, currency is the Costa Rican Colón which is at ¢519.15 to $1 right now according to google. So the price in dollars is \~$2.89.

Some places have them here for more money because they know people will pay more for them but I bought one pot a while ago from the nursery in my town for less than $1. It was like 1 button with one or two pups.

Yeah, he declined due to reasons you're more than content in ignoring because they contradict your opinion. There's really no point in arguing with you further, as you have no interest in actually changing your opinion or having a discussion. And if you bothered to read the link I gave you, *there was a parade*, they just didn't march side by side. They just erected arches with swastikas and stars for the germans to march under. 

>Give us links to documents, monographs, peer-reviewed journals, or at least just to the text. I basically can't stomach the video format. Practically no videos, except archived ones, are valid sources of information

The sources from the video are cited in the description. If you watched it, the video even cites Zhukov. As for the channel itself, it's one of the most in depth and reliable free sources about WW2. I don't see a point in seeking out the direct documents either, seeing as you have no interest in actually reading what I provide you. 

>Explain it. Did everyone die except the Russians? What kind of Russification under Stalin? On the contrary, small nations flourished under him.

Yeah, the USSR totally didn't violently conquer half of Europe, murder the intellectuals and anyone deemed an enemy, plunder the resources and call it a day.

Or shoot the nap shot from across the map and then try to Jecht shot. Mostly just enjoyed inflicting status that didn't work in early game, and i also really enjoyed getting the key skills for each player, was a fun challenge. I probably put in 100hrs or so to main game and 200-300 in BB, loved that game. I was about 15% through a playghrough when the co-op i was living in kicked me out because i was sleeping at my gf apartment most nights, then the week after i left there she broke up with me.

"progressive_islam","t5_2t8su","Yes. Exactly. This is a solid and sound argument.

Structure of prayer was known before the Quran was revealed and after the Quran was revealed. The Quran references something already known by everyone in the community.

And the the word **everyone** is operative. **Everyone**, man, woman and child, in societies which transmitted the Quran also knew how to pray. It does not need a secret ""chain of transmission"" privy to isolated individuals, and magically conjured up centuries after the alleged fact.

Another thing to consider. Prayer did not start after the ""mi'raj"" \[alleged 12 years into Muhammad's prophethood\]. The very first Sura revealed - Sura 96 dedicates 11 of its 19 verses describing the person who forbid God's servant from praying, and describes prostration as central to prayer in order to become closer to God. The earliest revealed Suras all reference of describe prayer and aspects of prayer (96, 68, 73, 74, 87 ....). Sura Fatiha, to be recited in prayer, was also revealed very early.

EDIT:  Also, surprise, surprise, Hadith has no useful information to actually reconstruct prayer, without already knowing the transmitted form of prayer by observation. This is admitted by [traditionalist Sunni scholars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbrj-BvAF8g), while those who really tried to take Hadith seriously for knowing the form of prayer made an absolute mockery of prayer. For example, see [Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4auGhmeBlw) ramble endlessly about heads, shoulders, knees and toes trying to reconcile mutually contradictory Hadith on irrelevant minutiae like how to orient the palms or how high to raise the fingers or how to spread the feet or where how to angle the toe. Hadith only captures such irrelevant things that people with too much time on their hands argued about at the time of its canonization, and not the already known and undisputed structure itself, which is clear and consistent across all sects as you observed.",1725148859

Every chance they can get they want to go on about how awful it is and what the spartan II's must be going through. No matter how much they bring it up they ever do anything interesting with it. But before that Spartan II's used to be the best of humanity. 

Not just in terms of their physical prowess or mental reflexes, but that despite what they've been through they're still good at their core. That no matter what their humanity is intact, a beacon that others can look up to during a time when it felt hopeless during the genocide of the human race. And it's what separates them from Spartan III's and Spartan IV's.

Now Master Chief had his entire personality smothered and no longer has any form of care for anyone, not even the closest thing to family in Blue Team or the mother figure he sees in Halsey, but an ai he's only known for a few months. That's now the only thing he truly feels anything for under 343i.",1725148860.0

This isn't an MMO or MOBA in which you have to keep up with the meta if you want to stay relevant. This is a RP game and it feels really bad that someone has to ""learn"" how to play a class. This doesn't mean all classes should be simple so everyone can pick them up immediately, but if there's a ton of people that have complains about classes and its always the same few classes that are brought up every time (wizard, gunslinger, and oracle) its likely because those classes have problems that people want to see adressed.",1725148862.0

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","1. I agree on the confession aspect of Deku and Ochako. Normally if the relationship between MC and main heroine didn’t happen I’d be ok with it because usually the heroine has long since accepted her feelings for the MC and they weren’t a conflict in her character(like Hinata) but in Ochakos case the constant reminder that she’s “locking her feelings away” feels like something that should have been talked about in the end because it was a major part of her character for most of the story, it feels like a wasted plot with no real conclusion.

2. I also wonder why it took so long for the suit. The two main things I can think is Number 1: Testing the reason All Might got his suit so quick was because he rushed it and they probably didn’t have the time to go through industry tests and standards to make sure it’s completely suitable for the field, so that makes the suit a risky buy. The Second and more important reason is because the suit HAD to be bought by Class A, to hit home the “How we all became the greatest heroes” message and basically have Class A give Deku their version of “OFA” a power that’s brought together through their own efforts, thematically giving him “his” power back.",1725148862.0

Has an MP mod. Server-authority physics.

No, it does not. There are plenty of videos that highlight how the physics are completely wonky for different players in multiplayer due to desync and a lack of server-authored physics distribution. CarMighty showcases this a lot in his blooper reels for his CarHunt videos (or in the actual videos):

[https://youtu.be/MTlGosc282I?list=PLjgUN3ofSStAIwkbTEA8H-6JRbELHYq4I&t=1011](https://youtu.be/MTlGosc282I?list=PLjgUN3ofSStAIwkbTEA8H-6JRbELHYq4I&t=1011)

>Has multiplayer. Again, server-authority physics.

No it does not. It uses peer-to-peer networking, 

>But fine, if you want an example of an MMO with server-authority physics: Planetside 2.

Planetside 2 does not have physics-based entity interactions nor vehicular physics grids.

If Kubo Saw How much Bleach is wanked he would vomit all his organs and colapse. my boi strawberry isnt multiversal. And you my friend, you need to rethink your whole life. What decision that you made that fated you to be a Bleach wanker here? What grave sin you did that condemned your soul to such a severe punishment?

Before responding to this comment, rethink all of your life choices. Is there really nothing that is more important to you right now than wanking bleach?

Also, I loathe seeing a coworker on their phone at another station while I am drowning.

You'd have to maintain your local license and maybe put up a bid bond, especially on larger jobs, but it's worth a look see. But there may be incentives from the ""small business thing"" which could help as well.  

If you're minority, woman, or veteran owned there may incentives for GCs to pick you over some other company to make up their mandated minimums - so you could be aware of bigger jobs and put together a quote yourself before shopping out to GCs your price.

Estimating is a *lot* of jobs being priced that you never get. Bear that in mind before you get too excited about the *number* of jobs you're getting.  I'd recommend trying to trim the fat internally while you have a good thing going to make yourself more profitable rather than just getting jobs to grind out work.

1. No. Using Sign language does not make you verbal. I’m a nonverbal person who uses limited sign language, and I am NOT verbal. 

2. Nonverbal is not a common descriptor I’ve seen amongst the d/Deaf community? But I’d honestly ask in r/Deaf or some similar community. I’m not deaf so I cannot say. 

3. No. Nonverbal does not mean “without words, therefore you can’t use sign language or AAC” Nonverbal and Nonspeaking are both the same. They ARE the same terms. Nonspeaking was a term MADE BY nonverbal people. It was made for a very shitty reason that I won’t get into here. But yeah. Nonverbal and nonspeaking mean the absolute same fucking thing. 

4. ANY PERSON without speech can describe themselves how they want. Stop taking advice from verbal people that don’t know shit about the life of being nonverbal and without speech. 

Anyways! Yeah. Hope this helps!",1725148864.0

The Vatican and the Smithsonian Institute have conceded that there's no scientific, carbon datable evidence of anything Christian even existed in the first two centuries.

Archaeologists for the Smithsonian Institute have lamented the complete lack of evidence that Jesus or his religion ever existed... The Smithsonian comment...

""The ultimate find—physical proof of Jesus himself—has also been elusory. “The sorts of evidence other historical figures leave behind are not the sort we’d expect with Jesus,” says Mark Chancey, a religious studies professor at Southern Methodist University and a leading authority on Galilean history. “He wasn’t a political leader, so we don’t have coins, for example, that have his bust or name. He wasn’t a sufficiently high-profile social leader to leave behind inscriptions. In his own lifetime, he was a marginal figure and he was active in marginalized circles.”

About historical evidence of Jesus Christ, Smithsonian correspondent Ariel Sabar writes,

""To have scientific, archaeological evidence of Jesus’s presence is not a small thing for a Christian,” he tells me, looking up and thrusting his palms to the sky. “We will keep digging.”

"theravada","t5_2ra0d","Thank you for your response.

 It's much better than simply saying *it doesn't exist, I don't want to know anything about these fables*. You just said you're not sure. Which is very good. The problem is that some people take their personal opinion as truth without providing proof of the suttas. They don't believe in cycles of rebirth, that's okay, but telling others that they are stupid for believing in them is something else. Someone told me the other day that Lord Buddha is just a normal human and the fables surrounding him are false. By fables, he meant his miracles and supernatural abilities. It is correct to believe, but to cause others to reject aspects of the Dhamma is wrong. There are even people who call themselves Buddhists, but for them, the suttas have no value. What is wrong is causing others to reject essential aspects of the Dhamma. The purpose of my post is to inform by judging. I may have said it in the wrong way, but I took it from a Theravada Website with proof of the suttas. I don't understand why some people come into the comments to cause controversy. It's not bad to be a Buddhist diet. We have to be realistic about our goals. If we want Nibbāna, we must accept the possibility that there are many lives and supernatural things. The goal of a Buddhist is to know suffering and how to end it permanently. We can be a ""Buddhist diet"" at first, but if we want to end all suffering, we must accept the possibility that there are things in this world that are beyond our limited senses.",1725148866.0

"4chan","t5_2qh4w","I get your point, but you're missing the core, fundamental aspect that a country provides which no single individual alone can provide: The land to live. The farm land, the fruits and berries, the vegetables and roots, the foundational soil, the calm winds, the sea's breeze, the stormy nights, the blistering hot days, the cool winters, the rainy spring.

You must live on land. At the end of the day, we can remove countries from this equation entirely, and substitute civilization for a small tribe in the middle of the Amazon. They still respect the land they live on; many native tribes naturally create different forms of pagan land-worshipping rituals that exemplify this ""nationalistic"" urge. Land is what facilitates neighborhood, what facilitates community, what facilitates the provision of a home, of food, of safety, of comfort.

The opposite, actually, does not comport. This is why I'll freely observe that a country cannot be called evil. It can, however, be called good; because while it cannot be evil, it can certainly provide goods. It can provide food, land, shelter, and all such things. You argue that it is societies which grant this, but that isn't necessarily the case. Societies provide built homes, but not the land which they're built on. Societies allow you to have friends, but not the land in which you play or meet on, build families on. Societies allow you to have safety and communal protection, but it's the land that gives you all the pre-requisites for such things; the land which roads are built on, which grows the food that feeds your protectors, which provides the pay for their services, and so on, so forth.

The land itself cannot be evil, but it can be good. The country is this land; it's the land that has been given to a nation. Now, I'm not suggesting we *worship* the land we live on, nor am I asking that we turn a blind eye to the evils that actually plague it, nor am I saying that we look away from those that have provided us the goods of this land. It's a both-and project. All good things that happen for a nation are done by people who live within its borders. Even when a foreigner comes and gives your nation something for the sake of establishing a connection between nations; well, I pretty much spelled it out here, no? The existence of nations facilitated that bond, that generosity. It isn't that the nation is solely responsible for this. It's that the nation facilitates all of these boons.

Again, I stress that this doesn't mean we go and worship nations, countries, and borders. I should clarify that, just as I believe many people don't realize they are nationalists, I also believe that there are lots of people who go beyond simple nationalism, and straight up into country-worship. Certain countries do this; not going to name any names, of course, but I'm sure you can think of some. Israel. Uh, \*cough cough\*, or something. Honestly a lot of middle eastern people are responsible for this level of country-worship, though none of them quite so much as the Isrealis, which is a consequence of the way they view the Tanakh after the destruction of the Second Temple and the coming of Christ; but I digress.

The core component of a country/nation is that it facilitates the good which happens within it. Attributing these facilitated goods to the country alone is just as much of a logical error as it is to attribute these facilitated goods *solely* to the people. The people did 100% of the work, and the land provides the ability for them to do 100% of the work. It's a both-and.",1725148867.0

So, you already decided that it's meaningful rather than meaningless, and now we are supposed to confirm your prevalence towards that decision. But if it's *actually* meaningless you will be dissatisfied with all the answers correctly pointing out that it's meaningless.

Given you already decided that it must mean something significant - how are we supposed to know what your own mind takes to be significant? Or do you believe significance is something objectively true out there that exists independently of what you hold to be significant?

But to shed a little more light: Our mind is made up of layers. The outer layers are our verbal and visual thoughts. But there are layers below that are more fundamental. Below those are e.g. geometric shapes, primal sounds, and such stuff, in other words, the fundamental building blocks of thoughts and images. And below those is the matrix of time and space. And below that is the ""I-thought"". And below that is pure awareness. Roughly like that. So, in very brief, your mind just took the elevator and went one floor down to see what's there.

And as for the “TC owes us” debate I’m also pretty on the fence about it. Like I said, I think they’re handling it pretty poorly at the moment but at the same time I fully understand they might just need more time or are having writer’s block or something. Also the fact that they basically HAD to announce they were making silksong waaaaaay. Hornet being in Hollow Knight was a stretch goal they promised on the kickstarter, but when they decided to make a whole new game they had to announce it far too early otherwise it would break customer trust.  Kind of bit them in the ass. I can relate to that. I don’t really hold it against them personally but as a consumer I think that their buisiness practices are just not working for them.

Some of the things it doesn't save you from and makes worse:

* Accidental deletion of data
* Unintentional deletion of data (application/operating system processes that modify files)
* Data corrupted due to virus/encryption trojan
* Live sensitive data being stolen or accessed by unknown parties
* Data corruption over the raid ""controller"" which is usually cheap mobo/os software or a no name chinese company.
* Same device disasters like power surges or components catching fire in the same case
* Wear on the backup drive being identical to the ""live"" drive which increases the likelihood of them both failing.
* Metadata corruption by applications

It could be that the entire Earth is some advanced simulation run by a more advanced civilization. This has less pitfalls but also can lead to nihilism.

Most humans believe they are in a fundamental reality and continue on their day without questioning things too much.

"intj","t5_2qowo","I secretly do love holidays, but I like to celebrate them in my own way. I enjoy having an excuse to do things that are special. And I do love being spoiled. 

That being said, they aren't so important to me that I will create an obligation out of it, which is what people who hate holidays really dislike--the obligation. It feels performative. And there are also high expectations, which if they are not met, certain types of people become irritated and sulky about, which can rub INTJs in particular the wrong way. 

I think I am lucky because I am in a position where my participation in holidays is optional, not mandatory, so if I'm not feeling it, I don't have to engage. Similarly, I find gift giving easy, so when it comes to holidays with gifts involved, it's a pretty straightforward process for me and I enjoy making other people happy with thoughtful things. 

My INTJ partner personally hates holidays but does love giving gifts when it is not expected of him--so we tend to skip birthdays, anniversary etc (we acknowledge it and might spend more time together on these days, but no pressure) BUT will just give me gifts at random based on what he's noticed I need or want.

But after a while, it would just become the status quo. What can be done? If they're much more advanced, what are we all going to do? Run off a cliff like lemmings? Life will move on. We'll express our fears and awe through art. I think new religions might form and old ones would perhaps gain new followers. But overall? Nothing is collapsing. People will work, pay taxes to a government that has lied to them for decades, and form families. People will debate how much more is covered up and the extent of NHI involvement in human affairs. But that's it, really. Especially once the initial panic ends.

Also from Duke! I had a similar experience being FGLI. My senior grades were stellar, but my cGPA and sGPA ended up both being 3.4x. I also had personal circumstances during my sophomore year, which became part of my PS. I took the MCAT once and got a 52x (Duke....overprepares you for certain topics in med school but that's just imo). 

My prehealth advisor actually said I should give up LOL, and maybe he was right. I didn't get in for two cycles, despite a lack of negative feedback from advisors and admission committees post-interview (MD/PhD programs including T10s). My new advisor really pushed for me though, and connected me with someone on the Duke School of Medicine admissions team to purposely give me brutal feedback. The feedback, to my suprise, was not to remediate my GPA, but that my gap years lacked commitments to the community (aka volunteering) and that made me come across as detached. I didn't drop my full-time research job, but I did end up volunteering at two different places in the nights during my third and final reapp. Again, some good interviews here and there, but I chose a MSTP I felt would have truly valued me from the start (to them, I was not a reapp). 

This is all to say: your GPA is fine! I did pretty well for myself I think, and your app sounds a lot more whole than mine. You WILL get into med school. You got into Duke for godsake. Work hard on your MCAT prep, rock it, and keep at it come application season; you will go far.",1725148870.0

"france","t5_2qhjz","J'arrive à apprivoiser des animaux qui sont particulièrement craintifs ou agressifs. Quand un chien est réputé dangereux et se montre agressif avec tout le monde, j'arrive souvent à l'approcher relativement facilement et même à le caresser après un certain temps de mise en confiance. J'arrive aussi à apprivoiser des animaux très craintifs comme des oiseaux, des rongeurs, des lézards ou des animaux traumatisés. Dès que je peux poser ma main sur eux ils ont tendance à se calmer assez rapidement et finissent par se détendre. Même les vétérinaires étaient bluffés quand je faisais des stages chez eux.

En fait je ne sais pas comment le décrire mais j'arrive vachement bien à décrypter le langage et les émotions de certains animaux et à les mettre en confiance, et lorsque j'arrive enfin à les toucher c'est souvent là qu'ils changent complètement d'attitude, mais j'ai jamais vraiment étudié le sujet ou appris à faire ça, ça s'est fait naturellement depuis toute petite, avant mes plus anciens souvenirs. Du coup je ne sais pas vraiment d'où ça vient ni comment ça fonctionne.

Je me souviens que quand j'etais petite j'étais beaucoup attachée à la chienne de mes voisins, une Berger Allemand qui était régulièrement battue et très craintive. J'étais la seule à pouvoir l'approcher facilement, à jouer avec elle, la caresser ou même faire une sieste avec elle. Avec les autres personnes et même les autres enfants, elle se montrait toujours méfiante et agressive (elle a même mordu plusieurs fois).

Est-ce que c'est cette relation qui a créé mon talent ou bien est-ce mon talent qui a créé cette relation ? Je ne saurais le dire. Mais mon talent ne sert pratiquement à rien, puisque même lorsque j'arrive à apprivoiser l'animal, il ne devient amical qu'avec moi et personne d'autre malheureusement. Donc c'est difficile de donner une utilité à cette compétence. Même si j'aimerais pouvoir recueillir tous les animaux qui sont délaissés, ce n'est juste pas possible. 

J'ai déjà pas mal d'animaux actuellement qui sont tous très craintifs à la base mais qui depuis sont devenus des amours qui me réclament des câlins tout le temps (mais que avec moi, comme d'habitude).",1725148871.0

Nu stiu neaparar sex negative cat mai degraba concentrate pe o viziune mai clasica a relatiilor. Adica cu accentul pus pe ""the nuclear family"". Are mult sens daca stai se te gandesti, pur si simplu si eu consider ca asa un om se maturizeaza cu adevarat si devine un adult functional in adevaratul sens al cuvantului. Evident, zic asta cu prezumtia ca aceasta relatie ipotetica este cu persoana potrivita.

I have found the throw sucks on the majority of their offerings but I did smell one in a boutique one time that was very strong but it was floral and I’m not into florals. They do burn evenly for the most part but the sooty wick is a pet peeve of mine combined with the lack of throw. I do like the simple aesthetic of their candles but not worth the price by any means.

"ManchesterUnited","t5_2r3io","He has played his entire Man Utd career as a 6/8 (and much of his Scotland career as a CB). 
Mourinho played him next to Matic. 
McFred became infamous because it was a double pivot that couldn’t retain possession. 
Last season he was used as a second striker when  we’re chasing games but in any game he started it was in midfield particular in the first half of the season when Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo were both injured, our midfield mainly consisted of him in a double pivot with Amrabat or Eriksen. In Ten Haag’s first season, he would play McTominay as a single pivot in the many games Casemiro missed through suspension. 

You’re making me out to hate the guy but this revisionism is crazy. He was an okay player that was fortunate to play for United as long as he did. His best attributes were his stamina and more recently getting into dangerous positions",1725148873.0

* With the new World Level, enemies have gotten quite a bit more tanky. It is more beneficial to bring a DPS like Neuv anyways to quickly wipe them out rather than rely on Yelan's 30-40k.
* If you simply don't ""plunge"" with Xianyun, she doesn't lock onto anything, and she lowers her skill cooldown as well, on the flip side, Yelan actually auto locks onto enemies if she's close to them when she first activates her skill.
* Because Xianyun's skill also gives you some height, it can be used to traverse rough lands quite easily, flying past grounded obstacles that would give Yelan some trouble. This makes up a huge bulk in the overworld, making it very important.
* Xianyun is also capable of flying over smaller rivers. Which is abundant in Genshin. 
* Being anemo, she helps make up 1/2 of the anemo resonance requirement which reduces stamina consumption, increases speed, and reduces skill cooldown, making her an effective pair with other anemo characters with good exploration abilities.
* She's also a healer, absolving you the need of bringing another healer and saving you time from going to Statues of Sevens.

So... Thanks for coming to my TED talk as to why Xianyun > Yelan",1725148874.0

"JamesBond","t5_2rsg9","I'm not a Martin Campbell completist but I did try to watch *The Sex Thief* years ago, in the interest of better understanding how THAT was somehow the movie that the most acclaimed Bond director (of recent history) got his start with. it's very dull, even by 70s British sex comedy standards. I don't think I made it more than 30 minutes into the 'film'. anyway since it's so unlike the films in his filmography which he is known for, I'm not going to rank it with the others.

* I would put CR and his fantastic BBC miniseries *Edge of Darkness* in a tier above everything else, both are masterpieces IMO and can do no wrong.
* *GoldenEye* and *The Mask of Zorro* are just slightly below them, as films that I acknowledge as imperfect but still overall awesome and (more importantly) extremely rewatchable.
* *The Foreigner* and *Vertical Limit* are solid films. VL is one where my rating out of 10 for it can change from watch to watch, but I have seen it many times and for some reason I have a lot of nostalgia for that movie.
* I'm pretty sure I've only seen *The Legend of Zorro* and Campbell's *Edge of Darkness* film once or twice. neither of them made much of an impression but I also don't remember them being egregiously bad.
* *Green Lantern* and *The Protégé* at the bottom of my ranking. both are frustrating watches since they have occasional moments of potential where you can see the seed of a cool idea or a cool set piece, but everything around it (weak acting / weak storytelling) undermines it.",1725148874.0

"videography","t5_2qwgz","Maybe. I don't know. That's such a hard question because it is saying ""would you trade your life for a different life?""

I will say, I got a lot of very cool travel experiences for documentary work around the world. It shaped me and formed my worldview and gave me a diverse set of experiences. Hard to put a financial price on that. I also got to blaze my own trail. While other people worked jobs they did not like, I was constantly learning new things, exploring the ins and outs of other industries to make branding films, and people would generally seem jealous of my day to day. Every week was a new adventure. Shooting bee keepers, then motorcycles, then airplanes, then kitchens and bars. Traveling to 20+ countries. Courtside sports games. Always something new and invigorating. Of course, you tend to share the highlights, right? There were plenty of lowlights that get lost in the euphoric recall: not knowing how to pay rent, getting sued, nightmare clients, calls at 9pm, all nighters, stolen gear, broken gear, back pain, neck pain, hard drive crashes, excrutiatingly long and boring shoots, jerk producers, the whole gamut. Dead end sales pitches, low ball offers, ungrateful clients, always hustling, always selling, always negotiating, always the stress of where next months or next years $$ comes from.

But, there were a lot of highlights, a lot of adventures, a lot of memories, and so on.

When you hit middle age, the tides can turn. You realize you don't just pay the cost in the moment, in the day to day grind. You pay for it in the 2nd half of life, and I have only just begun. But I am concerned....

Other people who worked less and had less talent or smarts built a lot more life equity doing a lot less than me. I had some very high grossing years, but needed to reinvest things back into the business, so my actual personal net was generally modest with a few exceptional years. Now, I get tired easier, and I just can't do what I used to do. I've sort of pigeon holed myself into an industry with bad margins, devalued work, constant hustle, and physically demanding labor. My resume doesn't allow me access to certain lucrative fields I otherwise could have excelled at. I've lost the passion, and also the energy, and also it's not profitable enough to have 1-2 employees or subcontractors to use my experience and vision to direct. So where can I go now? Will I ever get that house I wanted? Retire the way I wanted?

So, it is not so much that I would trade the memories or the energy expenditure at the time, I can recall those fondly enough even with all the downsides. But I am now at the age where you pay for that more than ever. Where the real payment, you discover, is not long nights and bad clients. It's life after 40. Where others invested and saved and built cumulative wealth to an extent I simply couldn't, I now don't have nearly as much liquid cash or assets or property. And it turns out at this age, you just don't have the energy of earlier. The days go quicker and you are less and less motivated to hustle or start over. This is the stage of life where it's pretty nice to keep going to a job that you already know how to do and have a stable income and well rounded resume.

I love (loved?) video production. So I gave it my all. Sometimes an attitude of quality over profit - you know, the love of the art. Every production and edit was a chance to give someone excellence and to prove I am better than my last project. And boy did I deliver quality. Clients LOVED results. But the favor was never really returned, either directly or indirectly. There was no promised land, no mountain peak to arrive at where the cash flowed easier and people stopped low balling me.

You and I are replaceable and disposable. You are running a business first, not a hobby where you get to make money. It may feel fun to have a passion make you an income you can survive on AND buy cool new camera gear. But that feeling will not be with you when you exit your 30s.

So make money first, art second. Business first, hobby second. Turn your projects around quickly, value personal ROI over artful quality (to a reasonable extent). Invest into gear as little as possible, because every cool gadget you value now will be near worthless in several years, even if you can't see how now. Don't be too precious about your edits. They are disposable. And that impossible shot today, it will be an easy to get shot in 5 years. If someone wants a crappy quick churn video, give it to them if its profitable. This is about making money, not art. This is about setting yourself up so 40 year old will say ""thanks for the life platform you built for me"" and not ""well, that was fun, but what do I do now? I'm out of steam with not much to show for it, minus the memories.""

I haven't lived out my second half of life yet, so we'll see how it goes. Ask me in another 20.

But in life, you live with your choices, and they all have ups and downs. I had a lifestyle to envy for many years, now, it is easy to envy the more comfortable life position of others. We'll see what I can make of it!

As for you? Do what you love, but also be aware of what price you are paying to do that - both in the moment, and deferred to later in life. In my experience, building a video production portfolio and business turned out to be building a castle made of sand.",1725148875.0

"realtors","t5_2soln","Well some costs need to be realigned for this to work. I will admit right now the people that buy a house tend to pay (one way or another) for the people that don’t. 

So, for me the question is whether that makes for a better market. For a seller it does, for a buyer it sometimes does. More buyers makes a more competitive market for sellers but buyers don’t necessarily want that. They do however enjoy not having to pay for services unless they buy. Sellers also don’t pay unless they sell with a commission scenario.

A lot of work can go into a buyer. I just discontinued working with a buyer who had been shopping for 8 years. She actually balked at having to pay me under the new rules. Of all people. She’s basically gotten 8 years of free work from myself and a few other Realtors. 

There’s also the pain factor. How much would you charge to have almost every enjoyable life event intruded on by clients? 75% of people get out of the business in the first year because, in part, the lifestyle is unsustainable for them. So, even the prospect of a $60,000  payday is not enough. 

Lastly of course, unless you are a broker you don’t get $60,000 (and brokers have expenses). I’m assuming that’s a double ended deal, which do not happen that often with one agent involved. But let’s say it does, you might pay the broker 20- 30%, then you get to pay the tax man, which in CA is substantial at least 30%, then you pay business expenses and closing gifts. Each month costs money to keep the lights on and running, and you may be paying for past months with that check. 

Average earnings in CA for real estate agents is $85,000 and that’s not rich.  So, I understand what you are saying but in order to make it more fair (in your view) a lot of other costs have to realign and some people who weren’t paying anything for services will have to pay something. Or you will end up talking to a virtual chat box for probably the biggest transaction of your life. That’s what’s really at stake here, we are the last customer service professionals around for the lower and middle class, and that’s probably because the pay is decent.",1725148875.0

At least not until you have had at least two or three long-term relationships that involve being in love with said person.

I'm not shaming anyone, but I'd never come here for advice on anything serious.

People only come here for validation that their choices/opinions/behaviour/, etc., are justified. Most people will ask friends or family. 

Hell, even coworkers or classmates. I refuse to believe anybody that posts here doesn't have better options.

If you, OP, are that insecure over one comment, you should depart, get some therapy, and work on yourself. Your ego is very fragile, apparently.

IF this is even real.

You are barely missing the Tulsa State Fair (by like a week), but you are in Texas the last week of the Texas State Fair. You should absolutely go to Dallas for that.

You are also going to New Orleans one month too early (missing the fantastic Halloween events). You are missing peak fall in Boston by two weeks as well (though should get some red leaves). These aren’t dealbreakers, but I’d move a bit if possible.

For Baltimore, you can literally catch the train to Washington DC and be there in 30-40 minutes. It’s commuting distance. If you haven’t been, definitely add it (Library of Congress, The White House, Capitol, National Mall, etc.).

If you can't manage to get your studies done, how the fuck could you manage a real world job with real stakes?

To answer you question, oo you're stupid for thinking you can take a shortcut to success in the current job market.  

You either accept that or you pursue your own business which presents its own set of hurdles. For one, you need capital. Most people get it from their day jobs (which you don't have), from their wealthy family (which I assume you don't have), or from investors (who will also find it questionnable na you can't even finish your studies and why would they entrust money to someone who doesn't have experience handling it?).

Start simple and progress, in order:

3. 2 functions about either axis (washer)

6. Solids with a given base and known cross sections 

*there are some exceptions, but if you stick to the first few exercises in a section, there usually won't be

As far as drawing, it helps to be able to draw a single arbitrary cross section, which essentially is like a slice of cheese from a deli slicer. A round piece of cheese will give you a disk in your hand. A round piece of cheese with a hollow center will give you a washer

The Behind the Bastards eps on the origins of the illuminati as some dude trying to con rich people into donating to his library are both educational and entertaining.

"RandomQuestion","t5_2r7o5","Key words"" like Jack Reacher""

I have a different perspective than just the Netflix show (which is 10/10 IMO)

There's a book of short stories that goes into his childhood, his teen years, when he correctly identified the Zodiac Killer and got blown off by 911, I believe that was the one where you find out some pretty cool stuff about how his most badass traits were probably more from his mom (nature and nurture wise) than his dad.

Anyway I think that's the one where he finds out he was unknowingly part of a huge number of kids who were psychologically profiled by the US military, he was off the charts.

Have there really been tests, absolutely and some of them may have been just as gray ethically or a lot moreso if you listen to some conspiracy theorists. Did they identify outliers with each of Jack Reacher's distinguishing traits - probably and probably to a more extreme degree. But all of those traits, to that extreme, in one person?

Google all the info you can find about 100 different people who have been awarded the CMH and let's talk.

I think there's people like Jack Reacher. What they do after they are cut loose from a position like the 110th, well, I think that part is well written light fiction, although I won't give spoilers, I think at a certain point in the books it probably gets even more believable.

Also, a ton of the people I have read of in real life were very different than he was physically. Overall, if you add up every detail of every member of the 110th I think absolutely there are people like all the rest, they're rare but they get talked about.",1725148877.0

Plus it's interesting that this is happening coincidentally right as Runway and SAI are moving towards closed, paid models and LAION is working on their own model that meets their own desires...

Is there a concern that models were trained on CSAM? Yes but the probably is far lower than people think. Is the real reason that SD1.5 is popular and they want people to move to new platforms that they have more control over licensing? Absolutely.

That's the main issue that I have, that so often, companies will use CSAM as an excuse to do shitty things, like when Apple tried to implement file scanning of all photos on people's phones and used it as an excuse",1725148877.0

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","Hey there.. I somehow missed this, so thanks for hailing me, u/Slutzlo .

OP - I'm an OC instructor in 2 states, and certifed by 2 of the major manufacturers as well. I've responded to concerns like yours many times before.

My first reaction as a \*person\*, is ""stop being that guy"". You open with looking for a medical exemption. Now, medical exemptions absolutely can be completely legitimate, and it's not my place to pass judgement on yours.

But, you \*open\* by saying you have a medical reason, and your next three paragraphs have nothing to do with that. It's just you trying to reason and bargain your way out of a policy.

If you're out there working the road, and someone says ""Yeah, well.. you have your law.. but I have my reasons.."", you'd laugh at them, right?

That's why you're getting the responses you are.

Now, that aside, if you really think this is the hill you want to take - using a medical excuse (and I'll return to that in a moment) to skip the OC exposure, you're going to have to talk to the training cadre and see what they say.

\*Typically\*, a medical providers note, if specific, is enough for an exemption to exposure.

BUT - that doesn't mean it's consequence free. Being exempted from exposure could mean ""exempted from graduating"" or ""exempted from carrying gear which is mandatory, thus making you not employable"".

Those are common scenarios, but they do happen. And, we can't give you an answer to ""will that happen or not"". You're gonna have to talk to the agency and the training cadre, and ask what their policy is. 

Maybe it will be in your favor, maybe it won't be - but you're gonna have to be an adult and accept it. Your bargaining, as shown in this post, is lovely and all - but nobody was inviting you to bargain their policy, nor are your personal circumstances relevant.

Now.. your ""medical issue"" - OC training when done properly and decontaminated property - doesn't increase the risk of eye infection. Bad decontamination does, as does that stupid ""use milk"" rumor that won't go away.

Do I think you could get a doctor to write that note? Yes I do.

Do I think some acadmies will let you skate cause of your note? Yes, I think some would.

Do I think it's a chickenshit path borne of excuses, since there's not medical need - Yes, I do.",1725148879.0

Axels swords main effect stopped her from healing and caused massive damage since it was (iirc) a legendary weapon.

Her ex was incredibly powerful, having defeated multiple other candidates for demon King and the floor guardians. So Vel (still recovering from everything) having some trouble against him makes sense.

"Polska","t5_2qiqo",">Protesty nie są po to żeby minister zobaczył na żywo tylko po to żeby pokazać sprzeciw. 


To po co w takim razie ten protest był po Ministerstwem Infrastruktury? Skoro chodziło o samą ideę, to równie dobrze mogli protestować gdziekolwiek indziej, zamiast pod pustym budynkiem ministerstwa. Komu ten sprzeciw sie okazuje? Ludziom mieszkającym w okolicy, którym uprzykrza się życie, gdy chcą sobie odpocząć w sobotę od pracy?



Idea takich protestów zazwyczaj jest taka, żeby przyjechać do Warszawy i wprost okazać rządzącym swoje zadowolenie. Nic tak nie robi na wyobraźnię, jak tłum niezadowolonych głośnych ludzi stojących Ci pod oknem. Idealna sytuacja to gdy przeszkadza im się w robocie hałasem, więc z braku laku zejdą na dół pogadać z protestującymi. Tutaj takiej szansy nie ma.


No więc jest jeszcze szansa, że w takiej sytuacji ten protest rządzący zobaczą, bo będzie o nim głośno w mediach. Ale tak tutaj nie jest, protest był na tyle mały i nieistotny, że napisały o nim tylko dwa portale: wPolityce oraz wyborcza (a ta druga schowała artykuł za paywallem, więc jest niedostępny dla wielu).



Sam nagłówek tego artykułu to: ""poszli wykrzyczeć rządowi co myślą o *Kredycie na start*"". No to sugeruje to, że jakoś dialog z rządem był zamierzony. A tu był głos wołającego na puszczy. Chyba organizatorzy nie mają doświadczenia w organizowaniu takich imprez.",1725148880.0

"AskOldPeopleAdvice","t5_2jx9b6","Well, first of all, if you can thrive in NewYork City you can thrive in many cosmopolitan cities across the globe. Like Bogotá. Your family should know that.

When I was a kid way back in the 1950s my dad had a gig as a US consul, posted to places like Lagos and Beirut. They were fine. Introduce yourself to your neighbors and you’ll be accepted. You got that part. 

But my Dad’s mom used to turn up unannounced and stay for a month. This was VERY hard on our family; she was very needy and had some substance issues. Grand adventure for her, taking a steamer or an airplane that stopped for gas in Labrador and again someplace in Northern Scotland. But huge pain in the ass for my mom. I used to listen to my parents argue and say things like, “our kids must be disillusioned.” Real pain dealing with an alcoholic guest in a majority-Muslim city. They tried to talk her out of doing this, to no avail.

I tell you this because I think you’d be very wise to have the conversation with your parents about visiting you, instead of just trying to put yourself out of reach. For one thing, the world is pretty small now, and out of reach you will not be.

For another thing, if you live as an expat there’s no point in fighting with your parents every step of the way. You may have to say something like,

“my dear parents, this is way I am choosing to live my life. I have thought this through carefully and I am willing to share the reasons for my choice with you. But let me be very clear about this: don’t try to pester me into changing my mind, because I will not change my mind and pestering will cause unnecessary conflict between us.

Stay true to yourself and that’s all you need to do. Don’t forego your progress, you don’t know if he will ever be able to meet you where you are, and that is okay. Time will tell.

"centrist","t5_2qx8j","I didn't downvote you since you seem to be new here and weren't commenting in bad faith.  I will make an effort to explain.

first of all, centrism doesn't mean ""I'm still trying to decide, and therefore would give both candidates equal consideration and benefit of doubt"".  The proper categorization of the latter is Undecided, which seem to be where you are, and that's perfectly fine.  It's just not what centrism is.

What centrism really means:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism

basically:

1. people who hold a mix of center-left to center-right policy positions.  The most common examples are pro-2A or fiscal conservatism, but otherwise socially liberal.

2. support gradual change, as opposed to no change at all, radical change, or regression to outdated values.

3. strong defenders of the integrity of democratic norms and decorum.

this is why this sub is overwhelmingly against Trump, who made multiple attempts at illegally undermining the foundations of our democracy for his own personal gains.  This has nothing to do with being ""leftist"", which the majority of people here aren't.

we tend to believe that as long as our democratic institutions remain intact, we can always figure out policy disagreements later.  Democratic backsliding on the other hand is irreversible, as evidenced time and again in failing democracies around the world.",1725148882.0

Started skipping school and trying to drink/do drugs in 6th or 7th grade, barely graduated high school. Kicked out of mom’s house, then dad’s house- technically homeless for a time when I dropped out of college and joined the military. Which ended up being the best possible outcome because I finally mostly got my shit together and now as a civilian am a fully functional adult who is self sufficient. But I have lamented about my wasted potential and wonder what I could have done/been if I had any aspirations or concept of the future. 

Ultimately I cope by trying now. You can’t go back in the past and what’s done is done. All we can do is our best today.",1725148883.0

"Cardinals","t5_2r7tu","Kind of like how everyone expected Heyward to be a power hitter. The guy has had a fine career, but he topped 20 homers just twice. Walker could have a good career, too, but a lot of fans seem to expect prodigious power numbers. That might never happen. 

If you take away Walker’s 1 season at Springfield, he has a good half-year in the low minors and mediocre results at Memphis. Of course, you can’t just cherry-pick the stuff. Plus, he had a solid 2023 in STL. 

There’s no doubt that he has talent, but he’s not in a good place at the moment. Out of 6-7 swings today, he made contact once. Perhaps the league adjusted to him, and now he has to make changes. It remains to be seen whether he can do so. I don’t have a lot of confidence in the system and the ability of the coaches to help him adjust. Perhaps a visit to Driveline and/or some big-time work can help him get back on a path to success.

"DarkTide","t5_2t7ck","Smite is very safe in that it auto cancels if peril hits 100%. Other warp attacks like brain burst can *activate* even if you hit 100% and you'll be fine, like brain burst. Then there are warp attacks like Trauma Staff that can detonate you even at 97%ish. It's not intuitive but you'll get a feel for it the more you use certain things. In general, warp can hit 100% but it's the *next* warp generating ability that kills you. Another example is using a Force Sword Psyker push, by holding the shove you can stagger a much larger area but it costs a very small amount of peril. If you're at 100% and do this, the warp takes you. 

Also, there are talents that relieve peril on kill that can save you even if the overloaded animation starts. That's not what's in your attached video, but it's worth mentioning.",1725148884.0

The entry level floor of marketing is that people need to know what this game is.  Next step is to tell people a story - when they buy this game, what cool thing are they going to do?  Play with friends?  Have some cool plays?  Experience a gripping story?

Nobody knows.

And to make it worse, the press is feeding off of the failure and Sony & devs are (in my view, at least) completely radio silent.  **Yet another marketing failure right before our eyes**.  They could have said *something* strategic about the launch and tell people what their plans are.  Do a free weekend, give the early users some goodies to say thanks, pay for streamers to play their game.

Sony doesn't care and has abandoned this game.

It's bewildering - sure, don't throw good money after bad.

I've had the same nightmare for a while now. It doesn't always start the same way, but every time it ends with HER showing up.

It all started when I turned eighteen, after celebrating my birthday I went to sleep. In my dream, a girl from a party appeared and my own ERECTION almost woke me up, but then something terrible happened. Just when I wanted to kiss my sweetie's full lips, she turned into City Mayor Alice Guo. I screamed and woke up all wet with a swollen genitalia. On the bedside table next to the Bible was the BBM sticker. I got out of bed and threw it in the trash, and went back to bed.

The next night the same thing happened, in my dream I was a brave knight who saved a lady in distress from an evil dragon and just when the lady gave me her scarf as a sign of gratitude she turned into City Mayor Alice Guo ! ""Now that you have turned 18, I expect you to vote for me. Or maybe you are CCP spy?"" She snapped at me. I couldn't believe my eyes. I woke up and rubbed my eyes well to make sure I was awake. Just when I thought everything was fine, I saw BBM sticker on the Bible.

THREE WEEKS have passed since I became an adult and every night I have the same dream and every morning that BBM sticker that I throw away finds its way to me. I don't know what to do anymore, I'M DESPERATE! My girlfriend thinks I'm secretly gay, so that's why I'm behaving so strangely, my parents think I have a girlfriend, and my boyfriend thinks I'm cheating on him. My whole life has turned into a huge nightmare because I don't want to vote for Alice Guo. The only explanation I have is that the city mayor is using INCEPTION to instill in me the idea to vote for her, but that sounds too CRAZY to be true. Does anyone have any advice for me guys I'm DESPERATE! Please help me!

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","According to General Mark Milley and Eric Schmidt, a longtime investor in defense technology companies, war has always spurred innovation. But today’s shifts are unusually rapid, and they will have a far greater effect. 

Future wars will no longer be about who can mass the most people or field the best jets, ships, and tanks. Instead, they will be dominated by increasingly autonomous weapons systems and powerful algorithms.

Unfortunately, this is a future for which the United States remains unprepared. Its troops are not fully ready to fight in an environment in which they rarely enjoy the element of surprise. 

Its jets, ships, and tanks are not equipped to defend against an onslaught of drones - weapons that don’t cost nearly as much. 

The military has not yet embraced artificial intelligence. The Pentagon does not have nearly enough initiatives aimed at rectifying these failures—and its current efforts are moving too slowly. Procurement procedures are slow and unwieldy. 

It’s not about patriotism, and has nothing to do with whether or not the United States is currently at war.  

To avoid becoming obsolete, the American military needs to make major reforms now. Failure to do so endangers not only the military, but civilians as well as fighting becomes more and more urban. 

Another reason to get out in front of the tech according to General Millet and Schmidt is that the rise of AI warfare opens a Pandora’s box of ethical and legal issues. 

An autocratic state, for example, could easily take AI systems designed to collect intelligence in combat and deploy them against dissenters or political opponents.

In the worst-case scenario, AI warfare could even endanger humanity.

Great powers that possess formidable military technology almost always have an overlapping interest in keeping it to themselves.

Even if China won’t cooperate, the United States should ensure that its own military AI is subject to strict controls.

- \[ \]  It should make sure AI systems can distinguish between military and civilian targets.



- \[ \]  It must keep them under human command. 



- \[ \] It should continuously test and assess systems to confirm that they operate as intended in real-world conditions. 

And the United States should pressure other countries—allies and adversaries alike—to adopt similar procedures. If other states refuse, Washington and its partners should use economic restrictions to limit their access to military AI. 

The next generation of autonomous weapons must be built in accordance with liberal values and a universal respect for human rights—and that requires aggressive U.S. leadership.

Leadership requires being out in front, not waiting for a war to start in order to play catchup.

In any case I would pay special attention to starch vs sugar.

There are plenty of vegetables with carbohydrates that are extremely low in sugar, they're mostly fiber and starch

Cabbage, by gram carbohydrate, is overwhelmingly sugar


When you start getting into higher carb amounts ( 40, 50, or more grams ) the type of carbohydrate is very important to stay in ketosis

If I told you to mix 50 grams of table sugar in with 20 grams of fiber from a fiber supplement I doubt you'd consider it keto 

50 grams of sugar from sugary vegetables (cabbage, onions, tomato) is not different.",1725148888.0

I used to be pretrib but then I started thinking about Goshen.  How God sent the plagues to Egypt and protected the Israelites from them in Goshen. Then there are other verses that make me think that pretrib is not exactly right.  Like how unbelievers will think that they are doing God a favor to kill believers. 
And that when Jesus returns everyone will hear Him return.  
So I don’t know. Maybe some believers will be taken pretrib some midtrib and some others post trib!  That would really serve us right for arguing about it all this time.  I think it’s good to discuss it but it’s not good to be so closed minded about it that we can’t listen to others thoughts. Because we don’t know.

 Really good to push enemies up a hill or down a slope
Floor freeze, same deal... Directional... Can perma stall a husky husk if you do it correctly. 
Wall darts , shoots 6 darts that can all Crit and 3 tiles but cannot pierce multiple enemies 
Broadsides ... NEED A WALL IN FRONT TO BE EFFECTIVE. at least 1 or 2 tiles... Can get away with 3 but anything above that is a no no 
Tar pits , great for stopping smashers in their tracks 
Ceiling electric field , amazing trap that can go 2 tiles up and can be energy and nature and has excellent damage 
Wall Dynamo , pretty decent trap for half walls I'd say and hits in a one tile area I believe and deals energy or nature damage

"linux4noobs","t5_2qy7t","**Learn the Basics:**

* Before switching to Linux, check out [The Grasshopper for Linux](https://linuxjourney.com/). It’s a great way to learn basic commands and understand how Linux works without the risk of messing anything up.

**Choosing a Linux Distribution:**

I recommend starting with Fedora. It's user-friendly and a good choice for beginners. You can choose between different desktop environments:

*  KDE: A customizable and powerful interface. [Download Fedora KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde/)
*  Cinnamon: Simple and easy to use. [Download Fedora Cinnamon](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/cinnamon/)

**Setting Up Fedora:**

* After installing Fedora, follow this [Fedora Post-Install Guide](https://github.com/devangshekhawat/Fedora-40-Post-Install-Guide) to set everything up. Since you’re not using GNOME, you can skip the GNOME-specific steps.

**Check Game Compatibility:**

If you're into gaming, make sure your games will run on Linux. Visit [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) to check compatibility.

**Browsers on Linux:**

* Linux supports all major browsers, so you’ll be fine. I recommend using Firefox because it’s easy to use, and it won't have restrictions like Google Chrome might have.

**Stay Secure:**

*  Keep your system updated.
*  Avoid clicking on suspicious links.
*  Use an ad blocker for safe browsing.
*  Consider using a password manager like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to keep your passwords secure.
* [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/) is another tool if you feel unsafe when opening a package.",1725148889.0

Check for any contact sensitivity across their body with light touch, anywhere they don't want you to touch them or be near.


See if opening the door to outside makes it worse, if there is a noise or sensation they feel that you don't pick up on that is amplified by the door being open.


If they are not eating or drinking regular amounts, or using the bathroom as needed, then please see a vet.


Something small you can do to relax them, regardless of the source of their discomfort, is to employ basic t-touch ear massage. This is one of the most effective instant-destress techniques I use with anxious animals, primarily dogs. I will link a picture with an explaination on it for you.


The wrap can also be used, any long piece of flexible fabric will work, from a pair of leggings to an ace bandage to a twin bedsheet. While the aim is to be snug, you want to be sure you leave room for breathing and movement, and never leave them unsupervised while in a twrap.

E pior, algo que me faz mais confusão ainda. A criança não foi bem entregue à mãe… a menina foi praticamente entregue a outra familia completamente alheia.

But the dating game is fucked. And i still hold hope a person I met after my ex (ended it because I was learning I was still healing from the sexual trauma from my ex. And now the guy I was with.. the best person I had... and I didn't want to hurt him more or give him sexual trauma because my absuive ex of 5 years had conditioned me mentally to feel repulsed with myself and hate myself for wanting/having good sex), will reach out and we can try things again now that I am in a better space mentally and .. *ya know..*.

I've been using the dating apps again, and it's such a mess... Im slowly giving up hope on finding someone, especially the guy I really, really fell hard for, and it hurts because my last long-term relationship was an abusive man and the best man who truly felt like the one to me... I met after leaving my ex and at the wrong/right time. Like he was literally perfect in every way.

I mean, who knows, maybe me and him will match on Tinder again, but I doubt it.

It could also be a fried ficm, they can block all data lines to the PCM if they let go, and it's not uncommon on 6.0s for the ficm to go shortly after installing new injectors.

It has been a while since you had a real break, so you decided to go to a hidden beach to get some time to yourself and away from the hustle and bustle of being famous.
But as you got onto the beach you discovered someone was already there and you began to brace yourself for a fan to bombard you with questions or asking for an autograph, but instead it seemed he had no idea who you were nor did he care to find out.
So you decided to make the most of it and see how life would be if you were just a normal person.

Hopefully you like the idea, if so feel free to dm :)

Sometimes his words are actually taken out of context. Other times he does say exactly what he means, and it's obviously horrible, so people make excuses for him.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I think it's a reasonable response given what you're going through, or might have gone through in the past.

I'm a student paramedic, I see people who are deemed 'regulars', are constantly in and out of hospital and sometimes calling multiple times a day.

Often, there is a social background. I have gotten to know of a few of the people that end up in this cycle. 

One of these people had previously spent years in the prison system, and since getting out has been homeless or staying in temporary accommodation such as hotels. He believes he is unwell, and he is, but will purposefully act to excacerbate his symptoms to get an ambulance and attend A&E. 

Given his experiences of being institutionalised, I can see how the hospital and the care that we give him can feel familiar and comforting.

It is very difficult to formulate a plan for people like him. His needs are, while partly medical, also heavily psychosocial.

If he were to be living a happy and connected life, without the burdens of his past, he might not be in this position.

There are plenty of others, and many of my mentors and colleagues can be very understanding and sympathetic. The main frustrations lie in the fact that we can't do much to help. We can't make him go through psychological treatment or make him access social support. Bound by medical protocols and the threat of not covering your arse, he ends up back in and continuing the cycle. 

To not feel safe, not feel supported, to not be recognised in your struggles and wins, not feel like you can put the weight down and have someone else carry you for a moment, to feel as though you need to take a time out on life just to catch your breath. These are all understandable reasons to be longing for some sort of care, such as that provided in hospital.

It might be that you've never had the chance to experience this before.

While 'normal' is a questionable concept, I'd certainly say this is reasonable and understandable. 

I know it's much easier said than done, but take a look at your support network. Are there social prescribing services you can access? Can you be referred for therapeutic support?

Peer support is one of the biggest contributors to healing and improving mental health. I know what a struggle it can be to find these people, but you can't find them if you don't try.

The social prescribing I mentioned can often refer you to groups and social activities where you can meet like-minded people. I would recommend at least asking for a referral for this and seeing what they have to offer.",1725148891.0

When he asked to postpone our date for New Year's Eve, I sent him a text saying I enjoyed getting to know him but I thought we should end our relationship because it was the third time he had cancelled on me and I didn't like being treated that way.  He texted back and said he agreed and that he enjoyed getting to know me too and apologized for the way he treated me.  And that if things worked out he wouldn't mind going out on another date.  I didn't answer him, but I didn't block either.  I wasn't afraid of him stalking or retaliating and I didn't mind speaking to him again, but I wasn't going to date him unless he treated me better.

On the other hand, biology (and I mean medicine basically is just applied human biology) is still completely open. We understand a few basic mechanisms, but that's basically it. Which honestly to me is very surprising,  like why tf have there been people in the past who where more Interested in putting massive resources  into finding out what the gravity  on some planet millions of light years away is or some shit than finding out how to be attractive and healthy forever. But anyway, biology is the big open book now. It's the only one of the 3 big natural sciences that leaves humongous room for exploration. 

And there's interesting new approaches and discoveries that are in their early stages. But tbh, I don't think we'll get immortality or an end of aging in our lifetime. And if we do, we'll probably all be old as fuck then and won'thave access to it, or it won'twork on us anynore.

I don't think this is the case at all.

I personally don’t enjoy texting as a form of getting to know people, and unless I know the person it’s harder for me to engage with strangers via text even if I’m excited about them. Especially if they don’t ask questions I can really engage with, give me a lot to work with, or I put effort into a longer message and I get short replies. And tbh I mostly see texting as a way to exchange quick information, meme’s/funny stuff/articles, keep in touch with long distance friends/relatives, or if I have no choice because most people only want to text. 

But I know I’m like this and not everyone is, so I will communicate that I’m a slow texter or prefer phone calls when numbers are exchanged with new people (unless it’s a dating app when I did that, cuz you have to try).

"DevilMayCry","t5_2tx5b",">Yes, because he was taken off guard, if mundus or argosax were to take Dante off guard the same would happen.

Don't know why you keep saying he was taken off guard even though it was in the middle of a fight. You ignore the fact that I brought Abigail and how he hit Dante with numerous of attacks and Dante laughed it off and Abigail attacked him while he was mid sentence. Mundus nor Argosax would be able to do anything just like Abigail if they caught Dante off guard because the power gap would be too great.

>Or he underestimates them Enough for them to land a solid hit on him, which is what happened with the savior.

Again, Abigail situation, Abigail caught Dante off guard and his attacks did nothing but made Dante laugh because of the power difference. By DMC 2 Novel, Dante called the power of a demon king a disappointment. If the Savior wasn't even demon king level then no attack from it wouldn't have even fazed Dante, off guard or not.

>Whenever Dante takes a fight seriously he DTS, as seen in dmc 5, Dante's attitude towards an opponent he can't really beat is not the same as when he faces a regular opponent (again, urizen is proof of this, when Dante figured he couldn't take him on there were no jokes thrown he just went for the kill and failed) 

First, that's not true cause he started taking the fight with Chen the Cannibal seriously but didn't DT and Imma bring up Chen later. Dante was taking the fight serious from the moment he confirmed it was Vergil, after he said Jackpot his face was serious, hell, from the moment V told him it was Vergil he was serious but he didn't DT until the second round. He wasn't serious cause he couldn't be at him, he was serious cause it was Vergil. Same with Mundus, he was serious about Mundus way before the fight because Mundus was responsible for the attack on his family. The only time he took someone serious that he didn't have an emotional drive towards was Chen.

>He used royalguard to block an attack from agnus in the very same book you are referencing, dreadnought is a technique that comes from royalguard.

He used royal guard in that fight to destroy Agnus ego, Agnus was bragging about the amount of power he absorbed from the Hell Gate and saying even the Son of Sparda couldn't do anything to him. Dante literally stood there and acted defenseless to taunt Agnus into attacking him. Then he uses royal guard to take zero damage, making Agnus confused and angry. Please use context next time to try and prove a point.

>Let's do some math shall we, in order for the savior to have enough power to rival the demon kings he would need to have full control of the sparda and completely have absorbed Nero.
We know that he didn't absorb Nero because if he did Dante wouldn't be able to release him (since Dante can't use the Yamato to the extent Vergil does where he can separe concepts from one another with it) , and we know that the savior/sanctus didn't have access to the full power of the sparda because if he did Nero wouldn't have survived that fight.

This is just wrong, the full power of Sparda dwarfs the power of a demon king. It's crazy how much you are downplaying the power of Sparda. Let's bring up the DMC 2 Novel again, you know, the novel where Dante states that demon king power is disappointing. In this novel, he fights a version of Mundus that's vastly more powerful than the original and who became a literal void hence why we call this version ""Void Mundus"". Dante no diffs this version and why he says the power of demon kings is disappointing. In the same novel he fights Chen the Cannibal, Chen absorbs the Beastheads and uses the power to give himself 70% of Sparda's body and power. With this, Chen was able to contest Dante and even managed to temporarily nullify his regeneration and break Dante's arm. Dante struggles against Chen for a bit before he eventually overpower him. Chen with 70% of Sparda's power was a harder fight than a much stronger version of Mundus. 

Dante vs Void Mundus: no diff in Dante's favor
Dante vs Chen: high diff in Dante's favor

Now if we look at Sanctus and the Savior, he wasn't getting the full power of the Sparda but he was getting a fraction  of it which would still put him above demon king level. Then on top of that, the Savior itself had a millennia worth of demonic power stored inside of it. Also, Nero was completely absorbed and dissolved by the Savior, the connection he had with Yamato separated him from the Savior. You forget that the swords have some sentience and can somewhat act on their own. Back to the Savior and it's power, on top of all of that power it already has, it had Nero AND Kyrie with their love for each other being a use power booster, that's why The Savior was so impacted when Nero was separated from it. Nero's power AND his heart were a huge factor. With all of that information, it's completely idiotic to say the Savior isn't at the very least slightly above demon king level. There are TOO many power boosts aiding the Savior to say that it's below demon king levels of power.

>Plus the sparda itself isn't that far removed from the power of demon kings, it's actually pretty relative to them, so if sanctus is using the incomplete power of the sparda he wouldn't be above the likes of demon kings to begin with.

And I already touched up on this but I'll say it again, the full power of Sparda dwarfs that of demon kings cause as we see with Chen, him 70% of Sparda's power completely dwarfs the power of Void Mundus who is vastly superior to OG Mundus. 

70% of Sparda's power >>>>>> Void Mundus >> OG Mundus/Argosax/Abigail",1725148894.0

"Granblue_en","t5_3e3se","There are a few cool ideas I have seen floating around for 0-1b. Here's what I remember.


If you have Hrunting, 0b should be fairly feasible with endgame grids.


Weaker grids or rosters can add, as Hrunting glorybringer gives 1t assassin on abi1, that.


Without hrunting, 0b is tight and a bit RNG prone. All the ones I seen so far require Sabrina, SBelial, SBubs, and no Kag. The one I got working is soldier.


For 1 buttons, you can try


- Split attack with false opus mh, prolly the easiest. Got it working with 2 kag
- 000 call attack 1b1c, needs 250 opus, baha 240, baha 250 support. Technically least asset loading. But expensive summon wise.
- SPholia tag team has lowest lockout
- Spholia atk usually is a decent strat
- bubs atk. Thankfully, bubs shouldnt force od anymore
- flb shiva main atk if your roster is weak but your grid is decent.
- nekomancer scratch post attack...this one was a bit cursed


Some of these may need smandrake flb.

You're underestimating the importance of information from common folk lol. Why do you think looking for information in a tavern is a common fantasy trope?

Because even rumors/information is a viable starting point to collect intelligence from. Intelligence networks don't only collect information directly from the top; it could also mean interpolating habits/plans/movement from things people say. Why do you think Yelan wears disguises and mixes in among normal people? Ningguang even utilizes children for information. Inazuma has the Shuumatsuban. Fontaine has the Marechaussee Phantom.

Intelligence networks aren't exclusively for top level information, those Fatui agents are in the city for grunt work and for monitoring events and movement in other nations. Information like that makes it easier for covert operations to be conducted without suffering international backlash.",1725148895.0

Aside from 4chan, he does not appeal to anyone else. He's deeply offputting to a wide cross-section of broader society. Women have no reason to like this guy and neither do liberal-leaning men but it goes beyond that. 

A lot of old-school conservatives probably don't like him either. He's an unfunny socially awkward loser type who can't hide the fact that despite these things he thinks he's the only one who 'gets it'. Also, even to some conservatives, the endless obsession with women's reproductive cycles gets fucking strange after a while. While a lot of them are not every conservative is a weird quiverfull fundie.

He's a misogynist with mommy issues, there is no broad appeal to a person like that.",1725148896.0

Tape the edges and (if you’re in a place that has four seasons) you can stick them in an unheated area. The fleas will die from the cold if they survived the wash.

Well .... then just keep doing that. Then if she takes you back that's when you reestablish some trust and some pleasant times. 

Only then do you ask her if she wants to know more then she already does. 

  
You could also be very mild after she mentions talking to her sister, ""Hows \_\_\_ doing?""

That way if she says something like, ""\_\_\_\_ thinks her husband is acting weird and it might be an affair.""  You know that it's already a thing sorta out in the open. 

Some women have a real hard time with affairs that are public and prefer things to be handled privately at first. If the sister is already talking to your fiance and your fiance talks to you about it then you have an opening to probe your fiance for her interest in learning more. 

  
Pretty complicated .... very chess like strategic moves on your part. Best to keep focusing on sobriety

"LateDiagnosedAutistic","t5_7cmjbj","Hey friend. I'm sorry you're dealing with this. I recently dealt with a overwhelming project at work that was photography related. All bc I told my boss I loved taking pictures aka was not hired for this particular job.  I was handed a camera ihad no idea how to work and told we need 20+ pics of 110 1-4br oceanfront condos. I'm so thankful to have work I just did whatever was asked.

I set myself so far back trying to get this complete. I would get dizzy, nauseated feel like I was going to pass out. I couldn't focus looking through the lens. It was too much so overwhelming 😫 

I pushed past this, used headphones with nervous system calming music, brought snacks to have every few hours, took meds, took breaks walking onto the patios and deep breathing,  nothing really helped. What I loved had turned against me. My body started shutting down, I got very sick, fibro flare, daily migraines, ect ect. 

Point is, you can keep pushing yourself, but if you are like me you are getting overwhelmed to meltdown and ignoring it and the more it's ignored, the worse the effects on my health. There is no end in sight on your project and the bookstore is no longer the safe space it was. Only you can decide if you can handle it, but for me, it would be too much if physically I continued to deteriorate. My project had an end in sight, and I finished it eventually, but I told my boss I needed to slow wayyyy down and things got better. 

I don't have an answer as you will need to weigh out the pros and cons but i do know not all jobs are for me. I have done many different types of work and usually if it's too much on me, I have to find something else or my health deteriorates quickly. Good luck.🌻🌈",1725148897.0

This always presented to me as lower back pain after working out here and there, but it was this past February after a kickboxing class that I just had the pain going into the groin from the back and it just got progressively worse I’ve done physical therapy. I’ve done the Cortizone shot. I’ve done the iliopsoas bursa injection & pelvic pt . My quality of life is horrible because of this so again that’s why I am going to do the surgery. I also have impingement on the right side, but it’s not like this so I have to do the left right now. If I were you, I would try Physicsl Therapy and see how it goes. Even maybe try Pelvic Therapy . The physical therapy that I’m doing now before surgery is just core strengthening and stability exercises.

If anyone cares,

Axl is more of a midrange zoning high damage guy in AC+. He has some nice hitconfirms into combos, some high damage stuff from his anti airs and even more so from a grounded hit. He also has some nice defense with a frame 2? Parry. Its either high or low and allows a combo. He also has a frame 1 autoguard with a follow up hit or super that deals with highs and mids. He also has a frame 4? Throw invul pseudo dp.

He mostly atruggles with commital, his offense needs him to commit to long arse normals, his fastest attack being his frame 5 5K. His defense is the same, high commital except for when you can use the gorilla stick autoparry and just not care.

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","From what I understand, the cravings for sex come from multiple places. For a lot of us, it's a misplaced search for acceptance (only misplaced if the connections aren't intimate). 

I'm avoidant attachment. My sex drive, my kink drive, all skyrocket when life isn't right or my connections aren't stable. So, it's unfortunately addiction if I lean in when craving it. 

But it's immense joy and life enrichment when I don't need it but I use it with someone I feel genuinely connected to, and I don't let the d/s ""work"" (Dom or sub) outweigh the value of the connection.

you also in the intro hear that if they flaunt their vocals they get put into detention camps, so its kind of hard to have that message that using the powers on them is bad. you can't just pull the fascist card and the oppressed different minority card without undercutting that. 

your take sounds like it'd be a great game and i think a good reviewer would point out whether or not the game fulfills or undercuts that message. its very hard to do subtlety or restraint. is there a good review of it you could link?",1725148900.0

Moderating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:

1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.

2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.

3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn’t care that much.

4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like “What is Maoism?” or “Why do Stalinists believe what they do?” will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.

5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.

6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.

7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/

8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/

"adviceph","t5_72gwja",">but i cannot control my aggressiveness and pettiness over the little things.

Then learn to. Of course it's easier said than done, and something that can't just be changed overnight, but by being more conscious of your emotions and how you behave when you feel these emotions, you can take control little by little.

Whenever you feel aggressive or any emotion related to it, try to take a step back, assess the situation, and reflect on yourself. Why does this make you feel a certain emotion? Is this situation the actual cause of the emotion or are there perhaps other factors that have contributed to the emotion building up and this situation was just your breaking point? Try to think on the other factors that may have led to this emotion you're feeling and assess if it's really just something little/trivial or something that actually needs to be addressed.

It's hard for me to think of questions for you to reflect on since it may vary depending on the situation, but you just have to make it a habit to reflect on yourself on why you feel an aggressive emotion, instead of just reacting to it without knowing the reason in the first place.

Also another comment here said that ""it’s normal for a girl to be aggressive due to the hormonal changes in our menstrual cycle"". It's normal to FEEL aggressive, but BEING aggressive itself is a different matter. Being aggressive is related to how you behave in regards to what you feel, meaning your reactions and actions. Feeling aggressive may make it harder to control how you behave, but still, it can be controlled.",1725148900.0

Disagreeing with someone’s career choice or lifestyle is a completely valid reason to break up with someone, you have to fully respect them and what they do and not everyone is ok with their friends seeing their partner strip.

"askaplumber","t5_2wm1w","Did the person who worked on this have to get inside the wall to make repairs? If not, and repairs were made solely on the tub side.. it's possible the original rough in was the issue.

It is possible during the recent repairs the 'wedges' came loose and now allow the valve to move around. 

Anyways, if this is the case then i wouldn't be too hard on the one who made the repairs as they probably wasn't aware it wasn't secured properly to begin with.

I suspect that the rules for Surgebinding will probably specify that any time a surge is used for damage, it would likely have dice size per the chart.

Yes there are many properties that have issues, in fact I’m just about to move into one.  It’s a family property, but I know there are issues with the extension that will mean either rectifying them prior to selling or accepting that we will need to knock about £20k off the current value.

"Millennials","t5_2rc4u","For reference, my grandmother bought a house for the value of one year salary. I have about the average Norwegian income, and based on my income that would make her house cost about 70k Euro today. Her house would easily go for 600k today. I've managed to score a pretty well-paying job, and I can't afford a regular house like my parents or grandparents did with minimal income.

I was talking with my mom about this, and she fell into the trap of not really having reflected on it. So she was like ""Yeah, but that cost an entire annual salary."" She's not dumb, so she immediately realized how bad it is when I said ""That would mean I should be able to by a house like that for 70k. For 200k I only get a tiny apartment."" She knew it was bad, but I don't think she had realized just how bad it is right now until that moment. And because she's a smart person, it just means that all the dumb people who are old, will not be able to grasp it even if you tell them. That's who we keep hearing stuff like ""Get a second job!"" and shit like that.",1725148902.0

He’s a legitimately tragic character. He has an actually noble aspiration (cold fusion to make electricity readily available to everyone for little to no ongoing cost) for which he slowly descends into madness as he digs deeper and deeper to try to make his dream a reality in a desperate bid to justify the project killing his wife. If he can’t make this work only has he failed, but he will have killed his wife…for nothing.

The tools that he created to help him master this great power whisper madness in his ear as he justifies progressively more grievous transgressions until there is only one hope for redemption… It’s sad, it’s beautiful and it’s a zillion times better than Thanos’ “lets end poverty through genocide” bullshit because his actions and decisions make *sense* while aligning with goals that are legitimately sympathetic.

If you wanted to buy a 9th Gen Xbox console for MSRP at retail or e-tail between launch and Q3 2022 without having to rely on dumb luck or eyeballing half a dozen e-tail trackers 12+ hrs a day, your only two options were to buy a Series S or walk away empty handed. Why? Because Microsoft was outright making at least 3 Series S consoles to every Series X being packed into a box for shipping.

That's really what it boils down to. 

It's not like Microsoft was the only company that looked at a $7K wafer suddenly becoming $16K up to $20K *because there was approximately zero unsold capacity for the next 2.5 years*, then at the rising cost of inductors, MOSFETs, caps, and substrate, and then asked, ""What's going to get me the most volume? and ""What gets me the most margin?""

AMD famously starved its GPU division of wafers between 2020 and 2022 in order to prioritize EPYC. If you wanted to buy an RX 6000 card that wasn't an IGP slapped onto a PCB and sold as an ""e-sports"" card, you weren't getting one because AMD flatly wasn't making them.",1725148902.0

Maybe for me, it’s just my age…but ageism isn’t a thing, right?
I have landed a few remote contract jobs in the field but they aren’t optimal, in my opinion. I worked remotely the last two years as a BSA Officer (8 total years) with minimal in office, until they required return to work and I was unable due to my son’s medical condition.

Think about everytime parents have been angry because of a gay kiss or something. 

Or the many people that complain whenever an LGBT+ character is included, even when there’s no impact on the game’s quality. 

For example: people complained that, when you asked about a transgender man’s backstory in Dragon Age Inquisition, he mentioned his life as a women prior to transitioning. People complained that it was unnecessary and the developer’s were shoving trans identities down their throats. 

So, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I got to that conversation. Guess what? The character literally only mentioned being trans if you ask about his backstory. Which is when that would be relevant. That’s it. If you don’t ask him about his history or too much about his people’s culture, you can avoid the conversation entirely.

"ZeroCovidCommunity","t5_7a63lg","The weirdest part is that everyone including all scientists and agencies knew a decade ago that no nation could ever withstand H5N1 in pandemic form.  But as the possibility got more real everyone who used to know has developed amnesia.  It's now being presented as something comparable to Covid or the Spanish flu.  Just get out your masks and hand sanitizer and you'll be fine.

H5N1 is estimated at a 15% to 35% mortality for the first wave,  Nothing we've ever experienced comes anywhere near its fatality.  Our global supply chains would break before any shots got into arms since even a 25% loss of workers will crash it.  And no one in this day and age is capable of surviving without the supply chains.  It's literally a collapse situation that's being handled exactly as we are with Covid, as though it's harmless.  

Here is a recent Michael Osterholm quote.  He is the only person who has even breathed a word of what would really happen if it adapted to mammals, and he is only addressing a 4 to 6% fatality rate.  H5N1 would be over 15%.  It's unfathomable.  

""*""If H5N1, or any other airborne virus that begins to spread in the human population, sparks a pandemic with a fatality rate even three to five percent higher than COVID, the world will be going to war against a terrifying microbial enemy. It would be far more deadly than any pandemic in living memory or any military conflict since* [World War II](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/tags/world-war-ii)*.""*

*""Even if the vaccine in the current stockpile does prove effective, there are not enough doses to control an emerging H5N1 pandemic. The United States is home to 333 million people, each of whom would need two shots to be fully immunized, meaning the 4.8 million doses on hand would cover only about 0.7 percent of the population. The government would, of course, try to scale up production quickly, but doing so would be tricky. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the first lot of vaccine was released on October 1, almost six months after the pandemic was declared. Only 11.2 million doses were available before peak incidence.""*",1725148904.0

Still  don't like Carrie/Big as a couple and didn't want them endgame 
Also still  not a huge fan of Carrie/Aidan but hate the way she treated him in season 3
Season 4 , the difference when I'm older is I see some passive aggressive controlling  tendencies in Aidan. As a teenager, thought he was  just a nice guy.
Still Love Harry/ Charlotte as a couple but still generally find Charlotte annoying , Harry made her a lot less so  
Still think  Miranda was the most relatable/awkward 
Still think Samantha is the funniest and the most likable 
Still think Samantha should have stayed with Smith-still  my fav couple on the show. Harry and Charlotte   Second 
Still think Carrie  wasn't wrong for sending Aidan to help Miranda because she had a work commitment she couldn't get out of last minute and Miranda didn't let her finish talking before she hung up
Still think Carrie way overreacted in Paris. Girl; there is no way you went to ""every museum twice,"" bye. If she had just let him finishes exhibit, he probably would have been more attentive, it was a huge career move for him, and she could have (as often the case) have thought  less about herself and more about others.

Strength training also helps strengthen and stabilise the legs. CrossFit is great because it puts your heart rate all over the place.

But at the end of the day if you are obsessed with the data figures you will stop enjoy running and it will just become another task.",1725148905.0

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","gosh, I’m really feeling nostalgic for clubs after I’ve started thinking about them. In today’s isolated world, where people take great pain to avoid eye contact, the energy you find at a good club is sorely lacking.

when I was in my early twenties, most people would go out with your friends regularly on the weekends. It wasn’t just seen as this space for the pretty people and the influencer types. Going out regularly is what also reinforced so many friend groups, how you made new friends, how you made memories and new inside jokes came up organically. 

that never ending dread and anxiety people feel? The club was our outlet, our space to be carefree and happy. Whatever problems we had would be there tomorrow, we had tonight to live! 

One other thing that really stands out with hindsight is that going out is basically how young people expressed their sexual energy/feelings. Nowadays it feels like the norm for Gen Z is to be outwardly disinterested in sex while “behind closed doors” exploring their sexuality through porn/OnlyFans. 

When I was 22, we focused that energy on ourselves, making a lot more effort on things like personal grooming and fashion, developing social skills, being physically fit - it was like we’d practice our habits all week so that on Friday or Saturday night we could put our best foot forward on a night out.",1725148905.0

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

#Please do not message us about this, we need the minimum karma filter to prevent spam. Thank you

Earlier this year, I was dealing with the same frustrations. It felt like no matter what I did, it wasn’t enough. I ended up creating a small AI tool that listens in during interviews and suggests responses in real-time, just to help me feel a bit more in control. It’s not a fix for everything, but it helped me push through. If you think it might help, I’m happy to share it with you.

"skilledtrades","t5_2v8gc","I can't speak for trades, in general (outside construction), but my coworkers and construction in general have a mixture of thin skin and god-complex. The minute you say something even remotely negative about trade work, they think you're demeaning them and so on. I always found it wild. It's cliche', but there's a job for everyone and regardless what the trade is (Ironworker, Electrician, HVAC, etc etc etc) all are important in their own way. It's the whole ""the world doesn't run without us"" attitude is equally weird. Guess what, the engineer who calculates the thickness of the steel needed, how many bolts in a connection, etc ... is equally important (can be argued, maybe more) than the IW who connects, bolts and erects the steel building. 

So is the immigrant you make fun of at McDonald's who gives you your coffee at the drive thru at 5AM before heading for work or the girl who does the paystubs and sends all the hours to the payroll company. It isn't because some of us risk our lives that we're the best.",1725148906.0

"paralegal","t5_2x243","Mere FYI - ""If you read through the discussion..."" was unnecessary and comes off passive aggressive. If you posted the exact same thing without that phrase, your tone would match your last sentence, i.e. thankful and appreciative. 

To answer your question: if you've video called w/ someone, went through a normal hiring process, confirmed that the person you're talking to actually works at the company, and reached out to former and/or current employees, I'd say it's most likely legit. The odds of a scammer being that sophisticated and expending that much effort, purchasing thousands of dollars of equipment, and hiring someone local to you to install said equipment are extremely low.

Before sending any real PII, request their tax ID and confirm it w/ the IRS, if the company is legit, find an employees contact info and ask to speak to the person you're talking to, do social media research on the person, and exhaust all verification methods. If you decide to proceed, request payment via check, only send the last 4 of the SSN.

in my vision of the future, we use AI to complete tasks that we already know how to do, but that take too much time. so rather than typing out all the questions herself, it makes sense to me to give AI the information, ask it to write a quiz under certain parameters, and then go back and fix it. 

as a math teacher, for example, there is software that Auto generates math problems within certain criteria. but you can edit them, so sometimes I'll use them to create problem sets, and then I'll go in and edit some of the questions to make them more rigorous.

To me, it sounds you are not sold on your own idea despite the effort you have put in. Even if those 2000 downsize to 60. Those 60 are a lot more worth that the 2000 together and you can work with them a lot closer to improve your product.

Trying to reach a new niche of users is a double-edge sword. Yes, your product could be more appealing but the requirements for those users will be different from your current set of users. Even if you are targeting people in the same industry, young and season users have different set of standards and requirements.

I think you are better off working closer with the paid users that remain after you enforce the payment requirement, and then figure out what are the things they share among them, and then go and target more of those people.

I agree with everything else people say here. 8% for a CTO in pre-seed is a joke, and you'll be cutting your salary in half. Even if they exit with 20-50M. Can you comfortable live with half of your salary for the next 4 years? If you don't increase your equity, at least keep your salary. There's no point in struggle like that.",1725148907.0

I’ve had HS for a long time, but I try not to let it consume me. I remind myself that even though this disease is challenging, it could be much worse. I believe that HS may lie dormant in some individuals until the body is under significant stress, which is when it tends to flare up. In my case, it didn’t manifest until I was 30 years old and in an extremely stressful relationship. I am grateful that it didn’t appear during my teenage years when I was carefree and always at the beach in Miami. From my research, I’ve learned that HS often emerges during puberty for many people. Fortunately, there are now numerous treatments and medications available. It gives me hope that there are options to manage the condition. Lastly, I just found a game changer, I posted it here the other day. I stumbled on this product by accident. I’ve seen real results. Especially on my butt. I swear I’m not exaggerating or anything but telling the truth. The one on my butt cheek I’ve had for over a year, same thing with the uo and down up and down. Never really going away completely. It’s huge under the skin. I’ve tried everything including antibiotic tea tree oil. I’ve used this product by Briotech call hypochlourous acid. The crazy thing is that it’s water with salt that has changed the cell
Or something scientific. My butt bump in 10 days has shrunk I’d say 85%. It’s never been that small. I was shopping for skin care on Amazon and this was # 1 in facial sprays. So I bought it. Give it a try. Hopefully it works some for you.",1725148907.0

This seems significant to me as E.L.F was the very FIRST to quit his longtime role with Harry, only a few months after the engagement. I strongly doubt ELF would be mentioned as a potential negotiator unless it was strictly regarding a return for Harry without Meghan. 

Having said that, it would be a really, really bad idea for the family to trust Harry in any capacity. I hope they''ll ignore him and keep themselves safe from his venom. We'll see.",1725148907.0

"adhdmeme","t5_2u0zn",">You've clearly missed the point in how it's used informally

I am perfectly aware of its informal use.

The issue here is that this informal use opens up a whole new way to create additional harmful stereotypes. If we talk about it like this, people outside the community are going to pick up on it, and as it goes with half truths, they're eventually going to be believed fully.

And eventually there will be plenty of people actually believing that ADHD people have no object permanence, which adds another target on our backs. As if we're not struggling enough in this society. Reasons for societal oppression don't need to be true to work.

And no, I'm not trying to dunk on people without object permanence. It's something that usually  develops in toddlers. I'm not aware of any adult (without brain damage) who lacks it, but it sounds incredibly challenging to live a life without understanding such a basic concept of reality. 

In the end, it's not an ADHD thing. But you're kind of making it one by using its name for an ADHD symptom. Every community seems to have their jokes, informalities or misuse of language that will be problematic when viewed from the outside, and I'm convinced this is one of those cases.",1725148908.0

You're not gonna get that sound from an electric bass basically ever, but you could hypothetically get a western-style upright to sound like that by using nylon norteno strings or kevlar weedwackers, combined with the right playing style. The best way to get this sound is probably using a real tololoche or guitarron, but you could hypothetically get close without spending much money by using an [acoustic bass guitar](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.guitarcenter.com/Acoustic-Bass.gc%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqjB3QmiJzLHLPCwBOOfcnXu7pjO6yKheKMczyG7rEpeygAuxX_&ved=2ahUKEwj66f-Mt6CIAxXJke4BHQjDBDsQFnoECCMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2MblAdguOrtyEZ4oPsAJaL) and playing in the so-called ""[bajoloche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6eHUn58q3c)"" style.

You might’ve put your phone down to have a conversation with your dad. Besides the fact that you’re quite capable of making your own decision as to when you respond. You are NOT at his beck and call!!!! 

This guy is making huge assumptions instead of believing you. He’s got major trust issues and is blowing this WAY out of proportion!! Not to mention you did nothing wrong. I guarantee you, it will only get worse if you stay with him!! Get out now. And be prepared for backlash. He will probably try to gaslight you and try to manipulate the situation to keep you in the relationship.

J’ai pu me sortir de ça grâce à une psy compétente et je n’ai jamais refais d’hypnose après ça. 
Malheureusement, c’est très difficile voir impossible d’aider quelqu’un dans le déni ou qui ne veut pas être aidé, il faut que tu puisses trouver un équilibre entre être là pour elle et te préserver au maximum, c’est difficile d’accepter qu’on ne peut pas sauver quelqu’un, mais ça ne sera jamais ta responsabilité, plutôt celle des professionnels de santé.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","In case anyone is wondering why these men are so obsessed with abortions, this is a timeline of what was happening in Utah at the time : 

Jan 22, 1973: Roe v. Wade is decided in a 7-2 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. The case establishes certain protections for a woman’s right to have an abortion, based on the constitutional right to privacy. The Supreme Court case Doe. v. Bolton, which struck down a Georgia law regulating abortion, is also decided on this day.

March 2, 1973: After the pair of landmark cases are decided by the Supreme Court, Utah moves quickly to roll back abortion rights in the state. A new Abortion Act prohibits abortions except in cases where the mother’s life or health is in jeopardy and requires “judicial hearings before all abortions and consent by the father.”

August 1973: The Utah Abortion Act is ruled unconstitutional in district court. The judges cite the Roe v. Wade decision in their ruling, which determines the act is “discriminatory and overly broad since it applied to any trimester of pregnancy.”

February 1974: The unconstitutional act is repealed and replaced. The new law contains a provision that requires “a physician to notify the parents or guardian of a minor and the husband of a married woman before performing an abortion.” The language relating to parental notification is upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981.

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","Feeling deeply and sensing the energies and intentions of others can indeed be both a gift and a burden. As an empath, your heightened awareness allows you to connect with others on a profound level, but it can also create a sense of isolation when you perceive the discrepancies between people's true selves and the masks they wear. This disconnect can make maintaining friendships and relationships challenging, leaving you to navigate your emotions and experiences largely on your own.

It's understandable to feel alone during difficult times, especially when you are sensitive to the energies around you. The absence of a strong familial connection and the loss of your father may compound your sense of isolation. The desire for genuine human connection, where you feel held and supported, is a natural and deeply human need. Seeking a safe space where you can express your vulnerabilities and be truly seen is important for your emotional well-being.

While it may be challenging, finding ways to connect with others who share similar sensitivities or experiences can be beneficial. Engaging with communities or support groups for empaths or individuals who understand the depth of your experiences might provide you with the understanding and companionship you seek. Additionally, exploring therapeutic avenues such as counseling or working with a therapist who respects and acknowledges your unique perspective may offer some solace and support.

Remember that while you may feel alone now, your capacity for deep empathy and understanding is a valuable trait. As you continue to navigate your path, be patient with yourself and allow space for healing and growth. Finding ways to nurture and care for yourself, as well as seeking out supportive connections, can help you create a sense of safety and belonging.",1725148911.0

Another reason to keep the cane in the stall is that sometimes, even after locking the stall door, they swing back open if the latch is poorly positioned or broken. Sometimes it takes a moment to realize that the door is swinging back open. A cane is useful to push the door back shut and hold it there if the lock is broken!

"KingstonOntario","t5_2s8kp","This post is crazy and full of flat out lies. I worked at art noise for a few months and need to put my two cents in about this as reading all the comments about people being saddened to hear about what was “going on behind the scenes” when in fact they are being lied too. I’m not a member of managment/the higher ups/family or anything I was hired just by bringing in my resume and having a backround in art and art knowledge. The lead floor manager was always kind, but the rest of the staff was incredibly rude flat out. The hiring team is by NO means homophobia or transphobic. I don’t want to come on here and start outing people as it’s not my place, but litterally the entire staff hired at art noise is on the LGBTQ+ scale so it’s litterally impossible to call the family running the store trans/homophobic. People are simply saying this because it is a straight/cis couple running the store, dispute them only hiring people on the LGBTQ+ scale as a show of support and recognition. They create a very safe space where everyone can relate to one another and i know the whole staff always felt safe as we were all in the same community outside of the store. We were never denied time off requests, family emergency’s, or anything of the sort and when we couldn’t come in one of the family members who ran the factory would come in and work the floor so the staff working would not be over run. 
While working here the only downside i faced and what ultimately led to me leaving was the constant negotiable attidtude of the floor staff. I’ve seen them get angry at homeless people, international students who don’t know what products they need for classes (but we do have we have detailed lists of what each course requires), and just hate on the family and higher ups for the simple reason that they (the staff) have to work at all. One staff memeber (the assistant manager no less) was consistently rude to me dispote me being the only worker who was not constantly complaining or hiding in the bathroom on their phone. I fully draw this up to me being the only cis presenting staff member but that is besides the point. 
This isn’t a walmart or superstore corrupt chain where they can afford to keep the whole staff on while undergoing months of construction. This is a small local family run business who’s been a huge supporter of the art scene in Kingston for decades. The staff laid off (NOT fired without reason) were also paid out to leave, and had enough time to go find new jobs in the area. please don’t boycaught Art noise because someone got on here and started throwing the words trans/homophoc around with out any basis in an attempt to run this small local family business out of businesses. ",1725148911.0

When it was illegal, and I was walking through a downtown or park or an outdoor fair or whatever, I'd smell it maybe 6-10 times a year, at least where I've lived. When it happened, it was so unusual I'd glance around to see where it was coming from.

Now, if I spend the same amount of time in those same outdoor spaces, I'll smell it *at least* once a day, but usually more. I barely notice it now because it's just so ubiquitous.

Dr. Strange was there when it happened and he had the opportunity to be the one to become God instead, and he refused, because he *knew* that Doom was the only person capable of making the decisions of who to save out of the entire multiverse. 

Sure, Reed would have done a better job with the power of the Beyonders - and did, after this fight, recreating the entire multiverse and setting things back to where they had been - but without Doom that opportunity would never have even arisen.

I’m not sure why you are so concerned about the costs associated with this component of things. It will come out of the sale of the house. I doubt it will be enormously different whoever you go with, and it is just part of the cost of resolving the estate.

You won’t transfer the house into your name because this has to be liquidated to cover debts as part of the probate of the estate. 

Like the other poster said, why aren’t you using the solicitor handling the estate, asking them these questions, or asking them for a referral to a conveyancer or property lawyer to handle it? If for some reason that’s not possible, I would go with a property lawyer for this one because it’s a bit more complicated.",1725148913.0

However, he could not find any attractive businesses. I am pondering why it was the case 20+ years ago. The Japanese firms are very well run and disciplined, in my humble opinion.",1725148914.0

"Helldivers","t5_2ya0t","Imo the problem with HMG is that it's best-case TTK is the same as other weapons - headshots and weakspot shots. The thing is, other weapons do it better, and easier. Much better spread (try tap-firing HMG - it won't shoot the same direction every time, there's a small circle within which the bullet is released), much better recoil, and much better ergonomics.

This is further amplified by just how incredibly good it feels to use the HMG emplacement. It's like having a full-auto sniper rifle, and tapping it makes the 300 ammo go incredibly far. When I need to full-auto, the laser-focus and zero spread mean every bit of power goes exactly where I need it to go.

I love the *idea* of HMG, and I'll still find ways to make it work on planets like Tarsh, which has a lot of medium/cqc, but damn does it suck to use on a planet like Vernen Wells, when you're being engaged 50+ meters out.",1725148915.0

I’d be hunched over at an acute angle all day, having to grab onto things in order to walk before I had my cane, still only missed a day and a half of work from this disease. I had dactylitis in my toes (which was some of the sharpest pain I’ve ever experienced in my life), my neck would literally be stuck in some godawful position because my muscles couldn’t stop spasming, and I could barely hold anything due to the enthesitis in my wrists and elbows. Got braces for my elbows and wrists and kept going. 

Some of us are more stubborn or persistent than others with this disease, or can’t afford to not do the kind of work that we do. Also some of us are stuck in these physically demanding positions actively looking for work elsewhere. I had to fight for an office position at my workplace and just recently got one, and it turns out more than half of the people I work with now have worked for years doing the same work as me with horrible back problems. 

I personally did not want sympathy from others and wanted to show them that disabled people can find a way to do anything. Me working like that definitely helped spread awareness in my workplace. Looking back though, I have no fucking clue how I did it.",1725148917.0

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Durant to the Warriors kinda tipped the scale a bit.  Taking since the Laker 3-peat (since Shaq to LA was a weird thing to begin with), it's been 13-9 to the west for champs.  If Cleveland pulled off those 2 somehow instead, it's 11-11.  

Since 2000 pretty much all the big east metro teams have been like bad bad.  NY, Chicago, Atlanta, Washington, Phili had some moments but that was basically AI in 2001 and not even a ECF since.  Miami had some good runs.  

Even first 1st overall picks, shit's been lopsided on draft wins.  

ECF picks going back  
Atl - Risacher  
Orl - Banchero  

Det- Cunningham (I don't know why the spacing is like this, reddit thing)

76ers - Fultz (stupid Colangelo)

76ers - Simmons

Cavs - Wiggins 

Cavs - Bennet 

Cavs - Irving (not too bad :))

Wiz - Wall (guess could be better but it's the Wizards)  
Bulls - (Rose, cut short by injuries)  
Raps - Bargnani  
Bucks - Bogut (not terrible just not generational)  
Magic - Howard  
Cavs - James (honestly could be better)  
Wiz - Brown  
Nets - Martin (alright but not what you'd want from a top pick)  
Bulls - Brand (Pretty solid actually

  
Meanwhile West 

Spurs - Wemby  
Min - Edwards

Pelicans - Zion  
Suns - Ayton

Min - Towns

NO - Davis

Clippers - Griffin  
Por - Oden (bust but #2 also west in Sea- Durant)

Hou - Ming

Even if the east made perfect draft choices with 20/20 hindsight.... outside James and Irving it's basically been dogshit for 24 years even with twice as many #1 picks.  Rose is unfortunate, but when all the obvious generational talent goes to one conference, hell even Curry taken #7, all top #7 picks were West teams.  I guess you could point out Luka for Young.  Just one of those it's the Hawks, even if they didn't trade down, they wouldn't have taken Doncic, cause it's the fucking Hawks.  

Still, if you consider Durant to Seattle still in 2007, that's a shit load of unmatched physical freaks over 20 years that went to the west.  

Which overshadows the East from 89-98 going 8-2 cause Jordan retired those 2 years.",1725148917.0

"Mononucleosis","t5_3eqny","Hi there! This post was made by a bot because it seems like you might be asking about interpreting blood test results. 

If this is not what your post is about, feel free to downvote/ignore this message.

This does not replace medical advice and you should consult with your doctor, but below is a brief aid in what common test results may mean.

For a more complete breakdown of each individual test, please see [our wiki page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mononucleosis/wiki/index).

## Summary

* VCA-IgG (AKA EBV VCA-IGG) positive indicates an acute OR past infection
* VCA-IgM (AKA EBV VCA-IGM) positive indicates an acute infection
* Early Antigen (AKA EA-D, EA, Early Antigen IgG) positive indicates an acute infection or a very recent acute infection
* EBNA (AKA Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen, EBNA antibody, EBV Nuclear AG, EBNA-1 IGG) positive indicates a past infection
* Heterophile antibody/monospot is a somewhat unreliable test; a positive result indicates a *possible* acute infection, and a negative does not equivocally rule out an infection.

## Table of Possible Test Indications

| Possible Indication            | VCA-IgG | VCA-IgM | EA   | EBNA |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| Never Infected                 | -       | -       | -    | -    |
| Acute infection                | +       | +       | +/-  | -    |
| Acute or very recent infection | +       | +/-     | +    | +/-  |
| Recent past infection          | +       | -       | +/-  | +    |
| Distant past infection         | +       | -       | -    | +    |
| Chronic infection/reactivation | +       | -       | +    | +/-  |

Note that monospot is not included on this chart as it is considered to be an unreliable test -- a positive monospot should be followed up with additional testing targeting these antibodies.

"asoiafcirclejerk","t5_2tvge","Sansa was done being fucked with. It happens to those of us with endless trauma. You let people know that you will gladly slit their throats if they fuck with you. It’s not about playing games, you’re done playing and you don’t care if you die fighting. Sansa had Cersei as a teacher. She hated Cersei but she also respected her Mad Queen Swagger. I mean, Cersei is a supposed to be the Lion, but Cersci is definitely a Scorpio in spirit. Sanaa is A Lioness. Both will destroy with absolutely savagery, anyone that threatens their loved ones. 

Cersei blew up the Sept, the militant, and her rivals. Cersei gets her army ready to fight and purchases cell-swords. She didn’t send her men to fight a pointless war, yes pointless because if Dragons, Dothraki Screamers, and Unsullied can’t defeat them, then she had time to evacuate Kings Landing, and the Crown Lands with the GreyJoy fleet. She’s also got caches of WildFire to blow up whites, she knows dragon glass, fire, and Valerian Steel can kill whites. I mean homeboy will probably ride his Ice dragon around like the Targ he is! And if those dragons had been Cersei’s, she would’ve decked those dragons out in some seriously bad ass armor. She’d feed them whatever they wanted,, never caged them, and rode her mount constantly. Sansa is seen tending to every detail for the winter, she’s calculating food, weapons, breast plates, armor, trade and barter, organizing stewards to sew more uniforms, shoes, and under garment’s. She paid attention and caught several details throughout her daily walk through an and progress reports from her household. She held court, she issued commands, she questioned Jon in front of everyone and because he trusts her and knows how much Sansa learned from being Catelyn’s shadow growing up, and regardless of how Jon feels about Car personally, She was an excellent Lady of Winterfell. Catelyn had to earn her worth too in the North. Man, Is love an entire Northern Maester’s account during Aegon and Torren’s times. Maybe the North has some interesting pin-pal letters between Targ Maestors and Stark Maesters,, we Need Te Nothern history. How many wilding weddings have happened between you know they’ve happened! 😂 a whole line of Snowy bastards and Dragon Seeds, maybe Jaweeyhs and Alaryck probably smuck awar to hunt if J was near by.

"PokemonMasters","t5_31qu9","Point to AS Cynthia (trying to not be biased because she is my favorite girl), is that she can afford luxury support and that's super rare traits. 

Mention any top tier damage dealer. Deoxys Attack? Deoxys still needs Psy Terrain + Psy Rebuff + SE Up support. Best he can do? SS Lana + NC Rosa. Voila you still missing SE Up and you also missing Circles boost. Okay let's step up. NC Red? Red needs Zone so Irida is always must for him/stuck with him. Already have rebuff and SE Up but since Irida stuck in stone, you musy choose SE Up support (Red Snoelax) or Circle Support (Chase) for NC Red. Also Red can't properly stack his SMUN to buff his nuke with his passive. He also needs SMUN Support if he wanna reach his peak. 

Now take a look at Cynthia. She already have Zone, rebuff-2, SE Up, and even can debuff enemies defense to -6 by herself. The only thing she needs is Circle and that will complete her. Sinnoh Solidarity from Volo is another layer of buff for her, but remember that we still don't have Sinnoh Physical Circle which will further Cynthia absolute bonkers damage to another level in the future. And she also get brand new Sync Move Up + reach herself +6 to +10 stacks by HERSELF without AS Steven TM helps (which Steven only give +3). Also she consistently get +4 PMUN after every sync. 

Note: Upcoming AS Lance is close to Cynthia completeness, but he still needs Zone + Circle + SE Up teammate while Cynthia only needs Circle.",1725148919.0

I refused pain killers for about 5 hours before the surgery and 18 hours after surgery because I knew what it would lead to. My doctor and family talked me into it because they said I wouldn’t heal as fast if I was in that much pain so a gave in. I had a few more surgeries on my leg and continued to use and ended up having a bunch more surgeries through the 10 years after the leg break. I was going back and forth from opioids to kratom and finally got off kratom 76 days ago. The relapse for medical reasons didn’t lead to surgeries but it led to being addicted again. 
Tuesday I started the tooth implant process and took no pain killers that they wanted to prescribe. I’ve realized I can’t have them even if it’s for surgery. I’m just going to have to rough it if I have any surgery again. It’s not worth having to kick that crap again.",1725148919.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Likely because if you overconsumed massively in previous decades, the average person would just die. Now we have modern medicine and mass production of solutions to self inflicted problems like diabetes. 

Humans have always been gluttons, but when could you actually never leave your house and have all of your needs met? You can order infinite food from your phone and have it delivered to your door in less than an hour. You can work from home in your underwear and not leave the house for weeks if you want. You can choose to spend on luxuries like food delivery three times a day if you want and if you're disabled, western governments will pay for it on their dime.

There's also the erosion of personal accountability. We stopped using shame in education and instead appeal to an infinite array of disorders to explain behavior instead of focusing on the agency involved to exhibit a behavior. We absolve individuals of responsibility and they use that as a weapon to never make better choices and to justify that they don't have to because it's always someone else's fault. 

Why didn't you include individual choice in your original comment as a factor? That's the overwhelmingly largest part of the equation.",1725148920.0

Abro paréntesis pata mi contexto (pero desde mis 18 me prohibi sentir algo por otra persona que no fuera mi crush, ya que, como no estaba intentando nada, sentía que le estaba siendo infiel ¿?¿?, traumas ya superados pero, fue real)

El caso es que entendí que lo que necesitaba no era tal cual conocer morras en el bar, si no conocer gente, porque está gente conoce más gente y de ahí amplias tu círculo social a un punto donde puedes conocer a personas que ya sea por recomendación, o propia iniciativa pueden interesarse en ti, es común el que te digan ""mi amiga está soltera y te puede caer bien, harian super bonita pareja"", pero para eso ocuparias conocer a esa gente que si sale de paseo en pareja o similar.

Yo recomendaría la terraza allende porque la barra la tienen en la terraza y es super común debido al poco espacio que gente se acerque a ti y comienzan a platicar, ya sea porque creen que estés deprimido o porque te pidan un cigarro lo importante es entablar conversación e intentar interactuar más haya de la cordialidad.

Espero haberme explicado bien, pero, a fin de cuentas, aún si no conoces morras y conoces puras parejas en esos lugares, esas parejas conocen gente, y muy probable te puedan presentar a alguien.

Y siempre se sincero, si te toca decir, ""ando conociendo gente porque ya me harte de estar soltero"" simplemente dilo, y te aseguro que la.platica se va a dar y con la suficiente suerte conocerás a alguien que puede ser el amor de tu vida, o que conozca al amor de tu vida y te la pueda presentar.

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/UTexpress.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

They seem similar to acid but were produced to create novel trips and to skirt the law, also cheap and easy to produce comparatively. 

The big problem with them is that the lethal dose of lsd is nearly impossible to reach, but Nbome class chemicals have a relatively low ld50 and can cause horrifying trips, bad side effects and overdose.

"vaporents","t5_2upjd","Not trying to step in the middle of your conversation, but oxygen deprivation can lead to a whole host of symptoms depending on the reason and length and various other factors. It's how a lot of people don't make it throug house fires, for one, because they don't know to get low to the ground and out of the majority of the smoke. 

It's similar for smoking cigarettes/weed, and then vaping, though as they've said it's true that you get 98% of what's active within the first few seconds of (and including) inhaling. There's no point to keep it in longer than that, but it's also why you can just take another hit after having a breath or two. Compared to vaping, with smoking you get 12% of the overall active compounds that go along with getting high, and 88% burnt carbon and other junk from the act of combustion. I'll take 98% over 12% every single time, because while inhaling anything other than clean, fresh air is bad for your respiratory system and your body overall, there is almost nothing dangerous about vaporizing dry herb for most of us that have started doing it over the years. Since cannabis vapor is technically a bronchodilator, it can even be helpful for people with minor asthma or lung problems, as it opens up your airways instead of constricting anything.

Weed really is amazing! But it's only amazing for some people in the right circumstances, and there are those out there that can't have it in any of its current forms for one reason or another. Everyone's physiology is different, and different drugs affect different people differently. Happens with twins and other genetic copies, too! We're not all alike, but we do share the common trait of being human, so while we don't know everything, we also know more than nothing about how bodies work and what's required to keep them working. It's just a matter of proper application after thorough assessment!",1725148922.0

"askaconservative","t5_2vg6d","And bring up some interesting points. As for PSAs, I think at least for now, there is enough political balance in Congress that if government agencies were putting out PSAs that were politically biased or objectionable, I think that could be easily taken care of. It's never been a problem thus far. Although it might be worth noting that conservatives have complained about public funding of television and radio because of bias, and I think they have a point. But I don't think PSAs post serious problem as there is quite a bit of government control over the agencies involved. 

As for examples, Elon musk made public records of quite a bit of communication between the staff of Twitter and US government agencies. Mark Zuckerberg recently went public with the information that US government pressured him to censor certain things. I think it can be argued as to whether they are good or bad or should or should not be allowed. But there is no dispute that government has and can do this. I don't believe there are any legal restrictions per say that have been violated, although that might be explored further by congressional inquiry. 

What's interesting, and it could be seen as a stretch but I think there's validity, is the laws that allowed internet companies to be considered platforms rather than editors. If they were editors, they would be subject to claims of libel and other things that could be held against any magazine or newspaper or other media. If they are platform, they can disclaim any responsibility for what is said, to a point. 

This was granted and probably a good idea. It allowed the internet to become an incredible engine for free speech and communication. However, once social media platforms began editing content, then it seems a logical argument that they no longer have the right to be a platform rather than a media outlet. So, I think it would be fairly easy to leverage this into some reasonable restrictions on censorship. 

People say, it's their company. They can censor anything they want. Free market. Freedom. Don't you conservatives like freedom? However, there is the concept of the Commons which has been occasionally stretched to include private shopping malls for example in regards to free speech. I'm not sure I love that idea but perhaps it's necessary to ensure free speech and other rights when more and more spaces are becoming privately owned . If you accept that, then it's not a big leap to cyber Commons. 

But I prefer the distinction between media outlet versus platform.  You want to edit and decide what can be said, you are a media outlet and subject to all the restrictions and liabilities that come with that. You want to claim immunity by being a platform, fine. No censorship. 

As for government involvement, it should not be legal at all, even if the platform seeks it out. I believe certain factions of the government are too biased to be trusted. Since when did anyone start trusting the government to control thought and information? 

One last thought. I find it interesting to watch government inquiries and such. It seems both the left and right want to grill people like Zuckerberg and make all kinds of accusations and insinuations. However, pretty consistently, the left is scandalized why they would allow certain things such as blatant misinformation, in their eyes, about COVID, or the election, or etc. You mean people can say whatever they want on your platform no matter how dishonest and dangerous it is, some earnest Congress person will ask incredulously. 

However, on the right, the questions always involve censorship of conservative speech and thought, as well as government involvement etc. If anyone can think of examples to the contrary or more to this, I'd be interested. But that's generally how it goes. 

So, while It is easy to say both sides have great concerns about this and want reform and regulations, their intent is quite different. It's kind of like when both sides say they want order reform, without actually saying what specific changes they want to make.",1725148923.0

Kína felé könnyebb kijutni az országból, mint Dél-Korea felé, viszont az előbbinél még nincsenek azonnal biztonságban, mert Kína rendszeresen visszaküldi a Koreai menekülteket Észak-Koreának arra hivatkozva, hogy ""gazdasági bevándorlók"".

2020 előtt amúgy évi kb. 1-2000 menekült jutott ki az országból, aztán Kína felé is le lettek zárva a határok a covid miatt (iirc az volt a hivatalos indoklás), és akkor durván visszaesett ez a szám.",1725148924.0

Most of the girls are runaways whose parents were too fucked up to take them back, or had no family. They were ages 11-17 at this place. 

Most of them had relationships with older men on the outside and they’d run away to be with them. The men would pimp them out and get them addicted to meth or heroin or both. 

Once they got tired of being beaten and prostitutes they’d show back up at the facility. 

The good news is, I only personally know one girl that grew up there and she is happy, normal, and well adjusted. She joined the army right out of school and made a life for herself. So there’s still hope for most of them, it’s just up to them to find their way.",1725148926.0

"Star_Trek_","t5_7qf9x8","I think that even saying that Trek used to capture both sides of the debate, isn't fully imparting the nuance involved.

Sometimes Trek clonks you over the head, with an overly simplistic one-sided approach to a messy and difficult issue, which can be necessary, such as when TOS parodied the absurdity and illogic of racial bigotry,

 but can also be a problem when the topic is genuinely complex and emotive, such as when DS9 tried to do Israel/Palestine with the ancient Bajoran offshoot and wrote itself into an answer that it couldn't give.

.
.
.



Then you have episodes, where I'm sorry, this is on paper an easy black and white issue, such as war crimes, and the trick is not to produce both sides of a debate because pro-mass-murder isn't a rational stance, 

but to find a common ground  such as the Metreon Cascade attack on Rylax, 

haul in characters who served on both sides, 

in this case the perpetrator and the survivor saved by his own cowardice, 

have them go back and forth on who did what, why, how it impacted both characters, 

what they would have done differently, 

and through that confrontation begin the long and painful process of debriefing and healing from the trauma inflicted.

Rylax is clear cut, black and white, it was an atrocity, so you don't debate that, instead you go straight into the impacts and struggles of both characters, and you look for the messy, broken, emotional heart, in what by itself isn't a complicated topic.

I would say that FDR being undermined by his own party hurt the bill more than any public alienation.",1725148927.0

He could’ve arrested Benny boy last month for war crimes but he didn’t because he a senile Cold War imperialist. 

I don’t think blaming people who are protesting against genocide is a good strategy and strategy Dems seem headed towards. The protestors asked if they could have a Palestine speaker at DNC and they said you could pick who you want and read the speech beforehand. 

They suggested a state senator in Georgia who speech was leaked online and the speech basically Palestine lives matter and I endorse Harris & Walz because they are right direction for this country.

**Is this post from a sextortion scammer?**

Sextortion scammers often visit personal request subreddits like this one and coerce victims into sending sexual images of themselves, then threaten to share these images unless you comply with their demands. Below are some signs this poster may be a sextortion scammer. Please report any post you come across that breaks our rules!

1. This poster wants to communicate on Instagram, Snapchat, Discord, Kik, Telegram or any other app where you may inadvertently give out personal details about yourself, family, friends, school, employer or any other entity that may be used against you in a blackmail attempt.

2. This poster wants you to send them compromising images of yourself. A sextortion scammer will likely threaten to send these photos to your relatives, friend group, crush, and/or employer unless you obey their demands.  

3. This post contains references to ""Friends With Benefits"" and/or ""Long-Term Relationships"". The false impression that a deepened relationship is possible may lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

4. This post is targeted towards readers from a specific city, state or country. Knowing your location helps sextortion scammers narrow down their search of your personal information. The false hope that an in-person hookup is possible may also lead you to let your guard down and ignore red flags.

5. Sextortion scammers often use default, randomly generated Reddit usernames along the lines of ""Adjective_Noun_1234"" instead of thoughtful usernames. Since these accounts are reported and banned so frequently, scammers often do not take the extra time to create a meaningful username.

6. A common theme amongst suspected sextortion posts in this community is the inclusion of various kinks in the original post. If you read a post where the OP says something along the lines of, ""Here are my kinks:"", proceed with caution.

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I did not say it affects men more. Stats tell us women attempt suicide more but men are more successful at actually completing the act. So by attempted suicide stats, one may conclude that women are affected by expectations more than men.

For men though, the expectations are different to women. Men are still expected to provide and protect. Even if women claim they do not want a provider, a man's income still matters. Women complain about the lack of good men on their level, i.e. lack of good men who make similar or more money than them. The families of said woman would also not be very welcoming of a man who cannot protect and provide for their daughter. I personally do not think any father should be happy marrying his daughter to such a man either.

 I saw this online: 

1) lower socioeconomic status

2) unemployment

3) relationship breakdowns

4) alcohol and drug misuse

5) divorce

6) alienation from their children

7) depression

8) chronic pain

9) prior suicide attempts

10) impulsivity and aggression

11) displacement of the traditional male gender role

Source:  [Suicide in Men: Causes, Signs, and Intervention (psychcentral.com)](https://psychcentral.com/health/suicide-in-men#contributing-factors) 

From the list above, 1) lower socioeconomic status, 2) unemployment, 11) displacement of the traditional male gender role seem to line up with the expectations I talk about.

4) alcohol, 5) divorce, 7) depression and 9) prior suicide attempts. All 4 of these can be due to the above three things listed in the paragraph before. i.e. they feed of each other.",1725148928.0

Ever since this controversy surfaced, everyone has been waiting for him to address the situation, even though he hasn’t been directly accused of anything. Yes, he adjusted the schedule to his liking, which some found unacceptable, but at least he’s out there, present and accountable. From day one, Lalettan has been in the spotlight, and we expect him to speak up.

But where is Mammootty? Why is there total silence about him? He’s stayed hidden away at home, as he has so often in the past, and no one seems to care. Why isn’t anyone demanding that he come forward? Why is the public so quiet about his absence? Could it be that Ikkachi’s fans are working overtime to stifle any criticism that might reach Mamooka? Or is it the PR machine working to shield Mammootty while targeting Lalettan? At this stage in his career, Mamooka owes it to everyone to step up and show just how much of that so-called ‘software update’ his PR team keeps bragging about has actually happened",1725148929.0

"IdentityV","t5_j95dd","I don’t like how low the gatcha rates are. I also don’t like how expensive echoes are like if you could get 960 echoes for 10 dollars I think that would be very reasonable 1 dollar per pull. but it’s indeed 723 echoes per 10 dollars which is about 7.5 pulls (or 0.75 pulls per dollar if I didn’t do my math wrong). And not only is that annoying but also expensive. 

I also don’t like how expensive the persona 5 crossover was. I mean if you wanted to get all the skins + their awakened for you’d need a total of 720 pulls (Max of course, but still). If you were to buy echoes for 10 dollars (since that’s the cheapest one), you’d need to spend 5,400 dollars (if my math isn’t wrong I just did 720 x 7.5). That is a lot of money. 

I get it why it’s that way I mean every 6 pulls you get 1 souls of resistance. You need 10 to awaken a character. If you take 60 pulls to get a character you can automatically awake them. But then S tier characters are 30, and sometimes you can get pulls early like with me and Futaba which I got her after 10 pulls. So if you want to awaken let’s say Joker and Panther you’d need a maximum of which is 240 pulls which is 10 pulls less than what you’d need to get Joker. That’s fine, but what if I wanted to awaken Fox on top of that? I would need to do 300 pulls and by then I would have all the characters from one of the essences. Continuing that logic if you wanted to get every character and their awakened form, not only would you have to fork 5,400 but also would need to make 220 more pulls than what they’d normally need to (pulls which btw could be used on different essences, crossovers, characters, furniture, houses or other)

My point is why did NetEase make it so hard to get Souls of resistance? I know that at the end of the day it’s to milk more money from the crossover, but seriously, some people just want to get all their favorite characters and their awakened forms, but simply can’t afford to spend 5,400 dollars just to do it.",1725148929.0

If you've hit 25x, there's a certain logic in pulling the trigger early with the strategy that IF your finances take a dump, you still have time to return to the workforce and recover. Most failure scenarios start with a significant downturn early. If I retire at 40 and things slump, I'd rather get back to work at 45 or 50 than I would at 60. 

Us FIRE folks tend to sweat over spreadsheets and projections. On a 40-50 year timeline, I think the things that will bite us in the ass are the things we can't reasonably predict.

""I know you hope that I will heal and we will never have to speak of the affair again. Believe me, that sounds great. But I still get hurt and lost. I still have questions.

In the second iteration, I decided to swap the swapped the AliExpress dial with an OEM dial which has no date. I removed the date wheel (and overlay) and left the ghost position.

In the third (and hopefully final) iteration, I swapped out the original 3-position setting lever jumper that comes standard on 2824-2 clones with a 2-position setting lever jumper for an ETA 2801-2.",1725148929.0

"warno","t5_5i3o06","I realize you are not behind the way the vet curve works. But if I understand correctly you are behind the base availability per card of units.

Many units, especially infantry and recon, have such tight availability numbers that it actively interferes with them doing their jobs as a replaceable front line.

Unit preservation will always be an important aspect of the game even if you are allowed to buy replacements. Prohibiting people from buying more than a quite low number of these units is, at best, pointless, and at worst, extremely detrimental to the game.

Right now in Warno, tanks have more endurance than infantry. Which is crazy enough. But planes have higher availability than helicopters. And lower costs than they do. Heck, planes are literally cheaper than *tanks* in many cases.",1725148930.0

Pero deja que te haga una pregunta: en la empresa de tu familia, ¿crees que se podría dar el caso en el que tuvieseis que pagar a un trabajador 200k€? Porque ya te digo que yo no lo creo. 

Yo tengo muy mala imagen de los empresarios en España. Pero para mí (en mi cabeza ojo, formalmente no es así) la empresa de tu familia no está formada por empresarios, sino por trabajadores. Para mí un empresario va engominado, en traje, con un maletín con papeles debajo del brazo. Y creo que mucha gente en España tiene la misma visión que yo de los empresarios.

Última pregunta: Imagínate que la empresa de tu familia es una panadería, una pastelería, un bar, restaurante, lo que sea. Si le preguntan a tu padre de que trabaja... ¿Crees que diría ""empresario""? Porque yo probablemente diría panadero, pastelero, hostelero, etc...

"baldursgate","t5_2t07j","For a fighter->mage, you always want belm/kundane in the off-hand for the extra apr (you need it to reach 10 apr). The only other viable options are some shields with elemental resistances to naturally cap your (mostly fire) resistances or Defender of Easthaven for that extra physical damage reduction. However those don't really matter for a F->M since your defensive spells will get you covered instead and they are mostly used by divine casters instead.

As for main hand weapon, it's a bit more open. Flail of Ages is arguably the best option (just gotta do some weapon swapping once it's fully upgraded since its free action will block your imp haste). It deals a ton of damage, it goes through stoneskins with the elemental on hit, it can become a +5 weapon (which can hit anything in the game) and that slow on hit is just completely op (33% on hit, no save and bypass mr, that's ridiculous). In BG1 you can get a few early flail +1. Either from Icharyd (if your are not playing SCS, i wouldn't mess with him early on with SCS), in a cave near the Xvart village or you can kill Sonner without reputation loss for it too (you'll lose some xp when giving the bowl to Tenya if you kill him, but who care about xp in solo run anyway). And then you can grab the Thresher from Sorcerous Sundries. And in BG2, obviously FoA will be your friend for the whole game and you can get it pretty much instantly.

But there's also plenty of other weapons you can use depending on how you are feeling. Axe of the Unyielding, Foebane and Celestial Fury are all extremely powerful weapons too that will allow you to stomp the game with.",1725148931.0

"FamilyIsland","t5_3g2b0g","I hate how inconsistent this game.  It’s the only one I’ve ever played where players aren’t treated equally.  They make their own rules and tasks catered to their algorithm.  I, on the other hand finished the last event with positive energy gains and I’m a quarter of the way thru island 3 on the current event.  So far I’m about -1,600 in energy after collecting with 20% boost a couple hours ago.  
Maybe a helpful tip:  what I do when the first 50% axe booster drops, I spend almost the whole 15 mins collecting items(at 1X)you know for a fact will be used later.  I don’t multiply because it works against the average.  For example if I buy a bagel for 17 energy I get 2 bagels for 17.  If I buy at 2X I get 3 bagels for 34 energy(1 free).  If you do the math… everything should be bought at 1X with the 50% booster.  When 100% kicks in then go all out, just be careful not to overbuy.  Hope that helps.",1725148931.0
"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","I disagree that he’s smug. He’s more surprised and flattered, mildly interested. It’s definitely not something book Harry would have said and he was much more alarmed in the book. But to include that whole dodging girls and him being uncomfortable storyline would have involved more time and effort for something that could easily be thrown away without impacting the movie. 

I think there was so little personality to the movie characters that it livened him up, as well as actually demonstrated a friendly relationship with hermione. In the movies she’s always frowning gravely, shrieking at someone, or otherwise upset. Even though she’s admonishing him here and she smacks him in the head with a newspaper, the laughing interaction at least illustrates a playful friendly dynamic. Otherwise she’s either yelling at them or hugging them seriously while choking back tears after they’ve just survived something.",1725148931.0

You should be in the room as well if the principal tries to say it's just parents don't allow that, they are trying to separate the issue into different sections and make it seem like your teenage brain over-thought the interaction, if you allow the school to downplay this then your parents will lose trust in your word and will start to downplay your valid reasons, and it'll seem like the boy who cried wolf. 

Not only have you suffered her emotional abuse but now your self confidence sank because she intentionally embarrassed you in front of classmates, this is called teacher bully and it is malicious abusive behavior and you should let the school know who is influencing this generations mind and future, who is taking part in our degradation as a disintegrating Society.

One thing Ambien is intended only for short term use. Every night for a month is not short term.

Once your brain learns some of the skills needed for good sleep cycles, it tends to make the effect of the medication stronger.  So very likely to have more side effects.

When people are on meds, this is what happens. People should be informed to watch for this.
Typically as you get more neurofeedback progress, you will need lower doses.

This sounds like you are continuing on the Ambien. You may need a lower dose and slowly, eventually none.

I think you are losing sight of the fact that she isn't with him, she is with you.  If she had said ""if he got clean I would go back to him"" that would be different.  I think she just stated a fact.  They aren't together because of the drugs and wouldn't have broken up with him otherwise.

HVAC companies tend to also be more likely than roofers to give people a company car and better mileage reimbursement. 

My brother works at a residential window and door company, and his best friend is the top closer. Dude has had multiple 40k commission months and has cleared 250k every year since like 2019.

"LearnerDriverUK","t5_2wwc8","I suspect it's because a higher % of 'bad' drivers switch to manual.

That's only my personal guess. I chinny reckon.

My personal belief, and advice, remains - ""why not?"". A lot of people now are saying, why bother - when surely all cars will be auto soon... but I'm pretty sure that any driver aged 18 today is -at some point in their life - gonna want to use a manual. So if it's no more difficult, why not?

To me, it sounds like a sandwich deal - £5 for a sandwich alone, or a £5 meal-deal with a coke and a bag of crisps. There's very few reasons why you wouldn't go for the latter.

I know a few people who reckon it's easier to learn auto, but very few - and they've mostly never tried manual, so they're not really in a great position to judge.

Conversely, I know lots of people who've driven both types, and don't care either way. No preference, and no perceived difference in difficulty.",1725148934.0

"footballmanagergames","t5_2s0w5","My main save currently is with Rabotnicki in North Macedonia. After a few seasons where, despite now regularly qualifying for the league phase of European competition, I could barely get players from even the u21 national team to sign. 

In the end, I decided it's fair to use the editor to boost the rep of my club, that of the 1MFL and artificially boost the other teams. That plus I often reward players who pop up with an 8+ match rating on mine or other domestic clubs, with a PA boost. A lot of them have like 50-100, so letting them *potentially* actually be good in the future just to add quality domestically over time, has been helping. 

Naturally the increase in rep is the main thing. I am keeping it fair, so my club is still below the levels of teams like Dinamo zagreb/kyiv, hadjuk split, Slava Praha, shaktar donetsk or that sort of general tier of European clubs which football fans mostly know. Considering the 'story' of the club and some historic results like a 5-0 demolition of Mourinihos Fenerbache in a league phase match, or winning 1 nil vs Newcastle with a 90+9min header from a corner from the only set piece we got, with a possession of something stupidly low like 11% over the whole game. 

Point is, game is meant to be a sandbox for you to have fun in. If there's something thats killing the fun like in both our cases, players joining our teams, then it isn't 'cheating' or whatever to fix that. If anything, it makes it more realistic in both our circumstances. 

Do whatever you need to, to have fun with the game.",1725148935.0

What you're probably comparing yourself are specific noteworthy titles- ie, ones that achieved *major mainstream success*- and when you actually put those lists against each other you'll probably notice a lot made under entirely different business models: one time payment retail software succeeds on selling more copies, which means you're filtering for games which can appeal to wide demographics; continuing revenue streams (DLC, microtransactions, subscription fees, et cetera) succeed on repeat transactions, which means you're filtering for things with the capacity for deep and long-term engagement.",1725148935.0

Direct quote “Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected”.  
  
Under that scenario, if required, it could then be sent to the house for a vote where they would win, but not sent back to each state.  
  
The indictment is extremely damning and all of Trump’s actions are pretty much indefensible. The only way he escapes jail are (1) if he wins and dismantles DOJ (2) if none of the Eastman memos, Pence’s testimony, or any other substantial evidence is allowed because of SC’s extreme interpretations and “official business”.  
  
Trying to overthrow the election is not official business. But it might be ruled that all of this evidence is.   
  
Hopefully Chutkan begins her process very soon to review all of this evidence though, and the American people will see for themselves. A significant majority are not aware of the fake elector plot at all.",1725148936.0

You put 15k cash down on a loan , your payment is reduced by 200$ a month , but instead of financing 30k your financing 15k , meaning your not in a negative equity situation, likely ever, unless you trash the vehicle

That same 30k car that you leased with 15k cash down at. 64% residual will cost you over 19,000$ to buy at the end

She wished to raise the corporate tax rate up to 28% from its current 21%. That is a start, maybe you are just simply unaware of this or more likely you don’t care anyway. Either way those are a few issues where she has been clear. And oh yes she said she has no current objection to fracking.

"WorkReform","t5_5qpzgw","> No for real you guys this time we’ll cancel student debt

Biden tried, he canceled over 153 *billion* dollars in student debt and would have canceled way more but the Republican-controlled Supreme Court blocked it.  

> We’ll make weed legal you guys

Since 2012, 24 states have legalized weed. You wanna take a guess which party it was that made that happen?

> we’re gonna canonize Roe!

Look up H.R.3755, the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021, before Roe was even repealed. Passed the house 218-to-211. Every single Republican voted against it and the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn't even let it come to a vote. But no, it's the DEMOCRAT'S fault because they can't magically pass legislation without voting on it. Your anger *definetly* isn't misplaced.

If more people would vote for their interests we would have a real majority that could bring real change. But Americans have the memory of goldfish and are so deep into the ""both sides are really the same"" brain rot that they keep voting for the ""fuck you in the ass"" party. 

> I’m voting for them but fuck you libs if you think I have to like it.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","The size of a nib plays a part in the geometry of the writing angle. For instance, on the 700, there’s a big flare just behind the grip that allows the vacuum fill mechanism to work, and that means you can’t comfortably grip the pen much higher. A shorter nib would put your hand closer to the paper, and for the same section diameter, reduce the possible range of angles at which you could hold the pen. So while I agree in principle that there’s nothing inherently better about a larger nib, proportions matter and you probably want a bigger nib on a thicker pen, especially if it has steps or features that limit the possibilities for the grip.",1725148939.0

I am dealing with a project that has: BOOL, Boolean, bool, and 1 for the same thing.

The visual studio warnings like ""don't use reinterpret cast"" C26490, which when switching to spans, causes compile errors in xutility in some branch for C++20.

C++ is the ugly basement monstrocity I have to once in a while go ride when dealing with ancient (and usually closed source) codebases. For everything else I've used Rust and haven't looked back.

Don't try to bring any of this up to seasoned C++ devs, they will quickly let you know that modern C++ is nice and clean (which it is), and if used properly makes for beautiful code... its hard for them to let go of their multi-decade investment.",1725148939.0

However, when it comes to  TV shows, movies, video games, any form of media that touches on the subject, like losing a loved one it kinda brings me a bit of comfort I'm not alone and that what happened has happened. A big example that i will try not to spoil I could give you is from the show How I met your mother. Iykyk. I'm reminded of what happened to me and I do cry and get sad but it's like a good cry and it's one that makes my heart less heavy.

All this being said. You know your boyfriend the best. No matter what you do, it's not like your doing this to hurt him. You'll be there for him no matter what. If you think it's gonna be to much don't let something like a spoiler get in the way of his mental well being. Nothing wrong in preparing him for something that brings back that pain. I think deep down while he may get really sad I think it helps heal the heart too. Sometimes crying and letting those emotions out is what helps us keep going. 

I just wanna say one more thing. A quote that kinda keeps me going is the one that goes "" what is greif, if not loved preserved"" I hope your boyfriend heals and I hope he keeps loving his brother forever. If yall watched the episode by any chance I hope it all worked out ❤️",1725148939.0

"Ratschlag","t5_4cv0iv","Hallo,

das Kinder sich vor anderen entblößen, das Gegenüber bitten die Geschlechtsorgane zu zeigen oder sogar etwas in dem Po stecken kann in diesem Alter durchaus vorkommen. Ich würde daher ersteinmal von Sätzen wie ""dringend in Therapie"" etwas Abstand nehmen.

Auch wäre es angebracht, bei aller Wut ob der Verletzlichkeit der eigenen Kinder, Äußerungen wie ""wird bestimmt missbraucht"" etc. gegenüber Dritten nicht zu äußern.

Sollten sich die Befürchtungen nämlich nicht bewahrheiten, dann ist der Schaden massiv. Sowohl für die eigenen als auch für das andere beteiligte Kind.

Meine Empfehlung lautet, Fachleute auf diese Sache schauen zu lassen. Es gibt Beratungsstellen welche Eltern von Kindern, die Opfer sexueller Übergriffe geworden sind, bestens beraten, über weitere Schritte aufklären und Unterstützung hierbei bieten können. 

Ich wünsche Euch und Euren Kleinen alles Gute.",1725148942.0

The engine is more efficient driving a propeller than driving a generator that pumps juice into a battery pack that then gets used to power electric motors. Extra steps = lost efficiency, plus you have the extra weight of the less energy dense battery pack. I understand the equipment electrical demands, but that can be a much smaller battery and generator run off of the motor. I guarantee that if you come up with a total system weight for the hybrid system and instead match that with extra fuel, you'll fly much longer.",1725148943.0

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","Welfare vs. rights has been around all along.  They might “love” but they don’t respect.  And cognitive dissonance keeps them eating some species while trying to save others.  I gave up dealing with welfarists long ago and stuck with actual AR work.   

The only thing I’ve ever seen work with welfarists is some version of the Socratic method.  This involves asking questions, not arguing or presenting information.  I didn’t engage, but I saw others do it…successful occasionally.  

A neighbor helps rehab raptors but eats birds.  I just thank her and appreciate her tireless efforts.  (Raptors aren’t easy.)  A friend knows someone who is actively involved in saving rainforests, but uses Roundup.  It can be crazy-making if we dig or linger too long.  Sometimes all any of us can do is help our little corner of the world, even though it’s not the whole world.  None of us is perfect.  We plant seeds and hope others will nurture the growth (even unknowingly).  Everyone has a story of how they came to veganism, and it’s always a process, not an event.  

I went vegan overnight.  But I could look back and see a lot of seemingly insignificant and unconnected things over many years that led to my decision.  

Keep planting seeds.  Nurture them when you can and bless those who are doing something, even if they’re real head-shakers.",1725148943.0

"Eritrea","t5_2soot","It’s not just shared lifestyles and culture that link the ancestors of the Beja with the modern Beja, Tigre, and Tigrinya peoples; it’s also migration patterns, archaeological evidence, linguistic connections, and other factors. These elements collectively support the hypothesis that the ancestors of the Beja were also the ancestors of the Tigre and Tigrinya peoples. From a historical perspective, it is established that there were two major proto-Beja and Beja migrations into Eritrea: the first occurred between 4,000 or 5,000 years ago, and the second followed the end of the Adulis kingdom in the 7th century AD. Evidence of the second migration can be found in numerous Beja place names throughout the Eritrean highlands.

Additionally, both Tigrinya and Tigre communities have oral traditions that trace their origins to the Balaw people. The Balaw were a Beja-speaking group from the 10th century AD who originated in Suakin, Sudan. While oral traditions alone can be unreliable, when combined with independent eyewitness accounts from that period, as well as archaeological and linguistic evidence, they contribute to a compelling case for this historical connection. 

But I get it, you view DNA data from services like 23andMe and others as definitive evidence. However, similar to oral traditions, such data can be unreliable on its own. Without corroborating evidence from archaeology, linguistics, and independent eyewitness accounts, DNA data can lead to interpretations that may not be fully accurate. Additionally, the science behind DNA analysis evolves over time, with new methods and interpretations being introduced frequently. This means that results from these services can change every few years, reflecting ongoing advancements rather than providing a final, unchanging truth.",1725148943.0

Since you mention gaining weight, is it due to diet? Lack of exercise? Both? Could it be a medical thing? Certain medical conditions can cause odor/sweat. Certain medications can also cause odor/sweat.

"OOTP","t5_2sf6w","Update ballparks as time goes on. It doesn’t make sense for me to be playing in 2050 and the Royals are still at Kauffman Stadium and the A’s are at the Coliseum. If teams had the option of building new ones, it could make fan interest and attendance fluctuations more realistic. Ofc, some could be deemed “historic” like Fenway or Wrigley, but generally, majority of teams will be in new ballparks 35 years from now.

Make expansions feel more realistic. The minor league systems that autogenerate with new teams are always in the same 12-15 cities that already have either MLB or MiLB teams. It would be nice if you could take over a team’s operations far before the expansion draft so you can have a say in decisions about things like staff, financials, and the ballpark before the expansion draft.

This is probably too unrealistic, but I’d love to see agents in the game. Even if they’re just cosmetic, it would be cool for a free agent to be like “I hired Scott Boras as my agent, and you have 7 of this players already, so maybe we can get something done” during negotiations.

HOF committees would also be awesome. This feels increasingly doable with the HOF partnership, but who knows.

Obviously there’s the copyright issues over international leagues, but it would be nice if there were at least templates for other leagues. Idk how copyright law works especially with things like this, but I remember when non-licensed baseball games used to use knockoff versions of MLB teams and rules, so you were basically playing an MLB game but with different team and player names. Why can’t we have something like that in OOTP? I hate that if I create a league in Japan or Cuba or Mexico I have to manually adjust the financials, reputation, and rosters so that their players aren’t immediately free agent superstars for MLB teams.",1725148944.0

"RPGdesign","t5_31cnk","I'll consider myself in the unique position of being somewhat of an expert here. I created a PDF for Pathfinder 2e for creating mathematically balanced custom classes. It has like 10,000 lines of JavaScript code to calculate everything. It actually works quite well when opening in Chrome (and Chromebooks), but most other PDF readers struggle to work with every function of the PDF. And there are some of the more complex parts that simply don't work on anything but Acrobat, no PDF reader supports it all, not even Chrome's. And even then, PDF JavaScript is a subset of JavaScript, not all JavaScript, so it's limited to start with.

So you can do a LOT, if by a lot you mostly mean simple math because that's the main purpose for pdf JavaScript based on what I've seen. Not sure if I've encouraged or discouraged anyone but I will say I plan to make several more PDF products like this and try to see how far I can push it. I wish more people considered it, or many of the reasons you say, it's like a universal app that's easy to sell on itch.io or dtrpg. If you are willing to pay, there is an excellent source for creating advanced PDF forms: https://www.pdfscripting.com/ (there is also some free tutorials as well here)",1725148944.0

Then there are hard working, smart people who make a good living or at least enough to be happy. 

It should not interest anyone what your decision is. Emigrating is often very difficult on many levels. As a person you'll learn and grow so much. 

And if in the end you realise you're happier at home, that's just one possible outcome.

I think most people are simply too scared to try. Which makes sense in a way, at home you know the rules. Abroad the rules tend to differ vastly.

Again a real cynical & reductive way to look at the game.  There's saves and resistances and HP as well as AC, not to mention the unique abilities of enemies.

Kenta will grow up to be a kind of antichrist figure, which is why he is annoying and destructive. He makes the right choice at the end, but everything he does up until that point, is the path of a villain he might have been. Skynet’s compatriot.

Malcolm created the A.I. precursor to Kokoro, and she is selflessly loyal and loving. He has hope a Powerful Kokoro can learn these same feelings. He is playing a dangerous game he believes can be won.

Eiko is on a suicide mission. She has no idea she is a piece of a larger puzzle. She fights the T-800 head on, because she believes her primary mission is to prevent that machine from ruining the future, worse than anyone has seen.

From the article

>While the rest of the world is still debating what artificial intelligence might mean for jobs, citizens in the Philippines are already living in the new reality.

Also from the article

>For some, the rapid deployment of such tools has been a harsh awakening. Christopher Bautista, 47, had worked in the call center industry for nearly two decades. In his last job on a tech support desk he’d watched as AI took on more responsibility in gatekeeping customer calls and asking questions before routing to human agents. Then last November, along with about 70 other people, he says, he was abruptly put on so-called floating status — no work, no pay, but still on the books — after the client pulled the contract. He quit six months later for a job in sales while still waiting for reassignment. ""AI will take over our jobs,” Bautista said. “It’s cheaper and more efficient.""

"StructuralEngineering","t5_2ttcu","You should demand an explanation from Persons A, B, and C (especially Person A, who you say is a structural engineer) on what mechanism is causing your house to ""sink.""


Clay swells (expands) when wet. So the storm a month ago, if you have poor drainage (e.g. gutters with downspouts that discharge right next to your foundation), would perhaps cause a portion of your house to lift, not sink.


Person D seems to be suggesting some kind of construction defect. That would require significant justification, with photos, and a floor level survey of the floor above said joists. 


I looked at your three photos but they provided no context and were not helpful.


Buy a digital level. Check if all of your walls are plumb. Check all of your doors and windows are operable and are not rubbing. Cracks in your wall finishes from floor to ceiling is a bit odd (not to mention your reportedly new cracks in some concrete) and does probably warrant a report from a competent structural engineer if the cracks are indeed as you've described.

"RedditPregunta","t5_2ltzsq","Conozco ejercicios:

1.- Press de banca con barra 

El press de banca con barra es un ejercicio básico para aumentar los pectorales. Dominar la técnica será esencial para evitar daños o lesiones, por lo que se aconseja comenzar con un peso prudente y bajo la supervisión de alguien más. Este ejercicio se realiza con el cuerpo acostado sobre un banco, rodillas flexionadas y los pies apoyados en el suelo. Se agarra la barra con ambas manos ligeramente más allá de la altura de los hombros. A continuación, se baja la barra hacia el pecho y se eleva de forma lenta y controlada. Es esencial no arquear la espalda y evitar un movimiento brusco.

2.- Apertura con mancuernas

La apertura con mancuernas también se practica sobre un banco y con la misma posición. La diferencia es que se usará una mancuerna con cada mano y con las palmas mirando hacia dentro. El movimiento consiste en elevarlas estirando los brazos y juntándolas, para luego descender con ellas a cada lado del cuerpo hasta que queden de forma paralela al suelo. La altura a la que desciendan las mancuernas no deberá ser más allá de los hombros. Y siempre con los codos suavemente flexionados.

3.- Press inclinado con Barra

Por su parte, el press inclinado con barra repite la técnica del tradicional press de banca. Sin embargo, existe una diferencia y es que, como indica su nombre, el banco sobre el que se apoya el cuerpo estará inclinado hacia arriba. La espalda debe permanecer en todo momento erguida sobre la superficie, sin que se arquee.

4.- Flexiones de arquero

Las flexiones de arquero son un ejercicio muy recomendable para ganar volumen en los pectorales, además, cuenta con una ventaja añadida: también se trabaja el tríceps. La técnica correcta consiste en adoptar la posición de plancha y desplazar uno de los brazos hacia un lado, mientras que el otro se mantiene con el codo flexionado y sosteniendo el peso del cuerpo que también se inclina hacia esta dirección. Se cambiará de un lado a otro en movimientos alternos.

5.- Hex press con mancuernas 

A la hora de hacer el hex press con mancuernas hay que acostarse sobre un banco inclinado y sujetar una mancuerna con cada mano. Desde el pecho, con las palmas de las manos mirando hacia dentro, se levantarán juntas y con los codos flexionados. Para, a continuación, descender de nuevo con los codos apuntando hacia afuera.

6.- Pull Over con mancuerna

Uno de los ejercicios más comunes para definir y ganar volumen en el pecho, el pull-over con mancuernas se realiza con el cuerpo tumbado sobre un banco. Con las dos manos se agarra una pesa con los brazos estirados y por encima de la cabeza. El movimiento trata de desplazar esa mancuerna en alto hacia atrás y volver a la posición inicial. Algunos errores comunes son arquear la espalda y no flexionar los codos al bajar la mancuerna, además de hacerla descender demasiado.

7.- Fondos

Los fondos o dips se realizan en barras paralelas y trabajan especialmente la zona pectoral. Hay que sostenerse con cada mano en una barra y realizar un movimiento que consistirá en elevar y posteriormente descender el peso del propio cuerpo. Dominar la técnica es especialmente importante, ya que puede correrse el riesgo de lesiones. Pero, si se realiza correctamente, será muy eficaz para aumentar el tamaño de los pectorales.

8.- Press banca declinado.

El press de banca declinado cuenta con una técnica muy similar al tradicional, pero esta vez se practica en un banco que se inclina hacia abajo. Una adecuada respiración y la ayuda de un compañero serán muy importantes.

9.- Cruce con Poleas.

El cruce de poleas se realiza de pie, con el cuerpo ligeramente inclinado hacia adelante y los brazos abiertos en perpendicular, cada uno de ellos sujetando una de las poleas. Este ejercicio se basa en trabajar los músculos haciendo que ambas manos se junten delante del cuerpo.",1725148948.0

Thrall knew Sylvanas would win, even Saurfang saw it coming. But when she hard blocked, that wasn't a plot inconsistency or absurdity - it was a *reveal.* She isn't supposed to be that strong. Sylvanas in another book was once gripped by Baine Bloodhoof and it came to mind very quickly just how easily he could literally crush her bones.

The reveal was how brutally empowered she was and how Saurfang truly had no chance.

Sylvanas has always been strong, what with the super dexterity some marksmen have in Warcraft (including her sister Alleria and presumably Vereesa as well), and her own terrifying Banshee Scream, but this was a first for her raw physical strength to be so extreme.

With that said, you're right there are better examples. Mortal races don't withstand colossal blows in any lore we have actually seen. A Heroes of the Storm cinematic showing Varian shielding himself from Ragnaros' fire isn't exactly canonical. 

In The Tomb of Sargeras audio drama, it seemed pretty clear that the power of friendship is a huge asset we always rely on to defeat terrible foes. When Gul'dan was first on par with Khadgar, he still struggled to dispose of him and the newly joined Maiev Shadowsong even though he received a *gargantuan* power boost. When he focused on Maiev, Khadgar redirected the magical power. When he focused on Khadgar, he saved himself while Maiev threatened Gul'dan's life again. Even just those two who barely got along in the audio drama were working together to try and topple someone they both thought they couldn't beat, and they made it hard for him to squash them.

So much so that Gul'dan realised that the heroes of Azeroth would all join against him, and that with all of his might, he couldn't kill them all on his own. He relinquished his power and let it feed the portal that kicked off the Legion expansion.

Most foes are vulnerable to blade or claw; even Mannoroth fell to a single blow (twice). Warriors and Rogues and Hunters are still exceptionally dangerous, even if one-on-one they don't have great records against magic users - especially warriors who nearly always lose (one exception being Taran Zhu versus Garrosh which... Really doesn't sell Monks well).",1725148951.0

You need to be above the enemy since the splash area of the projectile is MASSIVE so you want to aim at their feet, then drop on them and start clicking their heads. It also inherits your momentum, so you never want to use it when standing still - you can double jump dash to give yourself some momentum. It's good to sneak quite close before pressing barrage.

If youre not confident with the shotgun, you can buy Cold Front and Torment Pulse. Warp Stone is pretty essential on him. But the damage potential of the shotgun is much higher, especially since you do a lot of burst damage but can't take a lot of hits in return.",1725148951.0

I see a lot of people here and elsewhere saying that Holmes is a straight man who has decided he's above sexuality. I can see why - the stories are written during a time where being straight was the expected norm. But Holmes would not view himself as straight simply because that concept didn't really exist back then. He's just not interested in sex. 

The question is whether he's choosing celibacy (making the sacrifice) because of his art or if we can take him at his word that *he's just not interested*. If it's the latter, then he's asexual. Either interpretation is valid but I personally feel there's way more in the books to suggest that he is what we now call asexual.

For those of us who are alcoholics, the thought of controlled drinking is the thing that we wished for years.  Just a few drinks… after a year being sober… puts us right back where we were every time.  We forget what alcohol did TO us and we only remember what it could do FOR, insanity takes over, we take the first couple drinks, the craving sets in, we get drunk.  If we don’t get drunk, we are not satisfied and the next time we get the job done.  The desire to drink stems from many things, mostly because we suffer from untreated alcoholism:  boredom, irritability, fear, success,etc… and if we don’t know how to manage those thoughts and feelings, we think about what a drink could do to make it better.  Working the steps with a sponsor teaches us how to find the source of peace and strength we desire which, in turn, takes away the desire to drink.  There is a solution and millions of people have recovered from alcoholism to live a life they only dreamed of before…",1725148952.0

> Because of Nifelheim, I'd recommend Cruel Force, Deathhammer, Archgoat, and Hellbutcher. Hellbutcher is Nifelheim’s vocalist and he released a solo album a few months back.

Don't recall ever listening to Cruel Force, but it's been on the radar for some time. Deathhammer is great, Phantom Knights is one of the best thrash albums of the 21st century. Not a fan of Hellbutcher or Archgoat personally though.

That doesn’t erase my anxiety but it helps put it on the back burner. A lot of situations that are supposed to be fun are scary for me, so reminding myself this is a function of my brain and not the environment lessens the panic.

Also, my childhood psychologist told me to “chase the panic attack”. Like you aggressively invite the panic attack (like trying to start a fight in a bar with your anxiety). It’s like when you look into a light to make yourself sneeze. Whenever I try this method I panic for like 2 minutes max and then the anxiety is gone completely and I’m fine. She told me a lot of anxiety comes from running from the anxious feeling and by chasing it down it erases a big component of the disorder.",1725148953.0

We see Frida pulling someone out and I assumed it was Sara because she had been tied up, but the big reveal was that it was Slater. I thought it was so bizarre watching Frida just hand Slater the knife, then sit on her hands for no reason as Sara is about to be killed. Frida wanted Sara to die because, I have to assume, Sara would be so fucking not cool with Slater not facing more direct punishment. The reason that pan out shot revealing she saved Slater goes so hard because I think we are meant to infer she left Sara to die. Frida says ""I knew I forgot something."" The joke being she ""forgot"" Sara in the fire. Like the look on her face when she looks over to see Sara is one of kind of genuine surprise. And the interaction feels too bizarre to be real.

Again, please tell me I am a silly man, but thematically it fits. Geena Davis' character also chooses to benefit from her situation, albeit in a different way, which is why her confrontation with Frida heavily involves a mirror. The women in peril band together when it is for their best interest, but the second they can get a leg up, it turns out we all suck.

- We reached 11 million subscribers! [Here is the front page at the milestone.](https://i.imgur.com/BHhMT7o.png)
- We also have a [Scavenger Hunt event](https://redd.it/1352dwc) coming later this week to celebrate.

### Rewatch Votes
- Should we create a section within our rules page for Rewatches, so that Rewatches can be set to a minimum standard and moderated as needed? **[Vote Passed]**

- All rewatches must begin with an interest thread. An interest thread should contain general information about the anime that is being hosted, and serve as a pitch to gauge how many participants may follow along for the duration of the event. **[Vote Passed]**

- A minimum of three (3) participants must express interest in order for the rewatch to move forward. **[Vote Failed]**

- The official announcement post must be posted at least two weeks in advance, and no more than five weeks. This post should also serve as the index thread. **[Vote Passed]**

- You must wait at least one year between completed rewatches of the same anime before suggesting a new rewatch, as well as anime that aired less than a year ago. If there are overlapping rewatches of the same anime, hosts should consult with each other to work something out. **[Vote Failed]**

- Hosts must be actively engaged in their own rewatch. This means responding to comments, and posting threads on-time. **[Vote Failed]**

- Add a clause to this section of the rules page that would grant exceptions?  ""If you wish to run a rewatch that falls outside these policies, send us a modmail."" **[Vote Passed]**

"EDAnonymous","t5_rbmui","I really feel for you. I only know what you've told me here, so if I miss something, say something incongruent with your understanding of your friend, or am wrong in some other way, please feel free to correct me. I'm not old by any means, but I am out of high school (and every day I thank God for that - being a teenager is *hard* on its own, even without dealing with an eating disorder) and I do think I have relevant experience regarding this. 

Sorry for the late reply, I was thinking about this post a lot and how to reply to you in a way that's kind + understanding, and also makes the point I'd like to make. 

It sounds like you're a student of some sort, here, and so is your friend. I'll talk about both my high school and college experiences, if you don't mind, but the tl;dr of it is that I presented *very* similarly to your friend during the worst of my eating disorder. 

In high school, I was a straight-As student, leader of several clubs, and had many friends and separate friend groups. I was involved in my community - especially my town's Chinese Association, which had regular dinners I'd attend. I ate with my friends every day at lunch. I enjoyed and still do enjoy experiencing new food, cool restaurants, learning how to cook, and so on. The results of my disorder were... unfortunately, reinforcing all of these. I'm not sure of your culture, but you can probably understand at least that amongst Chinese-Americans, commenting *very* bluntly on weight and bodies and food is completely acceptable. I had that going on; as well, people at school treated me better as my disorder progressed, and I found it easier to make friends because *people wanted to be around me* in ways that they weren't before. I often engaged in exercise as a compensatory behavior, as well - and any sort of athleticism opens up a whole new friend group (running buddies and so on). 

I was a social, busy, successful, and *deeply disordered* teenager who was comfortable eating in public, who could eat chocolate, and so on - I'll be blunt, I factored treats into my restriction as easily as some people can eat rice cakes (sorry, I really don't think they taste good...) I'd sneakily research restaurants ahead of time, or restrict for days in preparation for public meals, or restrict for days after to ""atone"" for my meals. Because I was *very aware* that if people in my life who had any power over me - that is, my parents, my doctor, my therapist, my teachers - caught on to my disordered behavior, they could stop me. And I did *not* want that. 

I lied my ass off. I was a pretender on every single front, to *everyone who knew me,* including people who had realized I was disordered (I will say, the biggest difference between me and your friend is that I was *not* open about my ED; but that's not an indication your friend is faking things). Even people who were concerned, or - in the case of my parents - directly responsible for me, would *never* come to the conclusion that they needed to cross-reference *every interaction* I was having each day to catch my constant lies about food and exercise and purging and lax abuse and restriction.

I had one hell of a life that I was fighting to maintain on every front, and successfully so, for 5 years. And I had an eating disorder, a restrictive and purging *eating disorder*, not ""just"" disordered eating, that I wouldn't get diagnosed until my freshman year college because I *kept living my life* until I physically couldn't anymore. I do mean this *very* literally. And even after - even through my therapies, my ins and outs into psychiatric wards and several more health scares and tearing my stomach lining from purging and heart problems that I don't think will ever go away, through medical leaves from college because my disorder was so severe I physically couldn't *be on campus* because admin was afraid I'd collapse and die-

I was living a life. I still am. It's not perfect - I isolate too much, and I'm *neurotic* about food, and my compulsive exercise is destroying my joints, and I cry in the morning when I don't wake up ravenous. But I have an internship in my field of study, and three roommates who are the coolest people I know, and I go on dates and to parties, and I travel where I can, and I see my friends often, and I'm going back to school next semester because I've finally stabilized enough to be there. And all of this is *not* to say that there's something wrong with you - because I've been there too, spending every day shut up in a room at my parents' house because I couldn't be trusted to live away from them, thinking only of my next meal, memorizing the calories of a hundred different and nutritionally insufficient foods, so weak I could barely get up to use the bathroom - I really and truly *get it.* I am so sorry for your pain. 

This is only to say that nothing you have said here disqualifies your friend from having an eating disorder - a restrictive one, even. And I hear you, I know how much it *aches* to see someone with similar problems living unlike you. It's invalidating, it's scary, it's frustrating. I am *so* sorry you're going through this, and I understand that a *lot* of conflicting thoughts and feelings are happening for you. I know you care for your friend, and I understand why it can be frustrating for you to be around her.

I hope I've been able to offer some meaningful perspective for you, genuinely. I hope this week is good for you.",1725148957.0

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","hi friend -

lust is a sin because we do the wrong things - consciously - seeking solely, gratification in this world. 

- Lust is an intense desire for something. Lust can take any form such as the lust for sexuality, money, or power. It can take such mundane forms as the lust for food (gluttony) as distinct from the need for food or lust for redolence, when one is lusting for a particular smell that brings back memories. It is similar to but distinguished from passion, in that passion propels individuals to achieve benevolent goals whilst lust does not.

Whether you've been making too many replies over a certain time period, or other X users are reporting your comments as spam on masse, you won't know. This is something that definitely sucks about X, and too many people who disagree with your ideas/views will abuse this report feature. It's an attempt by Musk to reduce bot accounts but it clearly fails miserably. I get scam accounts follow me almost every day. They follow 1000+ accounts, but no accounts follow them, and their bio's are vague AF. Normally attractive women too that will \*instantly\* DM you the moment you follow them back saying ""How are you?"", ""What's you name?"", ""Where are you from?"" despite all of that in my bio anyway.  
  
Similar thing for liking too many replies/posts in quick succession too. X will suspect you as a bot account and will block you from liking any more comments for 2 days.  
These ""algorithms"" are pointless, because bot accounts will stagger mass likes over a long time period in ""retaliation"" to get past these algorithms.

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Hurt/Comfort Prompts I have in mind: Person A has recently tried to kill themselves, Person B has been helping them and making sure they are okay. 

Person A hates themselves, Person B teaches them ways to love themselves. 

Person A and Person B has gotten into an argument where it ended in a break/break-up in the relationship. However, Person A can’t sleep without Person B next to them, and Person B is the same. They keep on until they realize that they need each other.

Person A is in therapy and wants Person B to be next to them. While Person A is venting, Person B makes sure that they are comfortable and safe by [insert action] (e.g. holding their hands, smiling at them, drawing circles on their backs with their fingers).

Person A is self-harming themselves. Person B is helping Person A and being respectful while Person B is putting Person A in therapy (if they allow it).

Person A is not comfortable doing something unless Person B is with them. This leads to Person B having to be there all the time. This leads up to an argument where they hurt each other. They stop, communicate, and learn and develop from each other in the end. 

A mutual friend of Person A and B kills themselves/dies. Person A and B are coping the death and are trying to move on.

I'll admit i'm kind trying to find a specific K-DRAMA rather than looking for recommendations, but any kdrama that matches the description are welcome as well as I am also looking for stuff to watch anyway. It's just that I recently watched a scene from a KDRAMA on reels where a guy was reaching for something or stretching his arms and his shirt lifted up with the movement, causing his toned stomach to appear and the lead girl stared at it, blushing. My explore page refreshed before I could do anything about this reels and it's gone forever now. But I suppose there aren't many kdramas with scenes like that out there (please notice that I'm not talking about a man lifting his shirt on purpose or taking it off), so I assume it's likely that someone here will say the right one I'm looking for??? Please thank you!!!",1725148960.0

**Title:** [USA-FL] [H] Apple iPhone 15 Pro 128GB - Blue Titanium - AT&T and Apple Pencil (2nd generation) [W] Local Cash / PayPal

**Username:** /u/naz20xl

**Body:**

**Pictures / Timestamp:** [Timestamp](https://imgur.com/a/EivX7CS)

**Apple iPhone 15 Pro 128GB - Blue Titanium - AT&T - $900 Shipped OBO**\
For sale is a like-new, pristine Apple iPhone 15 Pro with 128GB storage in Blue Titanium for use with AT&T (can be unlocked for free if requested through them). The iPhone has been in a Spigen case and has had a privacy screen protector on it since day one (will come with the iPhone), so it looks brand new. Battery health is also still at 100% as I made sure to use the optimized charging setting in iOS (cycle count: 224).

**Apple Pencil (2nd generation) - $90 Shipped OBO**\
Brand new, never opened, still in packaging. Was planning to use it with my iPad but ended up trading it in for a MacBook Air.

Repairs: None

If you have any questions, feel free to send me a direct message (no chats). If you’re local, I can knock off a few dollars for shipping and will accept cash. Thanks for looking!

"Kagurabachi","t5_97ke62","I hard disagree with your take about Shiba unintentionly feeding Chihiro's revenge complex.

The death of his father , propels Chihiro like a revenant no matter how much of a good person he is and I feel like people started low ball that a little , because of Chihiro's scar comment I think?

His mind always comes back to his and his fathers little bubble , living their happy simple lifes mostly disconnected from the rest of the world.

With that bubble popped questions about why did they killed his dad , how they disrespected him as a person and his legacy , the pain of never being able to see his dad again all gets intertwined as this lump of gigantic trauma.

https://preview.redd.it/kihhswsk93md1.jpeg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1aad15e0cf0043557015320506fa2b8355ba200e

Chihiro wouldnt have stopped nor could have stopped , he wants to uphold his dads name , he wants to learn why , he wants closure.

Only way Shiba could have stopped Chihiro would have been to beat his ass , tie up his arms and legs and lock him up in a Kamunabi SANSO fortress like the rest of the sword wielders.",1725148960.0

(i.e Is this what I want? Will I be able to give this child a safe, loving upbringing? Am I healed emotionally enough to take on this responsibility? Is the person I’m having this child with someone I want in my life long term? Have they shown me enough of themselves to prove they will also be safe to raise a child? Etc etc.)

Melusines aren’t related to dragons. They are born from elynas who was an abyss monster

>The Obsidian Codex Goblet implies they’re wandering the Night Kingdom in a half-dead state, but even this could be because losing their Authority messed them up somehow.

That’s not at all what it’s implying. The artifact is written from before Xbalanque became an archon and refers to how one day the corrupted pyro sovereign would be killed by one of the humans that the sage of stolen flame gave phlogiston, which is exactly what happened. The pyro sovereign lost their authority when they died.

>there are no Pyro Tribes. But again, Phlogiston *is* Pyro and the Saurians’ stamina bars even have small Pyro symbols in the middle.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There's an entire field of study to answer the question. It's called ""Philosophy"". It's worth looking up. The reaspn that the people you talk to have trouble defining an appropriat answer is because philosophy is *hard*.

But I'll try to give you a coherent answer anyways.

Now, to begin, you must start by discarding any notion that there is some spiritual something that defines ethics. There is no 'spiritual realm' or 'soul' or any of that nonsense. For any answer to make sense, you have to be firmly rooted in the provable reality that exists around us.

Next, you have to accept that human beings are not perfect - not anywhere close. I'm not just talking about making poor choices, I'm talking about evolution - we're an ongoing project. An iterative experiment under constant refinement. Evolution is messy and doesn't produce perfect answers ever - it old produces 'good enough'.

So, what is the foundation of human ethics?

Survival.

Go back about 800,000 years or so and you'll still find hominins working in family groups and supporting each other in proto-communities. That's because they had life beat a message into them which modern humanity has forgotten - SURVIVAL IS HARD.

Take in this thought for a moment - the evidence we have says that approximately HALF of all children born in the Iron Age died before reaching adulthood. 

HALF.

Note: this was not ANYWHERE NEAR the beginning of civilization. Iron Age civilizations were, in the grand scheme of things, relatively advanced. Metal tools were relatively common. Farming of wheat and other crops was widespread. Despite this, starvation and disease took a heavy toll.

When you look back at the foundations of society, the root of morality becomes obvious. Everyone was scrabbling to survive. In those circumstances, stealing a loaf of bread might be the difference between life and death, both for the thief and the victim.

But staying in groups and working together is a survival mechanism. A group of people working together are far more than a bunch of individuals working on their own. Try raising a barn by yourself some time to see what I mean.

Unfortunately, when resources are limited and death is near, keeping a community that isn't closely tied - such as immediate family - together can be very difficult. If people start abandoning social morals to survive it causes conflict - *violent conflict*, not sit-ins - which inevitably weakens the entire community.

Because of this, we started adopting firm rules of behavior, rules which were violently enforced. It's no wonder the punishment for crimes today is far less harsh than it was in ages past - criminals today rarely endanger someone else's survival and, even when they do, they simply don't have the power to threaten the cohesiveness of society or community the way they could thousands of years ago. Yet in those days that's exactly what they did - endanger the community as a whole.

Over the course of human history - a span of hundreds of thousands of years - humanity has identified and adopted fundamental rules which generally work. Those rules have become the very bedrock of our societies - morals. When morality truly breaks down in a widespread way, society ends, because without the rules society simply ceases to exist in any meaningful way. Have you ever watched Mad Max? You know why all of the people in those movies are raving murderous lunatics? Because if they weren't they would have *already* rebuilt society.

Biology helps with this. We have hormones and other mechanisms which help us create social bonds and keep them mostly stable. Sex and childbirth, in particular, are strong bonding experiences but far from the only ones. Our bodies have evolved to play tricks on us to help us maintain our communities - they're called emotions. Now I know people think all emotions are negative, but joy, love, compassion, etc, are all social emotions which have evolved to keep us bonded to each other in social groups.

All of these have a good underlying purpose - survival. Safety and prosperity are the keys to good morals. The problem is that rules that only apply when you don't get caught *don't make for very good rules*. Why? Because humans are creatures of habit. Once someone gets it into their head that they can break the rules and get away with it, it gets progressively harder to make them follow those rules.

SO, that means that we, if we want to keep our nice safe societies, not only have to have morality, we have to have EMPATHY. We have to *viscerally understand* how our rule breaking hurts others around us.

History is rife with examples of what happens when we abandon empathy. We start to blame all our problems on a specific group, we start to demonize them, to dehumanize them, and suddenly the rules of society change so they don't apply to that group the same way anymore. Next thing you know there is ethnic cleansing and genocide, slaves and untouchables.

Thus you have your answer - morality is rooted in history and society, our desire to have nice things and not be murdered in our beds. We treat others how we want to be treated because if we don't, part of us not only suffers (because guilt is an emotion too), but because we contribute to the corrosion of the very society that ensures our survival and happiness.

Humanity is great because we *work together*. At some level, all of us realize that we require other people to survive. It might, *might* be feasible for an individual or small group to go off on their own and survive, but chances are they would all die. Surviving a week or a month in the woods is not the same as surviving a hard winter. Those who don't prepare starve, simple as that.

Just because people today underestimate the difficulty of survival, doesnt mean that, on some level, they don't know and accept that even they were one of the *very few* that actually could, nobody actually wants to live without bacon and wifi.

Morals are a purely practical way of expressing the need for a community of diverse individuals to act in a manner that keeps them from being in constant and unending conflict. Ever go to a baseball game and been in awe of how 40 or 50 thousand people can get together and not have an orgy of violence and bloodshed? Its because we're social creatures. We have some rules so deeply ingrained in us that we understand them on and instinctual, emotional level. Those are morals.

See? Morals. No weird hoodoo necessary. You like living, I like living. We should live together and maybe not make the people around us into people who would rather we be dead.",1725148961.0

"MMORPG","t5_2qlxw","Even with Albion its important to realize that when it launched/in the early days; that game had a lot of negativity around it online (like all mmorpgs that release these days). People were not big fans of it. [https://steamcharts.com/app/761890#All](https://steamcharts.com/app/761890#All), you look at those numbers for the first 6 months it release, you probably had a lot of people saying it was gonna die. You can even see some comments from around the time it released too :https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/b792fp/albion\_online\_becoming\_free\_to\_play/. 

The important thing about Albion is that they had a fairly large financial safety net. At least as far as kickstarter mmorpgs go. And like you said, that was due in part to outside investors. They weren't solely reliant on kickstarter money which helped them significantly in the long run. I think before 1.0 release, they raised 10 million USD. Which is really good for a kickstarter mmorpg. I believe only 2.5 million of that was from pledges.   
  
For comparison, some of the other mmorpgs u/BodySea9974 linked post mentioned. 

1. Crowfall - 35.7 million - game failed at launch, currently in limbo as it was bought out by another company and it sounds like they may try to re-release it. Only 5.7 million of that was from player pledges

2. Ashes of Creation - It sounds like about 35 million has been at least confirmed in funding as of 2023? 

3. Camelot Unchained - 17 million with only 4.5 million from crowd funding. It sounds like they're aiming for a late 2025 release date. 

4. Pantheon Rise of the Fallen - Last reported was at 5.3 million in USD. 2.4 million of that was from a private investment.  This one is supposed to be going into Early Access in December of 2024. 

5. Fractured Online - I think this one has only confirmed 250k raised from players. Not sure about private investments. I know they struggled to find outsider investors and that's why they with with gamigo, but they had a falling out so not sure where their total funding lies. 

Those are the small mmorpgs that I know of. There's also of course the potential of under reporting and they're not including other investments, especially from private investors/publishers. So some of these games could be higher. 

I think with Albion, they were able to concentrate on a very strong base product. They had enough funding that when they had launch troubles, they didn't go immediately under. And were able to address feedback/player concerns and play the marketing game well enough that they were able to bounce back really well by the end of their first year. A lot of these other mmorpgs ended up promising the world and were not able to deliver on such small budgets for what was promised. And because they had no run way left at launch, they weren't able to address player concerns before the game went under and bounce back like Albion did. And going free to play once they had a strong foundation built allowed them to attract players who were too unsure if they would enjoy that type of game.",1725148962.0

Oftentimes a child just changes the memory as they can’t comprehend what actually happened due to inexperience. 

Give your wife some compassion as she’s a victim and would never purposefully put her daughter in danger. 

Now that you’ve brought it up (which was absolutely right of you and necessary) you both can make decision together as parents to do what you need to protect your daughter. 

Allow your wife to feel safe to share her trauma with you. When one feel like the other person won’t judge them, they open up more.",1725148962.0

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","Firstly, don’t ever apologise for writing much. Any details are helpful to understand more what you’re going through.
While it may be possible that you’re autistic, I’d suggest getting diagnosed without convincing yourself that you know the result for sure.


I tried that before and thought I had BPD so much that I started applying some things to myself just to convince myself I was borderline. 

It’s good to notice some symptoms, but don’t let it stress you out. It’s normal to suspect something when you have things telling you it may be true. 


And the fear is normal. I was so scared before my first psychologist appointment. I went there. And just let my mind guide me. 


You can try and prepare what you want to say in your mind. I mean make a scenario, learn it and just recite when there.

I’ve had two magical moments where I decided to share these skills with some friends and brought the birds in.  The raven just flew in and stared at us for a bit.

The crazier moment was the Barred Owl.  I made the sound and the owl responded,… angrily.  Like really angry.  Barred Owls sound like, “Who cooks for you?”

This Barred Owl was saying, “Who Who Who WHO COOKS FOR YOUUUUUU!”

Then it started flying in towards us and getting closer.  Honestly probably dumb at that point to continue goading it, but I had to, for science.  

So I kept hooting.

Well two other owls from different directions started to also join in the angry hoot fest and they were also flying inwards and sounding closer.

Then two of them ran into each other and started fighting.  I decided I would stop there.

TLDR: Showed off my hooting skills to my friends, started an owl gang war.

!delta true I should have said in the last century. Essentially since food scarcity wasnt an issue anymore for the majority of the population.

>Not really saying a lot considering the male equivalent of the dad bod is rather effortless to cultivate

I never felt like that was actually a thing outside the internet? The thing is for men there hasnt been such a drastic change. Men in the past had to be more thin perhaps but there was not much expectation of any kind of grooming like we have today. Gyms, abs and male beauty products were not a thing in the 70s.

>Why? You can't just pick four random images to compare with each other. Especially not since one of them is seemingly a Life magazine photoshoot .

The pictures demonstrate what I mean because I assumed most people today would call all of these women ""thin"". Its to demonstrate a difference in body type so it doesnt matter where they come from.",1725148964.0
