There's also no reason why you should adhere to what the mind tries to do or make sense of with photography.  Photography is the art of making visual observations and there is no right or wrong way to do that.  This photo is very appealing and I wouldn't change a thing about the focus.  

If you want an emotional interpretation of the image, have you ever looked at lips you wanted to kiss, but were unable to?  For me that same feeling is evoked through this image.  If the focus was shifted to the eyes it would be an entirely different image, and probably less interesting since I've seen that hundreds of times.

The only place these critiques would apply is if either the client (if there even is one) didn't like the image, but I don't think that has anything to do with the photograph itself.","1328054402"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","By that logic, if someone feels obligated to help their friend move, then said friend is guilty of slavery.

IMO, it depends on why they feel obligated.  If they feel obligated because they think some unlawful harm (violence, economic harm) will befall them if they don't give in, then that could be coercive.  If they feel obligated simply because they think they owe their partner or don't want to make their partner unhappy (not because of fear), then I say they've made a free choice.

You're not entitled to your partner's happiness or affection, so if your SO pouts after you refuse sex with him/her, I don't think that's enough to compel you to do something you don't want to do.  That's the consequence of your choice, but it doesn't rob you of free choice. 

You are entitled to be free from violence, so if violence is threatened then you are being compelled against your will.  The consequences in such circumstances are unlawful and unreasonable, so it does rob you of free choice.","1328054402"

I was trying to emphasize the fact that I can find my own damn porn, and I stay away from any porn that markets itself as female-friendly.  I am just not interested.  

For you to jump on me for being sexist is pretty lame.  As you just said, when people say ""female-specific"" they DO mean softer and more romantic.  

And, for the record, I know there are a shit-ton of women who like the rougher stuff.  But THEY (we) are not the women being catered to with ""female-friendly"" porn.

It's like video games.  There are PLENTY of girl gamers who like traditional, mainstream video games.  But since a lot of girls don't like traditional video games, the developers have created a niche market, geared to appeal to females.  A lot of girl gamers probably stay away from those games, because they would rather play your normal, violent/graphic/creepy/whatever games.  That isn't sexism on the part of the girl gamers ... it is an understanding that that niche is not for them.","1328054406"

All those people who complain when the price dips have the wrong mentality. Dips are simply buying opportunities to accumulate more silver.

If you are like most silverbugs, the answers will be *""years""* and *""to the moon""* respectively. That being said, you want to accumulate as much as possible before it gets to your target price. The increase in silver prices means that you get FEWER ounces for your hard-earned Federal Reserve Notes.

Genesis 5:27 says Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty nine years, which ended in the year of the flood.

Yet, the Bible tells us only eight people were saved from the flood and Methuselah was not one of them. Did Methuselah build his own boat and hide from the Holy Ghost? Or did the reporter get the wrong information and religious numbers from the Ghost - again? Or, from some other place? Which account is in error? Are both wrong?
In Genesis 46:23, Dan is reported to have had one son. In just four generations, that family numbered sixty-two thousand, plus servants. If Dan had fifty sons and each son had three wives, he could not have made it. You figure it out, I can't. I don't understand religious numbers.

Such as when they find new art that they want to post someone might beat them to it. So they don't bother posting, which I cannot blame them for (no need to see the same piece of art 7 times in the new tab). But because of this a lot of new members get scared off and don't know what to post. I'm sure I read it in the other comments that a lot of people post Memes and such because they don't know what to post. I agree with that.

I am a martial artist (aikido) and have always been taught under the following mantra:

If you ever have to use it, you have already lost.

The real skill is in conducting yourself in a way in which you never end up in a fight. I understand this is a skill that we develop as we mature, and part of that journey is in dealing with idiots like this bully.

If your son gets into a fight or rises to the bait this lad is laying, the way it seems to me is that when we match energy levels and attitude with people like this, we are in just as much rapport (strange as it may sound) as if we were friends laughing at the same joke. By entering into rapport with this person, your son is being like him.

In terms of giving advice, I don't know if it is my place! I was bullied mercilessly during my school years until I learned just to say 'that's right' and walk away.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I guess a more detailed explanation is that banks don't want to deal with the risk of something falling through when it's done on financing. Even if you're pre-approved for financing, your lender might not accept the property in the condition it is.

The deal might fall through and the Bank(Seller) would have wasted months.  Many times, foreclosures are sold as-is. Banks don't even really know what the property looks like, they're just trying to sell it and take it off their books. If you are financing the purchase, sometimes the bank that gave you the loan will have certain requirements on homes you buy. 

They basically want to make sure money enters their pockets. They don't want to go through a 60 day process, only to find out that you don't actually have financing because the property doesn't meet certain guidelines and standards. ","1328054442"

\*sighs\* You didn't do what I asked with my first question.

Here's what he *said* when he worked on the Sabbath. Matthew 12:11-12

&gt;He said to them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”

He justified it.

As for the fig tree?

It's never said that it *belonged* to someone. Fig trees (in fact, all kinds of trees) just grow in the world, you know. As for the donkey? Well, he didn't steal it, did he. His disciples did (yes, I'm being legalistic). Also, the owners just were like ""Dude, whatcha doin'?"" and the disciples said, ""The Lord needs it,"" and the owners didn't say anything back. So it wasn't some furtive ""steal it in the night so no one sees you"" kind of thing (this part is mentioned in Luke, but not Matthew. Also keep in mind that they're telling the same exact story there, it's not two separate instances).

Jesus justifies ""working"" on the Sabbath as I already showed.

Yannow, a much better argument for you would be to talk about the blatent destruction of property Jesus did in the temple, later in Matthew 21, for instance. Learn your Bible, you can beat people with it when you know it better than them.","1328054445"

No he didn't.  He solves the problem of infinite regress with the first and unmoved mover.

&gt; Still has a cause.

This doesn't make any sense.

&gt; That would have had to begin with Aristotle figuring out what he was 
&gt; saying. 

No, it's not hard.  One begins by reading Aristotle and accurately discussing what it is he says.  You don't do this.  So, not knowing what Aristotle says, you have no basis to make meaningful judgments about what he says.","1328054447"

It was an op-ed article by Allen West in which he was telling Pelosi and other liberals to get the hell out of America.  I glanced at the byline, said the word warmonger, and put it down.  He looked at me with a shocked expression on his face and asked if I called West a whoremonger?  I said no.  He is a warmonger, a man who loves war.

The conversation stopped there.  He did not press it and neither did I.  My insight is this.  He rightly believes that the leftist are out to destroy the America he has always known.  He believes those same liberals are against America going to war against her enemies because they hate America.  He completes the fallacy by believing that people who want America to go to war against its enemies are patriotic, conservative Americans.  Being in favor of war is not about the war in and of itself.  It is about being part of the group that is trying to save America.  It is about group identification.","1328054448"

To be fair, I'm only 2.5 hours into the game but already I can tell there is more ""openess"" to it rather than XIII's linear style. The combat system is basically the same but with a few new tweaks. The level up system (crystallium or whatever its called) isn't as spread out as XIII's was. It's no longer seperated by paradigm class and takes place on one giant crystal grid. It's hard to explain but I like it as opposed to the previous style. 

If renting is not an option, then I would say buy it if you are a hardcore FF fan. The only reason I rented this one instead of buying it is because the last direct sequel made (FF X-2) instantly made me regret buying it.

""Accuracy of Home Pregnancy Tests at 3 Weeks Pregnant

At 3 weeks pregnant, it's probably too early for you to take at a home pregnancy test. A majority of home pregnancy tests on the market claim that they're over 99 percent accurate, and some claim that they're accurate as early as the first day of your missed period (which will be next week, at 4 weeks pregnant). 

Don't be misled by false advertising. Home pregnancy tests work by measuring the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine. This pregnancy hormone is produced from cells that come from your placenta. hCG enters your blood stream after the fertilized egg implants in your uterus. As your pregnancy week by week continues, the amount of hCG in your blood stream increases. 

At 3 weeks pregnant, you may not have high enough levels of hCG for a home pregnancy test. It's probably best to wait one or two weeks after your missed period before taking a home pregnancy test. You might get false relief, when you are indeed pregnant. Sometimes, you'll get false hope, in the event that you experience a very early miscarriage.""

&gt;Latin American reactions in the 1820s
The reaction in Latin America to the Monroe Doctrine was undeniably upbeat. John Crow, author of The Epic of Latin America, states, “[Simón] Bolívar himself, still in the midst of his last campaign against the Spaniards, Santander in Colombia, Rivadavia in Argentina, Victoria in Mexico—leaders of the emancipation movement everywhere— received Monroe's words with sincerest gratitude”.[11] Crow argues that the leaders of Latin America were realists. They knew that the President of the United States wielded very little power at the time, particularly without the backing of the British forces. Furthermore, they figured that the Monroe Doctrine was powerless if it stood alone against the Holy Alliance.[11] While they appreciated and praised their support in the north they knew that their future of independence was in the hands of the British and their powerful navy. In 1826, Bolivar called upon his Congress of Panama to host the first “Pan-American” meeting. In the eyes of Bolivar and his men, the Monroe Doctrine was to become nothing more than a tool of national policy. According to Crow, “It was not meant to be, and was never intended to be a charter for concerted hemispheric action”.","1328054467"

Please direct him to the [EPICA](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/304/5677/1609) and [Vostok](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/antarctica/vostok/vostok.html) [Ice cores](http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/science/contenthandler.cfm?id=1491).  They are cores of layered ice drilled from Antarctica that show that there have been 780,000+ seasonal shifts between summer and winter that have deposited roughly equal amounts of precipitation on the Antarctic.  You can literally see each of the 780,000+ years recorded in those Ice cores -- so no tricky formulaic inferences.

You can also point out that there are stars in the sky whose distance can be measured using straight up geometric parallax (just observing their position in the sky 6 months apart which show the maximum deviation and doing a little trigonometry) which reveals that some are 20,000+ light years away.  Then tell him the official definition of a ""light year"".

Neither of these use carbon dating but easily show that the earth is more than 10,000 years old.

- Keep holding down the reset button for 30 seconds while the router is unplugged

- While holding the reset button, plug the router back in

To summarize, you hold down the reset button for 90 seconds without letting go. 30 seconds while the router is on, 30 seconds while the router is off, and 30 seconds while the router is on again.

For the two years he was at my school, student A constantly behaved as if the rules didn't apply to him and in an anti-social and criminal manner (much unlike the OP's son). The rest of the student body verbally lashed out at him quite harshly and publicly (including a facebook group that resulted in a suspension). After about two years of back and forth criminal and negligent behavior from Student A, the student body, and the administration, the ""retaliation"" against student A narrowed down to a few students. One day Student A had had enough of it after being verbally ridiculed and having poptarts spit in his face (instigation much?). Later that day, he stole an exacto knife from an art supplies room, snuck up behind Student B (poptart kid), and attempted to murder him by jamming it into his carotid artery. Student B nearly bled out and was in the hospital for half a week. Student A was tried as an adult (age 17) and took a plea bargain to aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (dropped the attempted murder). Now I seriously doubt OP's son would behave even close to this way, but that said, NIP THIS SHIT IN THE BUD!","1328054481"

I was 15, and my friend and I got permits to hike in the Olympic forest in the PNW. I think we were going to a place called third beach. Well, we hiked about 10 miles to our campsite, got absolutely shitfaced drunk on patron, and went to sleep in our tent. We were on the beach, but high enough that the water wouldn't come to us, or so we thought. There must have been a fucking storm in the middle of the night, because at 4am, I wake up sleeping in at least 5"" of water. I sit up, and my friend had vomited in his sleep, and mixed with the sea water, so that was extra nice. I wake his ass up, we get out of our tent. The wind is at least 40mph, with gusts of 60 or so. We're completely soaked, and colder than shit. The wavers are crashing against our tent. We drag our tent up to where the fire was, and for an hour try to start a fire. All of our matches were soaked and useless, but there were just a few tiny embers left from the previous night. The problem is all the firewood is soaked as well. My friend and I set off barefoot in the woods in nothing but boxers, finding twigs and whatever we can to start the fire. It took us an hour, but we eventually started it, and got a raging fire going. There we were, mostly naked, holding our sleeping bags over the fire trying to dry them out. We eventually dried our shit, and got back to sleep under a tarp, but this was 3 hours later or so.","1328054490"

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","I've got a question for you guys. What if we were to map all your emotes to equivalent ones we have here.

So all the rainbow dash ones, for example, we'd try to find the most matching rainbow dash, and set it in our CSS.

Blank posts would no longer be an issue (there would be an equivalent in-sub emote shown) and you guys can still use whatever emote you would like.

Is this idea worth exploring?

It came from circlejerk, who redirected all of our emotes to [this image](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/NR9Jp7WrOSsD7jFJ.png) so that users wouldn't see blank posts when using mlp emotes. [Here's their stylesheet](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/stylesheet.css), ctrl+f flutterfear.

I'd love to hear from all of you, so please link this idea around.

There are a few issues with this idea. First is, the CSS will be much longer. It's also going to be very challenging for us to keep up with you guys. But if the burdeon is on us, we'd prefer it over sacrificing usability for our users, both those who want to user out of sub emotes, and those who hate seeing blank posts.

edit: after deliberation it was decided that this would be too demanding in practice. Back-end is much too complicated. This idea is shelved for now.","1328054491"

You reinstall whatever you need from some version controlled master 'base or disc and move one.  That's called Tuesday.  You learn never to get too attached to anything on your system.

"funny","t5_2qh33","My church did not take a literal interpretation of the Bible.  They were willing to accept that some stories were just stories.  The finer point regarding who did what action amongst the holy trinity is really more of a Catholic concern.

No, they did not threaten children with Hell, ever.  The closest they would come to it is to tell us we didn't need to be afraid of death.  All you have to do is let the love of Jesus into your heart, and you would have eternal life in heaven.  They didn't really get into the contrary.  

If you read the bible, it doesn't really discuss hell very much either.  The concept of fire and brimstone scary Hell and Satan was something that became popular in the early church after the books of the bible had been written.  It was a way to scare ignorant people into converting to this new fangled religion.  It was then further expanded in novels like Paradise Lost, and further pushed during the Christian revival periods.

While it wasn't the official stance of the church, many church-members felt you didn't even have to believe the whole ""jesus christ is the only son of god who died on the cross to have our sins forgiven"" thing to get into heaven.  You just had to be a good and loving person.","1328054502"

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","It all depends on what type of battle you're fighting. Bow troops are far more useful in siege attack and defense scenarios. Field battles are a mixed bag for bows (you can do some good work if the enemy camps on a hill but otherwise they'll get only a few volleys off).

The best scenario of all (for bow troops) is the siege attack. With proper maneuvering, they can empty their quivers and significantly soften up the defenders. The key to all this is to use a yari ashigaru to distract the enemy bow and move the rest of your army to the other side of the fort. This will allow you to fire at the defenders without risk of reprisal.

In the case of siege defense, bows are used to man the walls (obviously) and must retreat when the enemy nears the top of the wall, allowing the stronger melee fighters to take over.

In field battles (assuming the enemy doesn't just charge you) you can exploit the AI (just as you can in siege attack). The key to this is to perform a series of skirmishes with your bows, drawing individual enemy units away from the main army. Once these units are separated from the main body, they can be surrounded and crushed.

In the case that an enemy is charging you during a field battle, the best you can hope for is to position your bows on the edge of a cliff facing the enemy. In the best case scenario, the enemy can be fired upon continuously from above while your melee troops hold them at bay. In the worst case scenario, your bows can fire a few volleys from the front of your army before retreating behind the lines (a skirmish).","1328054511"

Please show me a rock that has ever given informed consent to anything.

&gt; or a dog

Again, I've never heard of a dog giving informed consent.

&gt; or 100 men

Sure, why not? As long as every one of those 100 men consents to a marriage involving 100 men, who gives a shit?

&gt; or a pillow (happened), a dead person (happened), an anime character (also happened).

Again, none of these can give informed consent. My criterion explicitly excludes these possibilities.

&gt; Today these are a minority, a novelty, exactly like homosexuality was yesterday,

Are you perhaps confusing homosexuality with overt homosexuality? Because homosexuality itself - as in, private feelings of same-sex attraction - has been at a fairly constant level for at least thousands of years.

&gt; but what about tomorrow?

Nothing. Just like giving women the vote didn't lead to giving dogs the vote, and stopping the death penalty didn't lead to letting murderers totally off the hook. The slippery slope fallacy, which seems to be the entirety of your reply, is utter bullshit.

&gt; The line's always gonna be erased and redrawn based on convenience because marriage is purely a social thing.

That doesn't follow. It has the potential to be erased and redrawn because of that, but it is not necessary.

&gt; Oh and the whole ""LOL IT DOESNT AFFECT U AT ALL!"" argument is also a crock of shit. You fucking SEE it happen, you run into people who have done it, etc, ergo it affects you.

So? My reaction to two entities giving informed, mutual consent is entirely my own problem. If I decided that heterosexual marriage was abhorrent, it wouldn't give me the right to prevent it from happening.

&gt; Might as well stop trying to fight crime because the odds that YOU, out of 7 billion people, are going to get murdered in your lifetime, are as low as getting forced to marry a gay person, i.e. a chance so small you may as well say: ""it doesn't affect you"".

What the fucking fuck? You're seriously arguing against gay marriage on the basis that somebody may violate your human rights by forcing you into a contract you do not want, which you could exit at absolutely any time (unless somebody was threatening you or others to coerce you, in which case they're breaking the law even more than before)? Guess we'd better outlaw spoons, because somebody might force you to gouge your own eyes with one! And paper has to go.

Second, I think in a sensitive and painful situation like this, I would rationalize that the phrase ""Pray to God"" could be considered just a sort of social slang, similar to when I say ""Good-Bye"" I'm not really saying ""God Be With You."" And so I would sing the song as written. You could also rationalize it as when you are singing a song, you are also singing in character.

Second choice would be a different song altogether. Third choice would be decline. I would not alter the lyrics, considering how annoying it was when John Lennon's song got mangled on New Years Eve.

I do understand your discomfort, but the way the phrase is used in the song, it doesn't strike me as that religious.

Adjusting for inflation, they would only be worth like $15 att best today. But that's probably one of the reasons that Detroit has become such a hellhole. I admit the auto industry in Michigan was a very extreme case. But in general they do seem to have a tendency view their members as more than what they are worth.

I understand what you are saying about U.S. vs. China. I don't see U.S. workers as being greedy at all for needing more, because the cost of living is much higher out here. There is also nothing wrong with some expectation of a first world lifestyle, but when workers feel they are entitled to even more than they are worth in even the country they live it definitely becomes a problem.

I firmly believe that workers should try to seek higher wages, but they need to make sure they can justify those wages if they expect to keep their jobs.","1328054520"

And of course your friends granddad was alive, that's quite obvious. 

What I'm saying is, you wouldn't be a reliable source to talk about that granddads life. 

But how do you know the stories they tell about that granddad are actually true? You talk to those that knew him personally right? Preferably someone that was actually there? Photographic evidence perhaps?

Of course, the problem is a bit more fundamental here, how do we verify someone actually existed? Well if it's a figure of historic importance; then that will reflect in historic texts of those times. 

Besides all that, I'm sure you are aware of the plenty contradictions about what Jesus did/didn't say or do in the gospels. 

It's an interesting question of course, but as the evidence severely lacks and because the defining characteristics are pretty much copied from older mythical beings (most notably Horus, it's pretty much the same thing) I am compelled to settle for C until any evidence suggests otherwise.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","If you were really budgeting for something, you could try getting a couple of Shure SM57s. Cheap, reliable, and pretty much indestructible. You could go for the Shure SM7B but again, it's a little over your budget.

Instead of giving you a million different choices for mics, I'll just give you what to look for.

Since you're recording vocals and also guitar, you definitely want something that has the standard 20 hz - 20khz frequency response. An omni patterned mic ensures that when you're close miking the guitar, you won't get any low wobbly proximity effect, so look for something with that pattern. Unfortunately your budget is quite low, especially when it comes to microphones. Your best bet actually might be something by the company 'Blue'. They have a very versatile price range, and also have a lot of great consumer gear.

Edit: ALSO! I'd recommend you get some sort of pop filter to smooth our your plosives (P's, B's, T's, etc.) in your vocals. Unless the mic comes with a wind screen like the SM7B already has on it.","1328054528"

&gt;Samyang 85mm f/1.4. Amazing portrait lens. Optical quality is superb (at least in my standards). Only drawback is that it's a manual lens and focusing is a bit tricky.

The A230 doesn't have the mirror lock-up that the A580 has for easy, perfect MF and remember that the viewfinder in a $500 camera is pretty small and difficult to manually focus.  I wouldn't recommend this lens to a beginner.  That being said, it is a pretty cool piece of glass.","1328054532"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","You NEED to smartcast her E if you want to be successful, preferably all her spells (except maybe the ulti, that can go wrong quite easily) but definitely E.

Once you have somebody poisoned all you'll have to do is hold your mouse over them and keep spamming your E and not having to click on them each time is going to make that drastically faster and deadlier.

Her W gives you vision in brushes, so use it to check them. You can also use it to deny your opponent farm by just placing it right behind the minion wave. If they walk through it, they're poisoned and you can harrass them with E, if they don't they'll try to walk around and you can usually place a Q and then E.

At level 6, if you feel confident enough about it, you can just let them get close to you, then flash in and immediately R. That should surprise and stun them long enough to kill them off with a Q/E (and cut off their escape with a W, too). Don't use that R unless you're absolutely sure you're in range though. It has a fairly long cooldown and it only slows if they're not facing you (still a pretty good slow though).

I may disagree with another Christian about whether or not the Bible is the literal word of God, where every word must be interpreted as inalterable fact regardless of time and place, but I know ultimately that both of us believe in the same character of God and have accepted Jesus as our savior , and that therefore we are both Christians.

Answer: Fear and stupidity.  There is a general assumption that if human testing is made legal, then there won't be nearly enough volunteer human test subjects to do whatever experiments are needed.  The lack of volunteers will some how trigger a massive black market of kidnapped human test subjects to perform mad scientist experiments on.","1328054541"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Dude, I appreciate you dropped the arrogant act and took the time to write an actual response, but you're still attributing to me an argument I didn't make. I worded my original comment poorly (more out of pith than anything, I wasn't expecting to spend hundreds of words defending it). I don't feel I was using a fallacy in serious discussion, because prior to your entry into the comment thread no one was having a serious discussion! 

In my brevity I was not trying to argue that racism in Japan was a non-issue, or that it should be ignored because worse atrocities happen elsewhere. If you note my reply to the very same poster you quote I actually agree that Japan probably is among the worst offenders when considering first world countries with problems of systemic racism. Does my reply minimize the faults of the Japanese problem with racism by calling it ""shabby treatment"" yes I absolutely do, but truth be told my end goal was comic effect not an intellectual buttress. 

But I guess here's my biggest problem, is that you keep on calling it ""my argument."" I've played the academic game too, if I ever write an ""argument"" on the role governmental policies play on racism in developed countries it would be 200 pages and contain an additional 30 pages of citations.

What I wrote was a snarky comment in response to a different poster's snarky comment. My intent wasn't to make a sweeping statement about Japan and their policies on race, or coax a treatise on ethocentrism into a 2 sentence post. I really was not trying to communicate anything past the blatantly obvious observation that Japan isn't as bad as Auschwitz. I tried to use spunky wording to hopefully give a few people a bit of a giggle.  The only reason I said this was because, on my first reading, it seemed like Ol_lefteye was so eager to complain about Japan he *was* saying it was as bad as the Nazi's, even after other people tried to object.  Maybe this is a misreading of Ol_lefteye's follow up post.

So I guess this is the real kicker: I don't disagree with anything you wrote about Japan or the practice of discussing racism within local realities instead of looking for universal absolutes. I never for a second attempted to compare Japan to the rest of the world in terms of ""worst racism"". If anything my intent was the opposite, to point out the absurdity of comparing Japan to the rest of the world as Japan has ""apple"" flavoured racism, and other places in the world have ""orange"", ""lemon"", and ""bitter nettles"" flavours.

The awesome part is that as I was backin' up, backin' up over the battlefield, I kept walking over dropped weapons and was able to build at least four or five minisentries in a row right after the other team destroyed them.

"MLPLounge","t5_2t403","Well, the point kinda was that ""choice"" is a bad term when there's a distinct lack of alternatives that are equally accessible, priced and available. Maybe every 9/10 restaurants have a ""Nutty Happy Hour"" lasting from 9 am to 12 pm when they only serve meals containing nuts. I really don't think anyone would argue this still constitutes an actual choice. 

Granted, we should probably all opt to consume different types of media and probably read more but yeah, well, you know. I can barely be arsed to breathe on my own, now I'm supposed to actively read stuff? I don't even know how it would fit into that analogy. I guess it'd be like realizing all restaurants are fucked, moving into the forest and only eating what you can grow yourself.

There is such a thing as middle ground. Too little talk and you don't further the plot in any meaningful way, too much talk and you start talking in platitudes. Darth Maul did not receive any development as a character - he was just there to look menacing (hence the title).

And it is because of this lack of development that we never get a feeling that the Sith are truly important. So much time is spent on various fight scenes that this whole Darth Maul business is minor. So we never get properly invested in the legend of the Sith. We don't value the significance of his defeat (the Jedi hoped their mortal enemies for millennia were finally ended), so we aren't filled with any sort of [Dramatic Irony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony#Dramatic_irony) at their unjustified hope.

Major opportunities were missed, and many of them could have been covered by some level of conversation with Darth Maul. And if they insist on a mute character, have a one-way conversation, or at least give him some character.

Dragonball Z on the other hand had over 9000 seconds of talking in each fight scene, most of which served little to add to the plot or the significance of the events. Instead it was mostly padding.","1328054555"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","To each their own, I think. Corki would be a decent exception (I would still play him with flash if I played him, but I could see why someone wouldn't)--but I don't think Graves would be. If I see a Graves without a flash, I get happy. It means I can bait him by applying pressure with Taric's stun and/or exhaust, then get him again when he returns to farm.

I guess I feel that flash is needed bot lane as an AD to assure lane dominance--ADs are always glass cannons but even more so early game. If I were Graves with ghost/exhaust, let's say, I would just not be able to get away from a Taric/Sivir with exhaust, stun, and her ulti.

But yeah, all that said, I do think flash can ruin some moments. But it also makes others. That M5 flash actually made that match for me--it was really fun to watch! Likewise, it's funny to see people flash through on Baron hoping for a smite steal. I think it makes the game a lot more dynamic to have an ability like that, plus it also levels the playing field if someone is playing a champion like Ahri that can hop over walls; you at least have a summoner spell capable of chasing her if you choose to run with it.

I'm going to sound equally sexist: all of the women I know don't find it sexy to talk about sex. Maybe it's just me? 

Women talk to me freely about their sex lives; only when it's clear I'll never be in them. I'm cool with this since I see sex as a fine topic, even when you're not planning to engage in it. For women I have a sexlife with, such as my wife or (I'm poly) any girlfriends I've had, talking or even consciously thinking about sex kills the mood faster than being walked in on.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My uncle made some weird scam about 10 years ago involving exchange rates. He'd tell the guy who made the exchange rates from mexican pesos to dollars (or backwards I dunno) to put it a a higher exchange rate, and he'd keep the extra pennies for multi-million transactions for several years. As I read on newspaper articles, he made about 4 fucking billion dollars this way. My dad told me when I was about 12, only trusting me not to tell my sisters or mom that I knew about it. Mom obviously knew, as it was her brother, thus my second last name (spanish naming traditions).

Almost 4 years later and I think my mom doesn't know that I know about it, but two years ago, my little cousin was having her birthday party when I was arriving outside and suddenly four men with M16's knock on the driver's window with my sister and I on the back seats. I remained calm as I quickly saw they had vests with state police lettering on them. My dad wasn't as calm because he was scared that anything would happen to us.

The agents thought my dad was my uncle and they were about to take him away. We just drove the fuck out of there after they verified my dad wasn't my uncle, and some 2 hours later I find out that the police politely knocked on the door and asked for my uncle. Kind of a dick move to look for a man when his daughter's birthday party is going on, in front of everyone him and his kids knew. Now comes the part I always lol about. He proceeded to climb that children's castle made out of plastic like the ones in McDonald's and other restaurants, but this one was about 3 times bigger. Somehow, he managed to climb to a window, up a ledge and into some neighbor's backyard only to run the fuck out of there. I wish I could've seen that :(

Oh, he's now in prison waiting to be released, as there's almost no way for them to prove he did anything wrong (even if he did and he knows it) and his family moved to Los Angeles. Fucking insane, man. I still don't like him. He ruined that family.","1328054571"

Upwards of 2 meters tall and 95-100+ kg is Australian rules footballer size—it's a rough, physical game.

One name that comes to mind is Josh Hubner of Arizona State. He has a monstrous kicking leg, and has also played quarterback, wide receiver, and linebacker, and I think is about the same size as Weatherford. Players with good kicking skills who are built like that might do well in Australia if they can't make it into the NFL, with its limited demand for punters.","1328054571"

"SocialEngineering","t5_2qlud","I never pointed at it as being immoral or deceitful to study. I am myself subscribed to this subreddit after all, and find the subject fascination. Just like any knowledge there are right ways and wrong ways to use it. I use the knowledge to purposely avoid doing things which are manipulative or deceptive.

&gt;Improving social interaction for someone with Asperger's is one.

Most of the posts on this subreddit do not concern typical everyday social interaction.

&gt;Learning how not to be taken advantage of (as others have mentioned) would be one.

A noble pursuit, but as a quick browse through the subreddit will demonstrate, is not how most here seek to use the information.

&gt;Learning how to deal with tough situations (anger, hostility, avoiding a fight).

Also an understandable cause to pursue. There's not much more to it, though, than ""be nice and be submissive,"" and it shouldn't take an expert and an in-depth discussion to understand that. And apparently it doesn't seeing how these kinds of things are not common discussion.

&gt;Making friends, which is not the most straight forward of things for many adults to do.

I'm very introverted, incredibly awkward and nervous, and most people probably find me intolerable for it. Ironically, I find them intolerable too and make no attempt to hide my characteristics so that I can make friends with the people with a similar mindset. Deception is a terrible foundation for friendship, or any relationship, even if it's about so really-not-that-simple-a-thing as your personality.

I made no calls on learning about social engineering, I questioned the ethical integrity of employing the practice in any way that is deceptive or manipulative, which the discussion here appears to focus on. Encouraging or helping someone to think *clearly* so that they can act *on their own motivation* is not manipulative. Encouraging or helping someone to think *how you want them to* so that they can act *on your interests* is manipulative.","1328054572"

Incidentally, I don't agree with the premise that men face worse sexism than women (not at all) but this is one case in which it is true, specifically because it is codified into law.  

A woman has all the advantages in this particular scenario: She could choose not to deal with the child and abort, she could choose to have a child and family without dealing with the man, she could choose to haev a child and family with the man, she could choose to have the child alone and not bother with financial support, she could choose to have the state force the man to provide her financial support.  

The man only has the option to do whatever the woman wants.

"EnoughPaulSpam","t5_2sir4","&gt; But they can violate some of our civil rights, and that's okay? Help me understand.

Sometimes you can't summarize the law into soundbites. The First Amendment doesn't mean you have the right to say anything anywhere you want, it means the government can't restrict you. Are you honestly confused about this?

&gt; Perhaps, but that's not what Paul is proposing.

True.

&gt; Paul's condemnation of the TSA has been pretty profound. He has called it everything from useless to tyranny. Why is it surprising that such statements would lead people to believe he wishes to do away with the function of the TSA and not just the form?

He certainly wants to do away with some of the function. But that's not the point. The point is he doesn't think it's the government's job to regulate, and he thinks that government regulation would ultimately cause more problems than it would solve. He doesn't think it's a good idea to smoke weed, but you should have the right to do it. He doesn't think you should eat at McDonald's every day, but he doesn't want to monitor your food intake to ensure you eat a healthy diet. Etc. Same with the TSA.

Imagine if the government forced everyone to take a hit from a bong before getting on an airplane. Maybe they say it's to make you calm or something. Ron Paul would say that's a bad idea, and he would support ending government-mandated bong hits, but he wouldn't want to pass a law outlawing the practice. He would just want the government to stop interfering and let the market handle things, which undoubtedly would result in no mandatory bong hits.

&gt; It just outsources the violations and abuses to private contractors. How is that any better at all?

I find it exceedingly unlikely that things wouldn't get better. I mean, if some rich guy wants to open up [Shit Ass Pet Fuckers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXEkjo5Imic), they can. But in practice, that doesn't generally happen. Airlines/airports don't have the near unlimited budget for security theater that the TSA has. They don't have the leeway to piss off their entire customer base by not allowing bottled water, when everyone knows there's no good reason for that policy other than security theater.

&gt; The point, however, is that Paul's supporters forcefully promote the idea that Paul isn't like typical politicians in this respect. He ""talks straight"", doesn't hedge and all that jazz. This is one of many examples that clearly indicates otherwise.

He's talking completely straight. You clearly disagree with him, which is fine. But it's still straight talk.","1328054586"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; On Pilate Josephus' accounts of Jesus are both considered forgeries and a brief mention by Tacitus Which are doubted here, under Josephus and Tacitus

sorry I can't see a quote there saying Josephus account of Pilate is a forgery. can you point it out? I am not talking about the forgery piece, to my understanding Josephus references pilate quite a bit in his writings. 

the page you linked to has a clear anti-christian agenda, and it is hardly fair in its conclusions. but having read them, I'm not seeing where pilate as history is disputed.

&gt; Just because C.S. Lewis wrote of England and London in the Chronicles of Narnia, that doesn't mean that Narnia exists, right?

why do people keep saying stuff like this? its probably the most obvious strawman argument I've seen. no, the answer is no. but if 2 other sources said Narnia was real, historically, it has more weight. 

&gt; As for John the Baptist (Just above Chapter 7.)

That would be the [Planck Epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_epoch) in the Big Bang theory. We don't really have a model of the universe during this period, although we expect it was really hot and dense, had unified forces, and a strong gravitational force.

General Relativity breaks down during the Planck epoch and produces a singularity at t=0. There may or may not have been a time ""before"" this. 

The Hartle-Hawking state is a popular interpretation (not a hypothesis or theory) which suggests that the singularity reflects reality and time did not exist (it was space then, more or less). They like to claim this interpretation means time has no beginning, but I see this argument as largely semantics (since there is a point at which t=0 and another where t&gt;0).","1328054588"

As I said above, you didn't time it very well, you even said so by saying ""At this point, I should be putting in your entree order, but the people with the drinks have now been waiting 10 minutes total.""

That's not timing it well, IS IT? Our order was first in the example, not the other table. I don't care if they waited 10 minutes, we ordered before they did.

I don't care if it's the other way around that we are waiting 10 minutes, if someone else's turn is their turn, well it's *THEIR* TURN, NOT OURS TO BE ****FAIR***, but when it is our turn, don't dis our turn. Get it?

""that your food came out like 2 minutes after your fucking entrees.""

Not the way you said you should have put our orders into the computer, but didn't all that time that you had time to go get and correct the bartender and deliver bar drinks to table B as well as come to our table to see if we liked our appetizer.

""yes, I'm going to take care of other tables while I time it out.""

But you said ""At this point, I should be putting in your entree order, but the people with the drinks have now been waiting 10 minutes total.""

You were going to and delayed it. WHY is that? The time you should have put it in was at the latest then, but didn't, WHY?

""As for morally wrong for ""cutting"" Lady, restaurants don't work like that and that isn't morally wrong.""

Not restaurants, **********SERVERS*********** work like that if they*************CHOOSE********** to it's a CHOICE YOU UNFAIR ASSHOLE!!

NO ONE makes you hand out a soup before entrées but *YOU* and *YOU* ONLY!! NO ONE MADE YOU NOT GO PUT IN OUR ENTRÉES except YOU!!

""Like I said, servers who do everything in order end up pissing everyone off.""

HOW? So pissing off the first people is OK? NO, you wouldn't be pissing me off, because we would have gotten it correctly. 

HOW can you say that if people are waiting longer that aren't supposed to be huh?

""So yes, I will do things in the way of priority not by what came first, that's just how it works.""

HOW THE FUCK IS A ""SOUP"" A PRIORITY, HUH?

WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GET THAT FROM?

Priority would be mistakes things of that nature since mistakes would be going in order since that person's stuff was first.

NO, it's not how it works, it's how you ***CHOOSE**** TO WORK. I would NEVER and COULD NEVER FATHOM DOING THAT TO SOMEONE, NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER!!

I don't know how you can live with yourself knowing you let people CUT, I really don't, then expect a good tip as if you were being fair to them?

""If you are so upset about how restruants run,""

It's not how a restaurant works, it's how you *DECIDE* to do things.

""save the world from your holier than thou attitude.""

You need one, because you don't have one. I do the RIGHT THING and I deserved to have been bitched out from that lady that I didn't greet first. WHY don't you see you deserve it too when you go out of order whether it's a bitching verbally and/or a stiff or a bad tip?

""see that there isn't a way to do everything at once and do everything in the order it comes to you.""

You can do most things in order if you choose. You *CHOOSE* not to.

""My guess is you would last five minutes ""

YES I would. I would make much better tips than you, because I would do things in the ORDER in which people came in, PERIOD! Treat people as a line as everything else is besides ER, which we all know ER is because of life or death, not because of someone's check taking too long.","1328054595"

12 out if the first 62 top level comments were not just casually mentioning the lack of a source, but were demanding one.

You have an agenda against r/atheism because the sub sometimes points out that Paul is hostile to separation, and you are a true believer in the cult of Paul, and cannot tolerate criticisms of Paul.  You launched an attack, and comments like the above are a continuation of the attack. It is logical to suggest that you view the results of your attack through the lens of confirmation bias.

There were also comments in those first 62 arguing that Paul's ""quote"" was taken out of context, or that Paul's supposed stance either should not be a threat to readers, or was outweighed by his anti-war position. It is sensible to suggest that these are Paul supporters who were equally taken in by your fraud.","1328054591"

""I don't ever want to hear that you started, or willfully engaged in a fight. If someone hits you though, I will never be mad at you if you defend yourself.""

The only time I had to use this rule was actually after I graduated. Some punk kid was trying to get with my at-the-time girlfriend who was a senior (we had dated all through high school, and continued to date after I started college). I had come home for a high school dance, and this kid asked me if I wanted to 'take this outside'. I told him ""no, I'm enjoying my evening I suggest you go do the same."" He stood there for 5 minutes while I ignored him and danced with my girlfriend... He sucker-punched me right in the side of the head at which point I grabbed him by the neck, threw him onto the ground, and gave him a few swift kicks in the kidney. (This brought the dance to a stand-still -- I was always assumed to be weak because I never got into fights... apparently they didn't know I had bee rock climbing for 4 years :/)

Shortly after that I was given praise from the superintendent for not fighting in the first place and defending myself when appropriate. The other shit-head was kicked out of school for 2 weeks. He promptly used those two weeks as vacation and didn't do any homework... failed a few classes and had to stay back for summer school. Dipshit.","1328054598"

It's really a horrible thing to have happen but alas, it happens to all women at one point or another. She is no different than them.

 She may be damn determined to have a kid asap but as soon as she gets pregnant or start to try to the feeling will wear off and then she will be stuck...or it could be intensified...but at some point, once there is no turning back, it's going to slap her in face that it was a very ill thought out plan but by then it will be too late.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Depends, solely on your parents and also the reason they are getting divorced. In my experience watching my mom get divorced twice now, it can either go fairly smoothly with the house usually being sold bills being paid on time, and little to no emotional strain as it was with her second marriage. this usually occurs when the children are over 18 and child support isn't an issue and if your mom doesn't seek alimony (your dad paying your mom after they are divorced). This can be done as quickly as two months to have everything, including house arranged.

The second is the messier kind. In this kind there is a lot of yelling, a lot of old shit is going to be brought up. Shit that happened years ago. Usually one of the parties (most of the time the man) doesn't want to sign the divorce papers. Depending on what state you live in he can avoid the formal divorce by as little as 3 months to in some extreme cases almost a year or two. Usually bills don't get paid on time and both parties credit gets wrecked in the process.

Most of the time the man ends up loosing more (financially) then the woman.

However, all is ultimately up to your parents and if necessary a court. If you have younger siblings this will play a huge part in the upcoming months. The only advice I have for you is stay strong, roll with the punches and take everything told to you with a grain of salt.","1328054602"

So he cheated on his girlfriend with you.  Bad sign #1.

&gt; I decided it couldn't hurt to hook up with him. It did. He got extremely distant after a while and refused to talk to me for almost the entire month of January.

He gets sex from you and then ignores you.  Bad sign #2.

&gt; He called me up asking if I had any way to give him a ride to work out of the blue

He only contacts you when he wants something from you.  Bad sign #3.

&gt; I do want a chance to... grab his attention enough to figure out if he is legitimately interested in me

He is not.  See the above.

&gt; or if he just thinks I'm an easy hit and run.

He does not *think* you are an easy hit and run.  You ARE an easy hit and run.

&gt; I had his attention before we hooked up, so I figure if I keep sex out of it, I may get his attention again.

You will never hear from this guy again if you do not keep having sex with him.  Or unless he needs a ride to work.

"fia","t5_2tgo7","Anonymity, unless the user wants to protect their work. Pseudonyms could also work in that case as well, but the person would have to break their pseudonym, but there may be ways to protect yourself in that case.

I think to ensure the freedom of the internet, anonymity is a requirement, with the ability to use pseudonym if a user so desires.There should be very few cases where your real information is required, such as banking etc.

Missed part of your question in my first answer. Well to address copyright disputes there are two solutions. First, create services that reduce the desire to ""pirate."" Second, make it obvious what sort of protection you have on your work and then make access easy for another user to license. If some one takes your photo and puts it on a website, while being anonymous, then the owner of the website should be obligated to take it down, *provided you can prove that it is yours.* If you cannot, then you should not be able to take down the image.

How do we deal with repeat offenders? I think that should be up to the individual websites, and may be based off of the imperfect IP addressing. Again, everything must be proven beforehand and now afterwards.","1328054612"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;So you end up with dead murderers

fine with this

&gt;dead children

very bad

&gt;children who do live are often born to poor inner city people, end up living off of the government, and become criminals--criminals that rob and kill other adults.

That implies that they can't be adopted.  That also implies that being poor means being a criminal.  Honestly, I would rather be alive and American ""poor"" than dead.

&gt;Also, the child that dies has no name, no idea what it's missing, nothing.

Still human

&gt;The woman that dies has a job, a family, people that love and care for her.

Still murderer

&gt;The whole point of abortion is that the child is NOT WANTED.

I'm sure you've not been wanted or liked at some point in life, that doesn't mean you should be killed.  They can be put up for adoption.

&gt;You'd rather deprive those people of something they love, and hurt society as a whole, rather than allow for abortion of fetuses that often don't have even a heartbeat or brain activity?

I think a bigger hurt to society is killing hundreds of thousands of people each year who each have the potential to do something great.  One of those could've been president.  One of those people could've cured cancer.  To say that having a woman, who is obviously a selfish whore and a murderer, stay alive is more important than a child, is pure stupidity.  That is pure stupidity.

&gt;are you in favor of abortion in the case of rape?

No, that's what adoption is for.

Brostep is just garish noise for children, Dubstep was deep, dark and thoughtful music. Hence the reason a chiptune artist from japan got a release on one of the founding labels of dubstep (note, not brostep) back in '07.    
Just to blow your mind a little bit more, Zomby released lots of great stuff back around the same time. Most notably this: [Aquafresh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PjKUp7VSQ)    
Which sampled this: [Robotron](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZsIyJehtE8)    
Anyone who samples Robotron gets a chiptune tick from me.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","hello again, I would recommend to keep at it. There is no one bit of useful information I can give when talking about using a VST for drums. A lot of the feel of drums comes from the human feel, but a person can become really comfortable with electronic drums when using the same vst over and over again. A few things I have learned:

Try to keep your kit on different tracks, i.e.: Kick on track 1, snare 2, etc. Even though the midi can be on one track I believe there should be a way to route your drum track components to separate tracks. This will help you eq each drum individually which will REALLY help the overall sound of the kit. 

Also, when making the midi track for the drums, try to run a humanize function on it. If your DAW does not have a humanize function, then I would go about and focus on the high hats and snare and make each note fluctuate velocity by about 10 points. say if your velocity hits are roughly around 100 velocity, then make each time you hit that specific drum fluctuate from 90 - 110. I hope that makes sense.

Now I have been seeing a therapist at the VA hospital for well over a year now. And the funny thing is this: there has never been a time when I could say: ""I am depression and anxiety free!""  That ideal of perfection will bury you under its own weight. 

I have had experience with bipolar disorder. The only experience I do have with that illness is this: I have learned that when I 'come out' of a depression, and I am feeling good for the first time in forever, I need to watch myself. Because it has been in those moments where I have made the truly damaging mistakes that I am now dealing with. 

Depression for me is like a fog that envelopes my mind. When I am depressed the entire world is muted and dull. 

I do hope you get better sooner rather than later! There was thread in this reddit about tips that help with depression. That is a very good read; and I guarantee you if you just two or three things off that list each day that you do not do now, you will feel better. Simple things like standing out in the sunshine, focusing on your breathing, meditation, exercise, eating a balanced diet; these and more can and will help you. 

Do not feel though that you have to do everything everyone suggests to you. Do what you feel will help. Just today I was dealing with a lot of anxiety. Well one of the tools that I recently learned is to put on some music that has a slow, steady beat (I used a youtube video of ""heard it through the grapevine"") and do some dancing to the beats. After about 10 minutes of dancing and feeling like a fool, I felt better and my anxiety was back to a manageable level. 

I may have rambled, but I do hope my experience can help you. ","1328054630"

Bad example. Sopa's on the back-burner, if not outright dead. No violence required.

&gt;if you control the population, would you rather have them protest what your doing or fight back?

Fight back, every time. If I can paint a group as dangerous thugs, I can do whatever I like to them, and people will cheer the house down for me for doing it. What's more, their political agenda will be tarnished by proxy, just like you can't say ""Irish nationalism"" without picturing a car-bomb. That's win-freakin'-win for me, baby.

On the other hand, if they start protesting and keep peaceful, I've got a problem. They're drawing attention to their cause. People are talking about it, learning about it. The apathetic are getting politicized. That's tricky. Now I have to spend my time countering their arguments while trying to look magnanimous. What's worse, I can't stop them without looking like a tyrant, making them look sympathetic in the process. It takes up my time and energy, and is very dangerous. Much better if they just start attacking cops and breaking shit, because then they're just a mob that needs dispersing, and everyone can understand that.

&gt;you can either wait it out or make them believe you give up and wait till no one is watching.

Of course, this relies on them giving up. If they don't do that, I'm screwed.

&gt;no because they'll keep arresting people little by little over any small provocation until people stop protesting

Right, because as this thread demonstrates, police brutality elicits nothing but yawns.

Every time a cop beats up an OWS protester, the cause gets a bump. Each time, one more uninvolved person starts to wonder why his taxes are funding that sort of behaviour. Each time, one more person starts to wonder who the bad guys are in this scenario. Each time, one more person starts to wonder what it is that these peaceful, reasonable people are willing to take a beating for. You start meeting violence with violence, and not only does all that go away, but now you're playing on the cop's turf, by their rules. You might hold the streets for a while, but only as long as it takes to bring in the ""whiff of grapeshot"" that'll end the whole affair.

It's also impossible to increase the price like that when you sign a contract to have electricity for a year.

&gt;You hand over policing duties to a private security company and they are motivated to make more arrests because the prison industry is also privately controlled and for-profit?

What's the point of the police if they don't arrest people they're supposed to? Either way, there would be much less arrests due to non-violent crimes not being considered crimes, so if that was your worry, you should be happy.

&gt;I have never said that private businesses were evil, but putting them in charge of public services can be dangerous.

That's just another way to say you think they're evil when producing certain goods or services. Even if this was the case, I wouldn't feel comfortable eliminating competition in that sector, and I don't think it is.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Why does the immoral laws have to be interpreted and treated differently whilst moral statements and rules just go free from all that stuff?

All laws are to be questioned, some have more simple answers, other involves analysis of literary technique or the situation being described. If you are referring as to why some cherry picked verses are not followed, maybe check out the context. Without specific examples I cannot comment.

&gt;Why cant the Qu'ran be god updating the rules and setting myths straight?

Sure it can, but we have to figure out if it is/isn't. Check out historical records outside both books and then historical records as displayed in both books and come to your own conclusion.

&gt;In Judaism there had already been a last prophet.

All the research I can do now does not agree with this, can you please explain?

Jesus also wasn't really a prophet in the traditional understanding in Christianity. He is in the Islamic understanding.

&gt;Explain why this can happen between Judaism and Christianity but not Christianity and Islam.

See above, but simply the prophets were in the ancient times of the nation-state-religion of the Jews. One of the greatest changes of Jesus was the separation of Church and state from the Jewish culture, therefore the political ""Prophets"" did not happen any more. Prophecy still happens today as Christians perceive. But this claim all rests on Judaism not having a defined ""last prophet"".

&gt;My arguement is that there are contradictions between all three and that there therefore must be the case that god is willing to change his mind later on i you believe in Christianity, basically the same as above.

God changes his mind within Jewish scripture, and provides very culturally specific instructions in both Jewish and Christian text. My understanding of Islam goes around the Quran being the eternal and perfect word of God, not providing specific advice which differs in different cultural settings. Is this correct? In Islam it is also believe that Jesus and Moses and Abraham were prophets of Islam and therefore were spreading Islam in their day, yet historically speaking I think you will find otherwise.

&gt; [about prophets being God you] can apply to other prophets in other religions

Even if it takes leaps in interpretation, I would like to see this.

&gt; it not being canon belief in the other religion

There is a reason I quoted something that goes straight to the bible and quotes it, talks about the context, goes into the literary technique being used, the message the writer wanted to get across is because the context gets the meaning from the writer, and if the writer wanted to say Jesus is God then we can get what he means. There are about 40 points in the other document where the writer either says Jesus is God or insinuates it. 

I don't think we have the option to pick the interpretation we like, or even really to pick at all, we need to discover what the author intended and then work with that. I have seen enough to categorically say: the authors of the bible intended to say: Jesus is God. I have not seen this in any other religion.

&gt;Because reall, in the end, none can know

This is an interesting topic, the level of proof we need to know something, I love look at the philosophy of argument and the burden of proof and the level of proof required. Yet to put the statement at the end ""no-one can know"" is a catch-all and it sounds like an excuse not to do enough research into the given subject. I do implore you not to settle for what you know now, and I shall not do the same. Gotta go find something on prophets being God and the last Jewish prophet.

"politics","t5_2cneq","*1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.*

No one is advocating taking everything away from the wealthy. What most people want to see is the wealthy contributing their fair share to the well-being of the society they belong to.

*2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.*

Even though Americans are working harder and are more productive than ever before, most of the rewards for that fact have gone to the wealthy. It could be argued that the wealthy are benefiting from the hard work of people who aren't receiving a fair share of the rewards for their effort. So the wealthy are the ones receiving without working.

*3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.*

Which is not a problem if the government is taking equally from all its citizens, or, to put it in less inflammatory terms, everyone is contributing fairly to ensure that our society protects and serves everyone equally.

*4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!*

Not true. The enormous success of the American economy after WWII and up through the eighties was a result of a vibrant middle class fueling a consumer-driven growth spurt. This was partly due to government spending on such things as education, home ownership, etc., subsidized by taxes on the wealthy. The reason our current economy is in such dire shape is that the middle class is no longer able to spend like it used to. Without jobs, they never will be able to, and with taxes at historically low levels, the government can do little to stimulate the economy.

*5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.*

The US does less to help its citizens than any other developed nation. This isn't a question of motivation: there are millions of people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves out of work. They aren't rubbing their hands with glee as the government showers them with money taken from the wealthy; they would gladly work, if only they could find jobs.","1328054653"

It's not. In philosophy, people argue about properties of objects, and what it means, for example, for two objects to be the same.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The day before my confirmation (in a Methodist Church, some 30+ years ago).  I was going over the things I was going to be required to do and one was to recite the Apostle's Creed in front of the congregation.  If you're not familiar with it, it starts with the phrase: ""I believe in God"" and goes on at great length about all the things you believe *about* God and Jesus and stuff.

I remember looking up at my teacher and asking: ""But what if I don't actually believe all of that?""   She replied that, if I didn't believe, then I couldn't be confirmed in the church.  I told her honestly that, while it was great that everyone else believed that stuff, and while I really wanted to believe, I just didn't.  

Oddly this declaration of mine created no controversy.  I did end up talking at length with my parents and with the pastor, but I did not end up going through confirmation.

Now as to when I went from ""I don't believe but I wish I did"" to ""I don't believe and I'm perfectly content"",  I have no idea.  It was probably a very gradual process.

TL;DR It wasn't until I realized I was going to have to declare my ""belief"" to a congregation that I woke up to the fact that I didn't believe.","1328054657"

"politics","t5_2cneq","If one learns how to read the Bible at a level above that of a third-grader, you would see that almost all Jewish laws are in fact, in the Torah. There is a *small* category of laws called *d'rabbanan* (from the Rabbis) which are not in the Torah, but as such, are not considered mandatory. Everything else (all 613 commandments) are *in* the Torah (called *d'oraita* or *d'oraisa*). You just have to read it in Hebrew, understand the concept of metaphor, not attempt to read the Bible as if it were a novel, and understand that there are many, many layers and levels in every sentence. You actually have to *think* about what you're reading, instead of just scanning it as if it were some Pulp Fiction...


...actually, I'm just going to stop. Honestly, I don't think I can really engage in a discourse about the Bible with one who writes a comment such as 
&gt;""most catholics do anyway. thats what confession is for. LoL Muslims and jews suck at religion."" 
completely unbidden and out of nowhere. What reason was there for that sudden childish outburst? None.


It is not
&gt;""a question of creating a religion that isn't ridiculously inconvenient.""

since that isn't what the comment you replied to was talking about. They were saying that the amount of money required for the program should be determined as justified or not based on how many people it benefited. We are talking fiscal policy and religious freedom. That has nothing to do with the fact that you watered down your religion to the point that it requires absolutely no effort, dedication, devotion, morality, or action whatsoever (for most Christians at least. I was a Catholic for 7 years, so I know that you specifically, as a Catholic, actually *do* have *some* things you are required to do by your religion).


At least Muslims and Jews actually *do* what they believe G-d wants. At least they have *some* requirements, rules, ethics, rituals, action, and effort. You know...at a minimum, actually *trying*.","1328054672"

&gt;Shouldn't there be evidence for every single living creature from the beginning of the evolution cycle to us, and all the branches in the tree? Obviously we won't find evidence for most, but wouldn't it make sense that we found some? 

We have millions of fossils. Do you think we should have more? Fossilization is not a random process. For some lines we have details of changes, for some we have gaps of scores of millions of years. Hard shelled marine organisms fossilize well, bats poorly (small bones and acidic environments). Maybe one in a million or one in a billion organisms fossilize and we have not dug up even 1% of all fossils.

I then dip the brush in the cup that holds the distilled water incrementally until I have the desired lather consistency. I have noticed that the distilled ""drier"" brush will actually lather a bit, while my usual water needs a dip or two. I feel like the lather feels better, I can't describe it, but there is no difference between the lather I get from tabac and the creams I would use. Usually it feels a bit too thick from the overcompensation. I don't think you need to wet your face or hot towel with distilled water, I haven't noticed a difference in lather when taking those out.

Kicking in your door

You can relax

On both sides of the tracks

And maniacs don't blow holes 

In bandsmen by remote control

And everyone has recourse to the law

And no one kills the children anymore.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Those are all good points. For Niche markets, indeed there are other options - I just don't have time to chase them all down so it is not a model that is cost efficient for me (time is money). I work with people, models, objects and food. Food does really well on Microstock, shockingly well. I have been fortunate. 

News/Editorial images are rough, and that whole industry has changed as well. The only one I had a TON of success with was the Shutterstock on the Red Carpet Program. They can get you access/passes you wouldn't normally otherwise get without the hassle and expense of being a membership of a professional freelance association. You only have to maintain the images at their library exclusively for 2 years in exchange for the service (fair, imo), and they turn around the photos (from upload to online) in less than 24 hours.

Microstock companies are shifting too. I think Getty owns iStock, and Corbis owns Jupiter Images (or something like that) and there has been dawning realization that they have in a sense, cannibalized their own larger sales and have created the market that no one likes (I don't like it either). Many microstocks have shifted their business model for higher end collections (certainly not like the past however) and are scrambling, trying to recoup losses in that way.  Someone mentioned in another comment that iStock is dying. It does seem that way, but probably to benefit shareholders and the former business model. 

I was thinking about this too after leaving my last comment - with the advent of the digital age and the way things are published now, while the prices have gone down significantly, the amount of people using these images (bloggers, online magazines, etc) has increased dramatically. I still believe that at the end of the day it will all balance out for the seasoned professionals who put out consistent good work.

It does strike me as odd though that HF, especially at such a high molarity, would just be kinda chilling in a high school chemistry lab. That's REALLY dangerous shit, moreso than even most of  the ""strong"" acids, because it permeates skin extremely easily and reacts readily with calcium in the bloodstream (and, apparently, the porcelain in bathtubs).

"math","t5_2qh0n","The main problem is that the distance between two curves doesn't have much to do with their length. For example imagine a curve like [this spring](http://parts.dixiedoorinc.com/images/extspring1.gif), except infinitely thin. Picture a line segment running through the middle of it. If we shrink the radius of the spring, it will get closer and closer to the line segment. However, as we do, we can add more and more loops to the spring to make up for it; remember, our imaginary spring is infinitely thin. If we coil it tightly enough, the length of our spring can be as long as we want, even though it's approaching a line segment of finite length.

You can do the same thing to a circle, just imagine a curve that corkscrews around the circle as much as you want.

Take a look at the Wiki entry on [arc length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length). Notice that the formulas for the length of differentiable curves depend on their derivatives. The problem in both the spring example and the picture from you original post is that the curves are indeed getting closer and closer together, but their derivatives are not. Mathematically we say the curves are approaching each other in the C^0 norm (the distance between them is shrinking), but not in the C^1 norm (their derivatives are not getting closer together).

I'm sweeping a little bit under the rug here as the outside curve in the post isn't differentiable at the corners, but the general idea still holds.","1328054695"

My son took a small hit on grades in the 4th grade -- the year we just gave up on it.  It hasn't really had an effect on his grades this year -- but this teacher assigns pretty good homework, in reasonable amounts, so he does most of it.

As to the tests, laws differ from state to state.  www.fairtest.org has a good rundown on state laws.  All we had to do is send a note to the school saying he wouldn't be taking the tests and they took it from there.  It doesn't have any effect on his grades whatsoever.  He just uses the time to read or study up on something he's interested in.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","The internals of the buffer tube that include the large spring and the metal buffer are intended for use in an ar-15 rifle where the bolt is designed to ride back into it. Many designs make use of the buffer tube itself for stocks because its a readily available and inexpensive part that has the capability to accept countless aftermarket stocks. Many designs arent of the ar-15 nature but still use the ar-15 buffer tube itself simply because most American firearms enthusiasts own an AR-15 rifle of some kind and usually have two or three different stocks that they use for their rifles and have grown familiar with. So from a business standpoint potential customers have piles of different ar-15 stocks in their personal collections and its a no brainier to use them instead of some proprietary design that limits the use customization and simply draws potential buyers elsewhere to rifles that do accept them because of the familiarity the shooters have with their stocks of choice. If you have a rifle that is intended to fit an ar-15 style buffer tube but isnt an ar-15 it likely wont require the buffer and spring that are included in most stock kits and they only serve as extra weight in the stock. Simply attach the empty buffer tube to the receiver or into the crossover adapter provided and simply slip an ar-15 stock of choice onto it. ","1328054705"

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","""For the sake of this answer I am going to define “conquest” as a game type that utilizes control points to accrue score. Using this definition, then we are not considering adding any other game types before launch. We want each map we release to be completely unique. We feel that we can get a ton of variety out of our maps by changing the secondary objectives and mechanics. For example, we won’t be launching with another map with trebuchets and destroyable terrain; those things are reserved for the Battle of Kyhlo map. The other maps we are testing all have some very involved mechanics and unique playstyles in them and we wanted a core game mechanic that was easily learned by players and stayed consistent across the maps we release at launch. This will ultimately help players learn each map and the game since they don’t have to relearn an entirely new scoring mechanic for every map they play on.
Once the game matures a bit, it is likely that we’ll experiment with both new maps and some new game types if we find a demand for them from our players.""

Keep in mind also that the Yachtsman dry age all of their steaks on-premise. The grade of the meat and the aging process are what contribute to the inflated price, but they're also the two things that make this cut perfect.","1328054708"

I can also imagine that as a fighter, threatening to ""cook"" your enemies would an intimidating warcry. Have you ever played Final Fantasy 9?

When I really try to picture this in the abstract (which I've never done before right now), I have a difficult time doing so.  What would the world look like if everything that could be represented digitally was free and immediately available?  Proprietary software used by consumers would largely cease to exist, although money could still be made in terms of support contracts (such was what RedHat does with Linux), and custom software for business consumption would continue to exist.  Musicians could only make money in terms of touring and merchandise.  Expensive creative projects might not get funded (given the generally shitty quality of movies these days, that would be a mixed blessing).  Books might not get written, at least, if the author was intending to make a profit doing so.  (Authors would have it worse than musicians -- how many people pay to go to events where authors demonstrate their works?)  Photographers would find their work options limited to things like weddings and portraits.  Porn stars would have to get real jobs or go back to being prostitutes.  Traditional artists would be fine.

But that's the abstract.  I suppose what you're really asking is when the content industries will switch to service models a la Spotify, Hulu, and Netflix.  As far as the movie industry goes, that's only practical in a given country when the broadband penetration reaches a certain level.  So the answer is, it depends on the country.  Broadband penetration is fine in the US, but the government and industry is corrupt.  I'd expect the movie industry in the US to get their shit together within three years, but who knows.

Sorry if my answer sucked.  You did encourage me to finish reading The Diamond Age and talk to my economist girlfriend about post-scarcity economics.","1328054724"

The issue with Lego friends is that once upon a time Lego did a great job marketing this unisex toy to both boys and girls.  You'll see an example of how they included girls in advertising in the link.

But with this ""separate but equal"" Friends set, they are taking a huge step back.  They went from ignoring girls in their advertisements to creating a line ""for girls"" that TOTALLY PERPETUATES gender stereotypes.  The same gender stereotypes that were so blissfully absent from LEGO for so long.

Not only did it mean automatic suspension if you wore a trench coat to school, but students were urged to keep an eye out for students who wore them out side of school.

No, they declare the glory of nature. God doesn't exist, period. Just because some moron tries to blame it on fairies, that doesn't make it true.

Making it up as you go along, as all Christians do. Their religion is bullshit, and even they know it. That's why they have to invent bits of it out of nothing. They twist and turn and massage and force words to have totally contradictory meanings because their religion was created by a bunch of insane people over thousands of years inventing their own version of ""the truth"" and adding it to the useless pile of toilet paper we call the bible.

The whole thing is so ridiculously contradictory and nonsensical, you actually have to become insane to believe it. You have to give up your grasp of reality and believe in fairies. Or you have to invent your own version that is only as retarded as you're willing to swallow, ""Word of God"" be damned.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","I had been very active in music when I hit my ""mid 20s music crisis"".  There were a lot of reasons to be done with it at the time (most of the band graduated college and moved, full-time employment of my brain, a live-in girlfriend, not enough contact with musician friends).  As a result I rarely played or tinkered for about two and a half years.  What got me out of this funk was distance, a bit of longing, and letting myself experience something new.  In my case a drummer friend called asking 'do you want to be in a country cover band with two girls singing lead?'

Now I usually believe(d) that playing in an all cover band is bad for your soul, but it actually is quite good for getting gigs.  Bootstrapping sets with strangers (new friends!) was very rewarding and those gigs, coupled with learning a new style I never gave a shit about, brought me back to practice, creative work for fun, discovering new music out of left field, tinkering with new DAWs (my teeth were cut on the first version of Nuendo), and a general love for performing and DOING music again.  The country cover band has been a gateway drug reconnecting me with the 11 years of my early life in which I was always working on at least a couple of music projects (rock band, school jazz band, lessons, etc).  Three years later and I feel like I have grown my mind.  Sometimes you let it slip away, sometimes you pick it back up.","1328054749"

Doctors and therapists do the treatment stuff, sure - but my nurses were the ones who were making sure I ate, checking on me every hour, dealing with my panic attacks/etc, comforting me when I was upset, telling jokes when I needed to laugh, etc. During a time when I could hardly eat anything because it was so triggering, one amazing nurse would come and sit with me in my room during each meal and talk soothingly/keep me grounded while I tried to eat. Another amazing night nurse would go around and tuck people in/pat their heads like a grandma or something, if they were upset at bedtime.

I went cold on Adderall because I was scared of having another episode.

But alas, I lay there thinking that for 5, 10, 15 minutes before I actually find myself trying to do something to alleviate my depression. 

Currently, I've lost health insurance and medical treatment isn't seeming to work too well anyway, so I'm self medicating. I drink when anxiety gets bad (about once a week) and take a psychedelic every couple weeks. It keeps me from feeling suicidal and provided I don't go too far out there, keeps me from having manic episodes too. Pot is purely recreational, though. I may not like it, but I just can't seem to go more than 2 weeks at a time completely sober without remitting into a state of uncomfortable existence. Oddly, though, if I'm occasionally using drugs, I'm happier when I'm sober. Without any at all, I hate being sober.","1328054757"

&gt; it is just a thought and arises, dwells, and ceases all by itself, you do not have to change it,

So thoughts exist by themselves? So who is doing the thinking?

&gt; you are not seeing the nature, you are trying to change the nature

You can't change anything's nature. You can change what you think the nature of something is.

&gt; it is replacing one for the other and not getting anywhere

That's exactly what must be done to get to the right view of things. You don't stay with the same view you had when you began.

&gt;you have to see the nature of form,feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness as being impermanent, non-intrinsic, and interdependently originated

Nop, that's not the nature of things, it's just called what it's the nature of things. But that's not the nature of things.

&gt;the trap of a dualistic mind and if you meditated on the nature(as i stated above), you see the nature of those thoughts, if a storm is approaching, you don't tell the storm to stop, go back, be sunny, you are not seeing that the storm on it's own will pass with or without you,

That's no the nature of the thoughts, and that's not what the dualistic mind is. If a storm is approaching you don't stay under the rain, get wet, get sick and die, just because ""it's a thought"". The same way, if you feel depressed, you don't stay sad and feeling sorry for yourself unless you want to stay there and face the consequences of that.","1328054761"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I just read it.  Where does it say producing food is a natural right?  Dude, I'm not disagreeing that it **should** be a right, but legal precedent has established that the Commerce Clause allows the Feds to govern all food production/distribution.   I don't agree with that, but my point is that we need a new ruling to set a new precedent (and that's a big redefinition of the Commerce Claus), or an explicit law from Congress.

This isn't some simple change that we should expect courts to conclude obviously.   There are no laws against taking a shit - that's why it's your legal right.  There are explicit laws that govern food production that have been held up to constitutional scrutiny, which is why it's illegal.

That's just the way the process works.","1328054763"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","1.  Immoral?  That depends on what you consider moral, and I'm not even sure it's relevant.  ""Irrational"" and ""illogical,"" being the other words used to describe bigotry in this thread, seem to be more applicable in my opinion, with the addition of ""undesirable.""  
As others have mentioned in the thread, I believe in people's right to be bigoted as long as they do not inflict harm on others, as much as I may dislike it.  
I guess once there is violence involved, it becomes immoral to me; but even then, really, it's the violence that's immoral, not necessarily the sentiment behind it.

2.  I don't think a scientifically accurate claim can be bigoted.  Also, I don't think someone is being bigoted if they truly *believe* that their opinion is based in fact, as long as they are open to changing their mind if shown convincing evidence that disproves their original stance.  It's even possible to find a fact distasteful and yet still accept its truth.

3.   I have a couple questions instead of a complete answer.  
Firstly, I wonder what, exactly, *is* the ""degree to which the an-cap community is bigoted?""  I was not under the impression that it was bigoted to any significant degree.  
Every group has some bad apples, but I didn't even see a legitimate cause for such accusations yesterday, in myself or the rest of the participants of the thread.  
Next, what exactly is our ""cause?""  Are we trying to convert others, create an an-cap society, or just discuss amongst ourselves?  In any of those scenarios, bigotry is again undesirable, but in varying degrees of importance - plus, I think that how bigotry is expressed or acted upon is more relevant than its simple existence.

"science","t5_mouw","Sure; the reason ""you can't argue any point with an anecdote"" is because your audience, unless they have personal knowledge of the topic, can't tell whether the anecdote is representative or exceptional. Is that the shared experience of all the people who do that thing across a bunch of different places, or is that just this one guy who had a bad day?

You can do the same thing with statistics. mosnil wants you to think CO2-per-capita is representative of the air pollution on the whole; I brought up one city hitting a record one day -- which is obviously not representative, but then that was kind of the point.

The only way you can really know is to either consume a lot of data on the topic, or you can spend a significant amount of time in a bunch of different places on both sides of the pond and make up your mind that way. 

I've done the latter. I've seen ruby red suns in Pittsburgh and the haze of LA Summers, and the clean dry skies of Amarillo in the Fall. I've seen Qingdao on a Spring morning after a rain and I've coughed my way through Shanghai and Beijing's traffic jams. And in my pretty extensive experience, the worst days in the worst parts of the USA are better than the best days in the best parts of China, where you still have to wash black soot off your hands even when you've touched nothing more than the air. Don't bother me about CO2 per capita when I'm sneezing tarred boogers every single day in one of China's prime Summer vacation spots.

I am so confident that the air in China is so much worse that I think you can be from anywhere in the USA and visit any part of China on any day and you'll still breathe air noticeably worse.

""What you gonna do now Chong sr.?"" the man in the wheelchair asked.  My dad immediately responded, ""if you don't start talking nicer im gonna take you outside and beat your ass.""  It was dead silent for about 10 seconds, as the man squinted his eyes at my father, until a wide grin broke out on his face.  ""Hahaha!  Hell!  I like you, you're alright!

&gt;We must, therefore, conclude that the **use** of nuclear or similar weapons, or the **threat thereof**, is a crime against humanity for which there can be no justification. 

He specifically says the use or threat of use is the crime against humanity.

&gt;He is making the case that the very **possession** of nuclear weapons is a violation of libertarian principles.

He is not saying this.

Let's say you own a firearm. Simply owning the firearm does not aid in coercing anyone else. Threatening to use it can and often does aid in coercion (robbing a convenience store at gunpoint, for example). In this case, ownership and threat to use are two very different situations.

Just reading what Rothbard wrote out of context, it seems he's condemning threat to use, not possession of nuclear weapons. Simply owning a nuke would not constitute a crime against humanity, but, and I'm just picking an example out at random here for no reason at all, if the U.S. were to threaten Iran with nuclear strike to retaliate against the actions of a small minority of their citizens, they would (of course this is purely hypothetical!) be threatening the lives of millions of innocent civilians who had never taken aggressive action against the U.S. *This* is the crime against humanity, not simply owning the weapon.
_____
&gt;It should also be pointed out that there is no defense against nuclear weapons (the only current “defense” being the threat of “mutually assured destruction”) and, therefore, that the State cannot fulfill any sort of international defense function so long as these weapons exist.

This article was written in 1974, so this was before we [began efforts to build defenses against ballistic missiles in 1983](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative). This is a side-issue, but it might be debatable that nuclear weapons cannot be defended against now.","1328054784"

When humans alone are responsible, it's understandable that it only moves so fast; we do the best we can, and that's just that. However, if you out a divine force behind it, then shouldn't it go faster? Wouldn't miracles be faster, more productive, and save thousands upon thousands of lives,prevent suffering, etc.? So why go through the slow process of 'using' humans? And how would one ever distinguish between things God is 'using' us for and things that happen because of human will? It seems to me that it's much easier to explain it as a product of humanity without adding an extra factor that doesn't actually add to the explanation at all.

I agree that religion and science don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. But detracting from the hard and brilliant work of scientists by saying they are merely tools, well... There's just no reason to think that besides wanting to rectify inconsistencies of religion.","1328054788"

It's probably easier to try to listen for the root note than to memorize where they all are for every chord.

Someone near my flatmate's work had been feeding this cat for a few weeks, she'd apparently been living rough, so she asked me to take care of it (I have a rep for taking in strays). We kept her while waiting for someone to claim her, put up posters etc. After a few weeks I started letting her outside and she'd always come back, except for once she was gone for three days before returning. I went through 3 or 4 collars with her, she kept losing them or getting them off. A month or so ago she wandered off and didn't come back, I figure as she's so friendly and she keeps taking her collar off and obviously wanders a lot, someone else figured she was a stray and took her in. She's probably gone through quite a few homes that way :-/

Or tell her to bring clothes for a nice evening, and then spend it ""in;"" cook a nice dinner (or pic one up and reheat), have a romantic fire, soft music you can dance to in the living room, etc.  

Also, instead of spending so much each time you're together, save your money and send her something while you're apart.

Guilty. We read 1984 and Animal Farm in school and I remember *hating* them, probably for the reasons you've laid out. 

I think most of your comments regarding the US public school, outdated curricula and levels of effectiveness varying from teacher to teacher apply on an international scale as well. It's a shame they often try to force good literature on us without taking modernism, relevancy and relativity into account. That's not to discount teachers or the education system in general, I imagine it's a lot of hard work and often thankless and given that they're shaping generations to come, should be rewarded more. But there are definitely a few things in the education system which could be tweaked for better results.

Anyway, I digress. Thanks again for your insightful comments and pleasant discourse. :)

&gt;and playing CS on a Eyefinity 6 layout.

Is this not a valid reason? Okay, forget CS and 6 screens, the **sole** reason that I have an Eyefinity 3 layout is because of Battlefield 3. I play on Xbox all the time, but I got BF3 on Amazon for $30. After playing it for awhile on a single 24"", I was browsing Best Buy and found a deal on 20"" HP LCDs for only $79 each. I bought 3 and a mount on a whim and got it all set up. I love it. Do I do anything else with them? Not really. I do my browsing in the center screen and have other things off to the side like IM/Twitter and maybe some other utilities, but otherwise no. Then again, when I come home after work, it's really my station to relax and let off some steam, which is about all I do on it anymore.

I do use a dual monitor setup at work though, where my main 27"" Dell display is for work (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, SublimeText, etc.) and my secondary display (the 17"" screen on my MacBook Pro) is for Outlook/IM/Twitter/Information that I need to see while doing my job.

Like I said at the beginning, I'm with you on the people who just buy them to have them to enhance their e-peen, but setting up a eyefinity setup and using it for the sole purpose of playing a game isn't a bad reason alone to have that setup.","1328054818"

In their arrogance, Democrats pretend that we should all be Politically correct adults. They pretend to be against placing labels or names on anyone, cry loudly when it's done to them, but are the place both on others.

They proceed in their arrogance by telling others that anyone with an opposing view is a ""Hater"", and during this President's Administration have gone so far as to call anyone who critiques his performance a ""Racist"".

Try disagreeing with one. You are immediatly told that you ""Listen to Limbaugh"" or ""Beck"" or ""Watch Fox News"".

As someone who watches BBC America, MSNBC, and Fox, but doesn't ""listen"" to talk radio, I find their accusations to be their way of attacking anyone who doesn't like their opinion.

I can tell you most of them get their ""facts"" from MSNBC, which has to be the most clearly partisan network on TV and calling it journalism. Fox may not be perfect, but they are FAR from being as openly partisan as Chris Matthews, Rachel Maddow, Ed Shultz and Larry O'Donnell. Watch both networks for a while, and you will see my point.

In short, they are the biggest bunch of hypocrites in politics. They play to the lowest common denominator among voters, such as their stance with OWS. ""You are entitled to something"" and ""Banks and Corporations are bad"" and ""The rich are the problem"".

If you like thinking of game ideas the handbook will be a delight to read for you, because it's basically a book of the game rules. I enjoyed it.

The advantage of that game is that it's an actual Role Playing Game, not a video game. This mean you get to play in a persistent world like an MMO, with a number of other players, but you're not restricted to any kind of story. If you make it good and reasonable, and the GM thinks it's good, it passes. 

I made some crazy characters. My friend asked me to make him a character that would beat everyone and we made a Lightning jutsu 12 year old that dual wields 2handed swords and rapes everyone in sight by the name of Rickert. My friend was obnoxious too so they had to rewrite a lot of the handbook because of him lol. I also made a poison based character and I was using poison freely in training duels and they forbid that in the new rules. So much fun.

The game masters run events all the time, and you get some really interesting interactions with other players as well. Rickert and I had some really cool encounters.

Story time: Rickert and I were sparring outside a village with a host of other ninjas. Free for all, anything goes type of deal. One of us was basically a Kismae clone who's goal is to be Mizukage. Very honorable, *very* high level.  Rickert grapples with this guy's partner, a weakling, and is basically choking him out. I poison Mr. Kisame and make him see double. This guy charge in full speed at Rickert and slices his arms off. Except he didn't. He split his partner in half because they were grappling. Rickert proceeds to knock him off his feet and kick him in the stomach while I use a smoke bomb and we get away. Poor guy was playing the character for a year and now he's a wanted man can't become Mizukage.","1328054830"

"glutenfree","t5_2qx1l","Miralax and the cheaper generic PEG is supposed to be safer to take regularly rather than senna or senna tea or senna combos like pericolace (which work for most people but supposedly are not recommended to be taken too frequently).

PEG is a tasteless powder you can mix with tea or soda or coffee. I have never tried it, but my friend who has IBS-C and was previously hooked on senna says she thinks it works great.

One thing to be careful with senna tea or mixing the natural senna leaves or herbs into other drinks is that if done daily, it can be toxic to your liver. In small doses like the 8 or 25 mg pills you can buy, senna is fine to take occasionally, but the problem with the leaves is you can't really know how much of the active ingredient you are putting in there, and it could be a huge amount that can be toxic.

Either way, I have seen liver toxicity in people drinking senna tea daily for years and also in people taking the senna pills daily for many years, so just be careful how much you are taking and how often if you continue. That goes for other herbal teas as well. To be safe, I would be moderate in whatever you decide to try. Anyone can feel free to correct me, but PEG is the only constipation cure I know of that has been proven in studies to be safe enough to take daily.","1328054831"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;was falsley accused of rape and how this is a travesty. Which if true it is.

So what's the problem? If someone says 'my friend was falsely accused of rape', you assume that's a fact (i.e. it's been proven in a court of law or the woman admitted to lying or whatever). Otherwise, they are simply lying and you might as well be asking 'Why do people lie?'.

And whilst, no, that is not the theme you are commenting on (you are commenting on the theme of misogamy on Reddit), I will offer a response. The same reason any comment where someone posts about being wronged or suffering a hardship will get upvotes: sympathy/consolation. No it does not 'create the impression' that most women make it up, that's your own inference from those comments and it is quite flawed. That's like saying 'Why upvote that comment in which a situation is described? People might think the circumstances of that situation apply to every situation of that type', which is just stupid. Don't upvote comments where someone talks about being hit by a car which then drove off - people might think that every time someone gets hit by a car, the perpetrator drives off.","1328054833"

That would be stupid. If you work as an exterminator you have to see bugs. My example is nothing so asinine. If you work in a typical retail store it's not an expectation that your job will be 100% ladder work if you are afraid of heights. 

&gt;Not really, but women should be aware of the impact their choices have on their careers.

Oh trust me, almost every woman has thought about this. But why should women be the one to suffer when say a *married* *couple* wants to have a child? Are women to be relegated to two groups? One that has a job but no children or another group where they have children but are barred from having a profession? Also these days if you want to provide for your children both parents have to work. There isn't enough disposable income for one parent to not be in the labor force.

You seem to be focusing on different issues and seem to be forcing the ""blame"" of pregnancy on women. If women *and* *men* in Europe are getting months and months of for maternity leave, surely it can't be too hard on the American economy to make minor accommodations for women who are working when pregnant and get back to work as soon as they are physically able instead of taking more recovery time like women in Europe.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","&gt;I don't think about my cat as being brown

Bingo!

We *impute* the quality ""brown"" on the cat! Exactly! So too do we impute ridiculousness like ""permanent"" on impermanent things!

The qualities are not *inherent* in the objects on which we impute them. Brown, e.g., depends on many causes and conditions, and is not solely to be found in your cat...is not found in your cat at all.

The ""brown-ness"" is dependent, at least, on the following: your cat, your eyes, the wavelength of ambient light in the room, the chemical composition of the air, the relative speed/acceleration between object and subject...you see how analysis can uncover all of these connections.

And we can change any one of them, and ""brown"" will be gone. Because ""brown"" is due to those causes and conditions, and not just your cat.

So too for ""permanence"".

&gt;So I can see that as a way to see things, though I definitely cannot understand how it would happen or feel like. 

It feels loose, open, non-clingy, appreciative, understanding.

&gt;How do you get to the point where it's not really a thought? 

Wait it out. It'll tucker out and then you can tuck it in for the night :)

&gt;And how do you deal with the depression that I feel would accompany trying to get to that point?

Wait it out. First recognize that depression too is impermanent. You might not know its duration, but you know it isn't forever, always.

I was/am depressed for years. And I still look for its storm on the horizon. One just passed yesterday, I believe.

Hell, I seriously and actively doubt even the happy feelings I have -- poking them in their impermanence. They won't last...so, what exactly are they up to...hmm? Trying to tempt me away like so many Mara's daughters!

No!

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","I find this very interesting, and I don't think anything is wrong with you :) 
I am currently not in a BDSM relationship, but am planning on getting involved in the community and hopefully meeting someone. But if/when I have a dominant I am absolutely positive that the one thing I wouldnt want them to call me is fat. Food + sexual play (especially D/s) is a huge no no for me. I've been fat my whole life and have suffered from uncontrollable binge eating as long as I can remember. I've had issues with boyfriends leaving me/not being intimate with me because of my weight :( I lost 100lbs a couple years ago, but never really fixed the binge eating problem. I went from 307lbs to 198lbs, but now I'm back up to around 230lbs. Every day is a struggle. 

I read somewhere that people take things that they are afraid of, or that cause them stress, and turn them around into positive things (often sexual). So if you've always had a little bit of fear about weight, it makes perfect sense that it would be quite a turn on. But thats the wonderful thing about BDSM; sometimes when you're being submissive (or dominant) you can just let go of everything. 

Anyway, I just wanted to comment on how interesting it is to find someone on the opposite spectrum from me regarding food/weight :) And I don't think you're bizarre at all.

They would not be able to produce all their needs or wants, and would thus have to negotiate with other groups to trade for those goods.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's been highlighted by many who have experienced them that a TSA pat-down is far more invasive than your standard ""club"" pat-down. Club security usually doesn't grab or grope at your genitals, and according to those who opted out of the screen machine, TSA does. 

I'm gonna guess you've either never had a TSA pat-down, or the clubs you frequent are a little over-zealous about security. I've never been felt up by TSA, but I've been going to clubs and concerts for 25+ years, and never had my junk groped once - which is something many who have related their experiences with TSA have been very clear about. 

It's one thing to have an opinion. It's another thing to make stuff up that sounds good just to support your opinion....maybe you've been through both scenarios and found them to be similar in ""invasive-ness"", but many others have found that this is not the case. So either your experience is entirely anecdotal, or you're just fabricating an analogy that bolsters your opinion.

Either way, TSA is just another unnecessary layer of government bureaucracy and incompetence.  ","1328054855"

That is you saying its wrong to be vegetarian because its natural.  I don't know how you can get anything else from it...

"funny","t5_2qh33","I figured you'd be above just playing semantics with phrasing, but okay. 

I made my main issue known in my first post and people criticized the first thing I said as the end all be all of how I view atheists. 

I'll reiterate my main problem with atheists. 

Let's take a religious person for example. We'll say he is a christian. If an example is given of him doing something good in his life for himself, his community, the world, etc., it is written off as ""He did this because he is a good person, not because of his religion.""

If that same person did something bad in his life, to his community, to the world etc., if it written off as ""He did this because he is a christian. Following christianity makes him a bad person."" Not, ""He is a bad person who happens to be christian.""

I agree and enjoying seeing questions about the religion of christianity (any religion of course, but still using this example). I don't agree with damning people who do bad things for being christians. They would have done these horrible things without their religion or not. Just because someone wants to filter their hate through a medium doesn't make the medium bad. 

I could say Phillips screwdrivers tell me to hate gays and I'd be considered fucked up in the head. I say the Bible tells me to hate gays and there's a problem with the Bible and the religion. Just because some asshole took inspiration from a book doesn't make the book bad; they were looking for justification of their actions. The Beatles music isn't evil because Charles Manson said Helter Skelter told him to harm others.

Tim Tebow is made fun of because he is christian. Why? He is a great person, does amazing work in the community, and is a wonderful role model. He is honestly a good-hearted individual who is considered faulty because he is christian. That's just necessary hate. 

Fuck, just hate the player not the game.

Of course they are in possession of criminals. The point is that they are not easy to get. Thus we limit the number of armed criminals and the number of *potential* criminals.

"gamingnews","t5_2rsaw","I understand completely, I want HL3 too. But Duke Nukem Forever had a tenuous development and countless issues. Valve has nearly unlimited resources, They are extremely familiar with working with their source engine, are known for consistently releasing high quality and well received games. It will be a lot different than what happened with the duke. That's not saying that It can't let people down, It just won't be anything near DNF. In fact Valve has been consistently releasing games over the past few years, and after Dota 2 and CS:GO see release I am pretty confident that HL3 would be the next game around the Corner. 

If Valve is holding out on HL3 for any reason other than polish and perfection, Its because what they are doing with the game can only be handled on a high end PC, as Half-Life is Valve's flag shit IP. Seeing that they release all their games to their console fans too, I'm sure they want a simultaneous console release. As much as this wait could pain me, I am in the wait for the long run.

The person said that if the vial was emptied in the right parts of the atmosphere, everyone on the planet would die.  So the terror of a government apocalypse is still ripe to be made fun of.

As for sci-fi, he would've done ""A.I."" and I would've been saved from a school of fish saving a robot.  I loved that film but that moment is a clear case of Spielberg sticking his nose where it doesn't belong instead of being a funnel for Kubrick.","1328054876"

"misc","t5_2qjbr","Years ago when i was a smoker, (pack a day back then - smoke free for 8 years now) there was this guy who used to do the same thing as you're describing except with cigarettes. 

""Hey man let me bum a smoke off you.""  He'd hit up everyone in the group at different points throughout the night, and you'd never know that he bummed a smoke off someone else.  He would do this every night for years.  

He loved new people; they didn't know any better about him.  He would even travel to other areas of the company (large property, lots of people) so that he could bum smokes off of others there too.

I mean we all never really had loads of money, but I know how hard you can jones for a cigarette when you run out and stress is up, so i never really minded much especially considering with most people, payback would come on a day when i ran out and you gave me one of yours just like most people do.

What finally put me over the top was when he said hey man let me bum a smoke off you and I was down to my last 2.  I didn't really want to give it up, and sort of dithered about giving it to him, but ultimately did the friendly thing and I gave him one of my 2 and smoked my last for the night, knowing I had 3 hours to go with no more smokes.

A half hour later this fuck opens a brand new pack from his jacket and lights up in front of me.  Mind you he's been in my presence the whole time so he didn't just buy it.  He just didn't want to open one of *his* packs.  He didn't even have the brains to look embarrassed about it nor did he offer me one as payback and when I asked for one he had the balls to give me a hard time about getting one from him.  Even though I had been fronting him smokes 1 at a time throughout the night routinely for like a year, not to mention the fact that I had just given him my last earlier in the night.

Turns out that he always had 1 or 2 packs of cigarettes on him at all times.   I asked around and a people knew about his practices and it was a fairly common practice for him going back as long as anyone remembered him (20 years+).  He did that for years till he retired.  He was just a cheap ass.","1328054879"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","Yes, I think you've basically got a handle on it now.  My only addition would be that it's very easy to go from ""Here are the things you should do to avoid rape"" to ""Here are the things you didn't do that made you get raped"".  Even if you personally would never do this (and I trust that you wouldn't!), it's dangerous to set up a precedent where the onus of not getting raped is always on the woman and not the rapist.  Rape culture lends us to thinking about what women can do to not get raped rather than focusing on why people rape in the first place and doing something to stop it at the source.  That's why the ""My Strength is Not for Hurting"" and ""Men Can Stop Rape"" campaigns are getting such positive reinforcement in feminist circles.  Because it feels like *finally* someone is saying that the only person responsible for stopping rape is the rapist.  

&gt;If I understand this correctly, it would be acceptable for me to say to someone (who has not been a victim of rape) ""In order to help keep you safe, you should always tell someone where you are going, and, if you can, bring friends with you."" This would help prevent the rarer ""stranger rape"" but would not help prevent the more common ""rape by someone you know."" It would also be sound and courteous advice to say ""Be careful who pours your drinks, to avoid roofies."" 

My only hesitation with this is that I think it can come off kind of pretentious depending on who you're saying it to and what context.  Many women know this stuff already.  It's been drilled into our heads by Lifetime movies, after-school specials, ad campaigns, etc.  So I would be careful about when you want to pull out this advice and consider if it's wanted.  Honestly, if I was going out to a club and my male friend said, ""Make sure you watch your drink and don't get roofied!"", I'd be a little annoyed.  Because I know that; I'm told that all the time.  

If you wanted to try and use these tips to set up some sort of safety guideline for your school to hand out to girls who might be going to frat keggers, then that's a different story.  But again, it gets problematic when we expect the girl to ""not get raped"" as opposed to expecting people to ""just not rape"" them.

Here's my solution for a fixed number of consecutive heads and a potentially large number of total flips. It shouldn't be hard to generalize for k many consecutive heads.

    def p(i, n):
        """"""Return the probability of getting three consecutive heads
        someplace in the string of coins starting from the ith coin
        onward, out of n total coins. (At first coin, i = 1.)
        """"""
        # Comment out the ### lines to disable memoization.
        
        if (i, n) in memo:                  ###
            return memo[i, n]               ###
        
        if 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-2:
            val = ((1/8 * 1) +              # TTT
                   (1/2 * p(i+1, n)) +      # F??
                   (1/4 * p(i+2, n)) +      # TF?
                   (1/8 * p(i+3, n)))       # TTF
        else:
            val = 0
        
        memo[i, n] = val                    ###
        return val
    
    print(p(1, 10))
    
    # Try this one without memoization.
    print(p(1, 30))


Should be O(n) with memoization, exponential without.

Edit: For arbitrary k, add a third argument and replace the recurrence with

        if 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-k+1:
            val = ((2**(-k) * 1) +
                   sum(2**(-j) * p(i + j, n, k)

I am wondering how they're going to keep the drama up with all the main antagonists (bar hank) gone.

Compared to the drama of seasons 1-4, its hard to see how going to jail or getting audited would really be adequate consequence for Walt.

I'm also wondering how they're going to keep a driving force behind Walt and Jesse.

The key to Walts character has always been some sort of pressure to justify his lust for power. It only makes sense for Heisenberg to come out when there's some way Walt can justify it (as much as he relishes the opportunity to become heisenberg).

2. It literally has drag 'n drop interface design. You just (I shit you not) drag lines to items, and choose which item in the code it corresponds with.

&gt;Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us. (1 Peter 2:12)

&gt;Give whole-heartedly and try to lead a life of so much goodness and loving that it makes people ask why. I think even the most staunch atheist can agree that this is a good way to live.

Actually, yeah, most atheists would argue that the parts of Christianity that affect how they act towards other people (aside from evangelizing) are universal moral values regardless of religion.

I think another part of the blowback against evangelism is that you basically feel like the evangelist sees you as nothing more than a target to convert. You don't feel like they actually care about you. I suppose if I had a really close friend that decided they needed to try to save me in a mild manner I would see it as a caring gesture, though.","1328054897"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","As  precursor, I'm terribly sorry you spent all that time to write out such a long post.  Don't get me wrong, I think it is very well written but also bears very little content.  So, let's jump back to the real point which you pick up around here:  

&gt; 1) Atheists all really positively believe that god does not exist, but consistently lie to everyone about it and argue as though they simply lack belief in order to win arguments. Despite the new existence of another term with a similar meaning to that statement (agnostic) and the baggage the term 'atheist' obviously carries, they continue to keep calling themselves atheists because. . . well, I'm not sure why. You haven't mentioned it yet.  

This I'm actually curious about too.  I don't know why anyone would bother to utilize an ambgiuous term to describe themselves either, that's part of why we are having this conversation.  There is no ambiguity in the term theist, it has a singular meaning.  Atheists on the other hand is confusing, most will jump on the implied dichotomy of a- prefix and assume someone that asserts the opposite (a strong atheist view).  This is of course incorrect to do because of the obvious existence of the weak atheist view, but no weak atheists seem to be in a hurry to distinguish what they identify themselves as clearly.  Instead, most proclamations of atheism start normal enough.  Then if the conversations progresses to the question of why they believe God doesn't exist, the ""I'm not asserting anything"" clarification comes out which leads us to your second case:  

&gt; 2) Theists, realizing the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate god's existence, but unable to demonstrate either evidence or necessity of god, (perhaps unconsciously) decide to argue against a strawman with a similar burden of proof, and insist that we accept their definition as our argument. This is all done to make the atheist's position seem as untenable as their own.  

I supose it might be as you describe to some, but the truth is just about any theist can point to the history of their religion/spirituality as a form of evidence, or the improbability of random chance producing a form of life capable of reproduction, change and selection allowing biological evolution and concluding that it is more reasonable and rational that something intended such a thing.  So, just about any theist can make a weak case for their assertion, that God exists.  At that point, a simple rhetorical ""I'm not convinced"" is no longer effective in a debate.  A simple decleration of Pascal's Wager would be effective to favor the weakly built case for theism.  The best the weak atheist case can do is attack the existence, credibilty, or logical validity of the theist case, but they cannot make the marginal chance of its accuracy disappear completly.  Therefore, they must make a case that God does not exist in order to provide an alternative to the theist case.  

That likely is the major source of theist frustration, because the weak atheist typically claims no evidence for the theist case and no burden of proof for the ""atheist"" case. That position in itself is decleration of ignorance to start, the theist case is easily made and has been often.  Furthermore, the ""defense"" of a position that requires no proof is really no position at all.  For that matter, the weak atheist position isn't even asserting something, so they have no basis to criticize the assertion of others.  If weak atheists were being honest about their supposed views, then they wouldn't have anything to say.  

So then we arrive at the end of your statement, ""This is all done to make the atheist's position seem as untenable as their own"".  So the fact is the theist case actually is tenable, and the weak atheist actually doesn't have a position because they are neither convinced of the theist case or strong atheist case.  Of course, maybe deep down they actually are convinced of the strong atheist case, but they cannot put their finger on any viable argument to justify it.  

&gt; If you wish to argue that our definition of 'atheism' has changed in a way to make it confusing and unhelpful, then I'd have to argue that the term theist is also confusing and unhelpful, since the word 'god' also doesn't really have a clear meaning outside of context.  

This is a valid point, partially.  However, it is evading the discussion at hand.  Regardless to which conception of God a theist accepts or advocates, there is no question that the theist is making an assertion.  In contrast, atheism also has many variations like theist, but at the highest level it cannot provide singular point of information.  If the matter was dichotomous it would be fine, but it isn't, it is trichotmous instead.  So, at that point, we have to acknowledge that with your usage ""atheist"" and ""theist"" cannot be on equal taxonomic levels. This of course doesn't make sense, seeing as ""atheist"" incorprates the same term, I would hope you can see where the confusion and frustration comes from.  

&gt; Saying that atheist is unhelpful because it doesn't clearly define a person is as silly as saying that the word animal is useless because it doesn't distinguish between mammals, birds, and insects.  

That's a non-sequitur and inapplicable to the conversation.  If I said ""animal"" everyone can assume certain things such as a DNA based life form which is categroized in the Kingdom ""Animalia"".  This has no inherent ambiguity.  

&gt; If I seek to believe only what I can know with some degree of certainty, then belief in god would definitely require some knowledge of god. I have no such knowledge, and thus don't believe. If you disagree with my methods, perhaps you'd care to posit some other way for me to reliably determine my beliefs are consistent with reality?   

This is interesting and perhaps telling.  According to what you have described, there is no valid distinction between belief and knowledge, and what you have termed ""belief"" you would demand be preceded by ""knowledge"".  Then I must ask, what meaning does belief have at all?  If you are unwilling to accept as true something you do not know, then how can you claim to accept as anything as true outside of what you have directly experienced?  

&gt; I don't claim there's a complete lack of evidence. The evidence is simply unconvincing. As a theist, I'd assume you probably believe you have experienced the divine somehow (if not, I'd definitely have some further questions).   

Ask away, I have not had any expereince I would characterize as ""God spoke to me"" or anything like that.  

&gt; In a poll taken a few years ago, 15% of the population in 17 non-US countries believed that the 9/11 attacks were caused by the US government, and a majority of people believed Al Qaeda was responsible in only 9 countries. Assuming that poll accurately portrays the opinions of the population, that's a huge number of people who can't even agree on details of a major historical event that was televised all over the world in this century.  

This is an intersting case study, and I'll gladly play Devil's advocate.  If the US government did indeed cause the attacks, they easily had the means and influence to do as much, so the claim is at least credible at face value.  Furthermore, the long standing political perception of the U.S. around the globe could easily compell people to believe that the U.S. participated in such actions with the intent to use it to justify further military occupation of other nations.  

&gt; What makes you think stories about experiences of gods are any more consistent? How should we go about determining what claims are accurate, what explanations make sense, etc.?  

Well, the real manifestations of previous people's personal experiences I find highly compelling.  There were a lot of Martyred Christians in the first century A.D. that were direct witnesses to the historical Jesus.  Those people were so convicted by something they experienced that they preferred torture and/or death to renouncing their beliefs.  So, I'd argue that's something that is difficult to discount to start.","1328054901"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I like your wall example.

Your treatment of Matthew 7:21 is a good start, but I'd go further and say that Jesus is condemning what could be termed false holiness or false spirituality. I don't think Jesus sent them away because they weren't good enough (or else we're all doomed!), but rather that they were listing reasons why they should be accepted into his kingdom. Their reasons were ""**I did** this"" and ""**I did** that"" and ""I did it in your name! Ain't I holy?"" No. The point of the gospel is that we can't save ourselves so Jesus has to step in. The moment we think we ""deserve"" to enter heaven, we've lost sight of why Jesus even came to earth.","1328054906"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","So, what the actual fuck, Reddit? I make a post that didn't condemn Tim Buckley to the fiery depths of Hell and I get a million downvotes? Why the fuck are you all acting like children?

To clarify, I don't read CAD; I only knew about the League of Legends referral plan that Buckley had going from a friend. I made a smurf to help him along, thinking that 10,000 referrals would be a cool milestone for the League Community to reach, and that a fan-made champion would be really unique and interesting.

Since I don't read CAD, I've had the good fortune to miss all the fucking shit that Buckley has done. Seems pretty shit, from what I've read. What I can't wrap my head around, however, is the Reddit's community's fucking *cruel* nature towards any opinion that disagrees with theirs. What is so fucking terrible about congratulating a guy who got **ten thousand** player referrals? I don't give a shit about what sort of person he is, it's still damn impressive that it even happened.

These aren't the fucking NA Forums, Reddit. You don't need to stoop to **vulgar and psychopathic** fucking language to make a point. In a community that's supposed to value the difference of opinion, you've successfully given a giant middle finger to expression and community interaction.

&gt; I hope your skin rots off your body and you and tim buckley can take turns felating each other's skinless bloody rods.

What the fuck **is** this? Who says this sort of shit? What on **earth** warranted this kind of response? Just because I don't know every sordid, this-guy's-a-piece-of-shit detail, that's no reason to burn me at the fucking stake.

You just get +5 light side points. They also lose their appeal when you have to run them repeatedly to get the loot you want, and you STILL have to go through each cutscene and dialogue event, and you can... make different decisions? Most of the story is just loosely draped over fetch and kill x womprats quests.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","&gt; what is another good cooler to get for cheap?

I linked it in the post above. Hyper 212+ EVO, $39. Should still be able to get 4.4-4.5.

The 560 Ti 2GB is nearly the price of of a GTX 570 ($350AU), so really it's more a consideration of the 560 Ti 1GB. So the question becomes, is the GTX 570 worth $100 more to you? What we're talking about is roughly ~15% performance. What that translates to is BF3 @ 1080P Ultra Settings running at 39FPS on the 560 Ti, or 47FPS on the 570. You *may* see some slow down on the huge maps on the 560 Ti when there's a lot of action, but it should still be playable.

That's only considering *current* games though. Both BF3 and Skyrim come very close to maxing out the VRAM on current Nvidia cards, so the argument could be made that switching to an [ATI Radeon 6950 2GB](http://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=193_877&amp;products_id=18330) could be advantageous down the road. You'd still be able to comfortably play on Ultra settings now, but future titles would have more breathing room for the inevitably larger textures that are to come with newer graphics engines. If SLi used both card's VRAM as it does their processing cores, this would be a different story. But since it does not, to me, the 6950 sounds like your best bet. It saves your $60 now for performance that is between the 560 Ti and 570, and can get close to or past the 570 when you overclock the card (which you should if you get a Twin Frozr). You can easily double it in a year or two and still be good on GPU performance, and still have enough VRAM for next-gen games.

As for the motherboard, I love mine, I paid $180US for it. It was so easy to overclock and the quality is great. I'd say it's worth it, but I am also an Asus fanboy and have been for a decade. As an alternative the [ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3](http://pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=138_711_1183&amp;products_id=18137) would save you $65 and give you similar features.

The Bronx has had a much different history and while some parts have stood the test of time most have not. The Grand Concourse used to be the place people in the city moved when they were done with Manhattan.  All of those buildings used to have doormen and were occupied by wealthy Jews.

To many the Bronx is some place else like Westchester.  It's not on their radar.  People move above 96th street within Manhattan not because they want to but because it's their only choice.  Nobody who can live on 70th st is going to choose 110th st.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It seems as if you're equating not using violence to doing nothing.  I am not saying, ""Do nothing"".  The school has a 0 tolerance policy put in place.  The problem isn't just the bully.  The problem is that the school isn't *using* it.  You think it's embarrassing to the bullied to have the police take a report?  It can be.  You think it's embarrassing to the bully to be fined or cuffed at school?  You think it's embarrassing if the complaint is filed after hours and the police show up to the house of the bully?  You better believe it is.  You think it's embarrassing if it keeps happening?  You bet it is.  You think it's embarrassing you to be served papers in public?  You bet.  You think it's embarrassing to have the news or paper know about consistent bullying taking place at a school for the principal?  You bet it is.

I can be a bully too.  But I do it within the institutions at my disposal and I do it on a grander scale.  More importantly, all of this documents everything.  There are far too many stories about people defending themselves and getting into trouble themselves.  It sucks.  It is what it is.  The last thing I want to hear is the OP's son whooping the bully's ass and his son getting a record for it.

But the biggest problem of all is that the OP has waited too long to do this shit.  THAT is what being a pussy is.  

I would have told my child to tell the admins first about the bully.  If that doesn't work then I call the parents of the child, tell them what's going on.  Ask them to talk to their son and call me back that evening.  Then I draft a letter and mail it to all parties involved, parents and school.  I summarize what happened and outline that the next step will be police involvement followed immediately by a private lawsuit on the principle, parents and school.

I will not tolerate bullying.

Because the elevators in the metro system all have very similar angles (30 degrees according to your sources) of ascent, as the rise goes up, the length get longer. The length of the north entrance is about twice it's rise at 188'10''. I may be making a faulty leap here, but wouldn't the length of the south exit then be 169'6''?
I feel comfortable making this jump of logic because I hiked up the Q street exit on saturday after clubbing, and I just jogged down and up the south exit after a job interview. I assure you it is not half the length. If it was, I'd be WAY more bent out of shape about my exit closing for 8 months.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","I don't think it's fair to say the individual quality of our players is less than other seasons. Players like Vidic, Hernandez, Berbatov, Giggs (even at his age, arguably he is playing some of his best football) and Rooney are top players, and others like Nani, Valencia, Cleverly, Welbeck, Young, Carrick, the twins, Jones or Evra would make it in to almost any other team in the league except for maybe City who want and can afford a team of stars, or Chelsea (ditto). I've even left out Scholes, Park, Ferdinand and Owen based on their age and/or injury problems, but that doesn't make them bad players.

When you look at that list, I find it hard to justify anyone saying it's a poor team, or that the quality of players is significantly lower than any other season. The quality of their play has been questionable at times this season so I'm not saying it's been a classic United year, but they get the results. 

And lets not forget the start of the season where they were being hailed as a young revitalized team before injuries hit hard.

Speaking of, injuries are playing a huge role. We are on 3rd and 4th choices at times; Evans isn't a top player, but he does a job considering he is not first choice. Few teams can afford to have 4 top centre halves in their squad, so when two are out injured, you have to rely on guys who are good, but not good enough to want to move elsewhere.

I think as United fans, we have to accept that even without the Glazers debt, we do not have the sugar daddy providing us endless funds to buy a team of stars. Most of the stars are being bought up by other clubs, for huge prices, inflating the market to madness like Torres for 50 million (out of form and injury prone) and Ronaldo for 80 million. He's a top player, number 2 in the world, but if that's the bar, we have to accept United will never pay that for a player. 

I'll admit we only have 1 top star  - and by that I mean a player in the top 20 or 30 in the world (and Rooney absolutely is a star player, his goals aren't as important as the effect he has on the team while playing) - and to buy a second would be great; but how much would he cost? £50 million? £60? United doesn't have those funds any more seeing as there will be a wage bill to go with it.","1328054940"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This email was largely necessary because the University screwed up in explaining the policy in the first place.  The policy essentially says that membership of all groups are open to all students and that there cannot be a religious eligibility test to run for leadership positions.  A member of the administration apparently said that religious beliefs could not be considered when electing leaders of religious groups (or rather -- as alleged -- that students might be able to challenge election results if they felt people didn't vote for them because of religious beliefs).  Regardless of whether or not that was said, it's not true and the policy is as stated above.  The groups seized on that incorrect statement to start whining about persecution that just doesn't exist.

More detail: the actual ""religious test"" in the charters of the three Christian organizations that were among groups whose charters were cited for amendment is a requirement that leaders conduct bible studies and lead prayer and worship.  The University asked that these be removed to come into compliance, arguing that requiring leaders to do those two things would make non-Christians ineligible for office.  I disagree re bible study, as anyone can do that.

More details: the review of the charters was sparked by allegations from an Ingram Scholar (i.e., one of the University's highest scholastic honors) that he was ejected from the Christian fraternity (BYX) when it was discovered by the fraternity that he was gay.  ","1328054941"

The level of detail the show has and the fact that they start to deliver a joke, then literally wait an entire year to reveal the punchline is enough reason to call it a geeky show by itself.

NPH's character also has the ultimate rich geek bachelor pad, complete with life-sized stormtrooper statue, and alphabetized porn collection. The show even creates it's own pop culture references within the show that never go away, like the fact that Robin used to be a Canadian pop star.

No, I wouldn't say that the show bills itself as a geeky show like Big Bang, nor is it a sci-fi or other genre show like Walking Dead, or Doctor Who, but it is a show which most modern geeks can relate to. Especially due to the amount of backstory they've created with a dozen flashbacks per episode, and with little to no retcons in sight!

"cripplingalcoholism","t5_2s68b","&gt;A 2001 meta-analysis found that of 108 studies on 5-HTP published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion. The two studies that were deemed of sufficient quality did not deal with 5-HTP exclusively, instead combining results for 5-HTP and tryptophan, so the results may not be completely applicable for 5-HTP alone. While the combined analysis of the two 5-HTP and tryptophan studies showed significant effectiveness over placebo in treating depression, the authors state that overall ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"". They also state that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"".

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","First of all, it IS easy to convert a vector image to a bitmap image. It's only the opposite direction, converting a bitmap image to a vector image, which is difficult. Second of all, it's easy to convert a bitmap image to a vector image if you're willing to do a crappy job about it. Converting from bitmap to vector is only difficult if you want to actually end up with a vector image which yields more detail even when scaled up.

The reason why it's difficult is that you have to guess based on limited information what the author's intent was. Let's say you only have 3x3 pixels to work with, and you wish to draw a circle. How would you do it? Maybe something like this:

     * 
    ***
     * 

Now if you wanted to draw a diamond in only 3x3 pixels, how would you draw it? Probably like this:

     * 
    ***
     * 

Notice that you end up with exactly the same set of pixels, because there's just not enough room to draw very much detail in only 3x3 pixels.

Now let's say I gave you this bitmap:

     * 
    ***
     * 

And I asked you to convert it to a vector image, you could half-ass it and just draw + shape, but then I might complain ""Hey, I wasn't trying to draw a plus! I was trying to draw a diamond!"" or ""Hey, I wasn't trying to draw a plus! I was trying to draw a circle!""

So if you wanted to do a better job, you might try to a circle, but then I might say ""Hey, I wasn't trying to draw a circle! I was trying to draw a diamond!""

So you can see the problem here is that from the pixels, there simply isn't enough information to recover what the original intent of the artist was, such that you can create an infinitely scalable representation of the image.","1328054968"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","From reading all of this so far, I've come to several conclusions:

If we had never seen a live elephant before, and all we had to work on were bones, there would be several variables, such as what bones of the elephant and of other animals were available to be used for comparison.

According to the Wikipedia article on elephants (paying close attention to the segment on bone structure), the trunk is in a small part similar to noses and nostrils of many species in the Animal kingdom.

A scientist in this field would be able to hypothesize as to how the elephant would acquire and eat food, and smell. Generally, animals have functional appendages and organs in the same relative area. Based on the elephant's massive size, it could be vaguely determined that since it's head and legs are very limited in flexibility, the animal would need a substitute in order to survive, and therefore reproduce.

These hypotheses are usually determined when comparing several sources, instead of just one, as are a lot of things. Examples of skull anatomy I would use for reference are [human](http://courses.washington.edu/chordate/453photos/skull_photos/human_skull_front_02.jpg) for the sake of familiarity, [anteater](http://www.boneclones.com/images/bc-011-lg.jpg) for the possibility of an elongated snout from said elephant skull that was somehow damaged, and [mammoth](http://www.boneclones.com/images/bc-159-lg.jpg) because the skulls between it and the elephant are too similar to rule out. 

Scientists would compare the bone structure of all of these to the elephant skull, and given the link from above:
&gt; http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2718/4378175875_61dc2b8fdd.jpg

(edit)

I'd think it's safe to say that all of these possible hypotheses would point almost certainly to the idea of a trunk-like appendage. Given the fact that animals on planet Earth rely on water as sustenance, the appendage would have to be able to reach water without the tusks getting in the way. 

Could it be proven beyond a reasonable doubt? Maybe. Advances of technology in this field of study is quite debatable. However, given the bone knowledge that we possess today, the idea of a trunk is quite fathomable. 

Many other possibilities still exist; but from comparative research alone, I could reasonably estimate that an elephant would have to have a trunk within a reasonable length to grab food from trees and the ground, as well as reach a water source. ","1328054970"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","C - in the practical, realistic, sense.

Consider Sherlock Holmes. We know that this is a fictional creation. Many people have written about him, with different mythologies and attributes associated to him. There have even been Holmes collections where those attributes and stories don't line up, because each writer was attempting to write 'their' story.

Was there someone by the name of Sherlock Holmes walking around Victorian London? Very probably, it's not exactly an uncommon set of names. Was there a factual individual that inspired the Conan Doyle stories? Yes it appears that attributes of deductive reasoning came from Dr. Joseph Bell - who Conan Doyle knew - plus others with similar attributes.

Was there a *real* Sherlock Holmes? No.

Practically we know it to be fiction, and the standards we have for it being a 'real person' don't allow either namesakes or others with similar attributes to be the 'real person'.

As such, we have to say that no, there was no real jesus character, even if there were namesakes or similar roving, raving, charismatics at the time - which again we do not know. As others have pointed out, there is no valid evidence (no matter how much the op wants to give the benefit of the doubt to forged, later, accounts) and if there was anyone with the essential 'jesusness' around at the time, it would have shown up in contemporaneous records. Sherlock Holmes has more evidence of being real.

The jesus figure is an accreted myth, probably by those looking to make use of such a story, pulled and spun from similar myths we know of that predate it, and from prophesy. It was then edited and 'adapted' by those with a cause. There's no 'real' left - if ever there were some.  ","1328054973"

God can hardly be cosnidered a bully, more like a loving but busy parent. He provides life and a soul, after that its our responsiblity to move forward. You know how you see those stuck up 16 year olds on TV who get angry that they didn't get the car they wanted from the quiet parents who both work full times jobs and sit there and take it? God seems to me like those parents, they try to push thier kids in the right direction, they try to talk to them and show them the right way but somehow, someway these teens think thier parents are wrong and just tune them out.

Now this is in no way calling athiests children nor would I demean myself to go to that level after all adults do this too but the above example is the easiest. If you really boil down religion, say Catholisim, it honestly is stuff people should have been doing from day one to prevent so many issues, the Golden rule being the biggest of them yet so few people manage to wrap thier brain around. 

Me...I've stood up to a bully to other people before, myself, I couldn't handle fighting for myself, I allowed myself to be bullied for a long time because while I didn't feel powerless helping others when it came to helping myself, and it still does, I feel powerless.

She lived in the field for about three months before my wife talked my into bringing her home. We took her to a vet to get her fixed, only to discover that she already had been. Because her ear wasn't notched, I took this to mean that someone had previously owned her.

Every time we take her in the car, she freaks out. My guess is that she was driven to that field and then dumped by some careless owner, and riding in the car makes her think it will happen again.

We kept an eye out for lost pet signs with her picture on them, just in case, but we never saw any. I'm glad about that, though. She's a wonderful cat and I love her very much indeed.

1. By the end of their rule they were
2. I was using roman era accounts as examples
3. Both romans and celts were moralised by christianity. Generally post christianity blood sports/sacrifice were out.

&gt;  Particularly if using it to praise Christianity in particular, since other religions during the era colonized areas with slightly less genocide.

You continually move away from my point.  Early christianity was not late medieval christianity.  The early christians converted through strength of argument, not genocide and colonization. 

&gt; Or any number of other religions, particularly those that don't emphasize spreading their religion and subjugating personal morality and scientific research to authority ruling in the name of God.

This i feel is atypical of the anti-christian brigade.

1. All religions subjugate personal morality (thats the point).
2. Christianity was not always anti-science: modern day evangelism is.  The monastries were centres of science, but back then they studied the world through a divine lens.  Christianity increasingly became anti-science the more science disproved their beliefs.

&gt; It's common for people to take the good parts, and define it as Christianity. But since it's no more faithful to the text than those who use it's commandments of violence and obedience, the WBC isn't more corrupted than the Unitarians.

Christianity = a follower of christ, and his teachings.  If you don't love thy neighbour then you aint a christian, everything else is just layers of shit human ""organisation"".  Corruption happens almost immediately away from this with use of gospel truths that were not the teachings of christ.

&gt; I would far rather it had been the Athenians. Or the Buddhists. Or Hindus.

Athenians would have enslaved everyone, Buddhists didn't give too hoots about social well being (you're a slave? Meditate and escape your earthly prison). And Hinduism (though again, contrary to original beliefs) led to castism, which is fucking appalling.  Racism without race.

&gt;  Not all religions contain such principles, and even more importantly, when religion is absent people are left to justify their own actions and principles to others in order to be followed. 

Jesus! When people are left to justify their own actions it is straight back to facism.  The law of the jungle.  Thank the sweet baby ganesh that christianity was the moral driver of European development and not facism (which I guess is just an entirely morally relative political system: we shit on the poor, they shit on the different.).

              White Bean and Turkey Chili
1.5lbs Ground Turkey (I eat like a horse, so I up it every time to 2-3lbs)
2 medium-large Onions
1.5 tsp Dried Oregano
2 Bay Leaves
1 (28oz) can diced Tomato - Un-drained
3-4 cups of Beef or Turkey Broth
1 (12-14.5oz) Tomato Sauce
1 TBspoon Chili Powder (if you're a pussy) :)
1 TBspoon Baking Cocoa
.5-1 TBspoon Cinnamon
Salt and Pepper to taste
3-4 (15oz) cans of either White Kidney Beans(Cannellini) or Great Northern Beans

In a Dutch Oven or large stock pot, cook your turkey and onions. Wait til there's no more pink and drain. Being turkey, there really isnt too much fat to drain. Add your oregano. Cook additional minute. Stir in everything else but your beans. Bring to a boil; cover and simmer for 45 minutes to an hour. Add beans, heat through. Get rid of the bay leaves and serve. 

I'll be honest. I eat like nuts. No one believes it when they see me. However, this recipe can be doubled, tripled, or quadrupled easily and I usually do. My stock pot is something like 25 quarts and I fill that baby up. So, enjoy and lemme know what you think! Props to the Bromo in Chief for starting this thread. I liked the coffee grounds in your recipe and will admit I will be trying it next. :) Peace!

THE BANKERS DEPRESSION OF THE 1930's

In 1930 America did not lack industrial capacity, fertile-farm land, skilled and willing workers or industrious farm families. It had an extensive and highly efficient transportation system in railroads, road networks, and inland and ocean waterways. Communications between regions and localities were the best in the world, utilizing telephone, teletype, radio, and a well-operated government mail system. No war had ravaged the cities or the countryside, no pestilence weakened the population, nor had famine stalked the land. The United States of America in 1930 lacked only one thing: an adequate supply of money to carry on trade and commerce. In the early 1930's, Bankers, the only source of new money and credit, deliberately refused loans to industries, stores and farms.

Payments on existing loans were required however, and money rapidly disappeared from circulation. Goods were available to be purchased, jobs waiting to be done, but the lack of money brought the nation to a standstill. By this simple ploy America was put in a ""depression"" and the greedy Bankers took possession of hundreds of thousands of farms, homes, and business properties. The people were told, ""times are hard,"" and ""money is short."" Not understanding the system, they were cruelly robbed of their earnings, their savings, and their property.","1328055013"

"funny","t5_2qh33","The whole Old Testament/New Testament misunderstanding is really starting to bother me. I've heard atheists, agnostics, and even Christians get it wrong. The truth is this: The OT (Old Testament), as its name implies, is the embodiment and history surrounding the old covenants that God made with His special people Israel. They made sacrifices to cover their sins as they looked *forward* to Christ's ultimate and perfect sacrifice, the one that would finish them all and atone for everyone's sins so that fallen mankind could once again have fellowship with the Creator. Upon Christ's Incarnation and death on the cross, the NT era (church era) began. Now people of *all* tongues and tribes and nations could believe on Christ and accepted Him as their Lord and Saviour, looking *back* (in time) to the cross and placing their faith in it for their salvation. They, and we who still live in this church age, do not have to follow the ceremonial laws of the OT. We still read the OT because of the great history and lessons to be learned from people like David, etc. and to see how God dealt with Man in times past, and for the morals taught therein (Love the Lord your God with all your heart, Love your Neighbor, etc.). But we are not like the Jews; this is called the age of Grace because the Jews rejected Christ at His first coming, and so God turned His attention from just Israel to *all* nations, and Grace is given to the non-Jews who believe (though Jews who happen to believe are not excluded or rejected). Again, we are saved by Grace, not works, and the NT repeatedly teaches this. We are not bound by the Law; the Law only existed to show Man his depravity and bring him to his need of Christ.

TL;DR- Christians are not bound by Old Testament ceremonial laws but according to the New Testament are saved by God's Grace.","1328055014"

Racism isn't a huge deal either, and the media (including reddit) inflate the problem much, MUCH larger than it actually is.

If I walked into a community where everybody (not just a small minority of people) just kinda avoided a guy, I would assume it's because he's unpleasant, not because of a religious difference. He MAY vary religiously, but the chance of that being the sole cause of the shunning is very small. Of course, even with that assumption, I wouldn't personally make any solid judgments until I met him myself.

At the very least, they're not particularly unpleasant, but they're TERRIBLY bigoted against Christianity, leading Christians (the majority) to tend to avoid them. If you were black and there was a flagrantly racist white man, wouldn't you do YOUR best to avoid them? I know I flipped the majority/minority bit there, but the argument still holds. ","1328055019"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The business model argument is so infuriatingly infantile. There are cases where you can legitimately argue that the problem is the business model, but there are cases (like piracy) where you can't. This is an argument 15 year olds trot out because they heard it on the internet somewhere and thought it seemed cool. Unless everything goes ad supported, there's no way to sustain this model at all. Ad-supported models would also not be able to support things like big budget movies, big budget albums, big budget games. Ads have limits. Ads get you cheap little smartphone games and basic apps. They don't get you the caliber of material you have grown accustomed to. Further, even if ads *could* theoretically support the current production value of media, there's the further issue of being able to block ads, which by your logic is also completely OK in all cases because they just have to adjust to the realities of what is easily possible in this day and age.. right? What then? What business model can feasibly *compete with free*?

Steam is a nice counter-example, sure. Steam competes with free pretty well right now (but this is because it generally only deals with games, and gaming torrents have occasional issues). But will it forever? If piracy is something everyone did, don't you think the quality of torrents would increase, people would put more time into making games easy to install? Right now you have to run things like cracks and then deal with a few issues occasionally, but that isn't going to be the case forever, because, as you said, it's the reality of the new computer-driven world. Things get easier and easier to do. You *can't* compete with free in the long run if free is seen as a legitimate option for the vast majority of people. It's not possible.

&gt;Musicians would have to give away the digital copies of their songs for free, and make their money from shows. A lot of performers have adapted to this new business model already.

Shows only bring in significant money for big performers. Otherwise you're talking peanuts.

&gt;Programmers would have to rent out their skills to people who wanted new features for software, instead of first creating a product and then trying to sell it. 

Most programmers already sell their time instead of make their own products, but if there's less resources to go around because products are being pirated, there are less resources to hire programmers, and many programmers lose their livelihoods. The large majority of programs are not under the GPL, and most companies wouldn't consider making a large R&amp;D investment into something that will eventually end up under a free public use license (like a video game, for example). In the ideal world, everything would be free, but this is the real world and things don't work that way.

&gt;Some might give away the movie but sell merchandise and memorabilia.

You've basically doomed all non-blockbuster movies here. This will destroy lots of the more niche genres. You'll see a lot more focus towards marketable mindless action movies and such. Congratulations, you've just killed movies as an art form.


&gt;None at all? You contradict yourself immediately

I don't think you understand what the word contradict means.

&gt;The business models would have to change.

Spoken like someone who read something off a bullet point on the internet and didn't give it much thought. Ad-supporting won't work for the majority of products (not even mentioning that many users hate ad-supported stuff and will circumvent it however they can). There's basically no business model that can survive forever against piracy, especially as piracy evolves, becomes easier to do (especially in the case of games and things that need to be installed) and even more user friendly (steam-like p2p client, maybe?)","1328055022"

Feminists sometimes say ""patriarchy hurts men"" or ""feminism helps men"", but for the most part such statements are incidental to the main thrust of what they talk about, are the first principles to be jettisoned when there's some conflict, and don't translate to listening to men earnestly the way we're entreated to listen to women earnestly.","1328055027"

Threat = Omen.  I just configure Tidyplates to alert me of high threat levels, personally, but I have used Omen before and it does its job very well.

Bars = Dominos.  Much easier to setup and tweak than Bartender, in my opinion.

Buffs/Debuffs/Cooldowns/Dot-Tracker = Raven.  Best one out there.

Combat Text = Parrot, some like Mik's better, but meh.  Whatever floats your boat, I guess.  Parrot just seems to work better for me.

Nameplates = Tidyplates.  Must have.

Map addon = Mapster.

Boss Mods = Deadly Boss Mods or Big Wigs.  Both work well.

Auction = Auctionator.  Works well without all the bloat of Auctioneer.

Unitframes = They are all a pain in the ass to configure, but Pitbull or Shadowed Unit Frames are the most capable.

Castbars = Gnosis.  Quartz is pretty good, too, but I don't like the way it handles channeled spells.

Other nifty stuff:
ReforgeLite is handy for speeding up reforging and generally does a good job.

BattlegroundTargets is indispensable for giving you an overview of the enemy team composition and helping you figure out which one of them has the flag / how many healers they have, etc.

ChocolateBar is a nice way to organize crap on a bar at the top or bottom of your screen instead of having an assload of little buttons stuck around your minimap frame.  You can also add other things to it like displays for your currency items or your xp / rep.

I'm going to make a small assumption and say that you haven't been reading scientific literature, nor even literature by notable scientists dumbing it down for the layman.  

The Big Bang is a ""begining"" but only in the sense that we don't have data beyond that point.  It is quite common for Christians to understand science while being stuck in their box.  I come across it a lot.  Here, the assumption is ""In the beginning was the word..."" and that is the beginning of time.  In science, Big Bang is just the beginning of what we can talk about.  Why don't you breeze of some science articles with this  new understanding.  The words may mean different things to you now.

&gt;Can't I just ask who created him?

Yes, yes!  That's exactly cuzincuz's and my point.  Remember this conversation is in regards to your assertion that ""there can't be a beginning of time when you ask [what if something created God].""

For your original position, there can't be more than 1 God who created the world.  However, I hold there can be almost infinitely many Gods creating each other in sequence until we get to the God who we believe created the world, and the world would not be changed a bit.  Where is the change?  Where is the malfunction that prevents this from happening? (you seemed to have missed this important question from my previous post)

(1) You hold that ""the world doesn't exist"" and ""there is not a beginning of time"" when one asks ""what if something created God?""  God is an uncreated thing exists all on its own without any intervention from anything else. 

(2) Therefore, you admit that things can exist uncreated by other things

(3a) You stop at only 1 uncreated thing.  Why?  What reason have you to believe that only 1 uncreated thing ever spontaneously came into existence.  If it happened once, why not many times?  Why not constantly?

(3b) I beleive cuzincuz was getting at the point that the universe doesn't need to be created by a god.  It can simply be one of those spontaneously uncreated things.  On what grounds do you say that the universe must be created?  (If you say harmony of the universe, I will say you are quite unread in astronomy.  There is great violence and conflict amongst the stars, being eaten whole, planets smashing into suns, large asteroids smashing into planets, decimating them, knocking them off axis, entire solar systems colliding with each other, etc)

You still have not been clear on why you think the world would not exist and also how time would not have a beginning.  I am very confused on this subject (I can't make a flattering argument for you).  I think this is because you are confused on the subject yourself.","1328055037"

As the article outlined, the problem is that pregnancy is falling in the cracks on being covered. So, if you want to accommodate pregnancy it ends up falling 100% on the companies and either

a) the company is shitty and doesn't want to help
b) the company simply doesn't have the capability to allow the woman to work anywhere else doing anything else: there simply isn't other work or the company is too small to be able to manage it
c) there aren't the resources and accommodation would mean someone else having to work more for less or losing their job to make room for expense of accommodation

If you want pregnancy to be treated like a long-term but temporary disability then the government has to step in. That's how European nations are able to offer such great benefits without stifling companies: the government becomes a giant insurance-like pool to smooth out rough patches for all.

And that was when we would pull out the bible. Your answer is brilliant, though. Not only is it true, it's the complete opposite of JW thought.

Meanwhile the toll road authorities charged in and offered a deal where we get the road improvements with no additional tax burden.  Everyone jumps on board because, hey, ""I don't drive over there so it won't affect me.""

Also at no point do I see the actual connection between polio vaccines and HPV/cervical cancer there. A contaminated sample cause a type of lymphoma. Again, human error. That is a long way from the vaccine by itself causing cancers.
They just leap from talking about one thing to the other with no actual connection.

What I would be curious about is how the hell they didn't manage to get rid of ALL contaminated vaccine in a span of almost 50 years or so, its not hard to manufacture new material, and once they identified the problem surely they could prevent it from making it into new batches. 

I also think the arguments against the HPV vaccine are weak. Saying that most HPV clears up on its own (because most strains are not dangerous and do go away) is a reason not to vaccinate against the handful that are dangerous, is like saying because chickenpox won't kill you we don't need to vaccinate against smallpox.
Live vaccines are definitely risky, dead vaccines decidedly less so. It does look like the HPV vaccine gardasil is potentially unsafe and should not be on the market yet.","1328055048"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Oh yes? I'd like to see the sources that back up your data on that trend. 

You're also equating homebirth and midwifery with alternative medicine and that's simply not the case.

Midwives are trained medical professionals, it's a specialised three-year degree in NSW and a postgrad option for registered nurses. Although it hasn't always been the case, anyone entering the industry these days who doesn't have a degree is just a doula - effectively a support person.

Midwives are *supposed* to take a significant amount of medical equipment with them, including resuscitation gear. 

Homebirth is **not** freebirth, which (as another poster pointed out) is considered radically nutso even within the homebirth community.

From my own personal perspective I believe in vaccination and scoff at homeopaths and naturopathy, raiki and pretty much all other forms of stupid health fads that don't have a reasonable basis in science with the data to back them up.

Homebirth has reasonably good data to back up its efficacy and safety. Like anything else however, there are caveats and risk factors. For low risk births, these are no greater than birthing at hospital.","1328055052"

But you're not entitled to be in a relationship with your SO, either.  Doesn't your SO have the right to decide under what circumstances they'll be in a relationship with you?  

If you consent to sex with your partner because you worry s/he'll leave you if you don't satisfy them, can you really say that your partner is guilty of raping you?  Your partner can break up with you for any reason they wish, after all.  Unless you think that someone should be forced to maintain a relationship lest it cause ""psychological harm"" to their partner.  Which I don't think you believe.

I think sex can be negotiated within a relationship.  If one person says: ""I have a high libido and must have sex at least twice a week in order to be happy,"" I don't think this unduly coerces their partner to do anything.  That person's partner can either accept the terms of the relationship, or they are free to find another relationship elsewhere.  I don't believe relationships should be compulsory, or that someone should just accept a sex life that doesn't fulfill their needs.

If you aren't happy with your sex life, I think you should be free to find a partner who's a better match.","1328055063"

I'm not the only one. Your post inspired quite a few ""you're being a douchebag"" responses. Honestly Willie, take a look at what you wrote. You don't need to defend the nerd statement. I'm a nerd. But people don't like being called losers. People don't like being told that 'you aren't cool enough to join my club.' Your validation of this method of thinking inspired looks of disappointment and anger in multiple people. Not just this sensitivity sheriff.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; *As I said, Bayesian evidence. Evidence for a hypothesis is the observation of an event that is more likley to occur if the hypothesis is true than if it is false.*

I'm not sure how that's applicable here, as we aren't talking about events themselves; rather, we are talking about unverifiable claims of having witnessed events.

&gt; *What matters is not just the quantity, but the strength of each piece of evidence.*

...and...

&gt; *There is plenty, in the Bayesian context, for the existence of bigfoot. There is however, far more evidence, and far stronger evidence, that he does not exist.*

No, there really isn't. The only ""evidence"" that he doesn't exist is the lack of evidence for his existence. However, if we're allowing claims such as ""I saw Bigfoot"" to be admitted as evidence, then anyone saying there's a lack of it is wrong. By this standard, the evidence *for* Bigfoot can't help but win out, because the evidence *against* him doesn't exist.

&gt; *Yes, this makes statements like ""I saw bigfoot"" evidence for the existence of bigfoot. However this does not result in one being forced to accept that bigfoot exists.*

But it does force one to accept that the evidence he exists is, as I've described, far stronger. This is why ensuring you have a coherent framework for what constitutes evidence is so important. What you have here is a situation where one can argue a being into existence unless you bar such argumentation as unacceptable.

&gt; *That people have tried to find such things, and failed, is bayesian evidence against the existence of bigfoot, and it is far, far stronger.*

Could you explain how a **lack** of evidence is Bayesian evidence? I'm not sure how a null data set works that way, but I'll admit the Bayesian model for evidence seems rather strange to me.

&gt; *It isn't. There is plenty of evidence that bigfoot does not exist. You listed it your self:*

But what if people just haven't found the spoor, footprints, or bones yet? That's still a lack of evidence, not evidence in and of itself.","1328055067"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","&gt;Tritium is relatively short-lived and penetrates the body weakly through the air compared to other radioactive contaminants. It can cause cell damage if it enters the body, but the amounts released from the Byron station under normal operating conditions and within the steam that's being vented now is not a health concern, said David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

[Trib story](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-byron-nuclear-plant-power-failure-under-investigation-20120131,0,7439598.story)


The reason for the Illinois legislation was not because of tritium from atmospheric steam dump valves.

The cycled condensate systems at nuclear power plants cycle reactor grade water through all sorts of systems and a makeup tank outside the plant. The piping to the tank was designed in a number of plants as underground piping. This piping has been seen, at 3 plants I believe, to corrode and cause reactor grade water to leak into the soil. Reactor grade water is completely purified water which has also been filtered for radioactive materials, but has increased levels of tritium, as it's pretty much the only thing that can't get taken out of water (because tritium is basically hydrogen with a couple extra neutrons and does not look different chemically, so there's no way to remove it). The ComEd plants, which became Exelon plants, did not report that they had known that there were leaks of reactor grade water. Eventually they found out that the stuff was migrating to their on site water monitoring wells in higher concentrations than expected, and in one instance it actually got into a local well of a property which was located right next to the plant. It is total bullshit that it happened and lead to laws like this one and industry initiatives to remove underground piping and increase monitoring and repairs of underground piping. In the case of the property that had water in their well, they were not even using their well (I believe they had plumbing), and the plant purchased their property from them (and actually still uses it for housing temp workers) to compensate them, which isnt perfect but at least an attempt to limit their error. To date there have been no recorded health impacts due to released tritium, however it still needs to be monitored and studied.

Again this is very different from tritium releases from atmospheric releases. The Byron plant declaring tritium in their steam is because there are very small amounts and they are required to notify about these things now. Unfortunately it got all blown up on the news because they enjoy doing that sorta thing.

If you want pure stability in a shield for &lt;5 weight, use the Tower Kite Shield from Andre (seriously), upgraded to +10 at least. Hell, the heater shield has a couple points less stability at max, but weighs almost half as much and doesn't require a slab (+14 and +15 stability are the same).

If you're going to block while meleeing the Kings, use the Crest Shield (+5, hopefully). Most of the damage done by the Kings' attacks (including their swords) inflict magic damage. Try and get the heaviest gear you can with the highest magic defense.

If the first King fires off the giant homing magic, BLOCK IT. I know people are going to tell you shields are stupid for this fight, but just trust me. Their shitty attacks do very little damage through the Crest Shield (even at level 1), and you should be having plenty of time and Estus to heal anyway. Only thing you really have to worry about is dodging their grab and AoE attacks. For the AoE, dodge back at least three times (maybe only twice if you're got the flip ring). For the grab, dodge right (King's left).

Oh and ditch the Lightning Battle Axe too. Change it up to Fire, or use something like a Fire Bastard Sword. OR, take the Battle Axe to +10 and use Charcoal Pine Resin. Or upgrade your Pyro Flame to ascended +5 and use great combustion.","1328055076"

The point of the ""double taxation"" argument is to show that the effective tax rate is much higher than the rate stated in pieces like the Mother Jones article above. That the supposed disparity between wage income tax rate and investment income tax rate does not exist because one must consider the corporate tax rate when calculating the effective tax rate. The different rate on capital gains or dividend income does not in fact enable ""wealthy investors like Warren Buffett to drive their tax rate down to or below the rate at which many middle class families pay"" as the Mother Jones article asserts. This is especially so when one considers that [the average effective federal income tax rate was 12.24% in 2008, and 11.06% in 2009,](http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html) (and 1.85% for the bottom 50%) as an example.

You think being abused is different, but my point is that you *do* advocate getting involved, even if it's not your business. So using the whole 'it's not your business' excuse doesn't really work here. in reality, you think it's okay to get involved, but only if *you* deem it bad enough to get involved. For many people, being cheated on is just as bad.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;First, do you know what happened in 1937? Government stopped spending. GDP fell, employment fell. Does this not show exactly how government spending works? Once it is removed, we go back to the previous status quo except further into debt?

Unless we spend enough to clear private debt to the point where consumer spending can take over on its own. Stimulus is like an engine that needs sufficient ignition ton start.

&gt;And WWII did not get us out of the depression. How could spending billions of dollars on making completely useless (outside of war) goods possibly increase our net worth? What got us out the depression was the fact that the rest of the industrialized world was destroyed and we were relatively unscathed. We had global economic dominance by virtue of everyone else being a heap of rubble.

I've heard that one. [Explain how the *entire world* was in a depression until they started spending massive amounts in WWII](http://www.onwar.com/articles/0302.htm).

And also explain how [Japan recovered after *their* banking crisis](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?&amp;id=JPNRGDPR&amp;scale=Left&amp;range=Custom&amp;cosd=1996-01-01&amp;coed=2005-01-01&amp;line_color=%230000ff&amp;link_values=false&amp;line_style=Solid&amp;mark_type=NONE&amp;mw=4&amp;lw=1&amp;ost=-99999&amp;oet=99999&amp;mma=0&amp;fml=a&amp;fq=Annual&amp;fam=avg&amp;fgst=lin&amp;transformation=pch&amp;vintage_date=2012-01-31&amp;revision_date=2012-01-31).

&gt;Clearly they don't need my goods or services at that time. For whatever reason (most likely government interference) the market dictated that I should be producing product X. It turns out that I should not have been producing product X, but product Y. The solution is not to give consumers free money to buy product X, as that does not help the underlying problem.

What if people don't want product X because they can't afford it? What if they *don't want any other product in its place* because they can't afford it? What if that results in layoffs in the X-producing industry, which reduces demand for Y, which causes layoffs in the Y-producing industry, which causes layoffs in the Z-producing industry, and so on? And what if businesses can't get loans to make product A, B, or C because the banking industry's been hurt? How will that turn out?

&gt;I don't think digging a ditch and filling it back up, or clearing nature trails will pay it back.

It's called the Keynesian multiplier. The ditch diggers and the trail clearers can finally afford product X, or product Y, or product Z, which allows them to employ more people, which creates more demand for product A, B, and C.

&gt;You assume that the private sector could not have come up with those technologies on its own. It may have taken longer, but to assume we wouldn't have them is a logical fallacy. And again, government spending did not get us out of the great depression.

Which is the logical fallacy? That I assumed something? Or that I assumed something that disagrees with you? Why would the private sector invest in something that will cost billions of dollars to develop and have no clear market value? You're making quite an assumption yourself.

On top of that, you say that it would have taken longer. If we had to wait 20 years longer to obtain the personal computer and the internet, how would that have affected our current wealth now? How would that have affected tax revenues?

Economics may not be as rigorous as physics or chemistry, but that does not excuse sloppy theories that do not explain the data. This is not a 100% rigorous science, but it is not philosophy, and it is not religion.","1328055103"

Make it up to Garrafon (I didn't pay to go in, but its worth the view from around it), Playa del Tiburon (do the fish bbq here---a ton of food cooked right in front of you, heaps of salads and while you wait you can swim with sharks for a teeny fee!).

If you're talking about the part where I reference the shooting that occurred, I still stand by the fact that the bullied kid did the right thing. He was about to get ganged up, and thought he was in immediate life threatening danger. In some states (again, I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be most) you are allowed to use DEADLY force if you feel your life is threatened.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Really? Do tell. Tell me which classes have a harder time escaping than Fire Mages.

Freeze moves (CoC and Nova) don't amount to much for Fire because our DoTs break them in 2-3 ticks. This isn't per DoT, this is overall, and Fire Mages are always aiming to have 2-3 DoTs on the target at a time. If they snared you (which they should have), then you don't have enough time to get away if you don't Blink away. If you use Blink as anything except a counter against a melee that hasn't used their gap-closer on you, then you've wasted it. So, you have to slowly move away and have about 2 seconds to do it.

Blazing Speed is a low-chance proc, so it's not at all reliable.

Our immobilizing bubble isn't an escape at all. It sticks you in place and, if your Blink is on cooldown, you're basically screwed unless someone is going to help you. Priests will dispel it or Warrior will break it.

That leaves our our casted stun and our frontal-cone disorienting move as our only reliable escape. However, Dragon's Breath seems to have a less-forgiving frontal cone than CoC does (or possibly farther forward). Whether or not this is true, I find it missing my target a lot more often than CoC does. It's a great move for preemptive strike, but fails often (for me) when used defensively against a melee that's training you.

In order to play Fire Mage successfully, you have to be able to predict your opponent's moves or get the jump on them. If you get charged or stunned, escaping is very unlikely without assistance.","1328055108"

You can then discuss your proof with the panelists. 

I assume by 1st and 2nd law, you mean the real 1st and 2nd law (because there is a 0th law).

Here, just to be sure:

The four principles, or laws, of thermodynamics are:

* The zeroth law of thermodynamics recognizes that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other, thus supporting the notions of temperature and heat.

* The first law of thermodynamics distinguishes between two kinds of physical processes, namely energy transfer as work, and energy transfer as heat. It tells how this shows the existence of a mathematical quantity called the internal energy of a system. The internal energy obeys the principle of conservation of energy but work and heat are not defined as separately conserved quantities. Equivalently, the first law of thermodynamics states that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible.

* The second law of thermodynamics distinguishes between reversible and irreversible physical processes. It tells how this shows the existence of a mathematical quantity called the entropy of a system, and thus it expresses the irreversibility of actual physical processes by the statement that the entropy of an isolated macroscopic system never decreases. Equivalently, perpetual motion machines of the second kind are impossible.

* The third law of thermodynamics concerns the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero temperature, and implies that it is impossible to cool a system to exactly absolute zero, or, equivalently, that perpetual motion machines of the third kind are impossible.","1328055120"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand completely what your trying to say about the rich should be paying more, and that is where we slightly disagree. Imo, the best tax solution would be having a flat sales tax and thats it. That accompanied by some sort of government program that taught people about financing and how to manage their money would solve nearly all the problems in the country today. The reasons being: A flat sales tax would encompass all people, especially the 48% of people who don't pay taxes. (Even though Republicans use this statistic to talk about how its the lower classes who need to be taxed, the 48% also includes the rich people who gain their money from capital gains.) Having a sales tax also takes the difficulty out of paying taxes every year, allowing people to more easily plan their money accordingly. The rich would in turn pay more in taxes as a result, because they would be making most of the big purchases. It would also allow us to get rid of the IRS, saving money, because their would be no reason for that agency. Honestly, the only problem I see with a flat sales tax would be the job losses of the IRS and businesses that help with taxes.

As far as the reason we have debt, the main reason is, hands down, entitlements. This (http://www.concordcoalition.org/learn/budget/federal-budget-pie-charts) is what we spend most of our money on, and it needs to be fixed. I believe as well, we should down size our military a bit and increase the CIA. Information, in many cases, is more important than soldiers. Health care also needs to be fixed, seeing as how its also a too large expenditure, I don't like Obamacare simply because companies cannot compete with government, governement is too big. Considering the government form of insurance will be cheaper than that of any companies, why would you buy anything else? It would only hurt us in the long run. The whole ""republicans were actually worried that we might pay off our debt too soon,"" thats due to the fact that countries are more economically savy if they are in a bit of debt because it lowers the currency value of that country, making products cheaper.

Thats just my take. Also, you assume that I am a republican due to my views. I'm not. I haven't really ever found a politician that I've liked, through and through. I like Regan because he was a leader, he led a country like only a natural born leader could. Didn't agree with Roosevelt, but he was able to admit when he was wrong and change his tactics all for the sake of the American people. I don't like Obama because he doesn't portray what I look for in a leader. He doesn't like to admit when he's wrong, not saying everything thats happened during his presidency is his fault, but he needs to take some blame. I don't like that he takes many vacations, might not cost a lot, but the country is ailing, show a little consideration. The thing I dislike most about him is the fact that he hasn't followed with a lot of what hes promised during his campaign trail. He was still talking about raising the taxes on the rich in his State of the Union address this year. I'm not saying hes been the worst, but he hasn't impressed me.","1328055122"

You're not wearing the same suits I'm wearing.  Of course they're not comfortable.  They're vaguely military in origin, and cut narrow.  They're really open in the front, with the button waaaayy down by the waist (another thing you complained about).  It's got high arm holes that make the shoulders stiff and cut your range of motion.

The standard American suit, in contrast, was called the ""sack suit"" originally.  They fit loose.  They button up higher.  They often have more buttons, too.  They have natural, unpadded shoulders.  They have wider, lower arm holes to keep range of motion.  In short, they sound like a solution to most of your gripes.

That being said, she was not microchipped, had no collar, was covered in fleas, and barely weighed 6 lbs. Had there been some way of finding/contacting the owners we would have, but there were no posters around and the vet/shelter didn't have anything either... so we kept her. 

I figure one of two things happened

1) The cat was lost (for a long-ass time, she was thin as hell...)

2) The cat's previous owner was abusive/irresponsible. 

With the temperature dropping considerably I don't think she would have made it another week. No matter what her circumstances were -- she's a lot better off than she was.

This is not good design, and my success or failure should not depend on whether or not Shoot First and Back Blast crit. My sustained DPS should have been buffed to compensate, and the fact that BioWare completely ignored any suggestions from the Scoundrel/Operative community (while bending over backwards to please the unshielded, healer sages/sorcs that we kill) makes me think that BioWare doesn't care about my class.","1328055135"

Problems with these microstock is alot of people see them as a way to get images for free.  We all hear of stories on reddit, my photo got used by xxxx site what do i do.  You cant do jack.  You dont have an agency supporting you.  And istock isnt going to care.

I do agree that microstock is a needed avenue, although many photographers need other avenues to increase their sales.  Im into Landscapes, i have tens of thousands of pictures of Australia covering over 100,000kms.  I go to places you dont go, wont go, or arent physically able to go.

"BurningMan","t5_2qj68","Dont know if anyone will care about this, but my gf asked me why tier III going first is better for the people in the lower tiers.

Say 25,000 entered at each level, 75,000 total. That’s a random guess

in the Tier 3 first lottery:

$390 – 25,000 enter = 15,000  get tickets 10,000 move on to next round. probability of winning tickets is 15/25 =60%
$320 – 25,000 enter +10,000 who didn’t get tickets previous = 15,000  get tickets 20,00 move on to next round . Probability of winning is 15/35 = 43%
$240 -  25,000 enter +20,000 who didn’t get tickets previous = 10,000 get tickets 35,000 don’t get at all. probability would be 10/45 = 22%

If Tier 1 was drawn first:


$240 -  75,000 entered = 10,000 who get tickets 50,000 move on and 15,000 dont get tickets. People in this tier would have a (10/75=)13% chance  
$320 -  50,000 entered = 15,000 who get tickets 25,000 move on and 10,000 don't get tickets. People in this tier would have a (15/50=)30% chance  
$390 -  25,000 entered = 15,000 who get tickets 10,000 dont get. People in this tier's chances would be 15/25=60% 


feel free to mess around with the numbers

p.s. this basically says what we all already knew. By drawing the top tier first you dont hurt those peopl's chances, but do help the everyone get tickets at the level they registered for.","1328055138"

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","Right - but... *why* is the city car-friendly?  Obviously some people want it that way. 

Saying that if the city were not car friendly then people wouldn't live out of the city, approaches tautology. The interesting bit is, *why is it the way it is?*  

Some people suggest it is clever marketing by Ford and GM that created the roads and infrastructure that allowed people to move out. The idea suggests that people are really not being rational when they move out to the burbs. Instead, they've been duped. I don't agree with this.

I think people like to live away from the crowds. They like to live in a place where there is order and calm, and there is an absence of commerce. (the proverbial ""bedroom community""). The city cannot be that place. The ultimate embodiment of this ideal is a remote village where nothing big ever happens, but there are no jobs in such places. So people compromise, and decide to live in the burbs.  And they convince the powers that be to provide infrastructure that allows them to work in the bustling city.

&gt; If the barrier was increased, 

Yes, but who would increase it?  The people obviously don't want that. They don't want barriers.  People don't want to be controlled. 

There is something that pushes people OUT of the city. The noise, trash, crime, crowds,  disorder, or some combination (I'm guessing. Really I'm just projecting my own preferences on the entire world). It's no good forcing people to live in a place. A better approach is to attract the people to live there. Find out what makes them run away, and fix it.  Fix the crime, fix the noise, or whatever it is. 

150 years ago, cities didn't have electric advertisements operating 24 hours a day.  Cities had gaslights and when dusk came, things quieted down.  By my way of thinking, it turns out that the city of 1850 fit the humans.  But when we turned cities into commercial centers that never stopped, we created a sort of deranged place to live.  Who wants to live where you need bars on your windows, and there's trash on your front stoop,  three mornings out of seven?

I am no expert, though. This is just my opinion. ","1328055139"

No, you fool, I said *you* are trying to just make yourself feel superior, by saying *both* groups are wrong.

You are intentionally reading my comments wrong, and are being willfully ignorant.

You literally cannot be neither of the two things. Like I said, that's like saying ""I am just as much a basketball as I am not a basketball""
You can't both BE and NOT be a basketball...you either are or you aren't.

I didn't say it means ""nothing"" on it's own...I said it means ""without knowledge"" on its own. You can be agnostic about anything at all...it's a synonym to ignorant (which means having no knowledge on a subject)

To be agnostic is to be without ""KNOWLEDGE"" of something.

So...an agnostic atheist would be someone who is WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE of a god existing, but DOES NOT believe in it anyway.

a agnostic theist would be someone who is WIHOUT knowledge, but DOES believe in one anyway.

Since you are without knowledge of a god (as all people are...whether or not you believe that knowledge is attainable is completely irrelevant) that makes you agnostic...with me so far?

Since you clearly lack the belief in any gods that therefore makes you ALSO an atheist.

So...your title is ""agnostic atheist""

To *just* be agnostic is incomplete..agnostic about what? tomatoes?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That letter is way, way, way to much. It sounds like you ran it through a bad legal jargon text converter and didn't proofread. I would start with the following: Clean up, dress in business attire, and visit the leasing office. Put on your slightly embarrassed for your crazy downstairs neighbor face. Tell the leasing office manager that your downstairs neighbor is a nice lady, but ""she's a little... different"", and seems to be very noise sensitive. Tell them that she has been complaining at the noise when you walk upstairs (and you try to do so quietly), when you walk from one room of your house another, play your music at a low volume, cook, and other routine activities. Tell them that you are starting to feel uncomfortable in your own house, because even though you are tiptoeing around, your neighbor continues to beat on the ceiling and verbally harass and threaten you.

The key here is to sound like a very nice and reasonable person who is being abused, and while sounding very nice and reasonable, imply that your neighbor is clinically insane and the spawn of evil, while not rambling or *saying* anything bad about her. If they ask you to write out a complaint, just write out what is going on, as explained above. No fake overly wordy legal jargon that makes you sound silly.","1328055145"

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I'm in rail; dealing almost entirely with passenger vehicles and recently the new Positive Train Control regulation.

Good things:
1) It's a very stable industry if you are an engineer. There's few engineers, and it's not a job that can be easily automated.
2) Most of the technology isn't cutting edge, but there's some interesting work being done to automate as many jobs as possible.

Down side:
1) The majority of the industry is based on technology that's older than your great-grandfather... and people like it that way because it makes decisions easy. Trying to do anything different is an uphill battle.
2) Most of the industry is retiring and, due to trying to be lean, there aren't enough younger people that have been involved enough to know WHY things haven't changed in a hundred years.
3) The government regulations mostly go back to steam locomotives. Many of them don't apply anymore, but they still get enforced.","1328055147"

"EnoughPaulSpam","t5_2sir4","&gt; It's not unconstitutional to repeal or amend an amendment.

That's the point. Even the framers of the Constitution weren't ""strict constitutionalists."" You can't *be* a ""strict constitutionalist"" if you want to change the Constitution. That would be like saying you're a fundamentalist Christian and then rattling off a list of ways the Bible could be improved.

If you want to change the Constitution, then the idea of being a ""strict constitutionalist"" is meaningless. Paul isn't a strict adherent to the Constitution, he's a strict adherent to *what he believes the Constitution should be.*

There's nothing inherently wrong with that (in fact, it's a much more reasonable position than genuine strict constitutionalism). But anyone could support a constitution that has been tailored to his belief system -- even a living constitutionalist or (gasp!) a statist. It doesn't make Ron Paul special, all it means is that he (perhaps unintentionally) uses misleading language to imply that he respects the Constitution *more* than other people do. In reality, he respects the Constitution in the same way most of us do: there are parts of it he likes and parts he dislikes.

&gt; ... he is one of the largest advocates for 4th and 5th Amendment rights, and especially that of the 1st that I know of. Prove me wrong.

On a federal level, perhaps. But another part of Paul's hallowed Constitution that he wants to get rid of is the ""incorporation clause"" of the 14th Amendment, which requires states to grant their citizens constitutional rights. On numerous occasions, Ron Paul has supported bills that undermine both civil liberties and constitutional rights *on a state level.*

But if your idea of supporting the 1st Amendment is supporting the right to free speech in federal parks and pretty much nowhere else, then yes, Ron Paul supports the 1st Amendment.","1328055161"

No, this is what Christian mind programming does to you.  When hypocrites are shown that they are hypocrites, they either feel shame or just double down.  The Christian mind programming really compels their victims to double down, which is what you are doing.  It appears to be actually quite expected behavior.","1328055162"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""Blood may be thicker than water, but what the fuck does that have to do with the price of eggs in China?"" ~ My response to my uncle who said I should have more of a relationship with my dad's family shortly after the death of my great grandmother. Quick backstory: Jim and Pam, my dad's baby brother and wife, had a baby with encephaly. Danny, my dad's other brother got drunk and called my mom to tell her not to invite his ex-wife to the funeral. My mom, rightly, told him to fuck off and sober up.

My dad's mother, Danny, his sister and her family (including the uncle I was talking to), his grandma (the one who recently died in the above paragraph) proceeded to have separate family functions, Christmases, never sent a card or gift, or saw us for years until my dad buried the hatchet shortly before his grandma died. 

To this day I have little use, though his mom visits us from time to time (I live with my kids in a house with my sister's family and my parents).

"gamernews","t5_2sc3f","PSx launched with the first real time 3d graphics in the console market as I recall. A huge marketing campaign, and a fairly neutral position in the market(compared to Xbox launching during the height of people disliking MS as a company). Launch time is definitely a factor. I just don't think it was as important as other factors in these cases.

To me MS's most brilliant and important move (though not the most innovative, as everyone had online before xbox launched --sony and Sega both did it previously) was to position Xbox live as a social platform. Friends play games with friends and they play with friends on the same platform. Halo was the other huge pawn there to cement that.

Sony's online strategy before that was that the developers could control the online per game(publishers and devs liked this and why EA signed exclusively with SONY). Gamer's preferred Xboxlive (same thing with steam). Took a long time for sony to play catch-up.
I think we all recognize that when you launch is important. You don't need to be first, but you need to hit the market at a sweet spot(with a huge number of factors), where you either blow the competition away, or you are in position to migrate you users to the next generation (apple). 

MS sacrificed a lot to go first, because for them it was important,a nd they thought that was the main reason Sony was number 1.  That sacrifice might hurt them in the next gen, but from where they were coming from it was an all or nothing gamble, and only they could afford the risk and the sacrifices for that risk. Nintendo wisely, or luckily suspected all this and went an entirely different direction. Not sure what they are going to do now though. The Wii-U launching first I doubt will do much for them as again the rules and situation has changed.","1328055169"

Also, most bartenders will talk your ear off if you ask their opinion on beers if they aren't busy, it's their job to know all about what their selling and if they like what they do, they'll surely let you know their opinions.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The same thing happened to me.  When i was 6 or so a pregnant cat gave birth to kittens in my garage.  It was a very stormy night. We made her a box with some towels so she would have somewhere nice to give birth.  In the morning she and her kittens were nowhere to be found.  Fast forward a few years and I see her walking in our backyard(she appeared to be stray as she was very scared of people), so i gave her a can of tuna, and she started to stick around.  She even started coming in the house for brief moments to eat and then would immediately want to leave.  After a while she started to sleep in the house on very cold nights.  A few years go by and a woman walking down the street notices the cat and strikes up a conversation with me.  She explains that she was the original owner of the cat, and about how her kittens drove her away. She was happy that someone has started feeding her and taking care of her.  As she aged she started to warm up to us, even coming and sleeping on my fathers stomach or just curling up next to my leg as i watched TV.  A Sunday morning in 2007, I woke and went outside to find her lying in her favorite spot on our sunny driveway.  Her eyes were wide open, a puddle of saliva had accumulated below her mouth, and she was stiff as a board.  I buried her in my garden, where she loved to sleep on top of the strawberry plants.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Say you have future knowledge of a person. You know that he will murder 300 people if you don’t stop him. You also have the future knowledge that nothing else would work to stop him but to kill him 3 weeks before the acts would occur. Do you consider this self-defense, even though you aren’t one going to be one of the victims? Is this you stepping in to help someone, even though it is 3 weeks before the event? Such an absurd situation is, while highly implausible, not impossible to conceive. Therefore, how can murder be “simply” wrong? For a further used example, if you could go back in time and murder hitler, would you? Many would say yes and believe it to be an absolutely moral act.

If you want to argue murder is wrong, justify this belief with logic. Don’t stoop to religious thinking. “The earth is simply the center of the universe.” We’ve move past such one-sided, non-logical thinking.","1328055176"

I heard that my father use to physically assault my mum when she was pregnant with myself. He had done this before hand and was on-going, but apparently the latter was where the line was drawn and she moved away.

When my sister turned 18 he tried to get in contact with her to meet up with her. After all the stories i'd heard about the man, I can only imagine why he was contacting an 18 year old girl who he hadn't had the slightest interest in contacting before hand. She ended up meeting him and after everything he had put the family through, she claimed he was a nice man. I've never forgiven her for that remark either.
I found that situation strange anyway, mainly because if he wanted contact with his children, then why not put effort in before one of them turned 18, considering that he never contacted me to finally meet him. Just aswell really.

And also it really only worked consistently with longbows at maximum range because their arrows would arc.  

As Vanto said above you will won't use a short range quick firing bow for pvp.  Even if you did want to use longbows, there were spells like Read the Wind or Quickening Zephyr that made your arrows fly straight and fast and be pretty much undodgeable.

ANet is very good at balancing things like this and it really does add some depth to the gameplay for both the ranger and the target, so I wouldn't worry.

""Some experts estimate that as many as 1 in every 1,500 babies is born with genitals that cannot easily be classified as male or female.""

http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/intersex.aspx#

Including:

""Vaginal agenesis, in which female infants are born without a vagina""

""Penile agenesis, in which male infants are born without a penis"" 

""Complete androgen insensitivity, in which cells do not respond at all to testosterone and related hormones, causing female-appearing genitals in infants with male chromosomes ""

Males, born with FEMALE-APPEARING GENITALS.

1:1,500. That means there are 6,000,000 people who are born intersex.

Again not only do people who are male but have female genitals exist, they are quite common.

XY is NOT necessary for being a woman.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex

""Intersex, in humans and other animals, is the presence of intermediate or atypical combinations of physical features that usually distinguish female from male. This is usually understood to be congenital, involving chromosomal, morphologic, genital and/or gonadal anomalies, such as diversion from typical XX-female or XY-male presentations, e.g., sex reversal (XY-female, XX-male), genital ambiguity, or sex developmental differences. An intersex individual may have biological characteristics of both the male and the female sexes.""

And further:

""according to researcher Eric Vilain at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""the biology of gender is far more complicated than XX or XY chromosomes"". Many different criteria have been proposed, and there is little consensus.""

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Are you asking are any social/behavioral traits inherited genetically?  And in reference to humans or nonhumans?  The fields of ethology (animal behavior, especially regarding instinct) and behavioral ecology largely deal with inherited behavior and their adaptive benefits.  Behaviors are either innate (instinctual), or learned.  Innate behaviors are genetic (i.e. heritable) although they may be influenced by the environment and social interactions. Some simple innate behaviors are controlled by a single gene, while more complex innate behaviors may result from the combined action of many genes and ""sub-routines"" that are triggered by a certain stimulus.

But from a totally nongenetic view, in humans many social traits are often passed down vertically (from parent to offspring) for at least one generation. The language, religion, and social status of an individual are often very strongly correlated to his or her parents, but these social traits may not last more than one generation (e.g. if the offspring moves to another country, marries a different language speaker, changes religion, etc.).  This is not genetic evolution because the traits are entirely environmental in origin (the parents are the environment of the infant), and there are no clear adaptive differences for different cultures (e.g. English isn't naturally better at communicating than Spanish).","1328055206"

For some security, such as normal x-ray scanners, that's true. But despite massive government propaganda, [it's not always true](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2010/11/new-poll-says-61-oppose-new-airport-security-measures.html). I couldn't find data on this, but I'd be surprised if most people don't also oppose things like bans on water bottles, nail clippers, taking off your shoes, etc.

&gt; The Free Market isn't some magical means of injecting common sense into the world; it follows the capricious, paranoid whims of whoever has money. In this case, those who have the money in question are rich, fearful old white people. I'm saying that to meet the demand of such a lucrative market, private security firms would push the security theatre as far as it would go. I'm saying that if you think the TSA now is overwrought bullshit, you haven't seen nothing yet. 

Who are these people clamoring for more security at airports? Where are they?

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","You were looking at Resident Evil the deck building game so I thought I would give you some impressions of it.

I have played the game in the explore house mode 4 times, and in the mercenaries mode 10+ times.

In the explore mode everyone starts with the same starting deck and you build up enough attack to try to explore the house, if you get lucky you will get a monster you can kill (at the beginning probably 10-15 strength).  If unlucky the monster you draw will be too difficult and you will take damage.  I find this large amount of randomness unfun.  Even worse the big and powerful monsters have the most debilitating downsides for losing.  You may get totally crushed by just flipping a few bad monsters.  The winner in explore mode is the one to kill the toughest monster in the deck.

In mercenaries you draw a character and get a custom deck built for that character.  This gets you off to a good start as you can start fighting on your first turn usually.   Also the very largest monsters are removed from the deck.  Although there are still some big ones out there.  In mercenaries your goal is to kill a lot of guys in a row without stopping to get a large combo bonus.  I like this mode a lot more, but there is serious huge character imbalance.  Some characters like Wesker have abilities that don't work well in Mercenary modes, and even worse Wesker has a terrible starting deck.   The value of cards that go into the starting decks is not even, and if you get the one that starts with a sniper rifle you can easily keep your starting deck and build a big combo without ever adding a card.  If the starting decks and characters were more balanced, this mode would be great.  As printed it is flawed.

Eventually we just shelved the game and we play other stuff.  Almost our whole group has played the resident evil games and some of the cards are pretty funny.   The theme of the game wasn't able to save the random and unbalanced gameplay.","1328055224"

CS120 with Madden is a much more interesting course intellectually, IMO. You really learn how computers work and do some good exercises with it, he's also a pretty good professor.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; Where is the data that would demonstrate that such a move would in fact have a significant impact on the national debt?

Brazil states that they will save $120mil/year.   I could care less about the savings and care more about the security, stability, and ability to deal with issues efficiently that open source provides.  Its a pain in the ass dealing with vendors of proprietary software because they typically have small support staffs for each component of their system and bugs get dealt with slowly.

&gt; I am guessing that any money saved in purchases would be 100% ( and probably more) offset in new development costs and support/training for the hundreds of thousands of users who wouldn't have a clue how to use anything other than windows!

In many jobs people use applications instead of interacting with the OS.  For large organizations many of those applications are developed in house.

The basic paradigm for interacting with the OS for both Mac and Windows are implemented for linux so that learning curve that you speak of is nonexistent.  I know that this is anectodotal but I have installed Mint for 5 different non-tech windows users and they have been very happy with it.

Shockingly, the ""legitimate"" parts of our federal spending only amount to around $300 billion every year, and pushes our deficit up to around $1.8 trillion.

It is no big surprise that Hellboy and Weaver ended up as big xFip over achievers.  Hellboy should regress more than Weaver though b/c his Babip was so low .224 that the regression back to .275ish (giving him some benefit of the doubt and adjusting for defense rather than going back to league average around .300) is going to hurt more than Weaver's from .252.  Additionally Hellboy strikes out a lot less guys over 2 per inning less (though I would predict an increase in his k rate this year) and Weaver has shown the ability to k over 1 an inning and may make up for his Babip regressions with 2010 type k numbers.

(Sorry if it's a bit long-ish) I am still a bit well known for kicking ass, just from the two times I had to do it in my eighth grade year. The first time, I was in PE and we were having a free day, and I chose to jog the track. I was on the final lap of my second mile, when the stereotypical black chick with all fat white friends decided to WALK the opposite direction that I was, and with her friends, take up all eight lanes. (It was a red clay track.) I politely asked her from a short distance away to clear my lane, but instead, she and all of her cronies crowded into it, preventing me from continuing. She got in my face, telling me to move aside, and then tried to shove me back with her arms folded across her chest. So I got tired of it, crossed my arms, and twisted, throwing her off balance. She landed ass-first in the nasty damp red clay. As I continued around, I told my gym coach to keep an eye on her. I ended up meeting her again on the other end of the track, and she was VERY pissed. She started to get in my face again, but the Coach saw, and called her over. She got suspended because he heard her threaten to kick my teeth through my skull. ","1328055237"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","When you register a new account you can only post every 9 minutes until you've posted quite a few times at that sub-reddit.  Furthermore it takes extra time to move between accounts once you get banned on your main, and when a user trolls in more than one sub-reddit, not just r/MR, then it is quite inconvenient to switch to a new account just to view and troll r/MR.  It would only take a few minutes a day for the moderators to ban obvious trolls, and it would be effective.

If you remove the ability of a user to conveniently come to r/MR and troll, you also remove their ability to conveniently come here to down-vote UNLESS they are willing to keep quiet and not troll.  So if you make the very simple effort to take a few minutes a day to ban obvious pro-misandry trolls who are primarily here to derail the conversation and down-vote, you will quite quickly cause the vast majority of such trolls to stop coming here, to stop trolling, and to stop down-voting good threads.

Here's an easy first step: Ban every admin at SRS and their alternate admin account at SRS.  Ban every prominent SRS poster who posted in this thread.  This would take five minutes.  It is, of course, likely that SRS will retaliate in the short term, but that's the price we'll have to pay.  We can rely on down-votes and 5 minutes a day from the moderators and within two weeks they would give up.  It would be a necessary market correction.","1328055240"

"funny","t5_2qh33","start reading the daily dish now.  its a blog hosted by andrew sullivan, a british, conservative, gay (Blah blah blah) anyways he's incredibly intelligent and always has these nice little couple of paragraphs discussions about being catholic in this day and age.  also hes smokes pot.  he wrote this about magic mushrooms today:

 If you believe, as I do, that we are at root children of God, trapped, as Pascal put it, between being angels and beasts, then there will be moments in our lives when we are closer to being angels and closer to being beasts. In my view, our beastliness, as it were, is a function of our contingency as evolving primates, having to tackle a terrifying world of death, disease, war, hatred, and fear with intelligence and self-control and self-defense. This is the world of the first half of Hobbes' Leviathan.

But we are also more than that, as Jesus taught us. We are children of God. Our alienation is because something deep within us yearns to come home, a home we do not remember, but we know exists. What psilocybin seems to do is remove the veil from seeing and accepting this wondrous, difficult truth. It does not add something to our consciousness that isn't already there. It simply calms the noise around it so we can hear what is already within us. Hence the parallels between brains in deep meditation and brains on psilocybin.

Of course, we need the veil to survive in our physical, practical lives. As Huxley notes above, we couldn't walk across the street without it. If we were always aware of the staggering beauty of Creation and the overwhelming force of God's love for us, we would be like Jesus - homeless, jobless, possession-less, beyond family or tribe. And that is where the saints are and where we are lucky occasionally, by grace, to find ourselves. Mystics have sometimes strained against their physical limits to see the truth. Jesus starved and meditated for 40 days in the desert. Others, like Julian of Norwich or St Teresa of Avila, had experiences of such intensity they live on in our consciousness even now.

To glimpse this even once - by chemical ingestion - opens up the truth as to who and what we are. It is not a substitute for living that truth, or searching for it every day, or prayer, or the sacraments, or caritas. But it is a sacramental glimpse. And however far into the darkening forest you walk, you never forget the mountaintop.
Or the view, which is eternity. Now.

Did the photos get leaked at random; implying unknown hacker happened to trawl into your shit, or in such a way as to cause maximum damage? For instance sending porn to your mom, ect; implying personal vandetta?

Where do you store your pics?

I would say it is unlikely someone actually hacked anything. More often than not, someone just pulled them off your device when you plugged it into something you should have.

I think this part could be interpreted as meaning that you should either be a panelist or have citations.

&gt;You don't need to be a panelist or a scientist to answer. You should have a source. We have a number of non-panelist scientists and non-panelists who answer questions correctly on top of the panelists, and we value their presence. Now, for the panelists, we've provided tags that are discussed further in the next section. When in their field, panelists' source may just be the classes they've taken or the research they've done. If that seems insufficient to you, you are certainly free to ask for more, but they may not have a source handy, so please be civil about this. The panelist tag also tells you when they're speaking out of their field. If you see a purple tag (physics) speaking in an evolution thread, you should be aware that they're not speaking from a position of specialist knowledge. They may be familiar with the science, but they aren't experts in this topic.


&gt;I believe that the response from puf_almighty with the condescending, belittling attitude was completely unnecessary

It was a bit rude, but it's borne out of frustration. Wrong ideas are so easily spread, this should be the one subreddit where it doesn't happen.

"coins","t5_2qhuq","Those look pretty nice, from what I can see of them.

Technically those would be medallions, medals, or rounds instead of coins, since they weren't issued by a government as legal tender - but that's not what you were asking.

There were a number of these types of things issued by private companies over the years as commemoratives of various milestones of the space program. For the most part they are known as manufactured collectibles, like modern baseball cards or Hummel figurines - which have little or no intrinsic value but a lot of hype surrounding them. The medals at least have their metal content.

Is there any writing around the edges of your medallions? Sometimes the Franklin Mint does that, and maybe other companies too. I think that most of the Franklin Mint's silver medallions are sterling silver (.925) rather than fine silver (.999).

You can Google space coins or space commemoratives, or check eBay to learn more about the specific pieces issued. People try to sell them for much more than their metal content, but a lot of buyers don't want to pay anything over melt value.

Here are a couple of sites that sell ones similar to yours, but don't expect to get what they are asking if you try to sell yours.

However, it's just stupid to actually address a point of debate in an argument not with a reasoned response but with an ad hominem attack.

""Posing your incredulity in the form of a question doesn't do much as a rebuttal to my rebuttal."" That is not ad hominem. I am attacking the logic of your ""argument"" being simply an expression of your incredulity in the form of a question. 

That's an attack on the logic of your response, not on you.

Again. your list of promises he has broken ignores actual reality.

The one you highlighted  with a video link is especially ironic, and actually highlights the whole point of why I wrote this.

A lot of people are throwing around that talking point and then actually linking to videos that disprove it. It simply shows an epic failure to actually discern the specific content of words.

Similair to how people misunderstand the finer points of the NDAA issue. 

Obama DID NOT PROMISE TO TAKE HOME TROOPS IMMEDIATELY. He said ""you can take it to the bank"" that he would meet with the joint chiefs of staff and develop a PLAN to do so. 

As for the other promises you mentioned, those are things that are on his desk as tasks that have yet to be checked off. But again, people somehow think that he should just immediately enact everything he has set out to enact, as if he has the power to do that.

He can't just DO any of that. He has to draft the policies and then try to convince congress and the american people to enact it. 

He DID put more troops in Afghanistan. 

He did not increase raids and actually put an executive order out to STOP raids. 

What he can't stop, is the justice department doing things they have congressional authority to do, such as finding ways to prosecute marijuana distributors for being too close to federal parks, using the IRS etc.. As long as he's working within the framework of the constitution he can't do anything about that. 

As for Solyndra, that's just an obvious risk you take when you invest money. Some businesses will fail. No one can predict the exact future winners in the clean energy game. The idea is to invest money in jumpstarting a wide variety of american companies because if we don't, the chinese will, and then THEY will reap the economic benefits of owning the technology for clean energy.

It's a small point, but I would like to point out that Jews *are* forbidden to work from an hour and a half before sundown on Friday (which can actually be pretty early some times of the year) until nightfall Saturday. Sure, there may be people who are jerks and try to feign observance just to skip work, but there definitely *are* people who legitimately cannot work during those hours and will turn down any job that would force them to.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Well, there's no real science that says Christianity can not accept evolution. It's similar to the Big-Bang theory in that the chruch accepts both. The Catholic Church accepts both theories. Several other groups of christians don't, but what can you do?

The Pope says that God was the original spark for -and the driving force of- evolution. I don't share this view, but this sounds like what you're going for.

If you don't believe the pope is the Vicar of Christ, or you have a problem with God of the Gaps, I can't really help you. If you want to stop reading here, that's fine. 

The evolutionary model is hardly linear, however.

you could have any number of mutations occuring at the same time.
using the same setup...

[Original creature] + (Change, where different numbers = diff changes) = [resultant creature]

2+ (1) = 3

2+ (2) = 4

2+ (3) = 5

2+ (4) = 6

from there, lets say, the change (3) didn't work in the creature's favour. In fact, it made it more likely to be predated on, so it is wiped out.

In addition, (2) was a benign mutation. It was neither beneficial nor negative.

from there we have

2 + (1) = 3

2 + (2) = 4*

2 + (3) = ~~5~~

2 + (4) = 6

This could continue on. Say, 6 has another series of small changes, not all of which are successful.

6 + (5) = 11

6 + (6) = ~~12~~

6 + (7) = 13

6 + (8) = ~~14~~

Then 11 and 13 would go on to mutate further. At some point, the changes would be so drastic that a descendent of 6 would look almost nothing like a descendant of say, 3. It might even look something like [this.](http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-fossils/species/human-family-tree)

There is in fact a physical point where a creature could in theory not become 'more red', or 'more poisonous'. That's the asymtote you're thinking of.

And this is why I don't call people stupid. Sometimes they're ignorant (Lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about something in particular: ""ignorant of astronomy"".) By this definition, I would say I'm ignorant of the apparent truth of Christianity. If I could be given knowledge, information, or awareness that was acceptable, I'd be a Christian too.

Thanks for your time.

(Copying for TL;DR)
The Pope says that God was the original spark for -and the driving force of- evolution. to get my opinion, you'll have to read the whole thing. Sorry

That is what has happened. The idea of government isn't inherently evil because it is only a reflection of collective will. When the people do not claim their power, either by their own choice, or by lack of knowing through manipulation, we get this run away situation. We get a racket of war, stealing from others, greed, etc. Of course it doesn't have the moral right to do these things, but we all willingly abide by it, perhaps out of fear.

&gt;I don't have the same opportunity, they all have more money than I do, and that affords them greater opportunity.

You're right, they do have a greater opportunity.  I'm trying to argue against the original point that it would be completely unacceptable to place art in the places where you'd normally find advertising.  I don't think the owners of the space have any particular bias towards advertising or against art, they just want to get paid.  If an artist were willing to pay more than an advertising agency, I'm sure they'd sell him the space.  As you pointed out, the advertisers tend to have more money, so they can afford to buy most of the space.  And it's not just that they have more money to begin with; the billboards presumably make them more money.  If artists can figure out a way to generate money from putting their art on billboards, I'm sure they'll start doing it.","1328055261"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Having bought Battlefield 3 on Origin when it was on sale for the holidays I can say it really isn't that bad. It runs in the background like Steam. Unlike Steam it wont pop up ""News"" and is fairly minimal performance wise. You can still put a desktop shortcut to the game you want it opens the Origin window and runs the game, just like Steam.

My only beef is the way it manages it's programs. It downloads and installs the game from the client just fine. To remove a game it opens up ""Program and Features"" from the control panel and then you have to go through and find and remove the game yourself. This in my opinion is inexcusable. If you can install from there you should be able to uninstall it from Origin. Hopefully this will be fixed. Another thing that is annoying is if you get a demo or beta it never goes away on your game menu. For example my origin homepage still shows BF3 beta when the game files have been removed and BF3 full version has been installed. I have yet to find a way to remove it. They did just release a patch last night. (or sometime earlier) I have yet to try it but we will see if some of these issues are fixed.

I am going to wait for ME3 to come down in price like I did for BF3. I got it half off when it was on sale for black Friday. This is where Origin only is really unfortunate. They don't do sales as often and the games are ""overpriced"" for some older games that would sell on Steam for 10 bucks or less Origin is charging 20.

Activation if you purchase online is instant just like it is on Steam. At least it was when I bought my copy of BF3. For retail sales there **might** be some delay but only if you buy it on opening night at midnight. However I cannot answer that for curtain. If you can wait until the weekend after it releases you will probably be able to get a retail copy activated instantly.

The hassle for people is that it is another Distribution system that they have to install and run in the background. People made the same fuss about Games for Windows. 

If you want access to the steam overlay then you can tie the exe to your Steam library just like any other non-Steam games. Then you should be able to hit shift tab and open the Steam overlay just like any other Steam game. I have heard this works but I have yet to attempt it. I just assumed it would because it works on games like MineCraft.

It is tolerable and going through growing pains just like Steam did. Nobody liked Steam when it released with CS 1.6 and when it was mandatory for HL2 but we dealt with it and now people are attached at the hip to it. These are the same tactics Steam pulled when they released. The problem was is we weren't vested (some people thousands of dollars vested) into another digital distribution platform. If Origin had released 7 years before Steam I imagine that we would be making the same beef about Steam coming into the ring.","1328055263"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well clearly you're using a definition of nerd that most other people aren't really using here, so obviously if you choose to define the word in such a strange manner, indeed there will be no correlation to IQ tests. 

If we use your definition, then nearly everyone will be defined as a nerd, hence making the word completely useless as a descriptor in itself. I might use the term ""car nerd"" to describe someone who has a great interest in cars, but I don't really think they fit the traditional definition of the word nerd, I just use it with the contextual qualifier to imply that they know a lot about cars.

You're using the term far far too loosely. If we actually let everyone who was a nerd about anything be called a nerd, we simply would have too many nerds to derive any correlation with anything at all.

Also, knowledge is separate from intelligence. Also, excluding handyman/everyday knowledge from the discussion, I can pretty much guarantee you that there is in fact a correlation between IQ test scores and knowledge of botany or knowledge of the history of art.

But again to make the point clear, knowledge is not intelligence. Some of my friends aren't smart but are great at soccer. This has nothing to do with intelligence, but is impressive nonetheless. Not everything has to be ""intelligence"" to be a positive factor. Very little of what you listed has much to do with intelligence. While the autistic child you know might indeed have a large working knowledge of Star Trek, concluding from that that he is intelligent would be quite odd.","1328055272"

Couldn't have said it better myself.

Now, I'm not sure the exact mechanisms by which the neilson boxes work, but if I were you I would:

* Watch Fringe live
* DVR it, and DVR any repeats
* Log in to Neilson as *each* individual person in your household and play the heck out of fringe (in idle time, with the tv off, etc.)
* Amass multiple episodes
* Rinse and repeat

I'm pretty sure shows get credit for 3 factors - 

1. Live viewing
2. Same Day DVR viewing
3. DVR viewing within 7 days

Although it will be a small bump for just one household, the repeat viewings *should* add to the ratings!

We also used to play this game when we were fucking around where the GM would say ""Roll a 100 right now and you get a random magic item"", at random times.

We also tried once do have a campaign where everyone rolled d20s for stats, straight up. I'll never forget my friend's cleric, with a 20 WIS and literally a 1 CON. We had to carry him around in a [palanquin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter_(vehicle) because he was so frail. 

That being said, you don't have to play it OP. I mean, a wizard with 17 strength still wouldn't be that great at melee, just not completely inept and he can carry more (which is a treat).

I've spent the last year not trying to get laid because my doctor told me I'd have to get circumcised, and then it occurred to me to do my research, and after about two weeks I seem to be making excellent progress.

Also, there seem to be multiple treatments considerably less drastic which deal with the problem if stretching doesn't work.  Most sites recommend trying stretching first though.  From the above wikipedia article:

&gt;Common treatments include steroid creams, preputioplasty, manual stretching, and circumcision.[11]

Ah yes, the ""Bush was just a puppet"" argument. Only Bush was quite fierce behind closed doors, locking Colin Powell out of meetings (for being late), calling Rove ""turd blossom"", and exerting influence in other ways. Other Republicans certainly wanted him to go in that direction, but Bush was the President, and he wasn't the limp dick that most people think.

It doesn't work that way. As N increases, 2^N algorithms quickly become impossible to run, given any form of finite power. And if you do barely have enough power, just adding one more photon to the world will require doubling the power of your entire simulation supercomputer to accommodate it. That's how bad it is.

It's hard to describe just how brutally difficult it is to deal with exponential numbers, especially when our common sense fails us, but try reading this:

The only way to run it in reasonable amounts of time is to have either infinite space (i.e. memory) or infinite power or infinite time or conduct approximations.

"funny","t5_2qh33","His fist thudded against my door with the fury of an angry god, dislodging me from the dark recesses of my mind and back into this hellish realityI don't know how long I had sat there, crying and letting what little hope I had drip away and splatter on the floor. I didn't even know what was happening any more. He was screaming, I knew that, but his words were garbled and unintelligible to me. I could barely hear my own thoughts, with the last hour replaying so loudly over and over in my mind. My head pounded with my heartbeat, as if Thor himself was swinging his hammer freely inside my skull.

Eventually, I was able to understand his demands. He was threatening to smash my door down if I didn't open it that very second. Instinctively, like a helpless child, I twisted open the lock, and my dad came barreling in without remorse, his face as red as blood. He didn't spare a second in deciding to strike me. I didn't even see his fist: all I ever saw was the fury in his eyes. Then I hit the floor, half-conscious and bleeding from my left ear.

I began fading from the waking world and all its demons fast. I believe my dad crawled on top of me and began shaking me. If he was saying anything, I couldn't hear it over the drums that had started playing. That made me happy.","1328055301"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My cat was stolen by our next door neighbor's son. We had a cat that never went outside even if we left the doors open. I was around 13 at the time and I remember the neighbor's son was in college though I don't know if he lived next door or just stayed at his parent's house every so often since I hardly ever saw him around. So one day my mother asks him if she could pay him to paint a room in our house while we were gone for the afternoon. Before we left, I was outside and I heard his girlfriend complaining to him that she wanted a cat like the one we had. Then he tells her something along the lines of ""don't worry I'll get that cat for you."" Now being my age I didn't think twice about it thinking he meant the same kind of cat we had. We leave for the afternoon and he goes in and paints. Later, we get back home and he's already gone. My mom goes next door and pays him and we go back in the house. The next morning we notice we haven't seen our cat. The cat was my 6 year old sister's and she's devastated that her cat is missing so she asks our neighbor's son if he left a door open or anything while he was in our house. He said he didn't even know we owned a cat. 

TL;DR: Cat stolen by neighbor's son and given to his girlfriend and I was too stupid of a kid to connect the dots. ","1328055302"

Also, in my opinion finger release only results in side to side inconsistency when unpracticed. A truly skilled archer can shoot a bare bow recurve just as accurately as they can shoot a bow with all the bells and whistles. I however, cannot.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Nevermind that you completely ignore the large history of U.S. land grants and regulations for farming which is definitely not free market behavior, or a small something called slavery. I already pointed out that arguing about how the U.S. left famine behind is pointless and historical anyways, and would just be a distraction.

You have ignored that I would want a more advanced implementation of EBT that *would* be spendable at farmers' markets, or could even subsidize farmers' markets as many present state EBTs do. Besides farmer's markets, I can't think of many places nowadays that you cannot use an electronic transaction card to get food, or could not easily be set up for such transfers. So your argument about market entry of products is moot.

Your argument that this would be a subsidy of the electronic transaction industry has some weight, but I just see this as a convenient way the government can kill two birds with one stone and provide easy access to purchasing food *and* regulate the out of control practices in the financial sector.

The whole ""amount never changes"" argument is bollocks, if I get an EBT of $75 a month for food and am middle class, there is no way in hell I am only spending just $75 on food. And since there is little functional way to differentiate between product demand from EBT and from cash (since they function the same for food), demand would be exactly the same except there would be a slight increase in spending on the lower end (poverty spending). So no, the market would not be any more constant or guaranteed than it is now, and it is already fairly guaranteed since there is absolutely no conceivable scenario where a demand for food does not exist. Also, a guaranteed demand for food does not necessitate a guaranteed demand for *your* brand of food.

Also I am going to ignore your very last paragraph because it seems incredulous that you argue on one hand that this is an unnecessary boost to manufacturers, and then you go and argue that this violates the 'rights' of those poor manufacturers.

Yes, if it comes down to it I have the right to force someone to sustain my life because that is part of their responsibility for taking society's contract. Unless they grew up and never benefited from public radio, never used a road, never used a public school, nationally subsidized telephone infrastructure, nationally regulated and subsidized energy production, never purchased a subsidized product, never paid social security, etc. etc. then they have bought into our society's contract and have already reaped the benefits of it, and they can't just opt out when it is not perfect for them personally. Why do anarcho-capitalists find it so easy to accept that it's fine for a policeman to end their lives if they go against society's contract, but not force them to give up a little food? Why do anarcho-capitalists find it easy to accept that you can force a policeman through a contract paid with public funds to protect someone's life, but you can't do the same thing with the average citizen?

Freedom is *one* of the goals of society, but it is not the absolute end all be all goal of society. If we wanted *absolute* freedom with no obligations, there would of course be no society. If you don't like it, move to another nation with a different contract or go enjoy **absolute freedom** in wilderness.

I like this idea. Could be tweaked to be workable. Although, still would allow someone to go ""afk"" for many hours (ONCE), but would then require them to leave and come back. If you have a defence fleet.. you could bubble up the system. Force them to log off to save cloak fuel.

Celiac can be ""silent."" Take heart disease or high blood pressure for instance---often you can't feel it, but if you keep pounding high cholesterol foods or not taking your blood pressure meds, you are risking serious complications (heart attack etc).

My point is, regardless of symptoms, if you decide to eat gluten, you are deciding to damage your health, and risk complications, even if you can't feel anything right now.","1328055315"

It means you only have one installation of the files.  That is definitely nice for when updates come out.  

But, I don't see much of a benefit in terms of having a single back end.  Have you used mutlisite before?  There is a network control and a blog control panel. So, you don't have one place from which to blog, you have one place with a list of sites and then you can click to be taken to the control panel for each individual site.  It isn't all that different from having bookmarks to take you to all the different admin panels and just have your browser cache your credentials.

The other thing is, plugins and themes are shared across sites.  If something isn't programmed with multisite in mind, it is possible for unusual results.  I hit problems trying to use a theme the customer picked on a multisite installation because it hadn't been designed for multisite and it had to modified to allow things like site-specific headers.  

There are still reasons to use it.  I re-read my original post and it sounds a bit too prescriptive.  If you want to try it and you think the potential issues aren't that big a deal, give it a shot.  You might find benefits I am not recognizing.","1328055326"

"nursing","t5_2ra72","Hey there! Second year nursing student here (In Canada)

**How many years it took?** The whole program (BScN) is 4 years, although most people seem to fall of the wagon at some point and take an extra year to complete it. (This is not frowned upon, life just happens and the courseload is pretty heavy)

**What skills do you need?** I'd say the skill most people need is dedication and a willingness to learn. I came into this program knowing I would have to read a TON of material and learn basically a whole new language. I Haaaaaate reading, as i find it hard to concentrate, but I'd say because I'm pretty dedicated to my program, that I just kind of bear it. A lot of our profs and nurses we meet tell us we need to be able to think critically and know your material. That's very much easier said than done at this point, as not all the information ties together in a natural flow yet, but apparently it comes in time and after years and years of experience.

**What type of nurse are you?** The nice thing about nursing is that there's so many areas to work in, that you're not just tied down to being the typical nurse that people envision being in a hospital working at the bedside. Although we all have to learn baseline skills to start us off, I'm very much interested in public health nursing. I'd like to give seminars and presentations to teens and the public about health-related topics. If I don't go into that, I'd really love to get into OB, as I really enjoyed it during one of my clinical placements. I think I mostly like OB because everyone just seemed so willing to learn and help themselves and their babies, whereas when I'm on a medicine floor, most patients don't want to help themselves get over big diseases because, mostly, its an inconvinience and they'll have to change their daily routines (diet, exercise, etc.)

**What is the hardest/easiest part? Is it rewarding?** I find the easiest and most rewarding part of nursing relates to bedside manner. All of my patients loved when I would take time to talk to them and learn about their lives a little by asking instead of just reading it in their charts. I feel like it makes both of us less nervous (being a student, nerves are a large part of my clinical experience). Another rewarding aspect of nursing is when I can explain things to my patient about their health that they don't necessarily understand. Even simple things. At the beginning of the day, we have to take our patients vitals, which includes their blood pressure. Most people don't understand what the values mean or what's normal. If they don't know, I take the time to explain this and why its good or bad, and usually they thank me afterwards.

"49ers","t5_2rebv","&gt; FACT: if kyle williams doesn't fuck up majorly, and his first one was 100% inexcusable, then we probably win that game.

FACT: if the refs made a slightly different call on the Brandon Jacobs fumble, then we probably win that game.

FACT: if Eli Manning had one less finger on the ball on any of the six times we sacked him, he probably fumbles and we probably win that game.

&lt;quoting polysyllabist&gt;
FACT: If Goldson doesn't destroy Tarrell Brown, we get an interception that easily leads to at least a field goal.
&lt;/quoting&gt;

Hypotheticals and counterfactuals are virtually meaningless in a game of inches.

When people defend Williams, they're defending him because of one overarching FACT: football is a team game, with team *accomplishments*, and team *responsibilities*.  Yes, one man can fuck up, and he can fuck up big, but when the game is as close as that last one was, **any** other minor fuck up that we didn't see or pay much attention to (a missed block, a slightly overthrown ball, a botched route, a missed coverage, poor timing, whatever), could still have made up for it or prevented the major fuck up from happening at all.  And the only ""unforgivable"" fuck ups are those that the player doesn't acknowledge, doesn't recognize, or doesn't improve upon over time (which doesn't apply here since Williams is a rookie and was placed in a backup return role).

Our WR receiver corps needs improvement, certainly, but you cannot lay the blame for a loss such as that one on any single player.  To do so is to patently misunderstand the nature of team sports.","1328055326"

I always had the most fun experimenting and playing what I wanted to play.  I think for every song I learned I wrote 10 more.  And I always play the ones I come up with the most.","1328055327"

I had this cat follow me around one day for a good 2 hours while I was hanging out by my friends house. Being that he was so cute and friendly and had no collar or anything, I figured it was a stray. Took the cat home and loved him for about 3 days. Then, one night my brother was talking to a friend of his on aim ( 2002/2003ish) and was telling me about his friends cat who went missing. So cat details and location were exchanged and it turned out that I stole the cat. I never meant to be that guy, but I was and I felt like an ass. So we arranged for us to meet and return the kitty to his rightful home.  Funny part of the story, 5 years later me and the boy I stole the cat from ended up dating. He didn't have the cat anymore and we broke up anyway. 

TL:DR
Stole a cat, gave it back, ended up dating the boy I stole it from a few years later, cat was gone, broke up anyway.","1328055336"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","The simple fact the shows up does not mean she is being a bitch who is destructive to someone else's life. All the song says is she comes back, talks to him, and gets sad. There is no mention of any harm, nor intent to harm, her ex. She just shows up, talks to him, sees the relationship is over, and tries to move forward. The song is a catharsis for her, and has very little to do with the ex.

I'll give you that she acts selfishly, but I don't see how that NECESSARILY means she is being a bitch at all. One can be selfish, but not harm someone else. From the way the song is worded there is no harm that comes to her ex. I think you are reaching too far in suggesting she is being a huge bitch about the whole thing. If she is hurting anyone, it is herself, not her ex. Her ex, by all accounts from the song, is very well moved on. So by going to talk to her ex, she ends up causing HERSELF emotional pain. So I guess she is being a bitch to herself, but that certainly is not the way you intended the use of the word 'bitch'. Even if she still WANTS to be with him, there is no mention of any actions she takes to accomplish such. In fact, there is the opposite. She says she will find someone else. Hence the name of the song. 

I'll stop arguing when you show a logical connection between an act of selfishness and her actually being a ""bitch who is destructive to someone else's life.""","1328055338"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is your son's problem, and you don't make him confront it, then you are doing him harm that will last his entire life. As a parent, you have to learn that you can not fight his fights for him. All you can do is have his back if he were to get into trouble b/c he was defending himself.

Since I was always moving around, being the new kid with red hair, a funny last name and kind of popular with girls, I was always a target for bullies and it always went the same way. I would get beat up, and go home crying, where my mother would promptly have the same instincts as you. Luckily, my father wasn't as naive. He would tell me/remind me that bullies are punks. Pussies at heart. All he has to do is confront him, one time, put up a decent fight, and not only will that bully leave him be, but all of the rest will think twice. **Winning and losing is irrelevant. Real life isn't the WWE.** *All he has to do is hurt that kid. Just enough to make him remember your son as he nurses his wound later that night.* Tell him not to wait for the bully to chase him down. He needs to find that punk, preferably with witnesses around, and without saying a word, attack him with the single-minded goal of punishing him for targeting him.*** No words. No hesitation***. *Just controlled breathing, and let his hands fly.* Don't think too much. *In fact, stop thinking.*

Your son has to let go of his fear and just remember to breathe. The crippling rush of adrenaline will become strength, and the resolve in your son's eyes will paralyze his opponent. Most fights last under 60 seconds, so let him know, good or bad, it'll be over before he knows it. Even if he is the biggest sissy you've ever known, I guarantee that if he can get over his fear, and confront this one bully, this one time, that it will change the entire way that all the kids treat him, and even how he sees himself. It's the law of the jungle. The strong eat the weak. *Either he's hungry enough to go H.A.M., or he's part of a well-balanced breakfast. There isn't other options.*

If you can't get him to believe you, then just do what my father did. Ask him who he is more afraid of, that punk or you? Then tell him if you hear about him getting picked on again, then you're gonna beat his ass, for his own good. Trust me, he'll handle his business.

I promise you that I'm not making any of this up. I wouldn't recommend that you tell your son to risk bodily harm and/or trouble with the school admin if I wasn't speaking from the experiences in my own childhood, and I knew of any other effective way of dealing with these predators. The truth is, he can stand and fight, now, or he can try to run for the rest of his life. They'll catch him eventually. They always do. Even if he loses, simply stepping up and throwing down will win him enough respect to give the next bully pause, and may even save him numerous beat downs in the future.

Once he handles this, though, I guarantee that he will come into his own in nearly every area of his life. There is no substitute for the confidence that comes from learning to stand on your own two feet and confront that which once made you scared. I wish him luck, and hope everything works out for him. And you.","1328055339"

"OneY","t5_2s5ni","I'll weigh in on the conversation. As a circumcised male, I'm told that:

 - I've been ""mutilated"" (doesn't seem to be so)

 - I have a decreased sensitivity (if so, thank god, because sex is seriously intense for me). 

 - I don't have a phrenum (except, I do, and I love it when it's stimulated by fingers or tongue).

 - I have to use lube to masturbate (not so, the skin moves perfectly fine around my full erection).

You've also heard that there are no medical benefits to circumcision. Some scientists disagree:

[Male circumcision provides a degree of protection against acquiring HIV infection, equivalent to what a vaccine of high efficacy would have achieved. Male circumcision may provide an important way of reducing the spread of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16231970)

[This meta-analysis shows a robust inverse association between MC and genital HPV prevalence in men.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249298)

[High effectiveness of MC for HIV prevention was maintained for almost 5 years following trial closure. There was no self-selection or evidence of behavioral risk compensation associated with post-trial MC acceptance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210632)

[Male circumcision reduces acquisition of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in men.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22147796)

[(3) the analysis reveals potentially harmful misconceptions about the health benefits of MC, demonstrating the importance of proper pre- and post-circumcision counselling as well as public health messages related to MC.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22087766)

The list goes on and on, and you'll note I only use peer reviewed sources, since this debate is often so contentious. The fact is, there is a clearly demonstrated medical benefit, but most pediatricians agree it is for the parents to decide, and there's nothing intrinsically harmful about not circumcising your child. 

**Edit:** See all the downvotes? The cult of the foreskin hates it when you present hard evidence indicating that circumcision is not just psychotic parents who love to torture their children.

- pay my way through college
- bought my car/have paid off my car
- am living on my own/paying for living expenses

Recently we got into a huge fight because I took a trip to visit my boyfriend, he goes to a college in the town I grew up in, and we ran into them.  They flipped and called threatening to revoke health insurance, etc.  I'm now paying for:

- all the above
-car insurance

As far as your situation--you need a job, you need to work a lot and then you need to move out ASAP.

Nope, but if enough people decide to marry their dogs they can rally and demand for the terms of the contract to be changed.

&gt;Marriage is a contract. In the same way you can't make legally binding contracts with kids or with dogs, you can't marry kids or dogs, because they can't give legal, informed consent. And yes, it isn't set in stone. Maybe someday we will accidentally breed sentient dogs, or the legal age for making contracts will drop to 10 to accommodate for hyper-intelligence or incredibly shortened lifespans.

Completely secure village.  Walls, no potential for slime invasion (if there are any slime chunks in the village, fence them off or half blocks everywhere), lighting, etc.  That means cobblestone generator, tree farm, and at least one animal farm (chickens for me, need arrows).

Lvl 50 enchantments on diamond tools, armor, and bow.  I level like crazy on flat worlds, usually ~40-50 per 3 hours of playing, so that's pretty reasonable for a few weeks of gameplay.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","To be completely honest, My 30 mW does fine as a night time pointer.
make sure to get a 532 nm ( our eyes are more sensitive to the color).
at night you can easily see a green beam (for several kilometers).

during the day of course you cant see the beam but you should still see the dot.  

getting a 150mW will make the beam brighter and more impressive.  But there is also the responsibility of using such a beast.

Bottom line if this is just for yourself you wont be disappointed with a 30 or 50 mW pointer.  

Now im about to advertise a chinese laser, and if anyone wants to yell at me for it. You're right they may not produce the power advertised and they may leak some IR.  I have bought chinese lasers my self and have not had a huge problem with the power. As per the possibility that the IR filter is sub par, you shouldn't be pointing these at people anyways!!!(I wouldn't use these professionally but for personal use they're cheap)

go to http://www.yourlasers.com (from dealextreme.com) I like [this](http://www.yourlasers.com/product/12337) one , because it comes with a cool diffraction grating which you can take off.

For the price you could get a high powered laser and a low powered chinese.

No, it's way less likely to get *exactly* our universe. But that's just common sense. The last I read about scientists actually using models to see what would happen it turned out that if you tweak the constants around you still get about 40% of the time a universe that has all the basic elements to support life (nuclear fission up till and including iron in stars and such). Not even counting possible other different ways that life can develop.

Another study even revealed that a universe without the weak nuclear force could still support most of what happens in this universe to provide for a planet with an atmosphere.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You do realize that Critical Race Studies is a booming academic field, even if Arizona is attempting to occlude it? As Noel Ignatiev famously posited, ""the point [of whiteness studies, a branch of critical race studies] is not to interpret whiteness but to abolish it."" That is, to abolish the systems that privilege the socially constructed category of whiteness. This is not the same as color of one's skin. It is not polemical to question someone's relationship to race or their use of racism. Though, for white privilege, it sure seems to be. Rather, it is an imperative question to ask, especially of those who wish to run for the highest office in this land. I get that you do not believe what I have mentioned are historical records, which leads you to believe that it is an baseless claim. However, I assure you that the textual history is there, and that makes him questionable. 

You pointed out that one journalist discredit. Fine, one item. That might disprove one item, but it does not mean he is anti-racist. Is the journalist conversant in Critical Race Theory in order to proclaim that? I highly doubt it. But the problem persists. For example, the speech. Perhaps if it were an isolated event, and Ron Paul took the requisite steps to rectify it, then I can understand. Which gets us to this whole idea that the North was right.

For starters, to say that the South was wrong is not to imply that the North was right. That simply is not true. Now, perhaps you are correct. The North buying the slaves would have been cheaper. Or the South could have just emancipated their slaves. Or they could not have engaged in slaving at all. That would have been a great alternative history. It is interesting that these were not the alternative histories you pursued. Rather, you kept it in the free market grammar of Libertarian/capitalistic pursuits. We are talking about people. My point continues to be that it is problematic to assert what he did. The fact that the grammar of Ron Paul would not allow him to pursue an alternative history that states that the South should have just emancipated their slaves is horrifically problematic.","1328055359"

Similarly, telling a serious Jew that they can either eat food forbidden by God or starve is also unnecessarily insensitive and cruel, especially for a country that celebrates religious tolerance.

Surely there's a limit to how far we can go to accommodate people, and I'll acknowledge that kosher meals might not fall on the right side of that line due to the expense involved in providing them.

Do you like when someone tries to cut in front of you in a line? I would REALLY, REALLY like to know your answer, especially if you are in a hurry, let's say on your way to work?

Also, you don't understand by not putting in the order when you said you could have ""At this point, I should be putting in your entree order, but the people with the drinks have now been waiting 10 minutes total"" you have just delayed our entrée orders, NOT the kitchen staff.

You see, most of the time, your server is at fault for most issues. They are ALWAYS at fault for wrong prices unless they are not the last person to give us our check.

I just want to know WHY do you think it's ""FAIR"" or ""MORALLY RIGHT"" to hand people things out of order off a tray?

WHY do you think it's fair to not put entrée orders into the computer in your scenario when you said you should have, but did not do it, WHY? If we ordered first, we ordered first. 

I hate you condoning cutting. Cutting is not nice, no matter WHERE you are, even in ER it probably sucks(I have never been fortunately).

NOBODY LOVES WAITING, NOBODY. The thing is, if you have table 1 that asks for their check, as you pass by table 2 asked for 2 refills, and as you pass by table 3 asked for another side of ranch for their side salad.  Table 1 should get their check first since they asked first, that's just the ""RIGHT"" thing to do. It has NOTHING to do with priority. One thing is not more important than the other tasks. I don't get HOW you come up with PRIORITY? I think it's that you are TOO LAZY to make separate trips or take a tray jack with you so you hand out the soup first off the tray that was ordered last.

Table 2 should get their refills. I make a separate trip to get the ranch if I have to pour it or get it poured. If it's poured already, I would grab it along with the 2 refills, BUT I would hand the 2 refills FIRST. 

NO ONE tasks is more important than the other unless there was a mistake involved or a spill for example that could lead to someone slipping and falling.

Now change the scenario to table 3 let's say they didn't want ranch that they had a problem with their steak, well table 3 would go ahead of the other 2 tables, because they had a MISTAKE, which honestly it was their turn first to begin with, because they had a MISTAKE.

Now do you see what a PRIORITY really is? Soup or entrées aren't more important than each other unless there was a mistake or spill involved. The things that go first are the things that were ORDERED FIRST. 

I don't get why you think soup would have priority over entrées if they didn't contain mistakes?

John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.


2 Timothy 3:16-17 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.

My son is 3.7y.o. and very logical, all kids are. So if you can't articulate a good sound reason other than ""That is just the way it is"" you will ultimately lose the argument.  
  
What I would suggest is this, cook meals and cook them veg* and if you want meat with your meal then cook it on the side. When you kids ask about it, then have the conversation with them. By then you should have formulated sound reasons.  
If you are going to argue for being an omni, might I suggest you start eating organic (not ""natural"" and NOT at whole foods, fuck whole foods.) Then you can at least have a little more of a platform to stand on against factory meat.  
  
Additionally, I would suggest you really think about your relationship with your food and in this case specifically with meat. How do you feel about it? How do you feel about the animals who provide the meat to you? They aren't the easiest questions and really require you to be honest and bare yourself to yourself.","1328055370"

Like Phaedrus85 said just carpet bomb resumes to engineering firms. If you have the means to relocate for a summer you have a ton more options. 

If you can't get an internship your first summer don't sweat it. Take some summer classes to get ahead and try for a coop starting spring of Sophomore year.

Before Vitamin K I'd consider whey protein if you don't get enough protein, Carnitine, Coenzyme Q10, Taurine, and/or Beta-Alanine. Those last 4 are al essential nutrients that your body seems to be able to superload on without detriment if you don't go overboard.

IIRC 3g or under of Carnitine, 500mg or under of Coenzyme Q10, 3.5g or under of Taurine, and 6.4g or under of Beta-Alanine (although you shouldn't exceed 10mg/kg per dosage for beta-alanine unless taking it with food) and there's more net benefit than harm. Optimal doses for health are probably closer to 1.5-2g Carnitine, 150-250mg Coenzyme Q10, 0.5-2g Taurine, and 0.5-2g Beta-Alanine.","1328055383"

A lot of what Steam offers seems to fall in line with what Gabe Newell said regarding piracy, and I'm paraphrasing here, that the key to defeating piracy is offering service the pirates can't offer. Valve, through Steam and their other services, has done a lot for the PC gaming community, and it has paid off both is sales and popular support. It's not necessarily true, though, that popularity is the only way into people's pockets. I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Origin is fairly successful. EA won't get any brownie points for understanding and fulfilling the needs of the PC platform or its users, but it could easily prove that a less-consumer-friendly platform is just as profitable as the alternative. 

As far as Impulse goes, I can't really offer an opinion. It seems pretty clear to me, though, that Valve hit the sweet spot by both succeeding first where others had failed in digital distribution, and by being able to support themselves well enough financially in order to always come off as being on the side of PC gamers. If things had gone differently for Valve, it's completely conceivable that they may have instituted completely different terms for the Steam platform, and everybody's opinions about it would have been much less favorable. The way things are, though, Origin entered the market with features that lack on almost every front on which Steam stands strong. On top of that, the exclusivity of new EA titles to the Origin platform makes EA an easy target for criticism. Whether or not that criticism is justified, it's something EA should have considered when bringing Origin to launch. I personally don't have any strong opinions on Origin, as I haven't had the chance to use it much, but to anyone arguing that EA ids only trying to do the same thing that Valve did nearly nine years ago, I urge you to try to better understand the situation. 

Valve has had nine years to improve the Steam platform, but *so has literally every other publisher out there.*","1328055396"

Just like geneticists identify a gene or genes ""for"" eye growth in fruit flies by observing the genes of mutant flies that don't have eyes, one can investigate the gene (or more often, complex interactions between many genes), by knocking out a gene and observing the effects.  Thus, the ""genes for tying your shoe"" are all the genes that, when deactivated, inhibit your ability to tie your shoe.  So genes for eye sight, depth perception, finger growth, manual dexterity, etc. are all required genes for a single behavior. If you don't have eyes or fingers (or feet!), tying your shoes becomes more difficult or impossible.  All of these genes must be inherited for your children to tie their shoes.","1328055397"

The only way I could see this being remotely safe would be if the kid was also in a full-body harness, and you were top-roping with dual lines or something.

I don't see any problem top-roping with a kid on your back so long as they're not going anywhere, but if she's using something like an [Ergo](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CJMBEBYwAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.ergobaby.com%2F&amp;ei=YoQoT_eYDpTciQKqlMnFAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEts_DA-_FjNphYMpL0MMJwiSYykg), then she's absolutely nuts to take a risk like that.","1328055411"

An IQ test tells how you well you perform on a standardized test which grades you on a standard line of subjects. It doesn't tell you how intelligent you are or how intelligent you can become. 

Someone can have the IQ highest score in the world and not know a single thing about how to wire a electrical system for a house. The electrician has a high level of intelligence in that field than the person with the higher IQ score.

Road one: two crazy students decide now's a good day to shoot up the place. they pop into class with whatever guns they have, or bought, or stole, et cetera. they start shooting people. students, professors, dogs.  two students in the class are carrying their CCW, and ventilate the aggressors. total loss of life: 0-5, depending on how quickly the carrying students reacted and how good their shots were. 

Road two: everyone left their guns in their respective cars. the same two disgruntled students arrive with the same plans, but instead of being taken down by the two carrying students, they get to keep on shooting until the police show up, or possibly until the swat team mobilizes. the tucson PD has an average response time of ten minutes and eleven seconds; how many people can you shoot in ten minutes?

I'm going to assume that you are from the U.S. (like me. Hello!) If you were to wake up and 89% of the country followed Greek mythology, you would be a bit put off. Even more so if everyone at your job, including your boss, had Zeus pictures and ""quotes"" around your office. Even more so if they fired you when you mentioned that your savior was Jesus Christ. Even more so if your wife practices this greek mythology, divorces you for not practicing it and a judge says that you are an unfit parent to your children for not having Hercules in your heart. When you say ""Happy Holidays"" instead of ""Merry Metis (titan-ess and Zeus' first wife) Day"" you get yelled at. 

You go on the internet in that universe defeated and drained. Out of the 346,004,403 websites on the internet you find the r/Christianity subreddit. You go there to discuss the Bible, Jesus, and talk about your experiences as a Christian minority. Some of those are positive, but some are hurtful and frustrating. Atheists do not spend there whole lives bashing religion. You do not spend your whole life bashing atheists and religions that you don't follow. But I bet that if I took every comment you made about those groups it would be a lot of comments.

1. Strong theist; definitely believes in a god(s). ""I don't believe, I know""

2. De facto theist; not 100% but strong belief and lives on the assumption.

3. Doubted theist; has doubts but leaning towards theism

4. Impartial, not leaning towards either

5. Leaning towards atheist; not sure, but inclined to be skeptical

6. De facto atheist; short of 100% sure but is strongly inclined to skepticism

7. Strong atheist (or 'militant' I guess). 100% sure. With the same conviction as a strong theist, but the opposite ""I don't believe, I know""


Very few would claim to be under 7 (unlike 1, where many claim it) as atheism is bred from lack of evidence and there's no solid proof that no god exists as much as the evidence that one did exist.

James uses two of the familiar keys to unlock an elaborate lock system - along with a third - and pulls open a heavy metal door.

I asked why Reddit keeps upvoting these posts, consistently.

I don't believe in trial by media, or that people are guilty once accused. If someone is accused of rape and they are proven innocent, I think they are innocent. That I know statistcily that they are probably guilty, has no more weight than knowing statisticlly that young men are more likley to be drunk drivers. Its true but it wouldn't influence my vote on a jury.

My question was always about the theme of the comments and why they get upvotes. By the standards of Reddit upvoting there are 1000s of innocent men, who everyone seems to know, that are falsley accused of rape by crazy bitches every day.","1328055424"

It makes you all warm and fuzzy to watch them gain confidence in their new home, and you...I loved this experience with my senior kitty - sadly she was more senior than originally thought and was only with us for 4 years.

It's so nice to find others who are concerned about the real facts of the quality of food for their animal friends.  Sounds like those two kitties found *exactly* the person they needed to live out their lives happily :3

A little OT, however...
&gt;The 2 cats are a bit nervous. The vet recommended I feed them a food specially designed for anxiety/nervous cats. 

I have had excellent personal experience with 3 different cats using [Rescue Remedy as well as specific other flower remedies](http://www.bachflower.com/Pets.htm), and I would very strongly recommend it.  

(I swear it saved one of my cats' lives - he was *seriously* upset due to circumstances - already somewhat anxious by nature (I referred to him as autistic) and had stopped eating or drinking anything at all for over 2 days - this from a cat who's appetite was like a dog - eat ALL the things!  Rescue remedy had him eating within 2 hours of applying it to his fur, and then I used Mimulus to help him get over his anxiety. 

I know it reads like it's mumbo jumbo, but it's inexpensive, doesn't counteract with any medication, and doesn't need to be taken internally...and it works.  

btw: I don't work for the company or sell the product or anything like that - just someone who's found it works when nothing else does. ","1328055427"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; The McDowell team studied 556 rape allegations.  Of that total, 256 could not be conclusively verified as rape.  That left 300 authenticated cases of which 220 were judged to be truthful and 80, or 27%, were judged as false.  In his report Charles McDowell stated that extra rigor was applied to the investigation of potentially false allegations.  To be considered false one or more of the following criteria had to be met: the victim unequivocally admitted to false allegation, indicated deception in a polygraph test, and provided a plausible recantation.  Even by these strict standards, slightly more than one out of four rape charges were judged to be false.

From the IPT citation.  They apparently did follow up studies with civilian populations before the issue got too hot to research which is probably where the 40% figure comes from.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; Actually in this case the victim was another little boy. 

I know. I can't speak for all people here but I've never said feminists don't care about men. Some do, some probably don't. That's not what's happening here. Maybe I was wrong to characterize this as a feminist disciplinary action, but it sure seems in line with it (overreaction to something as innocent and harmless as a simple touch -- this is well within the targeting scope of feminist action). 

As if that's not enough, the stark contrast between the discipline dished out for something as harmless as a touch, when a blind eye is often turned to bullying or recess fights, is **exactly** the kind of shit feminists champion. They scream and yell about the abhorrent reality of things like sexual harassment or being ""sexualized"", call for everything short of making sex a crime, and they get fixated and angry over things as trivial as the clothing women and men wear, while at the same time turning a blind eye to very real issues, like young men (mostly) being **killed** in wars. They think that sex is a bigger issue than violence (unless that violence is directed to a woman from a *man*, though they never speak up on violence directed to men from *women*). To feminists, things like sexual perception and status and victimization are more vital issues than people actually dying or getting hurt. They are more terrified of and worried about sex than they are real issues, issues that actually matter.


Please note I use the term ""feminism"" loosely, here. I don't want to get into a debate about what real feminism is or isn't. I'm just labeling people as they have labeled themselves. I see these kinds of things attributed to people who call themselves feminists, so I'm going to have to run with the assumption that there are feminists like this. ","1328055439"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","See, no, that's not what i'm saying at all. I'm not declaring a solution, i'm stating what the most likely scenario is going to be. That people are going to be blaise about it until it comes to that point.

I live in an area with a significant small town conservative mindset. I've posed different questions to them in regards to global warming. The majority of those people I've talked to think global warming either:

1) Doesn't Exist
2) Is a scam by scientists
3) Has happened in the past, so why worry

or a combination of the three. When I tell them that there's a chance that it is ""too late"" they all come into agreeance:

""So what's the point in changing anyway? If it's too late, we might as well keep it the way it is""

You know, as well as I do, that this mentality is bigger than my small town. First off, they don't believe it is our fault. Second, if it IS happening, what's the point in changing if things can't change?

Which is why, although i'm totally for this movement and promote it and will fight tooth and nail to get it going, with some people they are too far ingrained with these false beliefs that I don't think they are going to change their ways until things start getting dicey, which is why we're going to have to do some significant geo-engineering to stave off tipping points. Because people are bull-headed.

But I need to declare again, I'M WITH YOU AKUTA. I'M TOTALLY 100% FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. But we're dealing with people, and a lot of those people aren't going to change their ways overnight, and may not change until they see some hard evidence in their back yards that ""shits getting real"", but by then we'll need to do something drastic to thwart off disaster.","1328055455"

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","There are a lot of people out there who use the mantle of feminism, and they have a lot of different ideas. But the idea that men ""as a birth group"" deserve to be insulted is an extremely fringe idea, and not one associated with either academic feminism nor the major feminist organizations or publications in existence. Maybe you read people writing that on blogs or on reddit, but more likely I'm guessing you misunderstand their intended meaning.

That men hold more power isn't actually in dispute. Men hold more of the high paying, influential jobs in the world. Men hold many, many more of the positions of political authority. Men still dominate certain fields and industries. This is simply factually true. I certainly won't deny that, largely thanks to the feminist movement, the position of women in the United States is far better than it ever was in the past. True gender equality is closer than ever. But it doesn't exist quite yet. There is still some way to go.

I do need to point out a few things. First, feminists are not a social class. Secondly, if you have the impression that most feminists think all men are rapists, or only men can be rapists, then you're wrong. Most feminists do not think or say that. The idea that all heterosexual penetrative sex is rape is a radical feminist idea from the '70s. It's intended to be provocative, to get people to think about how their personal lives, even the intimate details of their sex lives, may reflect and reinforce the power dynamics of the larger society. It's not an idea that's taken seriously on a literal level.

Third thing I need to point out is that I do not believe that men are oppressors, and it is not a mainstream feminist position to assert that men are oppressors.

Fourth, listening to someone else's perspective isn't giving them deference. It's opening your mind to a new perspective.

It is entirely possible for two people to be talking, and for both of them to be members of privileged classes who are ""oppressing the other class."" But I should make something clear -- being a member a privileged group doesn't mean you're oppressing other people. I'm seeing where there's a breakdown in communication here. If group A has privilege and group B is oppressed, group A must be oppressing group B. And therefore members of group A are oppressors. That's not how it works. We're talking about institutional privilege. It's not something that people do to other people, it's just the way our society is structured. We can choose to break free from the structure or we can choose to support and reinforce the structure. So I would never say to anyone that he is an oppressing man, just by virtue of being a man (assuming he's not actually doing anything discriminatory or trying to take away my rights). That would be juvenile.

Anyway, imagine a black man talking to a white woman. The woman has white privilege and the man has male privilege. So, what happens, you ask? They listen to each other.

You can be a member of a powerful class and a member of a completely powerless class at the same time. That's how privilege works, it overlaps and intersects in a giant web that leaves about 0.001% of the population at the top of the heap. If you are a man you are a member of a powerful class, but it doesn't mean you're powerful, especially if you're not white, or you're disabled (as in your example), or you're gay, or you're poor, or you're overweight, or you're a child, or you're an immigrant, or etc. etc. etc. Saying that men, as a class, have privilege is not saying that all men have more power than all women in all situations all of the time.

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","My life kind of got turned upside down in a positive way because of night clubs.  Back in the day of being your typical shy, white, computer geek with low self esteem and average looks, I forced myself to actually start leaving my apartment during the weekends.  I ended up starting to dance various hip hop styles.  Then having a guy that promoted local EDM parties befriend me and then being in dance battles and whatnot really changed me.  I met a lot of good people that I have known for quite a few years now that weren't your typical ""club"" people.  Dancing boosted my ego, because I am better than most people and was something that gives me some confidence that I can show off in public (being white also boosts the novelty).  Took a few years of other people convincing me I was as good as I am because of low confidence at first of course.  So I don't regret going to night clubs now and it is pretty easy to pick out the different types of people.  Never have done a one night stand, even though the offers were there.  The confidence has spilled into my ""regular"" life as well.

tl,dr - Went to night clubs, danced my ass off, much higher confidence level that comes out a bit in the ""real world"".","1328055456"

It sounds like the UK suit you're describing is just a more extreme version of the standard US suit, but both have semi-rigid shoulders, an open front, a fake ""collar"" for the suit, and an uncomfortable tie-display collar for the shirt, etc.

This may be true as an average, but it certainly doesn't apply to every person in that group, all the time. Taking such a generalization and applying it to individuals is the very definition of ""*ism"".

Privileged people aren't given advantages, *per se*. What they are given, is a *lack of disadvantages*. 

* White people don't have to worry about people thinking they are going to be robbed by them because of their skin color. 
* Straight people don't have to worry about being accused of pushing their sexuality on individuals when they discuss significant others. 
* Cis people don't have to worry about not being able to pee in a bathroom where they would be looked at strangely because of their gender identity/expression. 
* Able-bodied people don't have to worry about whether a building they need access to has proper measures for them to be able to get in.
* Men can be loud without being called a shrew. They can be aggressive without being called a bitch.

Comment moderation is typically a lot less strict than submission moderation. There are a few reasons for this.

Frequently our course of action with people being un-ponylike is to remove posts if it's either a. blatent trolling by someone or b. hardcore flaming back and forth (and I mean REALLY flaming).

We typically message users who are trolling and tell them to knock it off. If they are a repeat offender, they either get a timeout or ban. This has not had to happen all that often.


There is a lot of disrespect going around, and my best response to that is to use downvotes, and try not to feed the trolls too much.

Our guidelines we are writing up will include rules about treating people with respect.

If at any time things really get out of hand, [please send us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23mylittlepony). We will in the future try to chime in more often and remind people to be more respectful.","1328055462"

I think LaFaro would bring a different element to the mix than what either of Miles or Jamal generally played with, and I chose Motian not in a two-for-one with LaFaro, but I think if you had Ahmad, Miles, and LaFaro all doing their thing, you need the most gracious timekeeper under all that, and there was no more beautiful, understated player than Motian IMO.

I think it was a kitten that just got away from the litter as opposed to actually being someones actual pet at that young age (although it may have been a kitten of someone's cat and they were planning on getting rid of the kittens anyways). I looked on Craigslist for lost kitten posts, but after 2  weeks there was nothing. 

We've had him for almost 8 months now and he is a beast of a cat that acts like a perfect hybrid cat/dog. He bites the shit out of your hands if you pick him up, but licks your face if you put it by his. He never bites my kids (or any kids), but will attack the shit out of adults. He hides in the hall closet and then jumps at your feet when you walk by. Also, he plays fetch with my kids and chases them up and down the hallway. He comes when he's called by name alone (no need to make 'psss' or click noises), and he begs like a dog and yet purrs like a crazy motorboat. 

His name is Commander Shepard and he's something else. 

He got out once (at around 3 months of age) overnight and came back. Now he runs out every once in awhile but just eats some grass and then runs back in. My bf is **terrified** someone will take him. ","1328055483"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I live in Mexico. I was never a fundamental catholic. And i can't actually recall the moment of my deconversion, i was baptized and did my first communion. I studied in a catholic school, and i was confirmed at age 16 or so. Odd thing is that i must have gone to confession a maximum of 10 times throughout my life. I guess my agnosticism started with the catholic church, and rarely gave god a second thought. I was always a curious kid and loved science, so i guess that was a great teflon coating for my brain against religion. I haven't come out to my folks, they're not fundies by any stretch of the word but i do think that the idea of god does comfort them. I just prefer to never get into the topic with them, and i sometimes accompany them to church, just to keep things civil.

A big thing over here is that a bunch of people are pretend catholics, they rarely go to church and rarely give god a second thought. So i think a big chunk of our country is really close to agnosticism. Sadly Soaps and horrible TV have the collective Mexican mind in the gutter preventing rational thought. ","1328055491"

They cannot schedule you for more than 40 hours, and many don't even come near this amount regardless, however if an enterprising individual wanted to pick up shifts and work more than 40 hours, he would prevented from doing so because they would be paying him overtime.  The 40 hour mark is also often times needed for an employee to be considered full time and be eligible for benefits, but this usually needs to be an average amount worked over a long period of time -- I digress.

When I worked at a restaurant there was more than one occasion where I would have preferred to stay, unpaid or paid, so that I could collect the tips from the tables I was serving.  Unfortunately I was near the 40 hour mark so I was sent home from my shift and all of my current sales transferred to another server.

Absolutely.

I'm not claiming that looking for meaning where there is very little is uncommon. A lot of people will look at a piece of trash sitting on the floor and wonder ""what does it mean""? Its why we have religion - searching for meaning where there really isn't any. So this sort of thing pops up fairly frequently, especially when you consider the nature of the artistic subculture.

That doesn't mean it has any real message. Quite a bit of ""meaning"" derived from things like this is entirely accidental, or even *exactly the opposite of what the artist actually intended*. Feel free to compare literary theories regarding the message of *Fahrenheit 451* to Bradbury's [intended message](http://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/scifi/celebrating-ray-bradburys-birthday-revisit-fahrenheit-451.html).

Does this mean that the mental masturbation is meaningless? No, if you found some sort of meaning in something meaningless, it still has meaning to you. But elevating something like that to the level of calling it ""art"" is a goddamn disgrace to real art, with all its subtleties and beauty. Would you put a dog collar that belonged to your first dog, your best friend for most of your life and one who helped you through rough times, in a museum? No. Its just a fucking dog collar. It has no meaning, except to you. Compare that wall to something like [this](http://www.area-56.de/pics/2d/hidden_nature.jpg) or [this](http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-illust1210/5.jpg).

However, any alien digestive tract would have to be able to at least breakdown, either mechanically, chemically or both, flesh. 
[This Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat#Biochemical_composition) lists water, proteins (polypeptide chains), fats (lipids) and carbohydrates as the four major constituents of meat, so any alien digestive system would have to include mechanisms for breaking down and absorbing these carbohydrates, proteins and fats in order to get any nutritional value.

And then there's the problem of whether the alien would be able to use the peptides, lipids and sugars obtained by digestion. Such aliens would probably use the same base elements of life as are found on Earth (Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Phosphorus) in order to properly utilized in biochemistry. Arsenic, lead and mercury are toxic to mammals, so any organism based on these could exhibit carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus poisoning.

TL;DR Any alien organism able to digest a human (or any Earth life form) would need a similar biochemistry to Earth-based life, so as not to be poisoned by conflicting biological compounds.","1328055497"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Spot on, just going to fill in a bit of how we made the jump from Michelangelo to Picasso.

Prior to the development of photography, the primary goal of painting was to accurately capture reality (or at least making things appear realistic).  For centuries, painters just got more realistic - like Michelangelo.  The advent of the camera meant that capturing reality with 'perfect' detail became unnecessary so, artists, trying to find something else to do became 'artistic'.  People came up with all sorts of ways to make things look more interesting than reality - like Picasso.

At some point, people figured out that they don't have to actually paint ""things"" - they just need to make colors and shapes, bringing us to abstract art.  Still, there's more to abstract art than these minimalistic geometric pieces you've linked.  For example, [Jackson Pollock](https://www.google.com/search?q=jackson+pollock&amp;tbm=isch) has a style that's completely different.","1328055498"

This isn't fair but even if he is cleared, I will always see him as partially responsible for this girl's death. He wasn't just legally drunk, he was shit-faced and this would've never happened if he stayed home. Hell if he was sober he might have been able to avoid the other car. If he does go to jail, he's as good as abandoned his own young daughter to the care of my elderly grandmother. 

I have a pretty good understanding of alcoholism, my brother is recovering, my dad had it and quite a few other family members have it as well. I realize that it's a vicious affliction that is extremely difficult for the alcoholic to control but I just can't excuse drunk driving, no matter how bad the alcoholism is.

Taking away that time-charged word, marriage, opens up whole new worlds of different relationship types that don't have the unspoken romance requirement.

&gt;The Director noted on the referenced memorandum, ""I would do it but before agreeing to it we must insist upon full access to discs recovered. For instance in the La. {Los Alamos...?} case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination""

**Some quotes:**
&gt;""All Apollo and Gemini flights were followed, both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely, by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin - flying saucers, or UFOs, if you want to call them by that name. Every time it occurred, the astronauts informed Mission Control, who then ordered absolute silence."" 

*Maurice Chatelain, Former Chief of NASA Communications Systems*

-

&gt;""At no time, when the astronauts were in space were they alone: there was a constant surveillance by UFOs."" 

*NASA Astronaut Scott Carpenter*

-

&gt;""Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence."" 

*Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII.*

-

&gt;""The phenomenon of UFOs is real. I know that there are scientific organisations which study the problem. It must be treated seriously."" 

*Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev*

-

&gt;""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe that unknown flying objects are nonsense."" 

*Roscoe Hillenkoetter, Former CIA Director in a public statement, 1960.*

-

&gt;""Of course it is possible that UFO's really do contain aliens as many people believe, and the Government is hushing it up.""

*Professor Stephen Hawking*

-

&gt;""I've been convinced for a long time that the flying saucers are real and interplanetary. In other words we are being watched by beings from outer space."" 

*Albert M. Chop, deputy public relations director, National Aeronautics and Space Administration,(NASA) and former United States Air Force spokesman for Project Blue Book.*

-

&gt;""I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth"" 

*President Harry S. Truman*

-

&gt;""I don't laugh at people any more when they say they've seen UFOs. I've seen one myself!"" 

*President Jimmy Carter (1976)*

-

&gt;""I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, ""Nope."" And I said to him: ""Let's follow it!"" We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it."" 

*President Ronald Reagan*

-

&gt;""I'm not at liberty to discuss the governments knowledge of extraterrestrial UFO's at this time. I am still personally being briefed on the subject!""

There have definitely been extended periods of relative inactivity, but I can't get away from the fact that the highest high is, for me, creating music, performing said music and feeling that music connect with an audience.

Has it made my life harder that I can't let go of this passion? Depends on who you ask. My folks would have loved if I'd given up long ago. My perspective is that even if no one ever shows any interest in the songs I write, my world is a better place for having brought them into existence.

Nietzsche disagrees.

Furthermore, I'd like to mention your list is exhaustive, and isn't as ""immoral"" as you seem to masquerade it as. 

The Bible is both descriptive and prescriptive. When the Bible describes violence, it does just that, recounts a historical narrative in which great violence did occur. Does that mean it sanctions those acts of violence? Absolutely not. You need to chop then, from your list, all the ""immoral"" stuff that is just historical work, not divine commands.

&gt; atheism is inherently a more moral position.

Where do morals come from in atheism? Where? Yourself? Well that seems like a mighty fine place to get your morals, seeing as human individuals are immutable, wise and undeceived. 

You also never really answered my point. How can you, as an atheist, even use the word ""moral"" in an objective sense? Atheism necessitates moral relativism, therefore you are in no ways fit to critique anybody's morality other than your own. 

I don't see how a belief that says ""we are all just relatively advanced primates that have evolved recently whose only purpose is to propagate DNA and survive"" gives you morality.

The belief that says we are all made in the image of a loving God who *is* love, endowed with inalienable rights to life, liberty and happiness, well, that is a moral landscape, as Sam Harris calls it.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Well, Why can't streaming and downloading simple coexist?  Streaming may not require storage or planning, but direct download allows for offline use, higher quality, and unstable connections.  Both have their uses.  Also, many smart tv's would support external storage, as they have a usb port and support flash drives, and I imagine hdds. 

As for watching once, everyone has different watching patterns, I for one do go back every now and then and rewatch something, and I would greatly prefer to have it downloaded, and availible forever, than the have it ""rented"" via streaming.  
Most poeple I know do have steam running, it allows them to see what there friends are playing, dl game updates automatically, etc, with minimial resource use.  Steam was just one example though.  
Also, many people do watch movies on their computer, especially laptop users.  Also, this could work for tablets and phones as well, although I imagine carriers would not like it, but a setting to only seed while on wifi could help.  
Also, the average users doesn't have to seed for a p2p system to work.  Most users, sadly don't, but the few people with a dedicated seedbox provide the brunt of the seeding for the average obscure file. The main advantage would be the ability to scale for massively popular files.  


Really, my main problem with streaming is that you can't own it.  This is my biggest concern about steam as well, but at least with steam, the files on on my computer, and would still be there if steam went down.
Unless I could actually download the files, with no, or very light drm, I couldn't forsee me using it.

Also, streaming, while it may be faster initially, can always run into buffering, and hiccups, depending on the connections.  Downloading is simply smoother.
Also, the whole point of this discussion, if I remember, was about charging premium fees for hd content.  A p2p download system would make the main expense, bandwidth, not occur.

Also, if your ps3 is full, I highly suggest you grab a larger hdd and pop it in if you haven't already. 
On another side note, the media could always be downloaded to a computer or server, then streamed to the device of choice locally, eliminating the problems with streaming.  Most devices make this very easy.","1328055513"

Once you know why, you can go about seeing if you can make her comfortable with it.

In turn, tell her that it's something you're really interested in trying, but if she's uncomfortable with the idea it doesn't have to be today, or, well, ever. Everyone has lines about what they're okay with, and you'll have to accept where hers are.

Who ever said she ruined someone else's life? Because zops didn't.

What action you take on someone for their cheating on *someone else you don't even know* was never a decision you had any right to make.

You don't have any facts, you just wanted to shit on someone for no good reason. One option was to do nothing, the second was to be an asshole for no reason.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","No, it's just amazing to me how people will say God needs blood when He says in the scriptures (Is. 1:11) that He doesn't. I think it's shortsighted to bring the motives of pagan gods into the picture when we are talking about the God of the Bible, who tolerated blood sacrifices because He knew that's the only understanding they had of worshipping gods. Yet as time went on, He moved them away from relying on their sacrifices to make them right and focused on their hearts. Jesus died to defeat death and sin on our behalf, not satisfy some blood-lust that God supposedly has. If you think God actually desires blood like some pagan god would, why would He come Himself to BE the perfect sacrifice? That was on OUR behalf, not because God needed it. God doesn't need anything from us. And if you think the Father was bloodthirsty and the Son wasn't then you have dis-unity in the Trinity and that is a huge problem.","1328055526"

Academics cant just go out and start injecting people with drugs or forcing them into bizarre experiments anymore (like Milgram).  Every university and research institution has a Institutional Review Board made up of members of the community as well as other academics.  What happens is the primary investigator, the Dr doing the research, will submit a basic abstract of what he/she will be doing, what questions he/she will ask, and what he/she hopes to gain from the study.  The review board will look at it and either sign off of it, send it back for more information (such as...maybe the PI can get the same information but not expose the subjects to controversial subjects or materials), or tell the PI that he/she's out of their mind and deny it.  Now most things will be denied outright.  If you wanted to do some kind of study like Milgram where you could really mess someone up for life that would never get approved.  The syphilis studies?  Youd probably be fired for even suggesting it.  All that nazi-type crap?  I cant even imagine how flipped their shit would be.

This same procedure occurs with animal test subjects as well.  Obviously its a different board but its a similar procedure.

The whole purpose is to make sure there is no permanent harm done to people (this isnt always the case with animals) and that any harm that is done is minimal and unavoidable and the gains from the study far outweigh the suffering caused (this is true for people and animals).

So yeah research is conducted all the time on people and on animals and there are some checks to insure that its ethical.

*edit I just wanted to add that any research involving people you have to obtain their clear consent.  Meaning you have to tell them what they are going to be doing, what is going to be done to them, what the risks are, etc.  You have to be very very clear and then they have to agree to it.  None of this Yeah I agree to some unknown pysch experiment and then I find myself in the basement getting a lobotomy type stuff.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I read the whole post, but i'm just going to cite to your tldr for compactness sake.

&gt; It’s not a crime to hold certain beliefs; that’s a pretty clearly immoral view. And this sort of illiberal perspective is exactly what’s justified anti-semitism for so long, along with many other forms of discrimination. In fact, I see that in a more recent post of yours you’ve confirmed this very principle yourself…unless it’s an Amalekite.

Agree to disagree. I disagree with your premise. I don't think it's going to able to be negotiated away. I see absolutely no problem killing someone, or at the very least permanently devesting them of any and all liberties, for voicing the fact that, given the opportunity, would kill me in my sleep for simply being who I am. In civilized culture, we call this terroristic threats and voicing this in any western culture means jail time and possible civil commitment. If you're making a legal argument, at least in American courts, you're factually wrong. I have no problem with saying it deserves death, you disagree.

&gt; There is no verse that explicitly refutes the biblical exhortations to destroy the Amalekites totally. The closest that any verse comes is De 20:10’s command to offer peace before sieges, creating an apparent conflict. But it makes more sense to interpret the verses commanding the destruction of the Amalekites as taking precedence; these repeated and intense commandments should be construed as more pressing than a bland and vague rule about siege procedures. Plus it makes no sense to have such violent blanket commandments if there was a requirement to make an offer of peace that would invalidate them.

You might not think it makes sense. But you are making the argument that the Jewish bible doesn't make sense to Jews and the Jewish legal system believes in your reading of the torah. The simple fact is that is not how the oral law treats it or any legal system. The oral law dates to Sinai so all Jews will always say this is how it's read. You can disagree, but now you're not debating Judaism, you're debating literature. 

&gt; Samuel implicitly agreed that it was more right and lawful to destroy the Amalekites utterly than to offer them a chance at peaceful subjugation first, as we see in 1 Samuel 15. 

I do see how you got that from a plain reading of the text. As I said before, Israel and the Kenites had a long standing peace agreement. This passage just means that the peace agreement with the Kenites would be off they allied themselves with Amalek. Amalek was already offered a peace settlement. You're trying to make me prove a negative. The law is that peace settlements were to be offered. It's assumed it was unless the tanakh or the oral law said otherwise.

&gt; You cannot redefine the term ‘Amalekite’. I have yet to see any proof at all for your supposed definition, much less any that would refute the scholarly evidence (or rather, fact) that it means a tribe or nation of people descended from Amalek. And your definition is clearly wrong anyway, since God includes infants, who could not possibly fit your definition, in his commandment to kill the Amalekites.

The oral law is the source. That is where get our definitions of nationhood and laws concerning conversion from. This is based off readings of Ruth. Again, you're arguing literature and not Judaism anymore. Jews believe that the written text is far less than half of the relevant bible. Perhaps Christians would share your readings, but if you're arguing that this is what historical Jews believed, our written and preserved contemporary histories disagree.

&gt; Maimonides, in my opinion, is stretching things enough by applying a rule about sieges to conclude that peace should always be offered before Jews wage war. Although it is, in fairness, a humane thing to do and a credit to him for proposing it. But you stretch things unacceptably far by ignoring any and all arguments that persuasively demonstrate that Amalekites would not have been offered peace, and further still by saying that peace offerings would necessarily have happened all the time, which is not true. 

It's not stretching things. That comes from our Mishna, which brings us to the next point.

&gt; Yup, I'm obviously completely ignorant of anything regarding Jewish law or history, and there's no possible merit to anything I've said. Dead on, sir.

Yes you are and there isn't. You do not know about the Mishna, Tosefta, Gemaras, Midrashim, Aggados, Mishne Torah or any of the law codes. You know your old testament perhaps. That's great. Still irrelevant to what was practiced and believed in ancient Israel or by any historical Jews. We put the torah shebe al pe far higher on the totem pole than plain readings of written law. You can argue against the text all day. But if your thesis is ""The torah and judaism believes in genocide,"" you're wrong because of my authoritative sources and technically coherent readings of the text, even if you disagree with those readings.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You are the one that appears to have stated you are republicrat based solely on the abortion issue. 


That is exactly what the parties want, they get your vote for promising to take away the right of ~1/2 the population to control their destiny, regardless of their other policies which you may or may not agree with.


As a tax-payer, I find the idea of forcing a woman to give birth, which often lands her and the child onto the public dole, a poor choice for spending tax-payer money.


The cost of an abortion or lifetime supply of birth control is infinitesimal when compared to the cost of all the social services, education, food subsidies, medical care, and likely incarceration for mother and/or child. Even if you strip away all of those except the eventual incarceration, it is still a far more costly choice for tax-payers. 


If you want to reduce abortions, increase sex-ed, lobby for free contraception, or a myriad assortment of other things that would reduce the need this procedure to a truly infrequent event. Not that they are really that common to begin with relative to the ~3Bn women on the planet and ~140M live births every year. 

Abortion, along with any other form of birth-control, or medical procedure should be between a woman, her doctor and her conscience/deity of choice. 

Before you ask: NO a woman should not be forced to submit herself in any way to her husband/father/brother/priest/senator/president for advice or permission, assuming she is an adult and/or above the age of sexual consent (both should be the same but that is another conversation).

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","It's low. I did the math on Bonus Bonds returns a while ago (I'm an accountant and did it for personal interest). I don't remember what the exact return is, but if you exclude the major monthly prizes (because you're very very unlikely to receive them) then the interest rate is somewhere between 1 and 2 percent.

Also I want to add that there's no particular reason to believe they'll always be worth $1 each. In principle the fund can decide what the bonds are worth on redemption - although it's a very safe investment and this is highly unlikely to change, the fund in theory could turn around and tell you your investment is actually only worth $0.50 on the dollar.

One more point - I wouldn't invest in this fund on principle. The fund holds extremely safe low maintenance investments - mostly crown bonds and ANZ bonds. The fund is owned by the ANZ group. Depsite the fact that the investments are very low maintenance, ANZ takes a massive cut as a management fee each month. I don't remember the exact amount (it's in their prospectus), but it's extremely large for the relatively small amount of admin work involved.","1328055543"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Heads-up: Most current American animation is terrible, with a few exceptions. We're not living in the golden age of US animation (which was the early nineties to early 2000s). 

Family Guy was great in the early seasons, but is a mockery of its former self. American Dad went from terrible to somewhat enjoyable to barely watchable. South Park is painful to watch these days, it just seems to have gotten more mean spirited as it became less funny. The Simpsons: don't make me cry on my early season DVDs. Futurama is the show that's managed to stay the most consistent but they've the characters are pretty one-note and they've already done pretty much everything imaginable with them, which has pushed the writing into topical gags rather than the character-driven comedy that used to make it such a good show.

It's actually pretty hard to make a comedy show that stays funny for more than maybe five or six seasons - or, at least, it hasn't really been done yet. Animated characters just don't have the depth of personality of live actors and thus wear out their comedic value faster. I'm thinking Disney was actually on to something back when they used to have a hard limit of 65 episodes for their series. A joke isn't funny if it just goes on and on.

The only currently running American shows I enjoy are The Venture Brothers, My Little Pony, The Ricky Gervais Show, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The only one of these that I'd call a truly great show is The Venture Brothers. It's one of the few shows that's allowed to have a developing plotline (and characters!) and this makes it enormously more appealing.

I'm not sure what would be needed to restart creativity in the animation industry. It's not the first time it's gone through a period of relative decline. I'm thinking it probably won't happen until some of the long-running shows stop their runs, and there's more money for some innovative new stuff. Or maybe if people stopped watching crap shows they don't really enjoy out of habit.","1328055543"

* My 12x12 cell had 28 people. There was a toilet, a concrete bench, and enough hard floor space for 3 or 4 of us to sleep at a time. We were mass arrested around 8 PM Saturday, brought into the jail around 2 AM, and kept there until 10 PM Sunday (So... over 24 hours) before being booked, informed of the charges against us, and given phone calls.

* One girl in the cell across from ours told the guards she needed Lexapro or she would go into withdrawl. They ignored the request.

* One of my cellmates was HIV positive. When I last saw him at 2 AM on Monday morning he had not yet been given his medications. **Going 30 hours without HIV medication is really fucking dangerous.**
* As I exited the jail I saw a woman who had just been released lying on the floor. She was having a seizure and being tended to by a couple of firemen.

* In general, the only way to even get guards to acknowledge you (say, if you needed medical attention) was to have all of the people in several adjacent cells pound on the doors as loudly as possible. I later overheard a police officer admit that they were deliberately processing people from the ""rowdier"" cells (i.e. those that had the nerve to demand necessary medical attention) as slowly as possible","1328055544"

These statistics may be true, but mean nothing about actual safety.

Where the statistics do actually relate to rates of crime, little evidence is shown that the guns have anything to do with it. For instance, according to their statistics rape cases reported in England and Wales were rising at roughly the same rate before and after the 1997 firearms act.

The chains have profit at the expense of the customer built in to their business, and the independent places are just flat out dishonest. And that doesn't even cover the laziness of individual mechanics.

Based on past history, Nexus devices come out at most once a year. We bought them thinking this was going to be the best and only current-generation developer phone for at least another year, and were prepared to overlook its flaws for that reason. For them to release a ""fixed"" model almost immediately afterward is just a big slap in the face.

The issue is that it's the *same product*. The Galaxy S III is probably going to come out at about the same time as any new revsion, and it is going to shit all over the GN in terms of specifications - I knew this when I bought my phone and was perfectly happy to make that compromise. I wanted a Nexus phone, even though it was very expensive for what it was, and reasonably (I thought) assumed it was my only choice for the next year.

Obama, by his own admission, modeled ""Obamacare"" on Romney Care.

On your second point, if the only choice between Obama and say, a stick, a clock, my dog, a mailbox or a 1/2 blind cat with only two paws, ANYONE but Barack is going to get my vote.

Romney has already stated he will REPEAL ""Obamacare"". I will hold him to that.

If Obamacare goes in front of the SCOTUS, ""Romneycare"" goes out if they throw out Obamacare.

Regarding your last point, the stories you are not hearing is from those who have been unemployed here in Massachusetts, who are FORCED to pay insurance or the fine.

I did the taxes of a man in 2010 for his 2009 taxes who only made $15,000 a year, and the DOR demanded that he pay the fine. COBRA, in Mass, for him would have cost over $1,300 a MONTH After his rent, groceries and auto expenses, he had $11.00 per week left over.

They didn't care.

Just so you know, for a family plan, it's $1800+ a month. The maximum you can get on unemployment in Massachusetts is $732.00 a week. Do the math.

And those who don't want to work, they get free MassCare. Thank you stupid taxpayers. No fine for them! But if you work, you don't qualify.

The point of my post is there are going to be hundreds of little things that are going to make this program a nightmare, but people just won't listen.

"travel","t5_2qh41","I've done three rtws: five months, three months and seven weeks. I enjoyed them all.

Just some broad tips. 

If you want to keep the budget low, plan more time in SE Asia and Asia and less time in Western countries. In my region be sure to visit NZ and Australia, but also consider Fiji and Hawaii en-route. However, Oz is definitely more expensive than SE Asia so I wouldn't stay here too long. In Europe, plan more time in the countries that used to be behind the Iron Curtain; they are cheaper than Western Europe and can be just as interesting. But still include the majors: London, Paris, Rome, Florence, Venice. Just don't spend as much time in them as in Budapest, Zagreb, Prague, Krakow etc.

I have no problems with how many flights you take or how long you stay in one place; that is very individual. On my first rtw I took 22 flights; I never felt particularly stressed about those. I plan well, but on the day of a flight I go with the flow because I don't have time deadlines on those days.

Allow a day for any flight. Not that it will often take that long, but do not plan any activity other than travel for those days. That takes the stress out of it. If you get there early and have time on arrival, just take it easy and wander the locality. That also helps with jetlag.

When budgeting I allow an average of about US$20 per day for food and another $20 for incidentals like taxis, metros, entry to museums/sites etc. Some places will be cheaper, some dearer, but that works out pretty well as an average for me. Whether it would for you depends a lot on the level of restaurants you choose. For accommodation, that is too variable to guess because the countries and quality you choose will affect that a lot.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh wow.  Thank you for being able to verbalize this issue so well.  It's hard to talk to men sometimes on these forums about rape.

I certainly don't think that I'm the most qualified person to speak about most things in terms of statistics - my major in college was fine art, not law or politics :) ..but I can speak from personal experience and observations, and it's really hard for me to believe that everything I've been through, what my friends have been through, and things that I fear in my city at night are ALL because of 'feminist propaganda.'

I also think it's interesting that people here seem to think that false rape accusations can only happen to men...while these stories are more uncommon, my female roommate actually came very close to being falsely accused of molestation/rape.  She was the personal assistant for a very wealthy family, and their 14 year old son was left alone with her frequently...he ended up sexually assaulting her (didn't get as far as rape, thank god) but when she was on the verge of reporting it to the police and working with a lawyer for a possible lawsuit, the 14 year old boy straight up said that if she tries to take any legal action, then he will lie and say that *she* actually molested him.  She ended up dropping the lawsuit because of the power that this *14 year old* sexual deviant/false accuser had over her.  

^ That was a bit of a rant, but yeah, it really is something to see the constant blindness and apologism of rape (especially on reddit).  It seems as though many posts and topics discussed here blow false rape out of proportion to make it look worse than it actually is.  Don't get me wrong - I certainly am able to empathize with the subject of false accusations. It's a real issue that needs to be recognized and reformed in many ways, so that the accused are protected within their own right.  But, I really do think that rape *actually* happening is a much more of a problem than *false* rape accusations, so it would be nice if there were more open discussions here about *real* rape culture that wasn't constantly down-played with scenarios of women being liars.
I mean, if men can freely talk about the issue of being falsely accused by women, then why can't women freely talk about the issue of being raped by men?

I've tried to explain to many men that there's certain aspects of rape culture for women which aren't fabrications or strictly based on propaganda.  The fact that my twin brother was allowed to stay out until 1:00 am in high school while my curfew was 10:30pm, was because of my gender and because of the obserd amount of date rapes that were happening to teen girls.  The fact that I don't feel okay walking around at night in my area is not because of propaganda - it's because women are 'cat called' left and right where I live.  The fact that an employer rubbed my thigh during my first job interview out of college was not a coincidence, it was because I was a young female in a skirt and he was an arrogant man who thought he could do whatever he wanted in his office.  The fact that my sexual assault in college, and my friends' date rapes were never reported was not because of 'feminist fear mongering,' but because of the shame in itself that does exist with rape, and because in *reality* there is not much that police can actually do to solve this crime.  And if you're from where I'm from - PEOPLE DON'T TRUST THE DAMN POLICE.  Seriously.  Their job around here is to do drug raids, that's pretty much it.  In many communities there is not a trusting relationship with the cops.

- Do you even know 20 women whose candid opinion you trust? If you don't, I doubt this is a subject you're qualified to speak on.

Hmm, I think that I could certainly name about 20 women of whom I trust.  From my own knowledge, I would say that about half of them (10) have either been raped or sexually violated in some way.  And I think that all of them would probably know of women who have experienced the same.  

Anyway, thank's for understanding where I (and many other women) are coming from. This stuff makes me quite angry, too. 

You sound like an awesome and intelligent big brother.  :)

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","For prices I suggest you look up info on schools near to you. It's pretty pointless to compare with other people on this subreddit. 

The important thing to keep in mind when looking for a school is that you shouldn't look at the price-tag first. Most schools let you train a few times for free so you can get to know them. If the vibe is good, you should train there. A bad school that is cheaper is still a bad school. So instead of comparing with what we pay, you should visit some schools for yourself and compare the lessons and then decide.

The reasons you want to take up Martial Arts pretty much fit with any MA in my opinion, what it comes down to mostly is what you prefer to do: if you enjoy stand-up, do kickboxing or boxing, if you enjoy grapling, do judo or BJJ, if you want it all, think about doing MMA. I would advise not to limit yourself: visit the schools and have a look what suits you best.

About your frame, I am 6'3'' too and weigh about 85 kilos (not going to convert, too lazy, but it's lighter than you), however, there are guys in my school who are shoulderheight for me but still kick my ass with one hand on their back. It really doesn't matter that much I think: there aren't specific MA's for big or small people. It's mostly about being (or getting) fit and agile, regardless of height and weight (weight'll probably reduce if you train intensive enough too of course).

Do what you feel comfortable with. I know that sounds like a pretty hollow advice, but trust me, the best thing you can do now is just go to some schools and *train*, the worst thing you can do is skulk around on internet forums *talking* about training.

Good luck and have fun!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Several things, actually... here are the top two:

1.  We hired a hammered dulcimer player and a guitarist to play Pachelbell's Canon as I walked down the aisle.  I'm a hammered dulcimer player, and it's a beautiful instrument that doesn't get enough exposure.  So, we thought the sentiment was nice.  At rehearsal, everything went fine, except that they hadn't practiced prior to that (even though I hired them 6 months prior to the wedding)  Fortunately, they did okay at the rehearsal.  Then, on the day of the ceremony, as I walked down the aisle, the hammered dulcimer player forgot the song and played it HORRIBLY!  And, to top it off, he still charged us.  :(

2.  Later, at the reception, we began to forget all the mishaps from the ceremony.  We were having a blast.  Soon, the DJ called all the bachelors to the floor for the garter toss.  I backed out of the way, so I could get a nice view but not be in tossing/leaping range.  As my husband tossed it, no one moved.  It bounced off of one kid's chest and no one picked it up.  So, he tossed it again... and again.  Finally, on that third try, someone caught it.  Meanwhile, my veil is hovering over a candle.  I didn't realize it until after the third throw... then I started to smell something burning.  My veil was smoldering in the fire, and I had a huge hole in the back of it.  Thankfully, it didn't make it up to my hairsprayed head... or it would have been a much different honeymoon.

I've already passed judgement on myself as worthless. There's no reason for me to be here. I'm just plodding through life on the course that every other young person seems to be on - get through school, get through college, find a job, make a family- basically, just get through life. I don't feel like I'm really enjoying life most of the time, I'm just sort of hanging on. I cry at least once a day, usually three or four times. I'm on medication, and I have a doctor I check in with this week. But man, I just don't see the point. I never have, never will.

Well, I guess that isn't true. The point is love- love of my family. I'm lucky, like you, I suppose, to have a loving, supporting family who wants me to succeed. But I don't know if I want to succeed. I guess I'd like to, but sometimes I don't see the point in even that. You could say I'm a nihilist in a way- there's no point, but I keep on going because I have to, and maybe, some days, because I want to. But those days are very few.

I've never had a lover in my life, and I'm 21. I've held hands once, and hugged only a handful of women. I've never kissed. I feel like I put too much emphasis on young women, but what do young men want if not a beautiful (inside and out) girl to keep them company through rough sailing? It's not like a girl would necessarily be a good thing for me (or her).

However, also under this definition, there is no reason to believe such a system could not have arisen through natural selection.

Numerous people have pointed out already that the eye could have easily been produced by natural selection. I'm not sure if they also mentioned that *there still exist intermediate forms from the evolution of the eye,* and that also *human eyes are not the most advanced.* Similarly, the bacterial flagellum, another common ""example"" has been shown to have at least a couple similar possible evolutionary pathways from a waste excretion system.","1328055584"

"depression","t5_2qqqf","In your opening post you described how you wound a blind cord around your neck, yet in the one I am replying to you say how you will never commit suicide and the only way you would do it is if you could somehow come out as a martyr. There is an error in logic there. 

Also, and I mean this as someone who has dealt with crippling depression most of my adult life, it is another error in logic to say that your depression makes you want to kill yourself. If you continue to treat your depression as if it were a tumor that could be removed, you will find it very difficult to treat it. 

Accepting that you do have depression, that it is a part of you, a constant companion, is a hard thing to accept. Yet when we own ourselves and our actions, it is then we can get the perspective to make changes. 

You stated that you 'completely lost it' that night. It is in these times of crisis that you should call someone who can help you through it. If you do not know or have or trust anyone to do this, call the many national help lines. No shame in that, I have used the national crisis line on several occasions. 

Depression is a mental illness. It is a chemical imbalance, a thought pattern that feeds unto itself. It will tell you terrible and horrible things.  But really, the secret that depression does not want you to know, is that it is really only you. Just you. With the help of therapy, particularly utilizing the treatment plan in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, you can learn to challenge your depression, and ultimately yourself.

This is how people get better. It is not by taking a pill, or smoking weed, or avoiding their problems. These are actions that will temporarily alleviate your depression, yet they wont fix it. You may have noticed that when you get really bad, your thoughts are very negative. Challenging these thoughts, changing your behavior, and learning new ways to cope is the true path to success. 

I will now step down off my soapbox, though I do hope what I have shared with you has helped in some way.  ","1328055593"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a feeling it's because of the way that our laws and history have defined rape as a violent act of power, stigmatizing nonconsensual sex as a horrifying crime. This dichotomy between violent sex predator and virginal victim is inaccurate and unfair: many otherwise good men (and women) can commit rape, whether it be through a lack of communication, a misunderstanding, etc, whatever. Furthermore, rape is not always violent. This puts a pressure on the rape victim: when she accuses their rapist, she is automatically qualifying him as a one of the worst kind of criminals (simply by the way we perceive rape) when there is much more nuance in the umbrella of non-consensual sex. It also thus encourages the backlash against the accuser that we see on reddit and elsewhere, even if the victim was legitimately raped.","1328055596"

&gt;Revitalized water reverses the polarity (negative to positive) of toxic substances such as heavy metals, pesticides, nitrates, etc. These positively charged (+) toxic elements cannot be absorbed into the body, since the cells also have a positive (+) charge and are electromagnetically repelled. These toxic elements pass through the system and are expelled. Furthermore, existing negatively charged (-) toxins are flushed out of the system as they are electromagnetically attracted ( -/+) to the positively charged (+) revitalized water molecules.

What?

&gt;In our units, the water is processed through a double spiraling flowform creating a very powerful vortex energy field. The vortex shape is found everywhere in nature from seashells and plants to antelope horns. It is always the natural path of least resistance that free-flowing water takes in order to keep itself healthy and energized.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not a single thing, but rather his life.

My dad's family used to be part of the bourgeois, small landowning class in China. The communist revolution left his family completely destitute. He had to go to school during the cultural revolution, and just to do extra reading and studying, he would buy candy with his small allowance and trade it to kids who still had books. He was lucky enough that in 1977, they re-established the national test to allow people to go to college, instead of cronyism and bribes. His older brothers and sisters were not so lucky and never were able to go to college. Taking the same test as his teachers, he did well enough to go to a third tier university. Now in college, he was finally able to live up to his potential. He learned english very well, and studied physics/mathematics. He eventually took some exam (not sure what it was exactly) and had one of the top scores in the country, which earned him a full ride to study physics at Yale, a school he had never heard of.  While finishing his PHD, he also learned how to code and program. After finishing his PHD, he went to work on wall street (on the condition he would not need to wear a suit), then studied more programming languages and switched to web design/computer programming that allowed him to work at home.

My dad came to the US with nothing but one small suitcase. To put that into perspective, last year I arrived as a freshman to my dorm with a minivan full of stuff and paying nearly full tuition (even with a twin sister going to NYU).

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","A word about focal lengths:

All other things being equal, higher numbers for focal length means more magnification of the image; or more precisely, a narrower angle of view. 

However, all other things are often not equal. Specifically the sensor size. The angle of view that a lens will capture varies mostly by tha *proportion* of focal length to sensor size. For instance, what is called a ""normal"" lens on an SLR is usually of a focal length about equal to the diagonal measurement across the sensor. For film, this is 45-50mm; for most DSLRs, it's around 35mm. We say ""normal"" because it represents an approximation of what we ordinarily see when we look with our eyes, excluding peripheral vision; a viewing arc of around 45 degrees. However, a ""normal"" lens is a much shorter focal length for a pocket camera. On the S95, it's around 13 mm. 

To help clear up the confusion, camera makers often express focal lengths as ""35mm equivalents."" That's why the S95 is advertised as having a 28mm wide angle lens: because that's the equivalent lens on a 35mm for that perspective, and a more meaningful number to most people than the 6.0mm that is the literal number. The long end is also expressed as a 35 equiv, 105mm, which is not very long but long enough for the applications you described. 

ISO is a measure of sensitivity, but not all high ISOs are created equal. The S95 does pretty well up to 3200 but noise gets very noticeable. The pop-up flash stays nicely hidden when not is use, which with this camera is most of the time; and when it does come up its a bit less likely to get blocked by your finger. The slightly increased distance from the lens also improved lighting, although slightly. 

You've done a good job of narrowing the selection. Each of those suggestions is an excellent camera.  Out of the cameras you've mentioned, I would personally recommend the S95, and recently bought one myself. It's a good ""enthusiast"" model that doesn't stifle the creative photographer much, but it still has the silly gimmick features for casual users. My favorite thing about it is the plenitude of knobs and buttons which make everything easier to adjust without as much reliance on menus. 

Definitely worth pursuing the sidebar links and photo class. These will help you to get the most out of a more advanced camera like the S95 or LX5. ","1328055605"

When they said it because they thought it was funny I clarify that I don't find it funny and that it's in fact very disrespectful. When they're at my home I tell them to leave if they want to make any more jokes. Sometimes they did not mean it funny and just don't see why I'm upset. I usually argue like that:

*""I put about one thousand euro in the healthcare of my bunnies last year. I am a vegan for about thirteen years now. I've spent countless nights watching for my sick bunnies and fed them their medicine every two hours of the night. You don't see me making jokes about eating/kicking/hunting your children, do you? Respect the love I give for my family just as I respect your family. Think about this and when you want to make another of these jokes, I'm through with you.

For more details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive#Capacity particularly the passages:

&gt; The practice of using prefixes assigned to powers of 1000 within the hard drive and computer industries dates back to the early days of computing.[32] By the 1970s million, mega and M were consistently being used in the powers of 1000 sense to describe HDD capacity.[33][34][35] As HDD sizes grew the industry adopted the prefixes “G” for giga and “T” for tera denoting 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000 bytes of HDD capacity respectively.

[...]

&gt;Creating confusion, operating systems report HDD capacity in different ways.

My post was a bit of conjecture and humor, which you obviously didn't appreciate. Sorry I wasn't up to your expectations. I truly wish there was a ""rolling my eyes"" expression available. Especially since, for the most part, I was in agreement with your post. I just don't understand why you seemingly took that as an offense. I mean, c'mon, ""culture"" and ""history"" are kind of inter-related. To say that it is ""fucking retarded"" to think an individual in the ANA can do anything due to a historical context is, indeed, fucking retarded. Especially since I never fucking said otherwise, retard. My point was that people often learn by seeing others doing it, and then by also doing it themselves. If they grew up in a war-torn shit-hole, the chances are pretty good that they have seen others shooting a rifle. They obviously didn't fucking learn too well. For some reason, they don't seem capable of learning much at all. I'm sure you have seen those videos of ANA recruits that can't even perform jumping jacks.  

You think I was trying to force ""my personal knowledge"" on you or anybody? Well, I don't know where you are coming from with that, so I am going to leave it be. All I know is that you got your pants all pissy on a post about a dumbass Liberian holding a rifle in a ludicrous stance. 

There is a really simple way for you to grasp the situation here. First, place your hands squarely on your shoulders. Then with a firm, but gentle, pulling motion, you should be able to ease your head out of your ass. With that done, you can get a better concentration of oxygen in your lungs so that you can think clearly.

Not at all, they're protected by public interest and the laws of western liberal democracy, and should that not be enough, there is plenty of room in Europe and elsewhere for those critical of U.S actions and policy. 

The evidence does not support your position of intimidated or directed advocacy - these NGO's were, among other things: regularly and loudly critical of the U.S invasion of Iraq, the secret transportation of terror suspects to torture cells in the middle east and the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo (which by the way you wouldn't even know about to cite in this discussion if it weren't for such groups).

In addition to this, like i said in my previous comment, and which you ignored, we would (at the very least) have websites calling out such foul practice as U.S intimidation or coercion of these NGO's, and if it was happening as you say they would also be unlikely to push for prosecuting U.S presidents and other members of government as they have been doing.    

&gt;Persecuting isn't necessary, in the same way that persecuting media organizations isn't necessary to keep them in line. Merely withholding support and access is sufficient....

This is apples and oranges. Human Rights NGO's don't need government support, that's the whole point. they rely on public networks for both finances and for developing their investigations. ie... http://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/faq#who-finances-ai

In contrast the modern media have a strong profit/entertainment motive which keeps them more favorable to playing nice.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","You make a couple of good points about my false dichotomy, but your percentages are way off base. 

Weak atheism means ""I don't believe in any religion, but maybe there's some other type of God that we just don't understand."" 

Strong atheism is ""There are no gods. Period.""

Agnostic, in common usage means ""I don't know if God exists or not."" (The original meaning is ""Mankind cannot have knowledge of God."")

I have never heard the terms weak and strong theist, and your assignment of percentages to a person's level of belief is so bizarre that I think you might be trolling me. You might assign a number to a person's level of apathy or passion on a particular religion, but that's not the same as belief. Religion is not a casino game. I think that for all of these you are assigning arbitrary numbers that have no relation to reality. 

The bible lays out a pretty clear roadmap for salvation when you actually read it. I'm pretty sure other religions do the same. If you are apathetic about your religion, that means you have doubts about it's veracity. Given a real education on the subject and forced to choose afterward whether they believe or not, I think the percentage of atheists in the US would double or triple. Of course this is a hypothetical situation where my false dichotomy would become a true dichotomy, but I hope you can see my point there.","1328055624"

It's not a retardation of personally maturity, it's just a fact that we now have the time and resources that allow us to wait to get really serious and completely settle down. I see that as a positive thing, personally. 

Anyway, my point is, why compare us to the past to make your point? That just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I mean, thirty is practically a quarter of a life now, so are you just going to ignore that because it's not convenient to your argument? If we're going to use your basic reasoning, I say if one still has almost 3 quarters of his/her life left, not ""having it together"" seems pretty acceptable to me.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","The MoPac toll lanes may be bullshit (I haven't yet decided) but if they are it's not because of ""double taxation.""

Nowhere is it written that you can be taxed only once for something. The money your employer pays you is subject to income tax, and then you pay other taxes with what's left over — sales tax, property tax, gas tax, cigarette tax. That's double taxation and it's been going on for years.

Cities also build roads downtown with our tax dollars and then charge us money to park on them. They do that because if they didn't you'd never be able to find any parking downtown when you needed it.

The MoPac toll lanes have a fluctuating toll, which means that it's much more like a [congestion charge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing) than a typical toll road.

You're already nervous about asking her out, you should probably make your first date a situation that is as comfortable as possible.

IMHO, you're better off asking her to coffee or a low key date this week, going somewhere more serious next week, then discussing V-day with her. Who knows? You might get a few dates in and decide she's a headcase, which means you just saved yourself a bunch of money on an expensive valentines day outing.

But seriously, the best way to ask her out is to be blunt. Come up to her after class, talk to her about something for a few minutes, then before you part ways, ask her if she'd like to get coffee or dinner sometime this week.

""Bed Sharing
There are some reports of infants being suffocated by overlying by an adult, particularly when the adult is in an unnaturally depressed state of consciousness, such as from alcohol or mind-altering drugs. Co-sleeping on sofas has emerged as a major risk factor in 1 study (Peter J. Fleming, Department for Child Health, Bristol, UK, unpublished data presented at a meeting convened by US Consumer Product Safety Commission, Bethesda, MD, December 9, 1998). Others have shown bed sharing with multiple family members in an adult bed to be particularly hazardous for the infant. Although overlying may be the mechanism in some of these cases, soft sleep surfaces, entrapment, and the likelihood of rolling to the prone position in such circumstances also may have a role. The risk of SIDS associated with co-sleeping is significantly greater among smokers.1153–55 Some behavioral studies have demonstrated that infants have more arousals and less slow-wave sleep during bed sharing, but no epidemiologic evidence exists that bed sharing is protective against SIDS.""

&gt;Maybe it would be better to think of it this way – there are certain cities and neighborhoods where you are more likely to be a victim of crime than other cities and neighborhoods. If somebody gets mugged in a particularly dangerous section of the city, will you say ""well, it shouldn't be a crime because they should have known it was dangerous to go there""?

You seem to have flipped things on me a bit.  In this case, the potential rape victim is the person getting mugged, and the mugger the rapist, not the other way around.  It is not the person's fault that they got mugged.  Like the person getting raped, yes, they should have been more prudent and more aware of their surroundings.  But the victim is never at fault. They did not burgle or rape themselves, someone else took advantage of the situation.

I can't agree with vln enough about getting a teacher. Even the most basic things, tuning, bow pressure, can be very difficult to learn by yourself. Without them, however, it's very very hard (and discouraging) to get the instrument to produce a sound that doesn't make you want to cry.

A last suggestion, if you live with people you may want to invest in a [practice mute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mute_\(music\)#Practice_.28i.e._hotel.29). Gaining skill in the violin can take a lot of practice, and result in a lot of mistakes. After you get a basic idea of how things are supposed to sound, having a practice mute can prevent frayed nerves around the house.

"nethack","t5_2qo3l","I have to disagree on the Helm of Brilliance.

Yea, he can do all of that, but its a ton of work and at least 1 burned wish, and for what? 

Being able to cast Magic missile with decent failure?  Daggers should do fine for the rare occasion where a ranged attack is needed.   Even if he had a magic missile spell book and knew the spell how often could he cast it once he picked up the ammy of Yendor with the increased energy cost?  He'll never wear a robe in combat since the cloak of magic resistance is too important, so there really aren't many spells he'll ever want to use in combat.

As for ID, again assuming he even has the book AND has a robe... yea it's great... when you get it early.  By now, what is left to ID? Not a whole lot and he'll probably find enough ID scrolls by the time hes done with Gehennom to do any IDing he needs done, especially if he prioritizes correctly, like price IDing his rings and only IDing the 200 ones in the hope of getting free action.  This late in the game the value is severely diminished.  The best thing he could hope to find at this point is speed boots and those self ID anyway.

An elven helm on the other hand is so common I'd be extremely surprised if there aren't a bunch just laying around on the dungeon floor he never thought to pick up.  

Is it worth doing if a helm of brilliance and spellbook of ID falls into his lap? Sure.  Is it worth burning a wish for?  Not in my opinion, not unless he gets lucky and finds another wand of wishing or something.

It's not so much that a helm of brilliance is useless, its that I don't think the marginal benefit is worth a wish that could be used for so much more.","1328055668"

However, some user made a pun relevant to the OP's topic. Then another person joined in. Pretty soon the thread was stickied and the whole userbase was enjoying trying their hands at crafting the most clever pun they could come up with.

I know. I have started a sub. We are now at 6k membership after like 4-5 months. We are now growing at nearly 50-100/day. Most users in subs are non-active anyway - so that number is stupid. In addition - more doesn't equal better if they don't want the same thing you want as a mod.

&gt;It stopped being his the second he stopped wanting it.

He clearly does want it (or he would step down) - he just doesn't want it to be what you want. 

Seriously - start your own sub. People will follow if they agree with you. 

I hated /r/fitness so I started /r/weightroom. It is now exactly what I want and has a great community that is growing rapidly. We strictly enforce the vision it was started with and always will. I don't care that is only has 6% of the /r/fitness membership. The quality of posts is worlds higher (IMO), the community overall is more geared to a goal I want to achieve, and we share the same no-bullshit attitude. It is exactly what I wanted. We have told numerous people to leave if they didn't like that attitude or the tone of the sub. That is how simple it is. ","1328055671"

I actually think he is slowly becoming a sociopath as the series progresses.  It seems more like a descent into a state where he is completely relinquishing his humanity and becoming a monster.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","This is a really common experience for someone who is new to anal sex.  The reason this happens is because the brain hasn't yet adjusted to seeing the anus as an erogenous zone.  I mean think about it, the only sensations she's ever experienced anally would be the sensation of needing to poop.  The brain doesn't know any better then to interpret your fingers as the same thing.  Don't worry though there are ways to make this easier.  I tend to think of anal sex as something that is more of an acquired taste such as coffee.  Some people like it immediately, some need to get used to it to like it, and some may never like it at all.  To help ""acquire"" a taste for anal stimulation the best thing you can ever do is to stimulate her clitoris while simultaneously stimulating her ass.  If you can bring her to orgasm while she has fingers or a butt plug in her ass it will allow her brain to rewire itself to associate anal stimulation with pleasure.  Think of it similarly to when people add sugar to coffee.  The sugar sweetens it and makes it easier to drink and then eventually the person will start to love the rich bitter flavor of the coffee itself.  Anal sex works this way for most people in the beginning.  Try combining clitoral and anal stimulation and see where it takes you.  I did this in the beginning when I was getting into anal and I discovered that the additional anal stimulation makes my clitoral orgasms incredibly powerful and more intense, now I can get enough of anal stimulation.","1328055678"

It is a difficult situation. Some people do have *very* strong opinions about such things. There are vegetarians who *would* rather starve than violate their beliefs, same with Jews, and probably Muslims too. Personally, when I was in the hospital, I just asked for a vegetarian meal because it would be at least kosher *enough*.

Completely compartmentalized, I had a huge drive and deeply perved fantasy life and while the path could have been shortened had I known I was on it and where it was leading, it was more a matter of unlocking what was there rather than turning me in to something I wasn't already.  

I came to it with a decent amount of stated and conscious perversion, so I had obvious potential.  And while her libido and desires outstripped mine in practice early on, we have come to discover that I'm at least as driven as her libido-wise and what's more, her [7]s are my [5]s.  When I get to her [10] I'm only about [8].  When I go to my [10] she is happiest with the kink, since obviously that is a [12] for her and part of her kink is to be taken past her limits(albeit safely).  

EDIT: I should say, also, that her [12] is actually her [10] when you come down to it.  Her scale may be a bit misaligned, so she's calling [8] a [10].  At least I think.  I don't know, but obviously by my scale 10 is the highest it goes and she goes there and is happy, so it may be more that she's happy with a 10 but can't get there without being taken there. I don't know what goes on in her head most times.  The scale thing has been useful for us in conversation but it has its limits in application I guess.  It doesn't matter.

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;Let's take a religious person for example. We'll say he is a christian. If an example is given of him doing something good in his life for himself, his community, the world, etc., it is written off as ""He did this because he is a good person, not because of his religion.""
If that same person did something bad in his life, to his community, to the world etc., if it written off as ""He did this because he is a christian. Following christianity makes him a bad person."" Not, ""He is a bad person who happens to be christian.""
I agree and enjoying seeing questions about the religion of christianity (any religion of course, but still using this example). I don't agree with damning people who do bad things for being christians. They would have done these horrible things without their religion or not. Just because someone wants to filter their hate through a medium doesn't make the medium bad.

This is the part of your examples that I kept thinking, ""WTF is he talking about? When does this happen?""

&gt;I could say Phillips screwdrivers tell me to hate gays and I'd be considered fucked up in the head. I say the Bible tells me to hate gays and there's a problem with the Bible and the religion.

Perhaps you've seen atheists make this comment about religion:

""You can safely assume that you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do."" --Anne Lamott

Note that the comment is as much about the people who use religion to justify their bigotry as it is about religion itself.

&gt;Tim Tebow is made fun of because he is christian. Why? He is a great person, does amazing work in the community, and is a wonderful role model. He is honestly a good-hearted individual who is considered faulty because he is christian. That's just necessary hate.

Tebow is not made fun of JUST because he is christian; he is made fun of because he makes a point to show off his christianity in a way that even for christians makes no sense, and in fact, there are even bible verses that proscribe what he does. The theme of every Tebow comment I ever heard was not, ""Wow, Tebow is a christian, what a jerk."" The theme was more along the lines of ""Tim, are you trying to tell me that your god gives a damn about who wins a football game? Seriously? Not starving kids, but god takes time to coach you on your game?"" The criticism is against Tebow's hypocrisy about his professed faith, not the faith itself.","1328055693"

.. but I know what you mean.. so I'll contribute.

Reddit &amp; Piracy has made me lose faith in humanity. Reddit has a much more diverse crowd than it used to.. but it still has very clear majorities. Atheism and Liberal/Progressive are two of those mentalities that are in the majority. It bothers me that I share those mentalities but am on the complete opposite side of reddit on piracy. 

I DON'T SUPPORT SOPA/PIPA! I just think that reddit's ability to justify piracy is biased and self-serving.. as well as immoral. 

I'm not on a high horse or anything. I have pirated content and probably will again. I don't claim to be a moral person at all times (anyone that does is full of shit)... I know one of the immoral things I do is pirate digital media on occasion. I don't abuse it. I could apply all of the nonsense justifications that other redditors do.. and I have in the past... but recently, I just see through it.

I lose a little faith in humanity when reddit.. which at one point and still is to a lesser degree a more intelligent demographic than a completely random sample group.. can't see it... or more accurately, won't see it. ","1328055702"

But the other thing we should expect is for this mess to be used to pull down Obama.  Is that appropriate or not? 

I agree that a certain degree of the credit or blame for the execution and competence of various agencies needs to accrue to the chief executive. For example, the decision to go into Iraq in 2003 has to stop with G W Bush.  The decision to drop a nuke in WWII definitely stp[s with Truman.  But... for  example do we blame Truman for the loss of the USS Indianapolis?  That was a major failure, but is it Truman's fault? 

And the Fast/Furious thing is similar. It's a mess, a scandal, it's bad government.  But is it Obama's responsibility?

Someone is actually responsible.  Someone made the decision to do that, and some boss ok'd the idea.  That's bad, and they should bear responsibility. But you can bet the hot-potato game will occur, and there will be a ""fall guy""  who may or may not actually bear the true responsibility for it.

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I'm brand new to all this but I just wanted to chime in. I really really really like this company and here are my reasons why:

Last Quarter - I think CoD and Skylanders sales will be impressive. For WoW, Asia is losing subscribers but in South America I believe there is growth.

Looks like you're right, price has dropped after the recent earnings calls.  If it drops, I'll buy some more. If it goes up I may contemplate selling to re-buy on a dip but I should really discipline myself and hold. In any case, I do plan on buying more if the price is right.

Short to long term, D3, more SC2, more revenue from digital services, more Skylanders, more sequels to everything! I think they are going to try to reboot Guitar Hero and Tony Hawk (this may be happening already).

Long term, there will be the new MMO and other new IPs that Activision will be sure to make sequels out of. It's what they're good at.  It's what Blizzard is good at.

No debt. Decent amount of cash. I don't really know about all those ratios and stuff (which probably tells you I'm some kind of idiot). Perhaps the stock is on the 'expensive' side but again, I don't really know how to judge that yet.

Quince dólares diarios debería sobrar.

Recién hablaba con mi novia, en mi oficina pedimos unas viandas que nos llevan el almuerzo todos los días. Nos sale $100 el plato, que son cinco dólares (ligeramente más). En el trabajo de ella comen por menos (alrededor de $70 u $80). 

La carrera esa es en la Facultad de Humanidades, que es en una zona bastante céntrica. Por ahí deberías tener bastantes opciones como para elegir, ya que hay mucho movimiento durante el día.

Actualmente sale $18, pero mañana mismo aumenta a $19. Poco menos de un dólar. Dudo que aumente demasiado de aquí a un año, aunque es posible que llegue a $20 (sí, al lado del metro a 3 mexicanos, es carísimo, lo sé).

Con lo que sé de México (que no es mucho, estuve allí sólo dos semanas), los precios te van a resultar caros. Otra cosa es la temperatura.

"tDCS","t5_2sfqg","Depends on what you want to do.  In general, the anode (red) raises the resting membrane potential of the underlying cortex, making it ""easier"" for those neurons to fire.  So, you can say that the anode helps to turn on the brain area under it.  The cathode does the opposite.  Note that the electrodes shouldn't actually be causing the neurons to fire, they're just making it easier (or harder) for those neurons to fire.  To give you an example, putting the anode over primary visual cortex (right above that bump on the back of your head, called the inion) is supposed to lower your contrast detection threshold, so that you can theoretically see things that would otherwise be too low contrast to see (see e.g. Antal, Nitche, &amp; Paulus, 2001).  

You can put the other electrode (the reference electrode) kind of anywhere you want, but it needs to be at least 8 centimeters from the active electrode or you'll just shunt current through the skin and it will really have no effect.  Also, extra-cephalic (not-on-the-head) reference electrodes can be good depending on what you want to do, just don't put it too close to the chest cavity to avoid cardiac effects: contralateral deltoid muscle is a popular extra-cephalic reference location.  This way, you don't end up inhibiting something else in the brain.  You can also use a larger sponge for the reference electrode, which will exponentially diminish the current density.  Also, sponges that don't have a lot of holes in them are better -- they create uniform current density and avoid hotspots, which can be uncomfortable or even cause scalp irritation.

So... if you want to mess with vision/contrast detection, put the active electrode on the back of your head, about 3cm above the inion.  If you want to mess with motion detection in the presence of noise, put it 3cm up and 5cm lateral (over V5/MT).  If you want to mess with working memory or problem solving, a frontal or even prefrontal location is more appropriate.  Many papers refer to the [international 10-20 EEG system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-20_system_(EEG)) when reporting their electrode locations, so if you find a paper whose effects you want to replicate/try out, that's a good place to start.

Basically: eat your green veggies, grassfed animals/butter/cheese, and some fermented food like kimchi/natto/tempeh every so often and don't sweat it too much.

1. You can legislate the poor to become poorer by making all the rules favor the 1%.

2. What one person earns through hard work he can use to purchase legislation to prevent others from earning too. (corruption)

3. The government creates money that it gives to the 1% at .01% interest. It is created out of thin air.

4. You can multiply wealth by borrowing against it and using the stock market to legally gamble it in a corrupted market. If you lose the government will bail you out.

5. When 1% gets the idea that they control the fortunes of the 99% and then try to control the economy by corrupting the system with their money it is the beginning of the end of the 1%.

Obama is representing the 1%... So is the Republican candidate. Don't be fooled, the 1% purchased both parties. Blaming one party is what they want you to do. Both parties are corrupt.

That said I prefer to run Cleanse/Flash on my carries as flash can make great positioning in certain fights and save you form certain skill shots ie) Ashe Arrow, Ezreal Ult, Ahri Charm, Bandage Toss, etc. And Cleanse is basically a QSS but more powerful, so you have a summoner worth ~1600 gold from level 1 and you sacrifice no damage.

Background APIs are not using CPU cycles, they are stored in RAM until they are unloaded, depending on the app type. Very few types of apps are even allowed to stay active (unsuspended) for more than a few seconds.

Strangely enough, this is almost *exactly* how processes are managed on Android, the only difference being that Android is less strict about apps demanding CPU cycles and staying awake, and poorly developed apps are more common.

I love Android and use a Galaxy Nexus as my phone (I love it!), but I feel inclined to point out just how wrong you are. Also, on pricing. 4S is the flagship Apple phone. I would argue that either the Galaxy Nexus or the Razr MAXX are the top tier Android phones on Verizon, and both are $300 for the same storage, while ignoring the lower price point offered by the 4S for a lower-storage model.

In fact, in the sixth photo, I believe every single shadow I've used is matte. I use a MAC 217 brush and place the roundest end of the brush directly in my crease, and just use a sort of windshield wiper motion to deposit the color. I always use a very light amount of shadow on my brush and slowly build up the color. Also, make sure you are doing something with your brows. That can make a big difference in your ability to carry makeup on the eyes. I find that when you have perfectly groomed and filled in brows, very little looks ""too dramatic.""

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","What does it mean to be a part of the larger organism? Fun fact: Of the 100 trillion cells that make up ""you,"" only *one in ten* actually have your DNA. Are those cells not a part of the larger organism? You couldn't survive without a great number of them. So I see no reason to think that there is a requirement to have the host's DNA to be considered a part of the larger organism.

My point still remains that you've gone from the statement that human rights should be given to any organism with human DNA to qualifier after qualifier. Not just any organism, any *living* organism. Not skin cells, though, even though they're living and have a full set of human DNA. We could go on, but hopefully my point is sinking in. We need some rational basis of deciding when to give human rights to an organism. That point, I argue, is in utero, but when? A collection of cells surely isn't deserving of human rights. On the other hand, a baby that is 5 minutes from birth surely isn't any less deserving of rights than a 5 minute old newborn. Roe v. Wade says it is at 20 weeks when the heart/lung system develops. Prior to that time, there is absolutely no possible hope of the survival of the fetus outside of the mother no matter what. I'm fond of using when the cerebral cortex develops as the measure of when personhood starts.

"math","t5_2qh0n","The following solution assumes ideal hexagonal packing density. If n is chosen such that this packing is not possible, your problem becomes much more complicated. 

Choose a diameter such that a/d is a whole number, and (b/d) + (r) is a whole number. n circles will consist of rows with a/d circles, and columns of (b - d/2)/d. The number of circles, n, is (a/d)((2b-d)/2d). n = (2ab - ad)/(2d^2 ). **2nd^2 + ad - 2ab = 0**, and use quadratic equation to solve. Once you have found d, check .25d, .5d, 2d, 4d, etc. as they will likely work as well.

The highest packing density you can achieve for circles in a plane is about 90% - I.e. 90% of your surface will be covered by the circles, and the gaps between circles will account for 10% of the space. The primary complication is avoiding excess space at the edges. If your box is 48 inches wide, using 3 circles with d=13 inches will leave 7 inches of space at the end of a row. As the rows are staggered, the next row will cover d/2 of that excess, or 6.5 inches. That still leaves .5 inches of wiggle, a clearly non-optimal packing. 

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CirclePacking.html

Looking at the linked picture of hexagonal packing, assume each circle has d=1. That means the height of a rectangle drawn around them would be a=6, and it's width would be b=7.5. The 6 rows of 7 means that there are 42 circles. These numbers match up with the above equation.
If you wanted to go for half the diameter, a and b remain the same, but now there are 12 rows of 14, for n=168.  Using the equation above, d=-.52655... (a negative diameter is impossible) or d=.5 (the correct solution).

tl,dr: It's not as simple as choosing a d based on an n. You need the exactly appropriate value of n for this to work, and some values of a and b aren't ideal for this at all.","1328055752"

So, in a Libertarian society you'll have a lot of charity organizations and hospitals, if only because people working there are respected and looked up to.

And you'd be surprised by how kind and charitable people actually are, if you only give them the opportunity to be so (especially when somebody's health is on the line). People LOVE to give. They're practically obsessed with it (speaking personally). TL;DR: Don't worry about it!","1328055755"

"skiing","t5_2qig7","I switched a few years back.  Some general tips and things I've noticed:

 * Take a lesson.  Teaching yourself will give you bad habits that are hard to correct down the line.  A good instructor will give you tips and drills to do on your own.

 * Read [Allen and Mike's TeleTips Book](http://www.amazon.com/Ms-Really-Cool-Telemark-Tips/dp/B000YU8QWK).  The book is full of useful drills and diagrams.  Both guys started skiing on pins and have instructed teleing for NOLS for years.  I found Paul Parker's [Free Heel Skiing](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Heel-Skiing-Telemark-Techniques-Conditions/dp/0898864127) useful as well.

 * Most beginners fail to distribute their weight 50/50.  Almost always the extra weight is on the downhill si, as you're falling back to alpine habits.

 * Drive the cuff.  Most new tele-ers don't apply enough pressure to the cuffs of the downhill boot, forcing you into the backseat.

 * Maintain an aggressive body position.  Think of all tele skiing like steep alpine skiing.  A quiet upper body, pointed down the fall line.  You should be plumb with gravity, not leaning into the hill.

 * Ski without poles (and with loose boots in walk mode).  This will force you to develop balance, and not rely on plastic boots and rigid bindings.","1328055761"

They are dogs that can be fantastic pets or very bad creatures to have around.  Like a gun or other dangerous item, any dog in the wrong hands can be dangerous. The problem with this bread is that they are very strong and not as likely to nip, if they are poorly trained.  Any animal can be a pet when in the proper hands...even polar bears are routinely trained to be gentle around people, but I certainly would not want them being owned by my neighbor that keeps his car on blocks.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","That flare could actually be caused by holding something in front of the lens as opposed to just sun flare. 

I will occasionally grab a ton of leaves or feathers, or use my finger to put right in front of lens while shooting and it gives that flare-y, lightleaky look. Also I've heard fashion photogs using a bit of petroleum jelly on a UV filter to get some cool effects with light. She's also using very fast lenses so anything right in front of the lens goes out of focus and becomes a blurred smudge of light. 

As far as post processing goes... It's going to be hard to get tones/colors like that in Lightroom primarily. You could try using VCSO Film Emulators for Lightroom and I believe Alien Skin Exposure has a Lightroom plugin as well. 

It also seems that she used a strobe on this to balance out the natural lighting on this image. 

Hope this helps!

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","Thank you for bringing this up. Any time there's a post about a legitimate question or concern about the fandom, I feel like anyone who dares to challenge the status quo or think critically gets shouted down. I believe most of the people in this thread, myself included, have commiserated in other posts about feeling excluded or about problematic aspects of the fandom that get shoved aside really callously by people who don't share the same views. To be honest it's gotten to the point where I'm feeling pretty disillusioned with the fandom in general and the subreddit in particular.

The fact is, the mods need to put out a more definite idea of what the subreddit stands for and what kinds of behaviors are acceptable. If we're truly going to love and tolerate then the mods need to crack down on the sexism, misogyny, and ableism in the subreddit. We should be able to recognize that aspects of the show - yes, even Derpy Hooves - are problematic and we should be able to discuss that without being belittled. (Seriously though, her portrayal was fucked up and ableist as hell, but at no point did I feel comfortable expressing that lest I get dogpiled upon by people who think they're the arbiters of what's offensive and what isn't.) 

As a female fan of the show I do not feel like /r/mylittlepony is a safe space for me or any non-male or critical fan to express our opinions honestly. Meanwhile there are straight males who write posts about coming out of the pony closet as though liking a television show meant for young girls is anything even remotely similar to being queer or trans, which is so repugnant and offensive that I don't have the words to express it. At the same time, a lot of them neglect to recognize the inherent sexism in their struggle as a fan of the show, since people look down on MLP because it's for girls. We also need to recognize that although there is a large adult/male fanbase, this is primarily a show for young girls and we should strive to uphold the ideals that the show espouses, including being respectful to girls and women (and all people, obviously).","1328055773"

Only reason I didn't get the Canon 50mm 1.4 was because I have the 1.8 it it fulfills my needs at that focal length.  Wanted a wider lens for the crop sensor on the T3i.  I find the 50mm is a bit too narrow on the crop.

Outdoors at events I still use the  50mm 1.8 sometimes, but more often it stays at home and I just use my Canon 70-200 f2.8 when the sun is out.  I might even get rid of my 50mm all together.  I think with the 30mm and the 70-200mm you have all bases covered for most subject matter.","1328055774"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I will give a complex and a simple explanation. 

Simple: Some big place called ICANN ""runs the domain world"". Godaddy pays them ~$5 for domains, anything more that you pay is profit for godaddy. You can do this as well, but it's not a profitable decision until you're in a spot where you're maintaining 5,000+ domains.

Complex: You can get into this business one of two ways. Prior to hitting the ""5000 domain mark"", you can get a ""domain reseller"" account somewhere. Netearthone.com, enom.com, resell.biz, and about 10,000 other places can do this. Some, like enom, require a hefty deposit. Others, like netearthone, require zero deposit. You ""add funds"" to your account, and then when someone places an order at your store front (or via the API of a compatible billing system), the domain is registered with your company name as the registrar, and your ""domain price"" is deducted from your reseller account, regardless of how much more you charged the customer. Option 2, is to apply for ICANN accreditation. This is only profitable after about the 5000 domain mark. In simple terms, there is a HEFTY fee to be ICANN accredited, but your ""price per domain"" will be much cheaper than if you're a reseller somewhere.

Hope that helps! I have ~10 years experience in the web hosting/domain reselling world, and currently run a web hosting company. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer! =)","1328055775"

All other things considered, this does sound the most plausible to me, but it's definitely not the only possibility.

&gt; Also, if they feared for their safety, getting out of the cab to confront those kids seems like an odd choice to make. I thought that they were pulled from the cab, as the news first reported.

Agreed 100%. Maybe the guy lost his temper and thought he'd get out and be a tough guy.

1) You have poor scouting info of your opponent (so don't know what to make or how much of it you need) --&gt; in which case you scout immediately and figure it out

2) You're under no pressure, you scout, see nothing coming and you're waiting on critical tech (saving gas for mutas, saving resources for corruptors/broods, etc.)

What you don't want to do is save resources and not have larva banked. If you have a ton of larva as well, it's not that bad. But again, you only want to do this if you don't know what to make (at which point you better starting trying to figure it out) or you're waiting for a specific tech structure to finish.

Generally though, if you're banking resources you're not playing efficiently. You shouldn't be in a situation where you're not sure what the optimal units to make are or how many of them to make (ie, you should be scouting constantly). If you are scouting and know exactly what you need, there is no reason to bank resources (aside from the waiting for specific tech reason).

EDIT: To clarify about 1, the reason you're banking here is because you don't know whether your safe to invest in tech/expansions or whether you need an army now. So you save a bit while you scout and figure out what you're free to do.","1328055780"

Grow a pair.  Or if you can't afford a tip ask someone else to make it up for you.  I give everyone the same service no matter what they look like.  So that means you got amazing service that constitutes a tip (and if you didn't get outstanding service then there's a manager at your table comping your whole ticket or at least a meal or something).  This tip that you refuse to give me because you can't afford is the payment for the service rendered.   

So the 5 bucks you short the waiter/delivery driver, that's our 5 bucks to buy a bag of potatoes or a new jacket.  You are just a selfish prick.  You ask for service yet don't render the ""voluntary"" payment.  We have problems too yet we are in a job that we are using to fix those problems.

I understand that IPL needs to generate revenue from videos/ads like this, but I think creating exciting and compelling video material will drive views (perhaps not as much as auto-play, but hopefully something comparable).

They're still incredibly complex, amazing, sometimes passionate creatures.  Personally I believe they're immortal souls that will continue to grow and change (or become more stagnant) . . . and at least part of what spurs their growth, for better and worse, is their tiny little interactions with people like you and me and the fellow behind the service counter.  Yeah, the things they think about may not be *relevant* to us, and they may not be all that *deep* by our thinking, but they're still *important* in a way because they're constantly shaping a real *person*.

And people are always important.

So a lot of people might not be all that interesting or relevant.  I totally get that.  They can be annoyingly incapable of critical reasoning, and appallingly wasteful of their time and energy.  I feel your frustration.  But please, **please** don't ever fall into the trap of thinking they're worthless or, well, less than human.

I don't have time to read every citation on that page, but two stand out:

&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. 2003 National Crime Victimization Survey. 2003.

&gt;U.S. Department of Justice. 2004 National Crime Victimization Survey. 2004.

Alright - DOJ stuff probably can be trusted for accuracy.

So I jump to their website:

&gt;Summary: The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a **nationally-representative sample** of residential addresses since 1972

So your entire collection is based on a sample of US addresses, and from this sampling we get 1 in 6 ?  The interviews are conducted face-to-face for all respondents 13 and older, and for 11 and 12-year-olds, face-to-face for the first three interviews unless the guardian insists on the use of a proxy.

So this would have me believe that these people who were interviewed would admit in person to a US Census department worker that they had been the victim of some sexual crime, but they would not admit the same to the police?

I have a hard time believing that.  In general, one's reluctance to go to the cops would naturally extend to any government employee.  

Cops?!  No way!

DOJ Census Worker only looking for data?  No problem!

I don't buy it.

That's just one study of the 8 linked, although the DOJ links are the most recent at 2003, 2004, and 2005, with everything else being a decade out of date.

Today's living dinosaurs do have penises, so that's a fact rather than a speculation. As far as the extinct dinosaurs go, yes, we are pretty much certain they did. The closest clades to dinosauria (with modern members including snakes, lizards, turtles) all have them, as do the surviving synapsids (mammals). This means the common ancestor of synapsids and diapsids likely had them. In order to have lacked penises, dinosaurs would have had to lose them during most of their evolution, only to regain them again sometime before we humans began studying modern birds. This is very unlikely and we have no evidence for it.

Remember, **birds are living dinosaurs**. Biologists think in clades nowadays, not in anatomical taxa. ","1328055817"

I went up the chain of command, told the teacher, guidance counselor, vice principal and finally the principal. I was immediately suspended because the principal took the bully's side. It was due to blatant racism. Luckily my parents and I had documented everything that had happened and what we had done about it. When we presented the evidence and our intentions to go to the school board, police, and local media, the principal declared she would investigate again. My suspension was reversed but the bully barely got a slap on the wrist. 

Luckily all the teachers knew what was up and didn't let this guy get away with anything.

If you just ask them for a standard oil change (the cheap one), they will certainly use the cheapest oil they have, which is more than likely the lowest quality one.  If you buy that same oil off the shelf to do the oil change yourself, you will pay more for the oil (since off the shelf stuff isn't bulk pricing).  On the other hand, you won't pay labor costs, so the total (monetary) cost of the oil change will be cheaper if you do your own work.  

I would say that people that change their own tend to use a higher quality (more expensive) oil, but if they take it to a shop they tend to get cheap oil.  So doing them yourself is more expensive in many cases, but it is due to the higher quality oil used.","1328055824"

""**10 REASONS WHY GOLD IS SO VALUABLE:**

1. Gold is not only the most malleable, but the most ductile metal that we have discovered.

2. Chemically, gold also happens to be the least reactive, aside from noble gases.

3. Gold has been seen as extremely valuable since ancient, unrecorded times. We have proof of this in the jewelry, coinage and additional arts and decoratives that have been found in archaeological digs.

4. Gold tends to withstand, likely because it is resistant to individuals acid attacks.

5. Gold is used in many industries. It is commonly used in electronics, jewelry, dentistry, the production of colored glass and even to detail fine china.

6. Due to it being a naturally occurring metal, it is considered to be fairly rare. In fact, it is most frequently found during abundant mining of other metals like copper.

7. Gold is able to easily create alloys with countless other metals.

8. Aside from gold being a wonderful conductor of electricity and heat, it will also strongly reflect infrared radiation.

9. Unlike many other metals, gold will not be affected by moisture, air or the majority of corrosive agents. This is why it is commonly used in jewelry, as a coating for metals that are more reactive and for coinage.

10. Gold has been used worldwide monetarily – and still is – whether by coinage, standards or convertible shares.""

If you’re anything like me, you like to look at a couple of pictures (and reviews) of things before you buy them. When I was considering buying the Edwin Jagger DE8, I didn’t find as many pictures as I’d have liked (although lots of reviews, good ones!) and so I decided that I’d take a few when mine arrived for the benefit of my fellow W_Ers. 

I ordered my razor almost exactly two weeks ago and it arrived today (Australia); it was very carefully packaged inside a small parcel filled with packing fluff and then inside its own box wrapped in tissue paper. 

The razor is pleasantly hefty and the chrome is gorgeous. I read elsewhere that people were concerned it would feel cheap, but it doesn't to me, quite solid in my hand. In addition, it came with a free sample of shaving cream/aftershave. 

I got this razor, plus shipping, for $26 AUD. Remember, shipping on [EJ products is *still* free until the 8th of February](http://www.reddit.com/tb/oci7f) (Thanks Leisureguy for the original headsup).

It performed excellently as a shaver, as many past reviews suggested it would. Much milder than my Gillette Old Type, but still providing an excellent, close shave with very little irritation. ","1328055833"

&gt;It was forwarded to the monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings without any action being taken on it.

&gt;The practice of slavery continued and was tolerated in Quaker society in the years immediately following the 1688 petition. Some of the authors continued to protest against slavery, but for a decade their efforts were rejected

That about sums up the sentiment of the minority of peoples that had the descending opinions about slavery at the time. It's the same today with Christians and the gay rights movements. You'll always get splinters, sects and [modern theologians](http://www.forthebibletellsmeso.org/index2.htm) defend the conclusion of a progressive society. Their voice is, however, a shrill echo in the Christian majority's homophobic and bigoted mindset, however subtle or subversive, ('Hate the sin, Love this sinner)

a) who gives a shit if reddit is privately owned? that makes no difference whatsoever.  google is privately owned, but it is publicly accessible, just like a shopping mall.  whether the OP believes that [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) is ""private"" is irrelevant; most people believe that you have to ""come here"" in order to read what is posted, which, as i have pointed out, is not true, at all, at all.

b) i didn't make my account to access personalized settings.  i made it so i could comment, and i made it a long time ago, when [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) was still a place where actual discussion occurred, instead of all this bullshit whining, facebook trolling, rage-comic posting and meme generation clotted up the front page like a fucking blood cancer.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Well... I think /r/atheism, because of their...belief(?) that science, a practice involving actual evidence and analyzing that evidence leads to God logically not existing

Atheism does not involve any positive belief whatsoever.  It is not necessary to acknowledge science while still being an atheist.  For example, all people are born atheist (and don't learn about science until much later.)

&gt; think it is incredibly obvious for any logical person to understand that the notion of God is silly and illogical.

This is a common sentiment.  It's along the lines of ""being literate is a good idea"".

&gt; Additionally, they point out that some horrible things are done because of religion, and come across as believing that religion is horrible in general.

More to the point -- horrible things (like cutting off the genitals of babies and actually celebrating it) are done *because* of religion.

&gt; From what I can gather from /r/Christianity, they understand why people are atheist,

That's very unlikely.  Even the briefest examination of /r/Christianity or people from there posting in /r/atheism exposes this as patently untrue.  Even when they honestly ask, they always frame it as ""hating god"" or thinking that there is some weird excuse we have, or some strange malady.

&gt; but don't go about mocking their beliefs.

We have no beliefs to mock.

&gt; This is probably due to the fact that they acknowledge faith as an essential component to their beliefs, and understand if people cannot make that jump.

Again, I assure you, this is almost certainly not the case.  Explaining why I am an atheist to a believer is insanely difficult.  Explaining it to an atheist is trivial.  I think this is close to universally true.

&gt; Additionally, I am an agnostic atheist, so it isn't as though I completely adore the views of either side

That sentence barely makes any sense.  An agnostic atheist is an atheist (they are the same thing.)  Atheism does not have a unified view -- just an agreement about one point (that we don't believe in god.)","1328055853"

This game quickly imparts a sense of leetness when really such a sense is unwarranted.  OMG you broke one THOUSAND health barrels you are sooo much more leet than me. OMG you bought 500 styles and raided INNER you are so much more leet than me.  OMG one THOUSAND conquest points...

People always think they are so much more fucking epic than they are often giving false advice because of it. Or think that better/more gear/stats/sp translates to them being a better player instead of realizing their output is mathematically based.  They're not working any harder or casting spells more often or using tactics or positioning or any skill whatsoever more often, it's just their gear has an innate easy button with which they look long down their nose at you with.

I'm sorry but the whole game is an easy-button and your mental prowess or lack thereof does not inspire awe within me.  The game is pitifully easy and you lording your shit over newer people just goes to show how false this sense of epicness this game gives to most everybody.

My controller's pretty epic. 66/66 cr/sp.  Then I remember that's not epic.  There is no epic. Everybody gets everything given enough time.  Plus since loot tables were borked and we have this need b4 greed bullshit every toon of a specific class by necessity has the same gear as every other toon of the same class.  Need b4 greed has trained people to shortsightedly and quite selfishly argue for cookie cutter classes.

Fuck that shit. I spec'd crit-chance/might then crit damage. Now 4 adds get popped down to 0 adds with cc+stun.  Means we clear the room faster everyone does more dmg since CC debuffs and healer heals less. Means as controller I murder in pvp.

All that said, after you figure out how thin the illusion is why bother?  Everything is a grind that does nothing in the end other than giving illusory power.

You farm FoS1&amp;3 now?  Big deal.  Isn't that much like farming the armory or smallville.  So what you moved up a tier.  Does it have any real impact?  Is your power shown anywhere else other than these instances?  It's not like you can pvp your own faction to prove said power.

This game allows you to quickly gain ""power"" with minimal skill such that to gain more power one has to grind crazy easy shit with more shit added each expansion that is just as mindless as the last.

I've taken cyborg down with a group of 4, whereas most people think 8 are necessary.  Even if it gets to the point that I can DUO these Titan bounties it would still be a pointless pain in the ass grind to add on top of the laundry list of other shitty else grinds needed to make my character leet.

I've got to do x amount of duos, x amount of solo challanges, x amount of toyman challenges, x amount of t1 alerts, t2 alerts.  You can expect trios. t3 alerts duo challenges.  The writing is on the wall.

I'm saving my time for Starhawk where skill actually means something.  Unless they try to dlc-onlinepass-escrow-assortedotherraperyanddouchebaggery to death.

I find it hilarious that people equate SP to levels and because you can grind feats for like ever the game has any kind of length to it.  Or skill.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I understand. I'm wondering if maybe I was too harsh on Eslader. Hard to say...


I know there isn't an official Christianity, but all Christians base their religion on the teachings of the same book, given a few different versions of it. If they didn't, they wouldn't called themselves Christians, I don't imagine. They'd be Jewish, or Raëlians, or something else.


That book is the source of that collection of forked religions, and that book is rather distasteful itself. Like I said, lots of really good people are Christians who simply ignore entire chunks of that book. Their religion is based on only part of it. If I, as an outsider, have to define Christianity in order to be able to say anything about it, then all I can go on is the book they all have in common. I can't dive into someone's head to figure out what parts of the book they like and what parts they ignore. Three of the largest religions on the planet all share a common ancestor in those stories. So, I'd have to say the Abrahamic religions can all by loosely defined (until corrected on a case-by-case basis) as being the results of those stories. So I feel perfectly valid in saying that religion in general, is bad. 


If I had a religion base on Mein Kampt, but just chose to ignore all the anti-Jewish parts, would you say that my religion is good? My disregard for the horrible parts of Mein Kampt who make me a good person, but the religion itself? No way.


But that's ignoring the fact that simply believing in things for no good reason is bad too. It doesn't even address all the data showing where religious belief correlates with dysfunctional societies. I'm tired of religion being on a protected pedestal where people can hide it away from scrutiny and objection. Then if I don't share that belief, I have to shut up and let them do whatever they want because they have The One Truth and I don't. 


I don't like to attack people for being religious, but I'm happy to attack the concept of religion itself. If religion can't stand up to being criticised, then it isn't worthy of people devoting their lives to it.


Would you disagree with anything? Let me know.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Generally it's this way around - you don't get a working visa then find a job. Getting a proper, official, job is what *gets* you the working visa. It is my understanding that when applying for a working visa from outside the country, they'll want to know who's employing you, etc - so you don't just get a permit then go looking, you have to do the looking first. Entering on a tourist visa allows you to do that looking on the ground, in the country, instead of online where you're only able to get jobs from companies willing to hire from abroad instead of from the large amount of job-seekers already in the country.

Just make sure when you're finding a job that they're able to do this - this should, after all, be your first course of action. As I said, there're workarounds should you be unable to do so (extending the tourist visa, hopping borders and getting a new tourist visa, etc), and most unofficial one-on-one tutoring (which pays fairly well) is cash-in-hand and so can be done on a tourist visa if kept hush-hush. But the ideal is definitely to find a job that'll get you a work visa and *then* find that unofficial stuff to fill extra hours for the bonus money.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","You need bad players in order to define good players. Just because your low elo doesn't mean you need to carry yourself out there. I have, so far, NEVER seen a post where a player legitimately says ""Hey guys, I'm 600 elo. I belong here"". It's always ""Hey, I'm 600 elo but **I think I should be higher.**""


They never once thought of the concept that EVERY player in that elo they are in believes the same yet they constantly get matched up with bad players. You deserve the elo your currently at, if you deserve to be higher you will gain elo. 

I'm sitting at 1403 atm. Yes I was 1560 before. Do I think I'm 1500 player? Nope. I'm a 1400 elo player atm. Can I improve and get a lot higher? Definitively. This is the attitude players need to get in solo ranked instead of this entire mentality that they deserve to be higher elo and as such they need to carry every game. **EVERYONE** is thinking this same exact concept in solo queue and it creates that same hostile and rage-inducing environment ranked solo queue is famous for. This creates far more harm than good.

If your at the elo you deserve to be, you can't carry a game and chances are, you attempting to do so will only hurt your team's performance when your not as good as you think you are. I'm sure you guys have had games where someone screams for a solo lane in an attempt to carry only to feed (getting counter-picked being an exception).


**TLDR;** Most player think they deserve to be a higher elo than they currently are. Many of whom do not believe they deserve their current elo or that bad players need to exist and they may be such.

When I was thinking about playing with opencl my thought was that I could still run it on CPU but I could only get a linear speedup and the algorithm has a quadratic growth. 

The point is that a Gaussian filter if implemented in a naive way also has a O( r^2) complexity but you can implement it way more efficiently (and that is what opencv makes in the case of a Gaussian blur). If there is a viable method for implementing bilateral in constant time then parallelizing the naive algorithm makes no sense (apart from the fact that is a good exercise) and it's just wasting valuable CPU and/or GPU power.

Basically if you look at how much people get from items you could try classifying heroes there, I'm shite at explaining but I'll give a few examples of what I mean.

Lina(nuker) - If has great farm and many items, cannoy carry, she can support and use sheep sticks and Mek and all that sweetness but she has a limited damage output based upon her spells, she cannot get more damage from traditional items

Tinker(carry) - Has an Ultimate which allows him to 'reset' his cool downs, more mana = more resets = more spells = more damage.

The big difference between these 2 heroes is that Tinkers damage is only limited by his mana while Linas damage is limited by her cool downs.

Simple enough right? As far as Necrolyte goes the reason he's considered a 'semi-carry' is because 2 of his big damage dealing abilities are % based, this means that they scale the same all game, compared to say Lina whos damage output is Set, Necrolytes grows with the HP pool and like all % based abilities, his ultimate cannot be out tanked like Linas which has a damage cap.

To put it in simpler terms.

Nukers - People whos damage scales from ability levels and not items, generally meaning they can pull out big damage early

Carry - Heroes who scale well through items, meaning with farm = good, without farm = mediocre, generally heroes who don't have abilities that have set damage, such as Faceless having a dodge and stun passive and no damage from a spell.

Semi-Carry - Heroes who get decent damage from items but at the same time have spells/abilities that don't scale with items, Mirana is a good example of this, she has a Q which does set damage a stun and a speed boost, however unlike say Faceless void, her auto attacks gain no benefit from these abilities so late game her abilities become more redundant for their damage and she will be largely auto attacking.

Yes I can and I will. The difference between my beliefs and those beliefs are that mine are based in FACT and SCIENCE. There is nothing about the concept of Kosher that sustains life. We cant stop someone from practicing thier faith, but we should AS AMERICANS be ready to stop wasting tax payers money facilitating peoples superstitions. I could really care less if you think we have to accomodate peoples fantasies. From a strictly fiscal and secular standpoint offering Kosher foods is an idiotic way to spend money that could be used for more viable things that would actually be tied to saving lived or prolonging them. People can practice their faith all they want. But when it is MY money for GOVERNMENT programs, I am going to vote for something based on fiscal responsibility and not making a bunch of superstitious people happy about how their burgers were killed. 

&gt;Also, I'm going to assume you're a bit immature and this conversation will likely just be met with constant rebuttal regardless of the facts intrinsic

So you are saying we have to provide Kosher meals based on ""faith"" and I say we don't need to because there are no FACTS backing up that it is needed to sustain life. Factually speaking Kosher foods provide nothing more or less than what non-kosher foods offer. Yeah I am the one not listening to facts. 

Maybe you are personally hurt by me calling your faith ""fantasy"", but that in no way means you are ""right"" and I am being ""immature"" about the situation.

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Nice looking products, and I do enjoy a good wood chopping board, but some of the material on their [Why Not Bamboo](http://riverwoodoriginals.com/page.php?page=12) page is pretty funny.

&gt; Manufacturing energy is limited to running a saw blade.

So planting, forest management, lumbering, transport, and drying/seasoning are all free?

&gt; Virtually every part of a log is used as lumber or by-products (including bark, sawdust, and scrap); finished products can be repurposed or **used as a combustible fuel.**

...

&gt; The remaining material is wasted, usually burned.

and

&gt; A solid hardwood floor can last 125 years or longer with several refinishings.
&gt; According to manufacturers, bamboo flooring should last 30–50 years.

Which is great, if you're selling flooring. Chopping boards probably wear out a bit faster though - I've never heard of ancient family heirloom cutting boards.

&gt; [...] bamboo is not a carbon-neutral material.
&gt; Even in a landfill, hardwoods will naturally revert back to nature.
&gt; Because of the high glue content, bamboo products will remain intact in a landfill almost indefinitely.

Whilst having landfills is bad for all kinds of other reasons, it not decomposing means that it *is* sequestering the carbon within it, rather than releasing it during decomposition.","1328055906"

Before the transition, I was kind of taken aback but I was aware where the impression could come from. After the transition, I wasn't like ""how dare you call me a man!"", I said ""alright; I make women uncomfortable, I'll use the men's, because I look like a man and feel more comfortable in there, anyway."" That's quite the opposite of expecting the bathrooms to bend to my will when I'm the one following their expectations- that being, if I look like/exist in society as a man, despite having a vagina I belong in the men's restrooms.

I used to be able to buy tortillas without trans-fat in the stores near me. Not any more.

I recognize that trans-fat has some useful properties. You can keep your tortillas fresh for and soft for years without refrigeration. Stores can keep them stocked longer, and they do not have to dedicate refrigerator cases to them. They can pass on the savings to the customer (or not).

However, trans-fat has been linked to heart disease, and I do not want to ingest it. That is a personal choice. I just want normal tortillas. Corn, maybe salt, maybe some enriching vitamins. They only need to last me about a week. I would keep them in the refrigerator. I would east them with mashed black beans and avocado for breakfast. So now I buy tortillas elsewhere.

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","People who originally read the screenplay for Legend said it was the most beautiful screenplay they ever read, but the film faced terrible challenges, including the soundstage burning down. Although the final result has merit, it didn't live up to the screenplay, and I think a remake is definitely in order in this era of CG.

Choke, the adaptation of the Chuck Palahniuk novel, could have been another Fight Club. It's a great novel. The film sucks balls. It's terrible. I was so disappointed.

My favorite D. C. comic as a kid was Green Lantern. I think you know where I'm going with this. I couldn't even make myself finish the movie. As a kid I would have done anything to be Green Lantern. The movie failed in every way to capture that feeling.

There is a strange thing I experience when watching films and cinematic television shows. Even if I basically enjoy the film and love the casting, I'm always listening to the lines and watching the action with a critical eye and thinking about how they could have been done better. Even when I generally like an actor and the show they're in, I can spot a LOT of times when they either didn't really understand the lines, or they obviously didn't quite have a feel for the character. This actually applies to some of the most popular portrayals in movies and TV. My wife gets all bent out of shape because she practically worships some of these fantasy shows like Harry Potter or Game of Thrones. She can't see how a scene might be a mis-cue.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Didn't happen on my birthday but actually when I went out with people from work about a month later. They took this opportunity to celebrate my 21st by buying me two tequila shots at dinner. Everyone was else was drinking too and we were having fun so we decided to go to a bar down the street. For some reason the bartender took a liking to me and decided to let me drink for free...all night. I started with beers and another tequila shot but then he started making me his guinea pig for all the different shots he wanted to try out. Next thing I remember I wake up on my boss's couch in pajamas I don't recognize and I'm supposed to be at work at 7am. I took a shower and got the fuck out of there. They had brought my car to her house so I found it outside and then realized, fuck I've never been here before I have absolutely no idea where I am. I had to use my GPS to get back to my house where I laid in bed and cried at the pain I was in for 10 minutes and then had to leave for work. I'm a preschool teacher so you can imagine how much my fucking day sucked. Puked all day but thank god for naptime because I slept the fuck out of that shit.
Found out later: Turns out I had totally blacked out but was functioning for a while. Then I passed out on the patio at the bar. My bosses and coworkers along with the bartender decided to pose me and take pictures with me on my camera so I could experience the fun we were having. Those pictures had to be deleted as to not make my boyfriend totally disown me. they would have made a whore blush.

In defense of Frank's earlier position, you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  A non-inclusive (not protecting trans*) ENDA would still protect millions more LGB people, which is a good, if not ideal, thing.  It would also give some ammunition to trans* people because of the LGB protections --- ""are you firing me because I'm trans* or are you firing me because I'm gay?""

"math","t5_2qh0n","First, a question: Have you tried starting from all three vertices with ratio 1/4 or 1/5 and overlaying the results?

Now, comments:
Serpinski gasket can be considered as the following set:

Every point in the triangle has 3 barycentric coordinates between 0 and 1, with sum equal to 1, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinate_system_%28mathematics%29
We write this [a,b,c] (with a+b+c=1).

Now write those in binary. What can the first bits of the three coordinates be? Well, the coordinates add up to 1=1/2+1/4+1/8+.., which means that the most significant digits have to add up to 1. If there is a carry from the second most significant digit, then the first bits are (0,0,0) - with the carry providing the 1. If there is no carry then the first bits are (1,0,0) or (0,1,0) or (0,0,1). So we get 4 possibilities. These options divide the triangle into 4 smaller pieces - one for each possibility.  The first one is the middle triangle of teh Serpinski construction, that we take out at the first stage, and the other 3 are the three ""corner"" triangle that remain.  Now let's assume we are in one of the 3 later cases, and let's consider the second most significant bits (the quarters). Sine we know we get no carry, we again have to have those add up to 0 if there is a carry from the eights, and to 1 if there is no such carry. So each of our three triangles is again divided into 4 parts, and 3 that remain in Serpinski construction are the ones that have exactly one non-zero bit in the 1/4's place. And so on. The conclusion is that Serpinski gasket is the set of those points in th triangle, for which the binary expansion of the barycentric coordinates has exactly one 1 in each position (i.e. out of 3 bits in each 1/2^k place exactly one is 1). 

The plotting construction starts with [1, 0, 0] which has 1=.11111111..., 0=.000000...., 0=.0000000 which indeed has exactly one 1 in each position.  At each stage the barycentric coordinates [a, b, c] go to [a/2, b/2, c/2+1] (if we move towards the third vertex). In binary, all coordinates are shifted once to the right and the .1 is added to the third coordinate. This clearly preserves the property of having exactly one 1 in each position. And, i fact, you can see that you can get to any triple of coordinates with this property by repeating these moves. That's why the program plots the serpinsky gasket.

Now for the other ratios you could write the barycentric coordinates in base 3 or 5 and do similar analysis to see which sets you would get. I think you still get nice sets if you seed from all three vertices.

For the golden ratio, I think you could use the golden-ratio based number system http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base to see what the map does....

My great-grandfather fought in WWII. He was a turret-man on the turret on the bottom of a bomber plane (I don't remember what type of plane unfortunately). They accomplished their bombing mission with some damage. The landing gear was malfunctioning and wouldn't come out, they were low on fuel but close enough that they'd be able to land. Unfortunately, though, the hatch from my great-grandpa's turret wouldn't open so he could get back into the main part of the plane. He told the rest of his crew to sacrifice him so that they could land. He figured it was better for one man to die than several others.

The basic gist is that the light is old, very old, and yes, from the source.

Plus, at short distances, such as 250 light years, expansion isn't an issue (local galactic gravity is stronger than expansion).  But yes, at the massive distances, expansion has moved it even further.

However, when we make discoveries... such as the galaxy we discovered that is 12.9 billion light years away (GN-108036) - when we give that age we do not take expansion into account.

I'd focus on ""cultural florences,"" as a teaching tool. Showing when and where different cultures cropped up, blossomed and receded. Even that boggles the mind. 

The problem with recording ""historic events"" isn't that it isn't noble, or anything like that it's that history doesn't really go back that far for significant parts of the globe. strictly speaking History only goes as far back as we have written records. So, outside of the Maya you're talking about the Western Hemisphere being dark until 1492. Ditto for Australia, large portions of Africa, Polynesia, Siberia and so on.

The second time we left right from High Point and ended at the NJ/NY border. This was a three day/two night hike too. North of High Point was really wet and muddy, but there was plenty to see.
If you have the time, I'd suggest starting right at the Water Gap and making your way to High Point. You'll get to see the Water Gap, Sunfish Pond, Sunrise Mt and High Point.","1328055944"

2) I think people are overly reliant on champion ""tiers"".  Playing and thinking outside the box is the whole point of having such a large champion pool as LoL possesses.  Getting familiar with the inner working of each champion gives you deeper insight into the game.  There are strong solo queue type picks that work well independently, but so much synergy from champions that aren't seen as often. (Fucking want to play another bot lane Kennen/Karma, it's the shit!)

3) Even without ward, be aware of most jungling times and where you are situated in your lane.  Get a feel for when junglers may come in through experience.  It all varies with general skill difference too.  With GP, depending on top laner and junglers, you generally have high movement speed so you can avoid ganks more easily.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't put those in the same category as so-called ""Reality"" shows, though. Those are documentaries.

And there is a distinction. The way I see it, the purpose of a ""Reality"" show is to create an artificial situation (e.g., a bunch of college kids living together in a house they could never afford, or a bunch of people stuck on an island, etc.), put regular people in that situation, and film their behavior.

The purpose of a documentary, however, is to go find something that is already happening in the world (crab fishermen doing their job, cops walking the beat, etc.) and try to document their activities in as unobtrusive a way as possible.

Of course, in a documentary it's obvious that there is no way to completely eliminate the possibility of any influence by the camera crews, but the goal is to keep that to an absolute minimum and *try* to show what things would be like if we weren't watching it. With a ""Reality"" show, OTOH, the basic goal of the show's producers is to artificially manipulate the situation to create something interesting to watch.

Of course, it's very convenient that these categories happen to be defined so that shows I like (like *Deadliest Catch*) happen to be classified as ""Documentaries"", whereas shows I hate (like *The Real World*, or *Survivor*) happen to be classified as ""Reality"" shows. So I'm sure my biases are showing. But I still think it's a pretty good way of breaking it down.","1328055960"

"funny","t5_2qh33","The fact is, in the current system we get a very good deal. we have all the strength and power of being the UK whilst governing many of the more important things ourselves. for those who are unaware, in general, Scotland is far more lefty than England. well perhaps thats unfair, as much of the north of england is similar to Scotland. the fact is that the tory government really over-represents the south of england, mainly the south-east, and does not truly represent Scotland or northern england.

but Scotland has it much better than the North of England, as we govern ourselves to a fairly high level, for example, in my situation as a student, the Scottish government pays my tuition fees, while recently in England tuition fees were potentially **tripled**. also we do not pay prescription fees to the NHS, and have seperate examinations and qualifications at school level which have not come under the (rightful) criticism that the english system has received.

TL;DR the way it is now, we (scottish people) get the best of both worlds. neither independence or more unity would help us","1328055957"

When do I ever say right or wrong? I am talking about survival. Being an omnivore is more beneficial to the continuation of a species.

It's right to be vegetarian if you don't want to eat meat. If you do, it is not right. That's all that can really be said of ""right"" or ""wrong"" in this situation.

I say eating a vegan diet is a step in the wrong direction from an evolutionary standpoint, not from a moral perspective. I don't know where you get that from.

&gt;morality of meat is only a ""human construct""

Morality is a human construct, so how could the morality of consuming a dead animal not be a human construct? Are you saying cheetahs are aware they are immoral creatures when they kill a gazelle?

"battlestations","t5_2rdbn","For newer systems (Vista/7): dual dual-output graphics cards in SLI, single quad-output ATI card with Eyefiniti support. 

For older systems (XP): Single PCIe or AGP dual-output card for two displays, as many PCI graphics cards as you want for secondary displays. Your gaming will be relegated to ONE of the displays but everything else will be able to span fine. 

XP basically supported the use of multiple types of VGA drivers simultaneously, allowing you to have, say, an AGP Nvidia 6800 Ultra for two of your displays, and a PCI Radeon 7500 for your other one or two. XP didn't care, and allowed you to span across all four without issue (gaming excluded from this, of course).

With the advent of the Aero interface for Vista/7, Microsoft required that all attached displays talk to a unified display driver, so no longer could you have two different video chipsets operating in tandem. Now, as long as the cards used drivers of the same family, they shouldn't have to be identical for spanning purposes. For example, you could use an 8800GTX for your primary and an 8400GS for your secondary, because both would use the same driver set. 

All of this information is relevant strictly to spans and will NOT allow you to game across all the displays. For that an AMD Eyefinity or Nvidia 3DSurround setup is required. ","1328055968"

"SF4","t5_2r4cj","If the PC version is like on consoles, you can only upload ranked matches and only after you've beaten an opponent in the same class as you (or higher) a couple of times.

I believe it goes like this:

Beating someone in the same class as you gets you the green film icon (Level 1).  Repeat this step to get level 2. 

While Level 2 is activated, if you fight against an opponent who also has Level 2 activated, that match becomes eligible to be uploaded by the victor. Losing matches sets you back one level (or back to no level).","1328055974"

With the EU and US openly trying to pursue bills that could mean more and more control over the internet, it's clear there is some sort of paradigm shift.

This conflicts with the cognitive bias with a generation that participated in massive online communities like WoW, all kinds of Instant Messaging, social networks, and other moments where large online audiences were for the 1st time suddenly able to talk to people outside their relatively small circles (a power accessible to only those with money or political power beforehand, who all have access to massive social networks)","1328055977"

One fine afternoon before I moved in, I was gleefully destroying the kitchen when I heard mewling outside my door. I open it and this orange stripped kitten about a month old comes in. I let him hang out for a few hours, then put him back outside when I left for the day.

I figured he'd get hungry and go home, but no. Seems he spent the night under my deck, and the next night and the next.

They still purchase food (sales tax) and by riding a bike/walking they contribute less wear to roads while still yielding solid tax revenues. Only thing they consume less of? Gasoline. 
3. Jobs? Building a road, building a bike path. Still pays the same. 
4. Bills sponsor is from one of the flatest states in the union. Has nothing to do with the above, bug just had to throw that in there. 
5. Errands/commuting by bike/walking result in less congestion for cars. Dedicated bike paths = less obsticles for cars.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was working as a seasonal party boat captain during the summer of 2007.  I piloted a 50-ft double-decker boat which would cater 4-8 hour parties for up to 50 people.  

One particularly horrid day (weather-wise) I was told I had 2 4-hour parties - and they were not canceling even with the heavy winds.  My boss told me I had to do it.  (I think because they didn't want to have to refund the customers.)

Hazard: Heavy Winds 
Party #1 was leaving the marina like normal, then wind caused the boat to drift into moored boats on the next aisle.  It caused only a tiny bit of paint scratching &amp; bent the other boat's drop-ladder.  After that, the party went along smoothly.  

Hazard: Some drunk chick
Party #2 was a lot more fun as the wet weather cleared up, but there was still strong winds.  3 hours into the party, when it was time to gather all the swimmers back onto the boat to head back across the lake, -Disaster Struck!!!

One girl on the upper balcony was (perhaps a little bit too) tipsy and fell over the railing.  got caught on the safety chains, and then landed crotch first onto the lower deck railing. she shattered part of her pelvis and was in shock.  I called for emergency evacuation from the lake medics, and tried to keep the rest of the party from doing anything else stupid.  

Needless to say, that event sobered everyone up. I got back to the marina late, and the next party looked upset for having to wait. (the wet drizzle had started again.)

TL;DR 
I had 2 boating accidents in 1 day and they fired me for allowing them to happen.  ","1328056005"

As someone else said, you are never fully prepared to have kids. But eventually you do and you do the best you can.

You are never too old to have hobbies or do things with friends. My close group of friends range between 27-32 and we make time frequently to nerdy things together. Playing Magic the Gathering, board games, or taking our wives/girlfriends on a group date to dinner. It keeps you young. Just because you get married or have kids doesn't mean you need to become a recluse.

Learn to say no. A professor taught me that. In the real world one of the most important skills you can have is knowing how and when to tell people no.

When time comes to find a career, try to find something you love to do that you would do it for free. Then if you can find a way to make money doing it, you know you will be happy working. Sometimes this doesn't work but make sure you try.

Very few friends from high school will end up being worth anything. While I don't dislike my friends from high school but only 2 of them are ones I still see regularly (aforementioned statement regarding game nights and group dates).

You're right that the root of the term agnostic can be applied to anything, including tomatoes. But as a term is has come to define (as shown in the dictionary) someone who believes that the essential nature of things (god or no god, etc.) is both unknown and unknowable.  

Yes, I do not worship any god, but that doesn't mean I lack a belief in one.  In fact, the thing that keeps me from worshiping one god is the same thing that keeps me from worshiping any other.  Not that I don't believe in them, but rather that I believe they could all possibly be right.  We can think we have as much evidence as we want, but the fact is, in the scope of the universe, we know nothing.  As I said before, I believe that whether or not a god exists is entirely unknowable and I don't want to believe the unknown.  I am without knowledge of a god existing and my beliefs reflect that.

To me, both of the definitions you state above seem stupid to me.  If you acknowledge that you are without knowledge of a god existing, how could you believe one way or the other?  Why would you take that leap of faith?

Right?  I'm, seriously not trying to be a dick here, I just feel like we're not on the same page.  ","1328056017"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","A hard carry would best be classed as anyone who you could rely on to single handedly win the game if you help them get the farm. For example, you know that if you let void farm up enough items as long as he doesnt make any big mistakes he will be able to almost win 1v5. A semi carry such as mirana or viper, whilst having a big impact if played well, will not be able to take on an enemy team alone. You wouldn't rely on a farming mirana to carry your team late game against a team with a void.

If someone calls something like necro a hard carry in a game then they mean that if the necro manages to farm then he will have a massive game changing impact. I wouldn't say necro is a hard carry in the traditional sense because heroes like void or AM would have a bigger impact with max items, but depending on the lineups there may be the situation where you could let certain heroes that might not be traditionally considered carries farm to the point where they can hard carry a game.

A heroes suitability to be a hard carry depends as others have mentioned on their abilities, with the best hard carries usually being agi heroes with strong passives. You asked about bloodseeker, who isn't really a great carry because his 2 passives don't really help him dish out or survive large amounts of damage, and who's only damage increasing ability doesn't work when you pop BKB. AM is a good carry because he has passive spell reduction, the mobility from blink to help him close down targets, feedback which is incredibly strong with manta style and also a fantastic base attack speed which helps him scale into late game.","1328056028"

God doesn't control us, though. We have free will.  You can clap your hands right now and that's your choice. 

God puts us through trials for a whole lot of reasons. He definitely wants us to grow. He wants us to understand that life is frail. If God just gave us what we wanted, like no pain and suffering- there would be no relationship with God, and we would not be able to love as much as we do. God would simply become our servant as we direct him to what we want. There is no growth, there is no relationship, there is no love. Only immediate desires met, which would make us the god instead of God the god (if that makes sense). ","1328056032"

Why do they do this? Because they know I am a good worker and they know that maternity leave is not forever.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A cat followed my brother home 4 years ago. He was walking home drunk and it followed him. We fed it tuna. It came back every couple of days for the next couple weeks b/c we would feed it and stuff. It had HUGE claws, no collar, and would hunt birds/squirrels.  It was a pixie-bob and had many dog like tendencies. It would hang out with me and my brother when we were outside. Just like, chill with us unlike most douche bag cats do. It would follow you around and respond if you called it. And the best was it would appear from the bushes somewhere as soon as I pulled up in my car, meowing and stuff and coming over to me to be pet.

Eventually our neighbors started seeing the cat around and decided to adopt it. They let it in their house and stuff. One time they put this stupid fucking bell collar on it that would make noise. Those dumb ass pig noise twins across the street had no idea this cat was feral so I took it off her b/c obviously she couldn't hunt with that bullshit on it's neck.

One time one of the twins were outside screaming like they always do ""STRIPES!! STRIPES WHERE ARE YOU!?"" The cat was in our extension so my mom opened the window and said ""Oh Olivia she's in here don't worry!"" The bitch fucking FREAKED OUT. She called my mom a fat cunt infront of my 11 year old sister.

Eventually, I found out that the cat wasn't wild at all, but that it was a part of a litter that our neighbors down the block's cat had. They let the thing live outdoors so it was basically feral except extremely friendly with humans.

At the end of this summer, it got hit by a car right outside our house and died. Shit was super weak. That cat was so much better then all your dumb karma whoring cats. Hunted it's own food, palled around like a dog, didn't give a shit about living outside. That cat ruled. I never named it, but I sure miss her.

I'm allergic to cats, so I can't have one living with me where I sleep and stuff (even though my roomate has a cat) so if I ever get a cat it will be an outdoor cat, and it will definitely be a pixie-bob. They are the shit.

Pitch the yeast and slowly raise or allow the temperature to rise to your target fermetation temperature over the course of 18 to 36 hours.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The only one of those 20 reasons that is not completely negative for me is that he is a gun nut.  I am also a gun nut, despite being a liberal.  The problem I have is that he opposed Mcdonald V Chicago despite being a gun nut, and if he had his way the Chicago handgun ban would have been allowed to stand, so even on the subject of the second amendment he refuses to defend our rights from the states governments.

I agree with him though that federal background checks when you buy a new gun are not neccessary.  One can legally buy a gun private sale in most states without a federal background check, so why should buying one from a store require a check? If you are a felon or illegally carrying, you will be caught by the cops when you go to use your weapon, or when you are stopped or searched for another reason, same as if you bought it illegally.  Not doing background checks in stores really doesn't make it any easier for a felon to get a gun, they have plenty of other options to get guns anyway.

The fact that you support 14 of those things makes me beleve you are almost as crazy as him.","1328056049"

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","Edit: I actually forgot our worst mishap. Two years before the time it just rained a little we had a kid fully break his radius and ulna at the wrist area. We were portaging across a highway and the area across the highway leading back to the trail had a thin wooden bridge over the drainage ditch with about a four foot drop into some shallow mud. My brother's friend must have had mud on his boot or something because one moment he was standing there and the next he had fallen into the mud but with all his weight on his wrist...against a branch. I don't have a good picture but the kid's arm looked something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/UGdjX.jpg). Of course we had no cell service so we had to flag down a motorist and ask them to drive up the road and call the hospital. This is in the middle of the Adirondacks mind you. Paramedics were cool dudes though and with the guy and his mother gone at the hospital we actually had more food than we could eat, which is insane for that kind of trip.

The other event, a canoe trip. The place, the beautiful Adirondacks. Going in we figured we would get a couple days of rain but have time to dry off before packing up. Well four days into the trip and not a drop in sight, we were feeling pretty lucky. Then is started POURING about halfway to our site. It rained the entire night (everything from bags to tents were soaked) and for the rest of the next day which luckily was our last. First picture is at the site, last two are at the end of the trip.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The game industry and movie industry are not the same thing. They're both entertainment mediums, but the gaming industry is much more secretive, that's how it works. Movies are announced the second they start production or get green lit, games are announced after they got something to show. And what they show, should give an accurate representation of the final product, which means they'll have to be at least 50% done to make that happen. Or else you'll end up like Zelda Skyward Sword, Duke Nukem Forever or Final Fantasy Versus 13. They were announced too early, and that only made it worse.

You act like Valve owe you something, an explanation of some sort. But they're a private owned company, they can do whatever they want. They love their fans, they're the reason why Valve is so successful. But Valve have to do what they think is best, and that's to continue to build up the hype, and wait for the right moment, instead of killing the hype because some fans became impatient.

[Take a look here.](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/108821-Valve-Says-Hang-In-There-For-Half-Life-2-Episode-3)

People have asked about Ep3 details for years, ever since ep2 was released. And every time, they gave a ""no comment"", and a ""it's coming"". They OBIVOUSLY doesn't want to give any details, so you think your little group will prove them otherwise? At best, you get a small pat on the back, and a reassuring ""some day..."" answer.

It's a nice thing to arrange a ""let's all celebrate this game we love!"", because it's positive and nice. But what bothers me is how you expect them to react any differently than they already have, they already know people want more HL.

You ask for explanations, but do you really need one? No answer would ever change the situation anyway. Either, they had production difficulties, making sure it's up to the high standard, or they decided to abandon the episodic format, because it clearly wasn't working for them. If they said that publicly, it would only result in a ""duh"" response. Any other explanation could risk spoiling or cause any other bad scenario for Valve.

So stop feeling entitled to a product, it's silly to look at, they're obviously working on it.","1328056056"

Our establishment is going for more of a full-service experience, rather than a serve-yourself-and-go of  a two-star place like Hampton Inn.

As for ""the cities are designed that way"" - I think the causality is exactly reversed.  We did not inherit cities. We built them.  We built them a certain way because, presumably, we want them that way.  The cities do define us, in some sense, but more actively, we define our cities. There is a feedback loop but the primary actor is the people, not the city infrastructure.  And my response said as much - we shaped the cities to allow what we want - moving out of them.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Essentially, the Spy is an assassin like the sniper so the best thing you can do is to pick off key enemy players.  

[Here's a link to a prolific and pretty famous spy in the tf2 community, not just because of his skill, but also because of the quality of his tutorials and anaylysis.](http://www.youtube.com/user/stabbyvideo)

So here's some of my spy tips (I used to main spy, moved onto soldier for now to play more 6v6:

1) 1:1 Tradeoffs with medics is almost always worth it.  

2) Taking down medic targets is almost as good as taking down the medics themselves.  Sometimes when I'm not able to pick medics taking down all the heavies and soldiers is literally just as good because medics are near useless when they have no one to heal.

3) Sapping sentries *while* they are under fire is always useful.

4) Body blocking is generally a GGG strategy.  If you can body block a heavy sometimes and buy your team some time, that can make a huge difference.  

5) Make sure you aren't CnDing and being useless to your team.  Every second you aren't working towards helping your team winning is a second wasted. 

6) Learn how to use your revolver.  I was in a lobby with stabby stabby once and he was just taking pot shot headshots on my/against my team, and it was working really well because of all the other spam in the area.  

7) Learn the situational nature of the game.  Sometimes spy is needed, sometimes he's not.  Sometimes different loadouts are literally necessary.  Spy is the only class where I actively use 4 loadouts because of the different play style associated with each revolver, knife *and* watch/PDA.  

If you ever want tips I can hop in a server with you sometime and we can spy around a little.  ","1328056065"

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","**A.**   Raw weapons have a smaller gap between their base level and fully upgraded state than regular weapons do. 

For example, take the longsword, which goes from an attack of 80 to 220 when fully leveled to +15. The Raw Longsword, while only leveling to a +5, goes from an attack of 138 to 184.

Basically, Raw weapons are a bad investment. There's no real reason to utilize them either, seeing how when you have access to modifying your weapon into a Raw counterpart, you're pretty close to being able to level your regular weapon above +5 and beyond.

The only time I would recommend using a Raw weapon is when you're leveling up your weapon before Anor Londo and aren't worried about the extra cost of the initial investment made and then reverting your Raw weapon back to its basic form. There are probably better options, but some may argue differently.

**B.**  Lightning is useful on any weapon when you don't want to utilize scaling.

Scaling is the letter grade given to stats on the weapon's damage in the item menu (in ascending order): E -&gt; D -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; A -&gt; S.

Lightning and Fire weapons do not scale, and therefore are good for characters not concerned with benefiting from their Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Faith stats. This is why you see a lot of low-level users carrying lightning or fire weapons. Armor and shields are generally more resistant to Fire than Lightning, so that's why Lightning is so often favored, although people wearing heavy and lightning-resistant armor (eg. Giant's Armor, Stone Armor) is becoming more common as a direct result.

In my personal experience, non-scaling weapons generally become less competitive in the community around level 100. If someone has invested more than 30 points into Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, or Faith, they might seriously consider switching to a weapon which best benefits from those stats.

**C.**  The *best* is a fuzzy word in Dark Souls. The currencies of the items in Dark Souls are a manifestation of one's own subjective value system. Oftentimes people will forgo some stat boost in favor of extra reach or a preferred move set on a weapon. As far as weapon enchantments, I've seen Crystal Magic Weapon used a lot in serious PvP. I'm waiting for the day I see Hidden Weapon utilized effectively because it seems like it's underrepresented.

In addition within a few years I'd expect download services to replace retailers more and more. 

As a startup you may be able to provide superior service for people, but you are not going to beat internet prices in general or Walmart prices for new stuff. You will not have the centralized advertising or web presence of Gamestop. The question is will people pay you for being friendly and knowledgeable. 

If you figure out why Gamecrazy is gone and how to avoid their issues and decide to go ahead be sure to spend a day or two outside each of the competing stores and count their traffic. Try to figure out who is coming in and why they are going there. Is it all grandmas migrating through malls and buying gifts? Is it college kids from the nearby school? Are they buying only when big new releases come out? Are some customers coming from very far away because these three are the only places in town? What is everyone buying?

These questions should let you figure out who you might be able to serve. You'll still have to find out how to make them aware you exist and convince them you are better than the other guys but you will at least know if it is possible for you to do so.","1328056070"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've said it in other posts like this...

Senior Software Engineer (and the one thing I hate about my job is that title.  I think it sounds way more fancy than it is.)
  
I've loved programming since I was a little kid.  I had gotten in trouble for something, and my foster mom at the time brought home a device (for the life of me I can't recall exactly what it was), called me downstairs from my room, sat with me, talked about what I had done wrong and why it was wrong.  Then we went through the manual for the device, and she showed me how to do a bit of programming with it, and then wandered off to make dinner.  I called her into the room excitedly as I'd just written the equivalent of 

    10 print steevdave is a super kid 
    20 goto 10; 
    
At that point, I was hooked.  I never actually thought I'd do what I do for a living, and I actually turned the company down for the job twice before they finally convinced me to take the job.

That said, this is pretty much my dream job.  It is what I'd be doing if I had 3 million dollars and didn't have to work anymore.  I work from home, although I can go in to the office if I want (no one actually goes in to the office.) I make my own hours, so I go to bed when I want, and I wake up when I want.  I won't get filthy rich doing what I do, but I have plenty enough to cover all my bills and still buy plenty of toys.","1328056076"

I was questioned for 3 hours before I was let go. Similar circumstances, 3.25 gpa, no criminal record, ""good kid but a lonely dreamer"" was how one teacher described me. I thought it was nothing, a stupid overreaction. 

Four years later I talk to an old classmate who revealed that while I was being questioned, another officer was asking the entire class about me. People I barely knew and had never wronged were lining up to talk about me being a psycho. If it wasn't for that friend and a great teacher vouching for me, my story might have ended the same as yours.

If you're as experienced as you say you need to l2p.  Seriously.  Pre-patch, if a sentinel/marauder in comparable gear popped trinket immediate after opener, choke/stasis, rebuke/cloak of pain, and guarded by the force/undying rage, in addition to their dps abilities, it was going to be a really, really close fight.  Instant full resolve on opener prevented a second stun for a while, and full on burst for an operative uses all of their energy.  Combine these facts with the sent/mara's damage mitigation abilities and there's a ton less burst.  Toe to toe, a sentinel/marauder with equal gear destroys an Op, it's not even funny.

"battlefield3","t5_2rlua","The UI design was terrible? Interesting. Let's take a look at what's better in BF3.

* Loading screen. BF2 shows a detailed image of the map, server settings, server name, etc. BF3 lacks all of those things.
* Squad interface. BF2 allows you to create, invite, and name your squads. BF3 has a very primitive system in which you're only able to join a set number of pre-made squads and is incapable of what was possible in BF2.
* Minimap. BF2 had a super detailed, clear overview of the map showing terrain features and units. It could be zoomed in and out and it was possible to view a full-sized, full screen version of it. BF3's minimap is an incoherent mess of glowing worms and it's full size version is a box that takes up less than a quarter of the screen.
* Spawn menu. BF2 featured a minimap on its spawn screen in which you could easily select where you wanted to spawn by clicking on the spawn point you wanted. You'd know exactly where you'd end up. Compared to BF3, in which you're only able to select through a list of spawn points, which aren't even shown on the minimap - no flashing or any clear indication.

So, BF2 suddenly has a terrible UI just because of that one thing you've mentioned? Nice try.","1328056085"

 It is also my belief that mungoB interpreted rsplatpc's original comment to be an overly serious response to what was clearly meant to be a humorous picture. I believe mungoB himself believed that rsplatpc never expected to be corrected since, as stated earlier, the falsity of his claim is obvious and meant to be taken as sarcasm. In an attempt to be humorous, he replied in a very serious manner, stating further obvious facts which are a counterpoint to rsplatpc's sarcasm tone. But even though he was stating a fact, he was *really* trying to highlight how unnecesary the original comment was.

This was 
A. A use of words which were meant to be contrary to a reply rsplatpc was expecting
and
B. A use of words expressing something other than their literal intention.

Now *that* is irony.

Look I understand people throw that word around like a ball on a chain. They like shoving ""literally"" before verbs and nothing seems to make them happier than stating any given thing as the ""best"" or ""worst"" whatever it is ever. I assure you. I very deeply considered my use of the word before placing it there. ","1328056090"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Damn I'm late to the party, but I have a story about this exact subject.

Last August my friend and I were house/apartment hunting when we found this apartment complex.  They had apartments for a reasonable price, so we checked it out.  There were some cat food bowls out near the apartment we wanted, and we had seen a couple cats around.  the current tenant was this kinda-creepy lady, but she seemed nice enough. So we decided to take it. 

A few weeks later we start moving in, and notice that even though the lady had left, the cats were still around. We had been sure they were hers, since she was the only one with the bowls outside.  One of the cats, a black and white one we call Mr. Kitty, was (and still is) a very vocal and whiny cat.  He was also very aware of how to manipulate people into petting him or giving him food by being adorable. Even though he is still such a little bitch, but I digress.  We start feeding him, but keeping him outside. He wasn't our cat, we figured that the lady would come for eventually. After a couple weeks, we started letting it inside on rainy days, then at night, til it was essentially our cat.  We always wondered why the previous tenant never came back for him.

Well a few months later, we are watching TV and we hear a knock on the door.  I go to answer it, and lo-and-behold it's her.  Her hair was very thin, and she didn't look very well.  She seemed almost like a crack addict that cleaned herself up to talk to us.  She starts telling me how she used to live here, and if we had seen her cats around.  I tell her yes, we've been feeding one of them.  She doesn't say anything for a couple seconds, then very creepily asks, ""Would you mind taking care of it? I really just can't deal with it right now."" I told her it wouldn't be a problem. She promptly said thank you and walked away.  Easily one of the more awkward conversations I've had with a stranger, but we got a cat out of it. So I'll take that as a victory.

TL;DR Very creepy previous tenant left her cat, and we took it in. She came by a few months later and asked if we could take care of it. Now we have a cat.","1328056092"

You seem to have good insight on one of my biggest problems, and I thought maybe you could shed some light on my biggest problem - motivation. 

You say that some women feel like toxic energy saps, and I couldnt agree more with that. My problem is that I seem to be meeting girls who dont stimulate me at all mentally. Because of that, I feel like there is nothing to learn from them. I give value, and get none in return. So I have a similar lack of interest because I feel like the reward isn't worth the effort. I have some FWBs set up, so now mostly I feel like I'm just waiting for someone of value to drop into my lap.

Im using a sniper rifle while I should be carpet bombing, and we all know here that that doesn't work. We need to be always be learning and improving so that when it happens, were ready. I recently took a month long vacation and I carpet bombed because I had nothing going on there. You're absolutely right, I did learn a lot. 

But now I'm home and I'm lost. I dont want to fall back into my loop like before, I want to be constantly improving. Yet I always feel like Im better off doing work or calling a FWB because of how low my success rate is, with success being defined by quality women.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;John 3:18

Good point but if you expand the context just a bit further you'll find this:

&gt;""11 **Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.** 12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things? 13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.[a] 14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,[b] 15 that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”[c]

&gt; 16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. ""

Based on the first sentence it could be argued that only those who heard Jesus' message personally from him are affected. 

The other stuff is a matter of interpretation. Which I mentioned before varies quite a bit. On the other hand, some interesting lines that seem to support universalism/inclusivism are 1 Timothy 4:10, 2 Peter 3:9 and 2 Corinthians 5:14-15.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yeah, it's a non-issue really in today's society. We're secular, not atheist. There are a lot of Swedes who still believe in a ""higher being"" and things to that effect, according to the polls. But organized religion, and the old protestant sense of the ""church"", really is almost gone in this country.

Also, unlike American atheists who are die hard about getting rid of any sense of Christianity in the public realm. Well, Swedes don't really see it like that since we consider it to be part of our culture and tradition. For instance schools often times still celebrate the end of term in church and so on. A huge chunk of the population still get baptized and confirmed.

Our secularism is getting threatened by the ever increasing immigration of mainly muslims though. Something that I personally see as an issue in the future. Sweden isn't an immigrant country and our policies and society just isn't set up to take on a lot of people who don't share our values and culture. The problem is that we are, and have, taken in a lot of people like that. And they aren't getting integrated like the old primarily european and western immigrants did. ","1328056096"
"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt;What friggen games have you been watching???

The ones in which Rodriguez has statistically outperformed Jeter.

* Rodriguez' playoff career: .386 OBP .498 SLG

* Jeter's playoff career: .374 OBP .465 SLG

Postseason Jeter is essentially the same player as regular season Jeter. Postseason Rodriguez is worse than regular season Rodriguez. However, the talent gap between the two is large enough that even though his play suffers relative to his regular season performance, Rodriguez is still the more valuable postseason player. 

And this analysis doesn't consider the effects of playing environment or include any attempts to quantify defense, two areas in which Rodriguez surely comes out ahead. 

Jeter is a great postseason player just as he is a great regular season player, but the myth of Jeter the postseason giant is largely media driven and not borne out by the numbers. 

Of course, I believe that the postseason is not materially different from the regular season to the point that we should expect players to either over or under perform their well established true talent levels. The fact that playoff Rodriguez has fallen short of his career averages is a function of a limited sample size. 

Jeter has had just about a full season's worth of playoff plate appearances. Lo and behold, his post season numbers are nearly identical to his regular season numbers. Rodriguez has had a little less than half a season's worth of post season plate appearances, hence the departure from his normal numbers.

If I have a baby now, I wouldn't be paying much attention to the baby which I wouldn't want the baby to have. I would love to give my undivided attention, love and care to both you and the baby. With my commitment pending, I'm afraid that I simply cannot raise a child. What I'm doing would benefit us in the long run financially and would help us raise the family together providing the children what they wish for. I hope you understand.

An IQ test doesn't determine someones intelligence. Take someone who is extremely creative. Are they not intelligent? They can create wonderful works of art, tell a great story or joke, etc. An IQ test doesn't factor in for creative intelligence. 

An IQ test tells you how well you can score on a standardized test. It's no way to judge how much a person is capable of learning. There's a lot more aspect to intelligence than what you can be tested on in a standardized test. 

Also, nerd being a descriptive word made up in our language (I think no earlier than the 40's or 50's) without a definite meaning means it's up for interpretation of it's specific meaning.

Yeah, I agree. I don't know why I wrote that since clearly the last part of my definition says ""as it pertains to the Constitution and law"". Should probably avoid multitasking leading me to contradict my own definitions. Yes. You are right that as a freedom, it is without restraint--since the very definition of freedom means to be without restraint. So yes, I will modify the definition to this:

**Right to free speech** will be defined as **an inherent, natural, and inalienable freedom of a human being which pertains to the innate and natural human desire to speak one's mind without restraint, which cannot be separated from the human being, cannot be transferred from and to the human being, and is granted naturally (from Nature) to the human being, and as it pertains to the Constitution and law.**

Add this after the printf:

Gives me a segmentation fault after printing the address (28CD1C the second time I ran it - your program will move around in memory from run to run, due to other things being loaded in the mean time).

That's not to say there isn't some system somewhere that does work that way, or that if you look in the generated assembly you won't see offsets of 77 or the like.  Just that when you are actually executing, the address of 77 is very likely not going to be in your addressable range.  You can probably figure out the starting address of the program's memory range and add an offset yourself, but when you say int *p = reinterpret_cast&lt;int *&gt;(77); you're giving it an absolute address, not a relative offset.","1328056128"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; To be fair, I think their main problem with the cartoonist is that he is depicting their prophet (some sort of sin)

I took a comparative religion class in college about 5 years ago (iirc) and one day we had a guest speaker who was the leader of the local (very small) Muslim community. He was a very chill, moderate guy, and one of the founders of the local interfaith ""all religions are true"" mutual masturbation society.

Anyway, I had never seen the offensive cartoons because the media outlets I paid attention to didn't want to risk a fatwa by showing them, so I had no idea about bombhead Muhammad or dogbody Muhammad - all I knew was that there was a general objection to Muhammad being depicted in any kind of image.

So I asked this Muslim guy why that was. He just said it was offensive. I tried to get him to elaborate - I said I just wanted to know the theological reason behind the prohibition, even if it wasn't a reason I agreed with. I expected an answer like, Muhammad was so perfect that no image could do him justice and would therefore tarnish his rep, or that only the highest ranking holy men were permitted to look upon Muhammad's properly rendered image, or that it was specifically forbidden by the Qu'ran, or something. He could even have said that the specific images were offensive because of the bomb/dog.

Nope. After four tries rephrasing my question, I couldn't get a straight answer out of the fucker. All he would say is that depicting the prophet is offensive and shouldn't be done.  I'm still annoyed to this day.","1328056128"

That's a very nihilistic point of view. I, and many others, don't agree with that view and are actually attempting to do something about it ourselves.

&gt; I live in an area with a significant small town conservative mindset. I've posed different questions to them in regards to global warming. The majority of those people I've talked to think global warming either:
1) Doesn't Exist 2) Is a scam by scientists 3) Has happened in the past, so why worry
or a combination of the three. When I tell them that there's a chance that it is ""too late"" they all come into agreeance:
""So what's the point in changing anyway? If it's too late, we might as well keep it the way it is""

&gt;You know, as well as I do, that this mentality is bigger than my small town. First off, they don't believe it is our fault. Second, if it IS happening, what's the point in changing if things can't change?

I hate to say it, but the likelihood isn't ""small-town conservative"" but ""religious"" mindset. They believe that the world is going to be destroyed anyways, so they figure ""What's the point?""...

&gt; But I need to declare again, I'M WITH YOU AKUTA. I'M TOTALLY 100% FOR WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. But we're dealing with people, and a lot of those people aren't going to change their ways overnight, and may not change until they see some hard evidence in their back yards that ""shits getting real"", but by then we'll need to do something drastic to thwart off disaster.

I apologize if it sounded like I didn't think you were agreeing with me. That's not the case. I'm merely talking about the issue. We **are** dealing with people, but it's people like myself and the others that are pushing for change that are going to get that ball rolling if it's ever going to roll.

We don't need over-night change, just change in general. We need to fix what all of our previous generations have done and prepare for potentially worse. We can't wait until then. We need to get the movement rolling **now**. :)","1328056128"

MS does a lot of research into the market leader when they enter into a new market. They realized a lot of areas the console market could be approached, and the time was right for a lot of things that weren't new, but they were the right time for them.

Nintendo also came out of left field and changed(for a significant time) the whole game.
The market share is significant, but you could also say Sony not losing even more in a market where they were last to launch, did not have any  franchises that were as large as Halo for exclusive, and had inferior online, was pretty impressive, and speaks to the loyalty (fanboys?) that MS feared so much.

Good ol Bill realized after the 2008 Super Bowl loss that he had lost another thing during the undefeated run: his instincts, that killer attitude, that had led him to such great heights in the past. So a plot was hatched by the Kraft family to create a newer, stronger, better Bill that would whip his team into playoff shape and would be unstoppable. 

A crack team of scientists, Navy SEALS, and British RAF were assembled to mix the genetic makeup of Bill himself with the most badass men that ever lived: DNA was extracted from the penis of Rasputin, Vince Lombardi's remains, and the entire 1980 United States hockey team, mixed into a blastocyst along with a little bit of Tabasco sauce, and used to inseminate an entire team of Roller Derby players. 

These superchildren were placed into hyperstasis where they aged at 30x the normal speed of humans while they were force fed clips of the 1985 Bears defense spliced with scenes from Rambo, Clockwork Orange style. An intense training regiment was implemented in early 2011 after extracting the now 60 year old SuperBelichicks from their chambers to give them super strength and the ability to decipher complex offensive and defensive schemes, and then an aptitude test was administered to determine the Bill that would eat gunpowder and scrap metal to shit bullets. 

This Bill, plucked from his brethren at the primest moment, has been disguised and integrated into the coaching tree of this season's Patriots. Original Bill saw in his clone a man who would never hesitate to start an untalented player to lead his team, a fearless fourth down converting playcaller that would never stop until the other 31 teams in the league were so desperate to have a shot at a championship that they would rename their team the Patriots and emulate SuperBelichick in every way. 

Bill was scared, for the love of the game. He wanted everybody to have a fair shot at the Super Bowl. Not because Bill Belichick is a good sport. But because Bill Belichick wants to win them all himself. So he murdered his clone and in doing so regained his killer instinct.

TL;DR: Bill clones himself, kills clone, knows he's the best on Earth.","1328056140"

"NYGiants","t5_2ruqw","&gt;Most passing attacks are somewhat complicated at the very least.

Those were your exact words. And it couldnt be further from the truth. You were trying to argue that most NFL teams run a complicated passing attack. That is wrong.

Secondly, you are thickheaded to think that Manningham wouldn't excel in an offense such as the 9ers or the Browns. That article basically explained that it takes a certain breed (read: cerebral) of WR to be able to have success in this offense. You automatically assume that because Manningham has trouble with what may be one of the most complex passing attacks in the NFL, that he wouldnt be great in a simpler offense. That makes you uninformed in my opinon, and shows how fucking little you know about base offenses in the majority of football.

&gt;This doesn't change the fact that Manningham is pretty damn stupid and wouldn't be able to adapt to a new playbook in one off-season. Fact is, other playbooks are still complicated and considering Manningham is still known for making mistakes after 4 seasons of this one, he won't be able to be a number one.

You are pretty damn stupid to post trash like this. You make this assumption based on what evidence? Ive said it, and I will continue to do so, this fucking offense is not pop warner. You continue to say that other playbooks are still complicated, but bring no evidence to the table. You make grand assumptions using a flawed train of thought. You obviously dont know much about offenses in general in the NFL.

HE MAKES MISTAKES BECAUSE THIS OFFENSE IS COMPLICATED. YOU SIR CONTINUE TO SPIT USELESS STATISTICS ABOUT HIS ISSUES IN THIS OFFENSE. IF YOU ASK HIM TO RUN A FLY ROUTE, HE WOULD DO IT FLAWLESSLY. ASK HIM TO RUN AN OPTION OUT, AND THATS WHEN WE SEE THE LACK OF ""SMARTS"" COME INTO PLAY. 

Go back and watch him at Michigan and tell me he doesnt have the tools to be a number one. Hell, he would be a number one on (of the top of my head): Cleveland, San Fran, Washington, Carolina, Tampa Bay, and I am sure there are plenty more.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Noooooo, EMDR is anything but an instant cure. I was actually SUPER skeptical of EMDR when I first read about it, and had pretty much resolved not to ever do it. But...desperate times, desperate measures, I guess. I've gotten to a point where I don't feel like I have the luxury of not trying a treatment that might work. That said, I HATE Francine Shapiro's model of EMDR, I am not a believer in the ""REM sleep"" theory of why it works, I think it's ridiculous that Shapiro runs an ""official"" certification school for EMDR...etc. 

Fortunately, my psychiatrist feels the same way - the EMDR he practices is... a variation? Instead of focusing on specific memories, he uses the treatment to focus on your perceptions, and then...deal with whatever memories come up in association with those perceptions? So, for instance, if you have the perception of ""I am disgusting"", you focus on that and see what traumatic memories come up in association with that perception. And then you examine the memories, and come up with a more correct perception, like ""I was disgusted"" - and then kind of...try to nail in the more correct perception? It is similar-but-different to the original method of EMDR, and I find it to be pretty damn effective. He still uses the eye movements, but my theory as to why they work is that they prevent dissociation while focusing on trauma memories (because following the finger with your eyes is grounding), and tax the brain just enough that it's harder to sit there and beat yourself up for what you're thinking (it quiets that voice in your head that is all ""STOP WHINING SISSY"" or whatever). 

This treatment variation is clearly experimental (something I knew and accepted before I signed on for it), and imho EMDR (of any variety) should not be used as a first line treatment (because prolonged exposure is all-around better and safer, and works directly on memory desensitisation rather than perception).  But...yeah, EMDR is certainly not the ""one session and you're cured yay!"" treatment that some quacks think it is. It's a long-haul type of thing that requires you to work your ass off - I have had 17 EMDR sessions already and I am nowhere near done.

The worst thing for me in True Romance is the goofy music. It completely destroys all tension and tells the viewer in advance what's about to happen. There are a lot of films I feel are hurt by bad soundtrack work. All the alien voices in the Star Wars prequels pretty much ruined those films. If they had made weird alien languages and put subtitles on the screen I bet those films wouldn't have gotten nearly as big of a negative reaction.

"community","t5_2qu49","I don't understand why there is anything wrong with ""escapist nerd fantasy"" - I really don't. That is the point of entertainment. Most movies, most shows, pretty much anything - they are escapist. Even Community. It's a way of getting out of your life and enjoying something else. If you want to watch something completely realistic and depressing, turn on the 11PM news or read the New York Times.

The cheesiness of Chuck is WHY it is so popular. People want to get away from what life is like, so they enjoy shows that are as unrealistic and fantastical as Chuck. I understand the need for ""realistic"" shows like Game of Thrones (well, realistic in the way the characters interact, not realistic in any other sense) and The Wire. I really enjoy shows like that (I specifically named those two shows because they are near the top of my list of favorite shows), but if all television was like those two examples, it would get very boring, very quick. 

Battlestar Galactica (the ""new"" one) was also very ""realistic,"" which seems to be a buzz word for hopelessly depressing and dark these days. It became a bit comical how hard they were trying to make realistic. It came down to the point where I'd just groan before each episode and wonder which character would get fucked over that particular episode. 

To conclude, both types of shows have their pluses and minuses. Just because a show is an ""escapist nerd fantasy"" doesn't mean that it is somehow inferior to shows where relationships are handled ""realistically.""

Also, somewhat related, you're being downvoted not because you're expressing a contrary point of view, but because you're expressing it in a pretentious way. You seem to be putting yourself ""above"" the cretins who watch ""escapist"" shows like Chuck. How dare they watch television they enjoy!

The newer halls in Princes Gardens certainly are swanky, but they're definitely not worth the insane rent. Also, interestingly of the albeit limited number of rooms I saw it always seemed that the twin rooms in the newer halls are A LOT smaller than the twin rooms in the older ones, but much more expensive.

Another benefit to Evelyn Gardens is the Cineworld right on the doorstep where you can see films for only £3.50 (student card + student beans half price mon-thurs).

B) I've yet to see anything on CTV that rivals programs like The Fifth Estate, and the excellent shows on CBC radio.


C) Sun News probably wouldn't become Canada's most popular TV news network if CBC disappeared, but the loss of the CBC certainly wouldn't cost them any viewers.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say 99.99% of everyone who lives in the south has never experienced it. It was just my way to illustrate the noticeable presence of evangelicals, for ME. 

You see the person who I was originally responding to was saying that atheist on reddit were the most annoying religion-related people they came in contact with. I was trying to express, via a personal anecdote, that there's a difference, in my opinion, with people being rude online and people being annoying in real life. 

I'm not bashing the south- I love living where I live. It isn't even a big deal that I have evangelicals leaving stuff in my mailbox, throwing things in my driveway, knocking on my door, and preaching at my campus.

title of post ""not your typical atheist.""

content of post: discussion of how OP apparently differs from ""typical atheists"" who (according to OP) have dissenting views only when it comes to religion.  OP believes (correctly) that an atheist is not innoculated against irrationality, simply because s/he has discovered that there is no proof of god.  as i said, many atheists harbor completely irrational beliefs about a great many things, as most human beings do.  it just so happens that atheists have, on average, one less irrational belief than most of the rest of the people in a given society.

OP further helps to indicate that this is the case by asking other redditors to fill in the blank, which s/he starts of with a- (as in **a**theist, **a**gnostic, or other terms beginning with the prefix a-, which in english and latin indicates *a lack of something*).

She put up signs saying ""found cat"" and about a week later a little old lady came by and was thrilled to find that we'd rescued her cat. Mom had her in for coffee and while they were chatting, she mentioned that they had just moved here and the cat must have gotten spooked and run off. Where did they move?

Currency:

Uruguayan currency is the peso (just like Mexico, Argentina, and many
others, but each has a different value; if confusion is possible it
will be qualified with the nationality; in case of doubt it will be of
course Uruguayan peso). The symbol is $, and to avoid confusion US
dollars are noted as US$ or U$S (I seriously dislike the second style,
it makes no sense). US dollars are used for big transactions (houses,
cars, sometimes even computers), and big stores sometimes accept them
(but they usually take them at a bad exchange rate and they'll give
you change in Uruguayan pesos). Current exchange rate is $19.15 when
selling dollars, $19.85 when buying them. The value floats freely, so
it will most likely be different when you arrive. Money exchange at
the airport itself is usually pretty bad, so I'd avoid it unless
completely necessary. There's many money exchange houses around the
city, especially near the city center (which is pretty close to here)
and also near the office there are a couple. Also, different places
have different prices, so it might be useful to know where to go
(mostly what changes is the spread, and they are centered at around
the same value). Also, they will give almost always give you a better
rate for a higher amount. For long term reference, last year the UYU
to USD rate oscillated between 19 and 20 pesos to the dollar. This
year it was estimated that it would end the year at around 21 pesos to
the dollar, but until now the exchange rate has only gone down.


Transportation:

There's many car rentals, but you would probably not need them for
moving around the city. For going to the office, I usually walk, and
it's not that much of a distance. There's almost always a supermarket
or something like that near everywhere, so it's not mandatory to have
a car. Of course, it's always comfortable (unless you need to go to
the Old Town during the day; you won't find a parking spot). Anyway,
taxis are expensive, uncomfortable, and completely unreliable during
the day. Especially if it's raining, it's completely impossible to get
one. They are very useful at night when going back home late, but
during the day it's sometimes better to take a bus.

Buses are also expensive (comparatively to other countries in the
region), noisy, and completely crowded at peak hours, but they do have
a pretty good coverage of the city. A bus ticket is $19 (actually,
today it's $18, but it will be $19 on February 1st) and it's good for
a one way trip. Most of the time you'll just find what line you need
and take it[1], but sometimes you might need to change bus. For that,
you can buy a 1h ticket or a 2h ticket. Both allow you to take as many
buses as you want during the alloted period, with the main other
difference being that the 1h ticket is only good for the same company
(if it is Cutcsa) or for all companies but Cutcsa. 2h tickets are good
for all bus companies (there are around four or five, with Cutcsa
being the largest one by far). For these tickets you need a special
card, to avoid people reselling the tickets. That card can also be
used to prepay the tickets, but that's really not a good option
because there's very few places to do it, so most people just use them
for the special tickets (it's a relatively new system, only a couple
of years, so infrastructure for the cards is still pretty weak). Most
likely, given where you will be staying, you won't need it (there's
good concentration of bus lines around here).


Supermarkets:

There's basically four levels of supermarkets around here. You have
Tienda Inglesa[2], which is the most expensive but also highest
quality everything (and helpful employees, which is good). The problem
is that there's few of them, but you can order online. Then there's
the decent ones: Disco and Devoto (which are different brands, but
right now are owned by the same people). Those are everywhere, and the
quality is not bad (this is mostly important for meats and fresh
vegetables, of course; factory packed stuff will be around the same
everywhere, if the brand is the same), but checkout queues can be long
during peak hours. Next you have Multiahorro, which is cheap, also
everywhere, and last time I saw it they were selling meat with a very
healthy blue color. I try to avoid them unless I have no option, and
then I only buy factory sealed stuff. Then there's also smaller
supermarkets, not belonging to any chain (or to a very small chain
with only two or three stores). Those can be good or bad, it will
depend on luck, mostly.

There's also the small corner stores, which also vary greatly in
quality and will depend on luck. You just have to go and see, but
they're mostly very useful for that time when you need something and
you don't have time to walk six or seven blocks.


Beach:

The city government says that the beaches here in Montevideo are
clean, and if you go there you will see lots of people, especially on
hot days. I would advise against going swimming there. I might be a
little paranoid about that, but they never looked clean to me. There's
pretty decent beaches at only twenty kilometers from the city center,
so why risk it?

Montevideo and other nearby places are on the River Plate. The river
doesn't officially end until Punta del Este, seventy kilometers east.
Of course, this is a very gradual change, and the more east you go,
the more ocean water you get. If you really want a beach on the
Atlantic Ocean, then Rocha is the place to go (there's many coastal
towns there to choose from, and it mostly depends on how much you
value quietness). Otherwise, there are very good places closer to the
city.

To go to any of the beach towns there's lots of buses. I don't know
the prices for everything, but for Atlántida (45km) it's about $40,
and it take about an hour and a half (yeah, it's slow; most of that
time is spent getting out of the city). Going by car you can be there
in about 45 minutes.


Things to see in Montevideo:

There's the historic area in the Old Town. Don't look too touristy
there or you will be targeted by pickpockets. If you like football (or
soccer, as it's called around there), the Estadio Centenario is where
the first World Cup was played, and it has a museum on the history of
the sport. There's also nice parks to see, and there's also the Rambla
(that's the road that runs next to the coast), which is very nice to
walk along. The Prado area is very nice, too. There's also the Cerro
de Montevideo, which is the equivalent of a big mountain here, at
about 132 meters high (it has an old fortress on top, and a very nice
view, and my girlfriend says that the rambla in that zone is very nice
too, although I've never been to it).


Safety:

Montevideo is mostly a very peaceful city, but there are risks.
There's currently a huge political debate around the issue. The
government claims that the current insecurity is mostly just the press
blowing it out of proportion and the opposition trying to exploit it
for electoral reasons; the opposition of course claims that crime has
gone up. It's hard to get to the reality there, but the truth is that
people do feel more insecure than a decade ago. In any case, it's
still safer than other big cities in the region. For touristic areas,
the main concern is pickpockets and other thieves preying on
distraction. Other than that, during the day most of the city is safe
(at least, all the areas you are likely to be around). During the
night, it gets a little more complicated. I wouldn't advise walking
alone in some areas of the city at night. Of course, if there's pubs
or such nearby, then it's probably safe.


Getting out of the city:

Other than the beaches to the East, you have Colonia to the East (very
interesting historical town, founded by the Portuguese, then taken by
the Spanish, then Portuguese, then Spanish again, and so on many
times). To the North, there's the hot springs parks in Salto and
Paysandú. I wouldn't go there during the summer, it makes no sense to
me. But during autumn and winter it can be nice. If you enjoy hiking,
the Sierra de las Ánimas[4] is nice (second highest peak in the
country, an astonishing 501 meters!). If you go there, on the other
side there's the Pozos Azules, which is very nice too.

The beach towns to the East can be nice during colder weather, too. In
particular, I like Piriápolis during winter, but maybe that's just me.

Everything in Uruguay is pretty close to everything else. The benefit
of being a smalle country is that you can take a bus to the
northernmost area of the country (Artigas) and it will take you just
around 8 hours. Not that there's much to see around there, but at
least you get an upper limit on how long it will take you to get
around.


Food:

Uruguay is a very culturally conservative country (in the basic sense
of people dislike change, not in the US politics sense). That means
most food places around are basically the same three: pizza places,
parrilla (asado and everything that comes with it), or the classic
Italian-like food of Uruguayan restaurants. There's a few different
places, and in general they tend to be pretty good, but they also tend
not to be as advertised. For example, Mexican food is not really very
spicy, and all that.

To order food, there's PedidosYa[5], which lets you order from many
different restaurants. Easier than using the phone, especially if
you're like me and hate talking to human beings.


Anything else?

Well, that's all I can think of right now.

* Ferthermoar, the vocals are super-extra-present, which doesn't match the rest of the track. Yes, they're *supposed* to be running counter to the stereo wideness of everything else, but at the moment they're so dry that they're occupying a totally different space than the rest of the mix.

* As I listen more, I realize that your drums are getting ducked a lot, most notably at places like 1.24 when you change between bass instruments. It seems you have some inconsistencies in loudnesses, blah blah blah gain structure blah blah blah compression blah blah blah.

Some places post the results online or require restaurants to post the results out front. I think it's a good system. The market *could* do it, but I think it makes a lot of sense for city or county government to perform that function. 

And to tie up the larger point, I tend to agree that the regulators here are possibly unnecessary and have too much authority, but (back to paleo) I think the larger problem is the conventional dietary advice that dominates the world of dietitians. Even without market interference I think they have problems in how they deal with dietary theories that don't fit into the American Heart Association style ""healthy whole grains"" approach.

So let me help you out, [here's the link to the full text.](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s1867es/pdf/BILLS-112s1867es.pdf)  And here's the section that you should read (since we both know you're still not going to read it):

""Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing law or authorities relating to the detention of United States citizens, lawful resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are captured or arrested in the United States.""

So all the wailing about indefinite detention of US citizens is shit.  You CAN be mad at him for avoiding questions about legalizing weed, I'll admit I'm disappointed about that too, but he isn't going to be taking risks now - it sucks but it's politics.  Plus, even if he wanted to, he couldn't legalize cannabis because the president doesn't just get to wave his magic wand and suddenly new laws.  And he doesn't have the support in Congress to pass anything remotely left leaning (never did by the way, for everyone who complains about the first two years the Democrats never had the necessary super-majority in the Senate).  

That's also why I think you Ron Paul guys are hilarious by the way.  I respect the man for sticking to his positions, and I think he's got some good ideas (and some batshit crazy ones too imo, but then again it's just as likely that he's right and I'm wrong about what we disagree on).  No matter what though, even if Paul is elected, things aren't going to radically change.  They just aren't.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to break this to you, but you would need to elect Ron Paul, and then hundreds of Ron Paul clones to fill Congress because otherwise his more... outlandish... ideas aren't going to even reach his desk.

I believe so, yes.  Because if their names are kept secret they're more likely to continue to live a normal social life, including dating and finding themselves in a position where (if they're rapists) they can rape again.

Items, other players, builds, all sorts of things that you need to react to, if someones doing some bizzare, you won't have time to read a guide to find out how to counter it, so I guess you just try to play through it and understand whats happening.

Good Fundamentals and game knowledge are your best friends in the dota world, guides only give you so much of both.","1328056211"

Occasionally I'll be pretty wounded, or I'll see a teammate pretty wounded, but the medic continues to pocket their heavy that's at full health, and they don't spread the heals around to others because they tunnel vision on their current pocket.

Now when an uber is coming up, I can see the argument for wanting to keep your uber target(s) ok at the risk of others, but the times I'm referring to aren't those big push times.

It can just be a pain to be standing next to a medic reflecting rockets via airblast or blocking them with my face so the medic doesn't take them (depending on which class I'm playing) and then stand there for 2 minutes shouting for a heal.

I don't understand how you can make this conclusion. Regardless of what analogy is used (despite the fact that the sheep/shepard analogy is not the only one used in the whole of the Bible, something that you seem to assume) the message is still be universal. And who said sheep are lead to slaughter? Sheep were kept for their wool. They were not killed or eaten. 

As far as the word ""fleece"" - the meaning you cited is a figurative meaning, not a literal one. Just because something is associated with another thing doesn't mean that the author intends for the second thing to be evoked by the first.

There are a lot of different analogies in the Bible, not just the one about sheep. And the connotations that sheep have are irrelevant to an analogy - they were most likely not associated with the word when the Bible was written, and just because someone uses an analogy does not mean that ALL possible logical and connotative meanings are intended.

""I don't want to be a sheep, and I don't want a shepherd.""

Before, if and when I got depressed, I just sorted of tried to wait it out. I would shut down, withdraw from the world. This really never helped me, but it was the coping mechanism that I knew and practiced.  What makes my future brighter is not that I can say ""I will never be depressed or anxious,"" rather I can now say ""When I do experience depression and anxiety I have the tools to manage and cope with it in a productive way.""

Therapy is really about learning to discover yourself. That is the first step, to become interested in YOU. Once you understand yourself, you can then start to make the decisions to change what you don't like. 

As my mom often says to me: ""Baby steps.""  Take the smallest steps towards recovery. Don't let the whole process weigh you down. Focus on what you can do, and learn to accept what you can't. 

On a side note, it is really interesting and remarkable that much of depression and anxiety management comes from eastern religion. For some reason, meditation really works for a lot of people (including me).","1328056237"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Can't say I can give you a source (ie, an actual instance you could read), though perhaps Google would bring something up.

However I have heard arguments of that nature fairly frequently from religious people, and also, though very rarely, from non-religious people. The argument is that if people don't subscribe to a religion and its tenets, they have no moral compass; without the threat/reward of hell/heaven, people have no motivation to not do immoral things. It is said with alarming frequency that atheists ""don't believe in anything,"" and from here it is supposed that an atheistic nation would be a horrible one indeed (at this point, either Hitler's Third Reich or Stalin's Soviet Russia are often brought up, though more imaginative debaters may bring up places like Vietnam to try and make their case.). 

A lot of people (usually my fellow US citizens) don't realize that places like Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are considerably more atheistic, or at least non-religious (there seems to be resistance to the title ""atheist"" even there), than places like [the US] but still outstanding showings on measures of quality of living; in other words, a surprising number of people aren't aware of places like Sweden as a counterexample to the core claim that a place 'suffering' from a relative deficit of religion would be rife with crime, instability, and the like.

tl;dr: The argument, at least in a less colorful, more basic form, is very, very common, especially in the Southern US.","1328056237"

Yes. They regularly eat small to medium alligators fairly easily. Large alligators fight eat them, but it's a pretty fair fight between the two.

&gt;Why there are so many people down here who insist on introducing invasive species into the environment is beyond me. We also have a big problem in South Florida with giant African Snails, apparently brought in for some kind of Santeria ritual. They are known to eat concrete.

If I recall correctly, the pythons numbers are so bad not because of released pets, but because one importer was a dumbass. When a hurricane was coming, I think Andrew maybe, he left his snkaes behind and headed out. When the hurricane hit, roughly a thousand snake were escaped during the damage. So I wouldn't blame the idiots releasing their pets much, as if it weren't for the complete dumbass that left all his snakes when the hurricane came, there wouldn't be nearly as many snakes and the problem may not have even gotten this bad.","1328056239"

(Though more as you level up, obviously.)  *EDIT: This is the key to enjoying Rift, since Rift is all about random people coming together for dynamic content.  Do yourself a favor and roll on a high-pop server.*

2. It's more even on PVE servers, on PVP servers expect Defiant dominance.  Having played both, Defiant lore is MUCH cooler, imho so are the steampunk horse mounts, but the Guardians are a bit more aesthetically pleasing from a female perspective. (Female Bahmi and the Kelari don't appeal to me at all, plus Guardians have dwarves and is the first game ever to have cute female dwarves).  That said, The Guardian city SUCKS.  I'm currently playing Guardian. :P  (My first 50 was Defiant)

3.  I'd stay away from Clerics.  While they can tank and can finally DPS, they are certainly the least interesting mechanics wise.  Honestly I would go with rogue if I were you.

"AppalachianTrail","t5_2stbz","&gt;but I get paid for a full week for high availability.

I would say you're not going to be able to be highly available. Even with a SAT phone and a netbook in a bounce box. If you promise your employer high availability I doubt you're going to be able meet that promise and stay on trail.

A better way of going about this might be telling them you'll check in periodically. Every three to five days you'll be in town and will call in and respond to those requests and tasks at that time with a bounced net book or laptop. You're not going to be able to leave the phone on 24/7. You'll have to check it at night anyway or during lunch, either way once a day. So what's it matter if you get the call in the woods and say ""Yeah I'll get to that in three days in Damascus.""  

Solar chargers are a mixed bag. The people I knew that had them never got much charge out of them. They could power an iPod a little and make it last a little longer than it would have without it but you're in leaf cover during the summer and dealing with indirect sunlight when you start. 

What you're proposing just isn't really viable. Your employer is going to have to be very flexible to make this work even if you're checking in every three to five days. Bouncing the netbook is going to cause you some headaches. You'll be locked into certain towns/hostels. If it gets routed wrong or lost you've got problems. Some places are in ""town"" but still have nonexistent cell and data service. If you get a hotel or hostel with wifi its a miracle.

I'm not saying its impossible necessarily. I mean an 8 year old, a blind guy and an 81 year old man have done it but ""I'm the guy that managed to hike from my home office."" just doesn't have the same romance to it.","1328056247"

1) I hate the term fair share and cannot stand it because people are stupid and have n o idea what fair share means nor do they understand raising tax rates does nothing for 'fair share. Its all about the loop holes we need tax reform not higher taxes. See those large 'fat cats can afford to pay smart tax lawyers that the small business cannot. So you see if you want to fix this its tax reform higher taxes only hurt the people who cannot afford to find the way around them. Someone like Warren buffet or bill gates can a afford to get around I t. 

2) Americans are not neccisarily working harder but technology is increasing productivity. See the wage increase is actusll a little bit sway because higher divorce rates bring down family incomes and the higher population means the median income will often sway lower because it takes time to make large some of money but the population is growing fast

3) the government and I know i am using this administration as an example but others do it enforce laws and give tax breaks for those they like for example there are three major guitar companies in the us they all import from the same people but only one have been vocal against Obama and donated large some to the gop. This one has been raided three times for importing illegal goods aka wood from India because India has an a skew law that is not enforced..... so to sum up the problem the goverment does not defend out rights equally

4) OK so on this point your right infastucture and educatio. Are key but the success and drastic i crease in wealth had little to do with the governments spending. It had more to do with the fact we were the largest industrialized country to not have our manufacture crippled due to ww2

5) the is fundementally different than Europe and always has been we believe that people and states are better equipped to help than the government. This is the way it should be in the us that we promote not only people helping themselves but businesses and individuals doing it. By using the government you give people incentives to not care anymore, something g you often see in Europe. Its just a different system and if we teach compassion and hard work it should not matter if the government provides assisatance or not because the locals can do it better","1328056249"

The vast majority would quit if they really had an opportunity to double your salary as your friend does. Often times, being too specialized can mean that you are less skilled at the jobs that are actually needed.  Being specialized means more money, if your specific skills are in demand and that demand is currently not being met.  Otherwise, being a ""niche"" employee can really screw you.  Again, this varies from position to position.  

A scientist working at Nasa is probably not guaranteed to get an equally high paying job if he/she were to quit tomorrow, since those skills are less necessary in the private sector.  

Will that contractor give your friend the same pension?  Will it guarantee him a career longer than a few years?  Is that contractor insulated from business shocks?  Will he get to go home at a specific time most of the time?

The R.1s were IMO the best version as they held up a long time and felt like they had low rolling resistance. They were however prone to flats. When those finally expired I went with the ZX. While I like them I prefer the R.1s. The ZXs roll well (supposedly better than R.1s), and I've had close to no flats. However, they're also 15-20g heavier and while they rarely flat, if you puncture to the side of the center belt the tire's pretty much trashed. I had a 2 week old ZX puncture 1-2cm off the centerline of tire on a thumb sized rock and it was unsalvageable. Gripping is exceptional but at 70$ a tire it's a hard thing to justify.","1328056252"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Just had to comment on Epicurus.  The answer to me has always been that God (even though I don't believe in him) must fall into the able-but-not-willing category and that Epicurus is wrong to say that this makes God malevolent.  

Parents allow children to exercise free will to a degree because it is an important part of their development.  God must feel that allowing us to exercise our own free will is more important than anything else.  And since we all have immortal souls it doesn't really *hurt* us to occasionally kill each other because one of us exercised our free will a bit too enthusiastically.  

Or so that's what I'd believe if I believed that stuff.","1328056259"

When I first found out I was pregnant I moved back in with my family thinking I was going to place my son in a adoptive family.  His birth father could not be happier about that because he wants nothing to do with kids, or his own son to this day.

In the hospital I made the choice to keep him.  To this day I'm glad I did. 

I contacted the father and he freaked out, and hung up on me.  I could care less about him but the one thought that ran through my mind was ""did he tell his family?"" I contacted his Great grandmother, who called me a few days later.  My ex never denied being the father so there was no question at all when his family came to him wondering why their 2nd grandchild was two weeks old and they didn't know about him.

That same week his parents and grandparents drove for two hours to come see Curtis (my son) and I.  His mother forced him to pay Child Support that day and took it from his college funds.  They always call and ask if I need anything, they take him once or twice a month to visit.  They have been more supportive then my OWN parents if you take out the fact my parents are giving me free rent right now. (I love my parents I promise)

Family is the most important thing and there is nothing wrong with you wanting to be in your grandchilds life, and make sure he has everything he needs, even if your son is being the way he is.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","&gt; You're looking at a spectrogram and fiddling with the formant settings until you get something that ""looks good""?

No, I'm adjusting the settings until the tracked formants actually line up (as much as possible) with what's visible in the spectrogram. If I didn't, the readings wouldn't be accurate.

&gt; Ideally, you should be using the same settings for every token that you're analyzing.

No, I shouldn't. Not when analyzing speech from different speakers and different recordings. Even when extracting data from multiple segments within the same recording it doesn't make sense for me to keep the settings, when the formants are visible in the spectrogram and Praat hasn't found them. (It also tends to mess up F1 and F2 for back vowels, since they tend to be very close or even overlap.)

&gt; it sounds like the solution that you're proposing is suboptimal. You want to be able to draw in a formant track where you think it is. If you really want to do that, you can just click on the place in the spectrogram and write down what frequency the cursor is at.

I want to be able to correct the formant track to where I *know* it is, because it's visible in the spectrogram but Praat is getting it wrong or not getting it at all. I would do my own readings (as you suggested, and as I mentioned in my post), but doing so for 10.000--15.000 measurements isn't really viable. Here's a screenshot of a problematic tracking &lt;http://i.imgur.com/1Bk5b.png&gt;. As you can see, Praat is definitely not tracking F4 correctly at the middle. F3 is shady too --- especially at the beginning, while F1 and F2 are mostly fine. Now, if Praat would let me manually correct those points, it would be a lot faster and definitely more accurate than Praat's raw measurements.

I like your idea about having a script tracking the formants and asking if they're correct, but the main problem is that I have yet to see Praat get the formants completely correct --- regardless of settings --- for less-than-perfect recordings (and unfortunately I am working on less-than-perfect recordings here).","1328056266"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You're confused on something. God answers prayers, and He sometimes says ""yes."" But this doesn't mean that he *has* to say ""yes"" to everything. That's called magic - manipulating God to do whatever you want. God isn't our slave.

The key here is directly stated (as opposed to indirectly inferred or assumed) in these:

Mt 21:22.........""...whatever things you ask in prayer, **believing**, you will receive.""

Jn 14:14........ ""If you ask anything **in my name**, I will do it.""

Jn 16:23........ ""...whatever you ask the Father **in My name** He will give you.""

Jas 5:16........ ""The effective, fervent prayer of a **righteous** man avails much.""

1Jn 5:14........ ""Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that **if we ask anything according to His will**, He hears us.""

Jn 14:13........ ""And whatever you ask **in My name**, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.""

Jn 15:7.......... ""**If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you**, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.""

Jn 15:16........ ""You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father **in My name** He may give you.""

There are a few common themes here - belief, righteousness, God's will, and ""in my name."" All these things are tied together. ""In my name"" isn't just tacking on ""in the name of Jesus"" to whatever you pray. It's a locative of sphere, grammatically. It refers to a person's standing in God - not hierarchically, but are they with God, praying His will, with His Spirit... it's very hard to describe. The closest I can get would be a D&amp;D alignment, but even that's not really good.

Ultimately, it is summed up in Ps 141:2 - ""Let my prayer be set before You as incense, the lifting of my hands as the evening sacrifice."" True prayer, even in petition, is an act of *worship*. In a sense, the answer - ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""not yet"" - is irrelevant at that time.

The common protest is, as the one person made above, ""but what about people who are dying?"" The answer is still pretty irrelevant. We all die. Even people whom Jesus resurrected, like Lazarus, died again anyway. Lazarus isn't around now. The death of the body isn't of great concern, because it's going to happen anyway. We never have any promise of living to the next second, let alone day. So, whether I live or die is irrelevant. I have a preference, and naturally I pray to God that I continue living. But if God chooses that I should die, it'll be a bit disappointing, but it isn't a terrible thing.

What matters is this: ""Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell"" (Matt 10:28). For humanity, only two things really matter: (1) Worshiping God, since that is the entire purpose of our existence and (2) the salvation of humanity, which was accomplished in the resurrection.

Does this mean we don't help those in need? Of course not. Christians should help the poor, the sick, and anyone else who is in need. But the purpose of these acts isn't necessarily that these people might live, because they will die at some point anyway. The purpose is to show God's love and to worship God. And it is one of the most effective ways of doing both.","1328056267"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Reminds me of what happened about a year ago. This nice looking cat kept coming into my backyard looking sad and hungry. My wife started feeding it and the thing just fell in love with her. Have two young kids and trying to make ends meet with just me working to feed and pay the mortgage I told her we couldnt keep it. Weeks of fighting with my wife about this. The whole time the    cat keeps coming back never with a collar and has fleas. My wife wants me to walk around the neighborhood and ask if the cat belonged to anyone. I tell her that's a lot of work with a low success rate. 
  I have to admit the damn thing was incredibly cute and friendly, my kids loved chasing it around to pet it. But, a lot of birds come to our backyard and the cat was ""going rogue"" on their asses. So me and my wife come to an agreement: I take it to the pound, and if it's not claimed I adopt it before it gets euthanized. I take it to the pound and tell them to contact me before euthanizing it. They advise me that it would be better NOT to leave it with them because the conditions weren't great and the cat would probably catch a disease or parasite if left there. 
   Decision time and I said fine, fate wants my family to have this cat. Don't turn it in the pound, take it to the vet where we spent over $300 on vaccines, shots and spay. Named the cat Kismet (fate), my wife and kids love it to death. 
  3 days later, the family next door on welfare come knocking at the door asking if we've seen their cat thats been missing for 2 weeks. What?!  This family has trouble feeding their 6 kids, no one works, and they have 4 poorly fed dogs (gov't assisted rent). I thought it was impossible they'd get a cat because it would be irresponsible so I didnt even think to ask them. We give them the cat back, they get evicted a month later for some reason or another. We never see the cat again, wife broken hearted. (that family collected animals and never fed or took care of them and the animals would always run away. Then they just get another.  Could never figure how they could afford to even afford to get them)

TL, DR: adopted irresponsible neighbors cat after weeks of fighting, spent $300, gave cat back to neighbors. Hearts broken","1328056270"
"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","There are more factors at play than just the distance food is shipped. Food grown in a friendly climate (ideal sunlight, soil conditions, humidity, and fauna), then shipped across an ocean on a freighter with tens of thousands of tons of other goods will usually be more sustainable than locally grown foods in a non-native environment. Growing crops out of their natural climates can require frequent watering, pesticides, and fertilizers, which, together, create a less efficient agricultural environment.

I figure changing people's food consumption to only native crops is something too radical to be adopted.","1328056270"

 Perhaps he has been struggling with the question so long he just wanted the answer by that point; I know I've been there.  I've also thought I understood a concept well and still not been able to get an answer that was correct so sometimes the actual question solution is helpful.  Either way I don't see how the TA hanging out on Yahoo Answers and being snarky instead of telling him to come to him if he has a problem is helpful.  It's like he's saying *shame on you for being a bad student, let me show you how great a teacher I am for insulting you instead of offering to help you.*  He might be acting like a bad student, but the TA isn't being much better.  

Also, the TA's comment sounds to me more like shame on you for not figuring out the answer you are too stupid to study this.

Yes. The BMR drop is due to the lower mass that needs to be supported. There are some exceptions to that (like when you are starving to death) but in both of the scenarios you listed - BMR will lower if you lose weight.

In addition: As you exercise more - your body becomes more efficient at those exercises and you burn fewer calories doing them (which is why intensity/duration must be increased).

The upside is, exercise has benefits other than weightloss - so it should be included even if your diet is awesome. ","1328056277"

For example, at my job I ring people up on a Verifone, and then am required to hit either Visa/MC, Amex, or Gift Redeem on the register, depending on the type of card they used. 

When I first started, I would frequently hit the wrong button, mostly because I was simply going through the ritual and not paying attention. I was buy talking to the customer or doing something like that. 

To combat it, I started saying ""On the Mastercard"" or ""On the ***** Card"" to tell myself which button to press. 

That was nine months ago. It's so habitual to say ""On the *type of card*"" that I don't notice it anymore, and I forget and hit the wrong button again.

"programming","t5_2fwo","[LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/) is one of the [best VM's around](http://attractivechaos.wordpress.com/2011/01/23/amazed-by-luajit/). 
The Lua language is very efficiently designed with performance and memory efficiency in mind, so the VM isn't starting out [fighting an uphill battle](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3851#comment-57643) against all the baggage that JavaScript and Python are cursed with. And Mike Pall, the guy working on LuaJIT, really knows what he's doing. 

&gt;How to be a millionaire

&gt;Old Steve Martin joke...

&gt;So after you get the million dollars, you have to do all those things Mike said -- his analysis is spot on.

&gt;One thing Mike didn't highlight: get a simpler language. Lua is much simpler than JS. This means you can make a simple interpreter that runs fast enough to be balanced with respect to the trace-JITted code.

&gt;IIRC, LuaJIT2 does not nest trace-trees (loops) via call instructions, as the UC Irvine researchers have done, and as we do in TraceMonkey. It simply runs the outer loop in the fast-enough interpreter. In TraceMonkey nowadays, we not only nest trees, we trace tail and direct recursion.

&gt;JS is surely a beast compared to Lua, but it's the one language interoperably implemented across browsers. This interoperation condition is hard to achieve (C, Scheme, etc. don't try -- compiler writers guard the standards' underspecification to enable optimization experiments; deployed code is firewalled generally, or only ported slowly), and harder still to justify supplementing with yet more (generally unsafe-code) language implementations.

&gt;So people are targeting JS with compilers, more and more from compilers running in-browser. JS is the X86 of the Web.

&gt;The national church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland, is presbyterian in governance (not recognising authority of bishops) so with no bishops or dioceses, and thus has high kirks rather than cathedrals. However, the pre-Reformation dioceses do have extant cathedrals, some of which (such as that of St Andrews) are now in ruins.
As noted above, both Perth and Elgin were recognised as cities prior to 1975. Additionally, five other pre-Reformation sees—Brechin, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Kirkwall and St Andrews—are often referred to as cities. Dornoch, Fortrose and Whithorn also possess pre-Reformation cathedrals.
Stirling, which was awarded city status in 2002, has never had a cathedral and Inverness, which was awarded city status in 2001, did not historically have a cathedral until the present episcopal building in the late 19th century, 3 centuries after the Reformation removed the authority of bishops in Scotland.

"politics","t5_2cneq","""They repeatedly denied building nuclear weapons""

I don't think I'm unreasonable in not trusting anything ~~Iran~~ any country says.

""They have a nuclear program now, and they still aren't building weapons.""

When any country wants to fuck around with nuclear power of any kind, I think the burden should be on them to prove its peaceful, not for us to assume it's peaceful. I could be wrong about that, but I'm really, really uncomfortable with assuming Iran's stuff is peaceful.

""The IAEA has been in Iran and monitoring the program for years; they confirm there has been no enrichment to weapons grade.""

How recent is this? When was the last time they confirmed that?

""As far as their government, their Supreme Leader issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons years ago, banning their construction or use.""

I don't trust anything a religious guy says in any religious decrees either.

""what would it do to Iran if they suddenly announced they were building them?""

That's a good point, but you could argue that having nukes would be better for them, so I'm not convinced. I find it *extremely* hard to believe that these right-wing jackasses are even aware they'd be proving us right. They do believe their bullshit, as far as I'm aware, and that means good, solid reason is soundly out the window. You may be right, but I'm not convinced.

""If Iran wanted to build a nuke, they'd have to kick out the inspectors and withdraw from the NPT. At that point, they'd need a year to build a bomb.""

Unless they're able to do it more secretly. Once you have enriched uranium, it's not really that hard to build a bomb, is it? I mean, you could do it in somebody's basement. Maybe you're right, but I find it hard to believe the inspectors would be able to do much even in the country once the they have fissile material. The whole point of the inspectors is to prevent that from happening, I thought. Am I wrong? That's coming from a layman perspective, though, so if you (or anyone) can prove that's not true, I'll concede the point (and possibly the argument, as that's a big one.)

So, look, I think I was pretty reasonable and fair in my addressing each point. I could be wrong on them, and if you can prove me wrong, I'll back off and give you the debate. I would *love* to be wrong about Iran. I really don't want to go to war with them.

If they're getting nuclear weapons, I think we need to. I'm not at all convinced that they're not.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","The difference is that the linear sequence in FFXIII is designed to *thoroughly* teach the system to the player.  

Sure, the designers spent far, far too long teaching the game with slowly increasing complexity instead of letting us play it, but that is the downside of releasing an FF game in the age of Triple A titles.  It had to be accessible, and they fell into the trap trying to make the game playable to the average idiot, who would have gotten bored of it after a few hours anyway.  I'm not defending this decision, but I am defending the design intention.  It was specifically made to be a certain way, to match the battle system which to me is one of the best ever made.  It's just not to everyones tastes.

&gt;If I played the first 10 chapters of that game repeatedly, it would be exactly the same, down to the amount of EXP my characters get.

You noticed this part, but if you pay attention you'll notice that the dungeons are intentionally designed to escalate your battles.  You'll fight one type of enemy, then two, then a different type, then a mix of the two types and so on, all in a very deliberate order.  This of course is only possible to do if your progression is linear.  There was an overly cautious focus on stepping the player through the mechanics of the game, again because I don't think the developers had confidence in some players picking up the stagger system.

Compare this to Call of Duty, which is the same skills being tested over and over again with more and more explosions.  There is no system to learn; you've mastered what needs to be mastered by the time you've finished the third level.","1328056303"

I went up and tried to talk to her and she giggled and ran away (like ten feet).  I followed her again and asked if she spoke english, she shook her head.  Then she grabbed a bottle of wine and held it out to me and smiled and nodded her head.  I knew she meant it was a type she liked.  So I bought it and held it up to her with a facial expression like, ""Care to join me?""  She nodded her head, smiling again, and we went and sat down in the middle cafe tables.  Just as I started to wonder how we were going to drink it, she shouted 'oh!' and ran up into one of the buildings (I later learned she lived there) came down with a corkscrew and two glasses.

The next day I came out to the market again just hoping she'd be there.  She popped up ten minutes or so after I did.  After finding out where she lived, I like to think she saw me down there and came to see me.

Since I came down roughly the same time as the day before, I just officially made that the time I would come to market to find her.  It worked.  She was a true beauty and had a delicate demeanor about her which was just angelic.  I truly think that if we had spoken, we would have found out we had nothing in common at all.","1328056303"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Unfortunately, many high schoolers are criticized for speaking their minds as any teenager would.  However, working in a high school where bullying, gangs, students with serious family issues, and just plain old drama exists all the time, any threat observed and reported has to be assessed.  It is a (unfair) balance of making sure the school doesn't miss anything that could incriminate them later if something were to happen, but also to make sure that students are safe. The second element is extremely important. 

You definitely should not have been kicked out of school and forced to go to jail. The ""Columbine effect"" has unfairly led to increased suspension, expulsion, and jail time for teenagers, which ultimately leads to pretty fucked up lives for a lot of people. Although your situation was not fair and the school should have handled it far differently, I have hope because at least in the school I work in, the culture is shifting to how to restoratively fix problems without taking students out of school.  

If the school had handled it appropriately, the social worker should have assessed that you were being bullied and have focused on working through that problem and adequately supporting you with any other academic/family problems.

Okay. Here's a funny excerpt from his We The People Act:

&gt;(7) Supreme Court and lower Federal court decisions striking down local laws on subjects such as religious liberty, sexual orientation, family relations, education, and abortion have wrested from State and local governments issues reserved to the States and the People by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

&gt;(8) The Supreme Court and lower Federal courts threaten the republican government of the individual States by replacing elected government with rule by unelected judges.

&gt;(9) Even supporters of liberalized abortion laws have admitted that the Supreme Court's decisions overturning the abortion laws of all 50 States are constitutionally flawed (e.g., Ely, `The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade' 82 Yale L.J. 920 (1973)).

"China","t5_2qh2v","Sorry these guys are wrong. I use Google Voice in China and make free calls to the US using my Nexus S. The tricky part is setting it up, as you do need to assign your phone a US number. Heading off to work in a moment, but I'll post the website that showed me how to do this later. Basically you need to set up your phone for Internet calling, which is quite easy on the Nexus S, and only slightly more difficult on other phones (needs a separate app).

That said, you'll still have to pay for calls made within China or to other countries besides the US. Also, Google Voice call access is limited by the fact that you need to have an active Internet connection to send or receive calls. As for call quality, it is mostly fine, sounds a bit compressed, but the biggest problem is that there is noticeable lag going this route. Not enough to make phone calls impossible, but it is noticeable. I've never had connection issues to Google Voice in China from my home Internet connection, either. 

The reason I went with Google Voice is because Skype has increased its service fees for connecting calls. Since most of my international calls are to the US, there seemed little point in continuing to use it for VOIP calls. It's generally fine for Skype to Skype though.

The problem with kilt is when you're flashing people you are dumping every ounce of stored heat in the kilt. You can get very cold very quick.

Also - on the note of heat... Beyond the factor of heavy kilts being warm the wool weight against the body creates awesome friction heat while hiking/walking just from the sway of the kilt. 

-------------

Edit : If your looking for a lightweight kilt for hiking get a traditional cut in an acrylic wool. They are dirt cheap and pretty good quality.

It really is a cultural difference. How you would handle the bullying is un-heard of where i come from. And seen as weak. ( NO offense )

"canada","t5_2qh68","I'm not so sure.

I'll fully admit I'm naive.

If I were in charge I'd reform our Armed Forces.

A focus on digging in and defending.  A focus on building things.  A focus on search and rescue.  And a large focus on transport capacity.

I don't want our men and women to be the first up the hill.  I want them to make damn sure nobody takes that hill back.  Canadians hold our line.

If we develop a large engineering corps we could utilize them to build and maintain road/rail/ports/telecommunication, especially in places that require service but private industry wouldn't invest in.  (then lease our property to private industry)  When times are bad our troops can be the first boots on the ground to help our neighbours rebuild.

Search and rescue capacity is important for any country as large and varied as ours.  If we build and train more than we need then we'll have units to rent/share.

If Canada builds/buys the largest boats and planes we can provide the best logistical support to those who need us.  We can rent our large transport capacity to private industry and other nations when we are not using them.  (think: Poland with it's Hercules or Russia with it's Antonovs)

Basically, lots of keyboards are built with the same key structure, and the fault of this structure is that when certain keys are pressed in combination, some of them may not be recognized.

Some keyboards are marketed as ""anti-ghosting"" but ghosting is still possible with them. These keyboards simply map commonly-used key combinations differently to avoid ghosting, but it is still possible.

The good news is there's nothing wrong with your game or computer. The bad news is, it's a design flaw of the keyboards you're using that is doing this.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","You sound like me. I've been playing music my whole life and never wanted to do anything else. I wanted to make it big and so did my band mates, so we collectively decided to just smash it and work hard until we got somewhere. 

We released our first EP after two years of hard work to a sold out room of nearly 300 people, we played with some of the countries biggest acts, were on the brink of doing a tour of the east coast of the country and we were told, like you, by everyone we knew that if we sat down and did the hard work we would be one the biggest acts in the country. All off one EP. 

Then all of a sudden the two other guys in the band just stopped caring. We were doing two shows a week for months and were on a roll and they just stopped caring. Our singer just decided he wanted to be a politician and instantly shifted his focus to University. Our drummer was a lazy guy anyway so he just stopped caring once the drive was gone.

I think it was when I found out that we had been contacted about doing a tour in the US but our singer said we couldn't because he wanted to focus on uni (behind our backs) that I realized it was over. Then I realized that I had to somehow make a new career without any educational foundation except for two years of film school that I dropped out of to pursue music. Luckily I have always had a secret passion for photography and me and my brother started a business that will allow me to make money doing something I love and to support my fiancée/future wife (who I never would have met if it weren't for the band FYI).

I can no longer play an instrument for more than fifteen minutes now without moving onto something else. I've completely lost the love and cannot produce music at all. I don't look back on it with fondness either, I look at it like a girlfriend who left me just one day with sadness, regret and bitterness.

Keep going though, find something you love that you're good at and pursue it as a career. It's just always going to be hard to look at other musicians without feeling immense sadness for what you've lost. ","1328056332"

There are parts of my job that I can't stand already. Grading is a royal nightmare. Kids don't want to do work if they aren't getting graded on it, and I don't want to spend 2 hours a day grading stuff. There are many tricks to making it easier, but it is still a lot of work. I also can't stand students who don't let me do my job. I never realized how readily kids will jump at an opportunity to goof off, slack off, and do stupid things. I feel like I have to fill every minute of class time with *something* for them to do just to keep them from going crazy.

That said, I do like teaching for the most part. My kids are great overall, they work hard, they learn well, and they are usually quite respectful.

I didn't know that I wanted to be a teacher until I was in my mid twenties. I always knew I wanted to do something with science, but I could never pick a field ... now I teach a little bit of all of the main branches of science.","1328056336"

"Seattle","t5_2qhad","&gt; What proof are you looking for? I think agent provocateurs are classified info,and usually that information isn't released until decades later, if at all.

That's really all I'm looking for: any proof.  The fact that agent provocateurs exist doesn't mean a given instance of ill behavior is an agent provocateur.  In one case, you gave a decent reason to believe that a person was actually a provocateur.

But for a while there, it was very much a trend to blame any and all bad behavior on the police.  Someone broke a window?  Provocateur, and no reason to ask for proof.  Ask for proof?  Get talked down to as if you're trying to deny they exist or somehow place the blame somewhere it doesn't belong.  It was very much intellectually dishonest back-peddling.

But yeah, if someone has actual *evidence* that someone is a provocateur beyond, ""They did some bad stuff and everyone *knows* that OWS protesters don't do bad stuff"" then, sure, I'm game.  The problem here is when supporters resort to dishonest arguments to shift blame away from OWS.  I'm not expecting them to be perfect - any protest is going to have bad elements.

I'll ask you the question in the inverse, WHY DONT YOU RAPE SOMEONE? What is the consequence? You repent for a while say you're sorry and feel bad, then you're good and re-secure your place in heaven. So answer why you don't rape people?

Also, there are things that are, by common sense objectively moral and immoral. For example Allowing people that don't advocate the existence of a certain group of people do make decisions on human existence is immoral. There doesn't need to be a god to tell me that.

There are certain moral truths that I accept, objective moral truths that God himself doesn't follow(making me far more morally just than your god). 

It is morally wrong to deliberately and mercilessly slaughter men, women, and children who are innocent of any serious wrongdoing.

That is in my opinion and moral truth.

God himself drowned the whole human race except Noah and his family [Gen. 7:23]; he punished King David for carrying out a census that he himself had ordered and then complied with David's request that others be punished instead of him by sending a plague to kill 70,000 people [II Sam. 24:1-15]; and he commanded Joshua to kill old and young, little children, maidens, and women (the inhabitants of some 31 kingdoms) while pursuing his genocidal practices of ethnic cleansing in the lands that orthodox Jews still regard as part of Greater Israel [see Josh., chapter 10 in particular]. These are just three out of hundreds of examples of God's violations of this truth

And I can do this for a few other things.

The fact is YOUR god is morally corrupt and MY morals are what guide me to do the correct thing.","1328056351"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Here is the best advice I can give you from my experiences and what I know about the physiology of the female prostate (urethral sponge) and how you can stimulate it through the g-spot area.

Squirting takes a lot of practice and knowledge about your body and ultimately a deep comfort with the fluids it produces. Getting the right stimulation is important but learning to relax is key.

The g-spot is located about 1-3 inches deep on the front wall of the vagina. Its best to stimulate it by applying A LOT of pressure and a ""come here"" type motion. This can be done with your fingers or a partner's fingers or a good toy. My favorite toy to use to make me squirt is [this](http://www.edenfantasys.com/sex-toy-reviews/dildos/blushing-pink) glass dildo. The link I sent you is a review of the toy I did for Eden Fantasys and it will give you more information about it if you are interested.

When you stimulate the g-spot she should start to feel a sensation that feels remarkably similar to the urge to pee. This happens because the g-spot is a region of the vaginal wall that is located directly over an organ called the urethral sponge or the Skene's glands. This structure is made up of thousand's of tiny glands and ducts and it will swell and engorge with fluid when it is stimulated. As the urethral sponge swells it applies pressure to the urethra. Expansion of the bladder also applies pressure on the urethra so the nerves that pick up this change in pressure signal the brain in the same way needing to urinate would. This is why the urge to ejaculate feels so similar to the urge to pee. If she is worried about peeing she shouldn't be. Have her urinate before you play so you don't have to worry about it. She will still ejaculate large amounts of fluid.

As the ""need to pee"" sensation grows stronger it will crest and she'll start to feel slightly tingly. At this point she is very close to being able to achieve orgasm. I know I personally need to add clitoral stimulation though if I am to reach orgasm but I know some women can orgasm without clitoral stimulation. Try adding the clitoral stimulation if you are having trouble. When I add clitoral stimulation (usually by use of a vibrator on my clitoris) I allow my body to relax deeply. To ejaculate she has to relax deeply and let go allowing the fluid to flow out of her. It feels similar to how you relax when you urinate (the same muscles are used). This is the hardest part of the whole process. Most women don't get past this point since they typically clamp down because they are worried about peeing. It takes practice so keep trying.

Once she relaxes her muscles the fluid will start to flow out of her. A half second later the orgasm will begin. In my experience ejaculatory orgasms are incredibly strong and envelop the full body rapidly. It starts in the pelvic region and then spreads quickly up the body and all the way to the limbs. It happens so abruptly that it feels like getting hit by a bus. Extremely intense contractions of the pelvic floor muscles will follow orgasm.

Squirting takes some practice and it takes some time to learn to get the orgasm and the ejaculation timed together. I don't think my orgasm and ejaculation were simultaneous in the beginning. I can't remember exactly though because I was so excited the first time it happened I was euphoric anyway. Keep practicing have her learn to really relax.","1328056359"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Hey, I forgot to get back to you about the regulations part of my argument. You may not care anymore... but here it is anyway. Well, not all of the regulations are directly federal, but the culture that has been created by policies enacted by the federal government is very much to blame. This being the dependent welfare culture, where people believe they are owed things without doing anything to owe them, and the idea that it is the governments job to protect us. This has lead to an increasingly lazy and demanding work force, and regulations in the name of safety, like the many health regulations on the food industry. 

The biggest burden that the federal government puts on people who might want to start a small business is taxes. The average American gives away half of his earnings to the government, much of it federal.

Then there is the housing market that has been crippled by government interference. In the name of making sure everyone can buy a home the government forced banks to give out loans. This surge of money in the real estate market drove up prices, including prices on buildings that could be used for commercial purposes. Then you include all of the land that is federally owned, which only the rich and well connected can purchase.

Then there is the fed that can constantly print out money, lowering the value of our money, to give to large businesses when their bloated selves mess things up and collapse. 

Then add all the permits you have to buy to be allowed to start any business and it becomes ridiculously costly, risky, and time consuming.

"environmental_science","t5_2s90l","Firstly you can't use glacier extent as an analogy to climate. Ablation from glaciers is determined, at least in part, by temperature in the summer months, that is true. However, accumulation in the winter is determined by precipitation, and there is little or no correlation between precip and temperature, in fact if anything precip increases as temp increases, so this helps to counteract the increased melt in summer.

[This](http://www.eoearth.org/files/117101_117200/117182/320px-Figure6.16_sensitivity_to_temp_rise.JPG) chart puts it another way, it shows the sensitivity of ice masses to change in climate (lilac) and their ability to contribute to sea level (blue), so greenland, for example, isn't very sensitive, but contains a lot of water. 

Greenland by the way, has, in the last few years experienced increased melt rates, [this](http://www.eoearth.org/files/117101_117200/117184/620px-Figure6.18_time_series_of_greenland_melt.JPG) is another figure showing how the area of the ice sheet that experiences any melt in summer is increasing, this is the reason why things are getting a bit worrying. 

If you look back in time to the points when ice sheets were much smaller than they are today, then sea level was higher, as you can see in smectite's post.

Most people want security. In order to have security, we inherently have to give up some of our freedoms. For example, in order for us to not be killed, we cannot kill. In order for us not to be stolen from, we can't steal. So some of our freedoms are taken away and security is gained.

Do these things still happen? Of course. But consequences and a police force will deter many potential crimes that would happen in the absence of one.

You want your ""freedom back""? What freedom. The freedom to kill? To steal? What exactly is it you're looking for? I admit that some laws are ridiculous, and if it's too much for you to take, move to another country or get involved in politics and try to make a change. We have the freedom to leave this country if we aren't pleased. The control of the military is ultimately in the hands of the civilians since we finance it.

2013 *will* be interesting. Elevenwarriors [notes](http://www.elevenwarriors.com/2012/01/the-rising#more) that OSU went 8-6 against Michigan on the 2012 recruiting trail, i.e. we hold commitments from 8 players of the 14 who received offers from both schools and are currently committed to one or the other. However, with a permanent staff in place (pre-Tressel resignation and post-Meyer), we're 8-0. Anomaly? Who knows. Make of it what you will.

I don't expect much from Penn State either, not for 5 years or so. It's my hunch that the strength of their recruiting classes has been heavily dependent on out-of-state kids who wanted to play for JoePa the Legend. Their brand is strong enough, as a top-10 all-time program and as the only major football school north of Virginia Tech and east of OSU, that they'll recover down the road, but change ain't easy. They haven't recruited without JoePa allure in a long, long time.

I agree it'll be the Big 2 where recruiting is concerned, but honestly I only see Wisconsin maintaining their level of play. I'm a big MSU skeptic. They've had a hell of a lot go their way the last couple years: 

* vs. UM +17 win over RR team; +14 win over green Hoke team
* vs. OSU no game against Tress; +3 win over **horrid** Fickell team
* vs. PSU  +6 win; no game
* vs. Wisc. +10 win; +6 win (curiously, both '10 and '11 reg. season games played in East Lansing); *-3 loss in Indianapolis*
* vs. Iowa *-31 loss*; +16 win

* Every license holder is allotted one tag in which he is allowed to place in the one fish that he brings in.
* Charter vessels, are allowed to C&amp;R, while commercial vessels are not. 
* The tuners usually appear in these numbers  around early August and are gone by mid October.
* The average price fisherman are payed for one fish is anywheres between 5-10K.

Because agnostics aren't atheists and atheists aren't agnostics. Because i see far too many people using the term in debates as a way to get by without providing reasonable arguments. 

Take your dragon question for example. If there was someone who believed in dragons, the kind of response they'd get from those who were analogous to the ""agnostic atheists"" in here would likely have been, ""Show me any evidence of dragons. Dragons are explained by myths. There's no way there could be a biological method for fire breathing. You mean to tell me a sauropod could *fly*??"" The dragon believer would say, ""Oh so you think dragons don't exist? What makes you think that? Show me evidence that there aren't dragons!"" To which the other person would say, ""whoa, hold on a minute, I just don't have reason to accept your belief it's not that I don't believe that dragons exist. I don't have to explain anything. It's a null hypothesis."" 

They would give all the reasons for thinking dragons don't exist that I did, but when pressed, they would deny holding a belief. Why? It makes no sense. The only thing I can think of is that the atheists in here are so wrapped up in evidentialism and they don't want to admit that it just doesn't work for everything.

Karma are invisible internet points.  I would like to see it kept that way by weeding out  karma only posts without content.

Reddit has always had the problem of controlling contentless posts that are simply exploiting a new meme or topic. i.e. the 'I'm so alone' or 'socially awkward brony' posts that can clutter up a sub.  While I am okay, but not exactly ecstatic about these posts there are others that are more pressing.

The 'I hear you don't downvote' or even really any mention of the voting system calls attention to it in a way that is quite annoying.  The stick figure pony that was top for a while was just kinda sad and asking for attention like child that found out waking its parents gets a lot of attention.  Regardless of whatever neat discussions ensued it was concept over content which always makes me sad...  there is such beautiful art and some really neat stories and concepts in the posts (lets face it, new is worth browsing) that it makes me sad that a 'you guys are nice and therefore can't downvote me!' is just an exploitation of kindness.  

The 'we are so awesome' posts are getting a little bad.  It was okay when it was only the your soul is mine my soul is yours screenshots and the thank yous were left to the new pile.  But now thank yous are skyrocketing to the front page.  We are a different kind of internet and that is undeniable, but simply saying that over and over makes it lose its meaning... and I don't think we want it to lose its meaning.  People can come to that conclusion on their own.

What we have to remember is that reddit is partitioned for a reason.  Different communities can thrive and prosper.  But now the general culture of reddit is spilling over.  People feel like they have to compete and it is silly.  **If I thought there was a way I would make the default tab new instead of hot.**  Everybody gets attention and a larger variety is seen by all.

It's just another direct download service.

I can't speak from experience since I haven't bought anything from Origin, but I haven't had a need to anyway.  I'm sure Origin is just fine, though, just like Impulse.  ","1328056395"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;their majority seems to think that their obligation as an atheist is to be obnoxiously militant against other religions.

Except that's not happening. The members of /r/atheism mostly keep their distaste towards religion IN /r/atheism. There are a handful of trolls that go to religious subreddits and comment, but associating that with with half million people that make up /r/atheism is unfair.

And referring to the discussion in /r/atheism as ""militant"" that's misleading. Militant behaviour is shooting up an abortion clinic, or suicide bombing a church, or rounding up and executing a bunch of people based on their beliefs. Mocking religion on the internet is about as far from militant behaviour as you can get.

&gt;If the group didn't behave like an anal-retentive holier-than-thou hate group.

That's not an accurate description of a majority, or even a significant amount, of the content on /r/atheism. There's no preaching of hate and the ""more-rational-than-thou"" attitude is almost exclusively directed at *fundamentalist* theists, which hardly seems unfair.

Like I said, please prove this.

It is the fault of Europe for spreading violence and hatred to the world? Conversation pretty much ends there. You might as well say the earth is flat or that it is 6000 years old. It figures that you similarly believe that Christianity is a complex allegory for astrology with roots in secret societies in the face of the immense historical evidence that proves otherwise. What about religion is ""evil""? Remember, you cannot use religious definitions of evil, because such definitions are primarily nothing but evil, according to you.

The Mongol conquest is the deadliest campaign in human history. Hardly European. The An Lushan Rebellion is the second. Also the fault of Europe I suppose. I think the Europeans are also responsible for tribal warfare in the Americas, and the Aztec conquest and their penchant for violence and human sacrifice?

&gt;Hunger is caused by greed, greed is caused primarily by the flawed monetary system, hatred comes from lack of understanding, and revenge comes from hatred. They are intertwined. 

So where does religion factor into that?

Honestly, Tebow does not in anyway bring up God, Jesus, or christianity anymore than other christian athletes. He is just in the spot light because of others. Christians, ESPN, and his story this year made it seem that way. A lot of players pray on the sideline, a lot of players thank god or jesus during post game interviews, and a lot of players are open about their faith.

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;Because politics directly affects citizens like you and me. Religion does not.

Except for when people let their religion inform the way they act, especially with regards to politics - which is a *very* common occurrence.  Hell, a 2007 Gallup survey found that over half of Americans would refuse to vote for an atheist for president.

But we don't have to use politics as our example.  Let's take another popular point of debate - Macs versus PCs.  I'm sure you will agree that one's preference for Mac versus PC doesn't affect anyone else.  Yet people will have very passionate arguments about which is better.  And though I agree those debates may be silly and unnecessary, I've never heard anyone called an ""anti-Mac bigot"" for saying that PCs are better, or vice versa.

&gt;It's like if I said I like the color red, and you came to me and said ""no, you're wrong"" Why would anyone say that?

Let's run with that analogy.  I don't think you'd have any problem if you said ""I like the color red,"" and I said, ""That's nice, I like the color blue.""  We disagree on which color is best, but it's a matter of personal preference.  We can both be right - my preferring blue doesn't contradict your preferring red.  I can express my color preference without saying that yours is wrong.

However, the God question is fundamentally different.  It's not a preference question, but a factual one.  Either God exists, or he does not.  If you say that you believe in God, you *must* believe that those who don't are wrong.  And vice versa - if you don't believe in God, you *must* believe that those who *do* are wrong.  Which presents a problem - sharing and discussing your views is good, but it inherently criticizes the views of others.  So which wins out, the benefit of open discussion or the cost of the criticism?  I think it's the former.  I'm confident enough in my beliefs that I'm not going to be personally offended when they come under criticism, and I'd like to think that the same is true for others.

&gt;makes you look like a massive hypocrite

How am I a hypocrite?  Where have I held religious people to a different standard than myself?

&gt;You know how we discuss religion? We don't...and that's how it should be. Everyone should just shut the fuck up. 

That sounds really boring.  Must we be so concerned about never telling people they're wrong that we have to avoid any controversial topic for discussion?  Better idea - how about instead of worrying so hard about offending people, we all agree not to be offended so easily by positions we disagree with?  To take them as disagreements on issues, rather than personal attacks?

Daughter introduces Bieber
Bieber talks
Bieber then sits with the Jackson kids (and someone I don't know)
The boys are between him and Paris
The boys and Bieber are seen talking a bunch of time as well as talking to each other.
Later, when it seems like the event is coming to an end, Bieber seems to say something to Blanket while extending his hand.  (I assume at this point the picture is taken from a different angle)
Blanket seems not to be able to hear him so it looks like Bieber repeats, then they shake hands.

What about if they have sex, and the woman is either too ashamed or tired or whatever reason to verbally say no, but the man assumes consent from a lack of refusal? My point is there is a huge grey area between the typicalized violent rape and totally consensual sex, and to say that as long as the accused did not intend for it to be rape that he is completely out of fault is not completely correct either. I'm not attacking you, but I just want to elucidate that consent in actuality is much more tricky to define than just yes vs no, desire vs. non-desire. Also, because accusations are essentially a legal issue, the way rape is defined legally and understood socially severely limits the ability for a rape accusation to describe an event of non-consensual sex.","1328056424"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","One could argue that, I would disagree based on the number of high masters / GM players who have the same formula (ladder games, webcam, some music, skype, practice games, viewer interaction etcetc) and have like 10 viewers instead of 500. 

&gt;One would also mention how even if that was true it would say more on how gender would matter to people, not SC2.

This could be true, but since we're looking at her within the context of her popularity / successes in SC2, I don't think it's that relevant. Basically, here's how I see it - people get signed to a team for one of two reasons - they are either popular or good (or both, ideal case for a team). Julia is definitely not good, so she must have been signed because she's popular. 

Now, why is she popular? It's not because she's a good player, and she doesn't strike me as much of a showman (if there are people who think she has a really entertaining personality, please post and let me know). Sure, she has a webcam / mic / decent quality stream, but many higher skilled male players all have that as well and they don't have 1% of her popularity, viewers, subscribers, etc. What does she have that they don't? Unless someone finds another reason for her success, I think it's because she's a girl. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but to pretend that gender isn't a factor in her success just doesn't seem realistic. 

So, to recap, signed because she is popular, why is she popular? She is a girl. Therefore, her gender played a non-negligible role in her getting signed by xSix. 

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with xSix's decision to sign her either - she's popular and signing popular people makes sense (even though I'd love if it were an ideal world and players got contracts with pro teams based on skill first). 

**tl;dr gender does matter**

While the idea-stealing is problematic, what else have they done that has ""damaged video games?""  They make games that are high accessible to *anyone*.  Why is that a bad thing?  Does it upset you that they make something anyone can play anywhere?  

Or is it the mico-monetization of their gameplay?  They are adapting their business model to a changing market and changing technologies: which is **EXACTLY** what people bitch about when other content providers *aren't* doing it.  Why is it bad that they want to make money off of the things they create?  Each one of their games is also free to play.  You do not have to pay out one cent to play any of them.  To play faster you have to pay, yes, but that's actually charging you for being impatient.

And, they are designing for a specific market, the incredibly casual market.  They aren't using false advertisement to draw in more enthusiastic gamers (like Evony), or even making claims about their games at all.  You can play all you want to see if you like it.  Are you upset that you finally aren't the target market for something?

Or, in the end, are you upset because they swipe ideas from other people?  Content providers have been doing that for *centuries* and it hasn't done obscene amounts of damage to any other medium out there.

Les' show is pretty good, as he focuses on safety first and demonstrating techniques to help get you OUT of a bad situation.  It's funny watching his early episodes though, because it was fairly obvious near the beginning that while he had outdoors experience, he wasn't a survival ""expert"" yet-- he didn't know how to make friction fires, etc.  

If you really want to learn some good bushcraft from a show, I recommend watching anything of Ray Mears' (he's an expert from Britain).  Most of his stuff is available on YouTube-- we have a lot of them saved in playlists on our channel if you want to check them out: http://www.youtube.com/user/SurvivalNewsVideo?blend=1&amp;ob=0","1328056439"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You realize this is all about hats, right? I think fedoras are dumb. Nothing you say about acceptance, name calling or graduands assumptions about who I am will change that. The act of wearing a fedora and not being A) An FBI agent from 1962, B) Don Draper C) 75-90 years old or D) Baritone in a boy band in 1998 is ridiculous and, in my opinion, qualities of a loser. I don't care who you are. If you wear an ill-fitting suit and a fedora in my presence, even if you recycle, are best friends with Dave Grohl and regularly save children trapped in burning buses, my first opinion will be that you're a loser. Is it not human nature to form irrational opinions of others without knowing them? You've certainly done that with me!

I am not the person who, at some point in your life, excluded you from whatever it is that you were excluded from. Actually, I've never excluded anyone from anything and I don't see where I validated that kind of thinking. I live nextdoor to a group of guys who do their own thing. They're sociable, smart and seem to have a good time. My word choice of loser comes from the fact that they wear dumb hats. If given the opportunity, I'd be nothing but accommodating and friendly. There's a vast difference between a first impression and a lasting one and I did not feel the need to break that down in my comment because I didn't think I'd be dealing with over sensitive nutcases.

What you fail to realize is that I was being absurd. I was trying to be funny and anyone who is offended by my comment probably needs to loosen up and relax.

I also don't like the fact that the website has to be stretched horizontally very far in order to fully display the full UI for the Google Calendar on the right side. The Google Calendar doesn't fit the color scheme and looks out of place as well. Speaking of stretching the website, the jumping and switching of the format at specific intervals is really annoying. A well designed website shouldn't have to do that. The Videos section looks poorly designed as well because of the white text on the black background. Here's an example: http://i.imgur.com/2Mjwm.png . First of all, it is not clear at first that the circles are matches, and second, the circles are off center and that looks really bad. It also seems like the right side of the page is pretty empty - there's only the Google calendar and links to IPL Apps and after that it's just useless whitespace. The pop-up menu under Tournaments at the top of the page also looks bad because I can't find everything. I feel like there are so many different things that IPL runs including the fight club, team leagues, etc, but all that is shown is IPL3 and Team League 2. The page isn't representative of all that IPL does. The orange highlight color of the menu items also seems not to fit the page.

"funny","t5_2qh33","I think religions absolutely need to stand up to scientific rigor. I loosened my beliefs when I started to consider how an alien might view religion. With far superior technology than ours, they would be able to do away with any erroneous myths, but would still be left with unanswerable questions. Basing belief off of a book (which is subject to interpretation and written by a human) always seems to be dangerous, but not all beliefs need to be based that way. A direct feeling or an intuition about what to do, or even a outright fantasy/hypothesis about how the universe is can constitute a valuable thought structure, in my opinion. All thoughts would be within the realm of this potential larger force, and since we don't all know obviously what the answer is, any wager someone makes about it, even if temporarily correct/valuable, is always subject to improvement.

Edit: I appreciate you reasonable and cordial reply. I was getting the same hostile vibe from your previous post, but I can recognize how your situation might be different. Where I live, everybody is pretty laid back about their beliefs, with more atheists than anything else, and the most vocal people are the atheists. If that was on it's head I could imagine that situation to be quite frustrating. In direct response to how you say religions in general are bad, I would say any rigid thought structure is bad. I think there are a good number of theists and atheists who use their thoughts to make the world a better place, but in almost equal numbers there are bad apples on both sides as well (have no idea really though).","1328056444"

They differ from the norm, and as such they will have a hard time forming a social network to help them through school.

8) I only have access to the pool for 50 minutes, so I can't change much there. I will have to compensate with dryland workouts. What should I be doing for the three parts of the workout you described? Right now I kind of do the following:

* Swim around 10 laps very slowly to get body in the right motion.

* Alternate between kicking 100's with fins and swimming fast 200's for conditioning

* Do 50 back/50 free on the 45 seconds

* Cool down with 5 laps of free.

I don't really know how to work technique on my own, and I don't know any drills that I haven't mastered. Any help at all would be much welcomed :) And 4 hours of practice a day seems ridiculous.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt; There are cases where you can legitimately argue that the problem is the business model, but there are cases (like piracy) where you can't.

Of course you can.  Rather than accept that the world has moved on and people are capable of copying bits and distributing them to the world, the content conglomerates have tried to fight this with anti-consumer laws, rather than innovating.

&gt; Unless everything goes ad supported, there's no way to sustain this model at all. Ad-supported models would also not be able to support things like big budget movies, big budget albums, big budget games.

Maybe so.  So what?  Things change.  During the industrial revolution, the invention of the spinning jenny and the flying shuttle completely changed the ways textiles were manufactured.  Gone were the days where everybody got a handmade shirt that was unique and different, but the overall benefit to society made that concession worth it.

&gt; Shows only bring in significant money for big performers. Otherwise you're talking peanuts.

Again, so?  Things change.  The big money used to be in composing pieces for orchestras, it isn't anymore.  An artist who is it for the art will probably try to find a way to make it work.  Someone who's in it for the money will probably try to find an easier way to make money.

&gt;Most programmers already sell their time instead of make their own products, but if there's less resources to go around because products are being pirated, there are less resources to hire programmers, and many programmers lose their livelihoods.

What makes you think that would happen?  Already there's a move on to do everything ""in the cloud"", with software as a service.  In that model, there is no software to ""pirate"".

As for games, there are subscription-based games like World of Warcraft where the real service is running the servers.  Blizzard would still make good money if they gave away the client for free because people would pay for the service and not the software.

I guess you're just really scared of change and want to clutch the dying remnants of a doomed kind of business model.  That's fine, but it would be healthier if you just admitted that to yourself.

I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the verse says.

&gt; If a partner or employer is abusive, coercive, controlling they are over-stepping their God-given authority.

I think you just made that up out of whole cloth to directly contradict the verse that you disagree with.

&gt; Unless of course, one thinks that a person has to remain in that relationship because there's no specific Scripture verse that allows for leaving.

The verse specifically said that you must endure the relationship no matter what your master does.  In fact it says ""For it is a credit to you if, being aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly.""

She's useless in teamfights, because she can't bring the fight down to a 5vs4, and once she has casted everything she has too long cooldown to be usefull anymore.

Her ratios are actually quite decent.

Shaco is the same. He can 1vs1 most heros lategame with his ultimate, and if he is able to make good use of his fear, passive, and blink, he can kill almost everyone. He also scales himself very well with items. And if he can't kill, you won't kill him, thanks to his slipperyness.
But he's downright useless in teamfights. And lategame is all about teamfights. He is too squishy to be used as a bruiser, and not bursty enough to be a good assassin (expecially since he has a way in the fight OR out of the fight, his blink has a too long cooldown to be used to go in and out, and with his squishyness …). he can't make use of his boxes in teamfights.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Why don't you ask why savings aren't turning into investments? Hoover and subsequently Roosevelt intervened massively in the markets to prop up wages and prices. They even went as far as killing excess livestock and burning crops (see the AAA) to keep prices high. If that's not insanity I don't know what is.

Price controls and supply controls, as far as I understand, aren't prescribed in Keynesian economics. Even if they are, then I wouldn't argue from absurdity; economists have a tendency to take simple principles, analyze them, and come up with shockingly counterintuitive results.

&gt;I did say that eliminating fractional reserve banking is a requirement to reduce/remove the bubble/bust cycle that results from artificial credit expansion.

I don't get this. Should the reserve requirement be 0%? That would create even more risk. Should the reserve requirement be 100%? Then banks wouldn't be allowed to lend money.

&gt;Still, this statement is dishonest when you consider that the Great Depression occurred in 1929, after 16 years of Federal Reserve in play, and it lasted longer than any other depression (until WWII).

To be fair, the Fed tightened the money supply during the beginning of the recession. They basically kept the gold standard in tact.

&gt;Mises on the other hand, predicted otherwise and correctly. (The Great Depression: Mises vs. Fisher pdf). 

From your article:

&gt;""*It is clear that the crisis must come sooner or later. It is also clear that the crisis must always be caused, primarily and directly, by the change in the conduct of the banks. If we speak of error on the part ofthe banks, however, we must point to the wrong they do in encouraging the upswing. The fault lies, not with the policy of raising the interest rate, but only with the fact that it was raised too late.* (Mises 1928, p. 147)""

&gt;He showed that the central bank's attempt to keep interest rates artificially low and to maintain the boom only makes the crisis worse. Despite the tremendous odds against the adoption of his solution, Mises ends his analysis with a prescription for preventing future cycles.
15 The only way to do away with, or even to alleviate, the periodic return of the trade cycle -with its denouement, the crisis - is to reject the fallacy that prosperity can be produced by using banking procedures to make credit cheap. (Mises 1928, p. 171)

Mises pointed out that when the Federal Reserve keeps the interest rate too low, it creates a bubble. I'll admit that pretty much every economist agrees with this now- he had a legitimate point.

But isn't there a difference between prevention and a cure?

&gt;Not at all. TVs, computers, cars get better and cheaper every year. Yet most people own all of these. People spend to survive and increase their satisfaction. The ""deflationary spiral"" stops when prices drop far enough and people come in for bargains.

Used items get cheaper, but I'm pretty sure that new items get more expensive.

&gt;I think it's true. But if cost of living is constantly going down, people would be more willing to take pay cuts. It's unfortunate, but a minor inconvenience compared to the mismanagement of a central bank.


If people just took paycuts, there wouldn't be as much of a problem. The basic idea is that people don't get paycuts, they get pink slips.

&gt;You talk as if banking crashes are acts of God and have no discernible causes. Keynesians ignore the causes and try to come up with solutions. The Austrian business cycle theory predicts such crisis as the inevitable result of artificially expanded money/credit.

Prevention vs cures? The idea is that the federal reserve can cut back on the money supply during times of prosperity, and let the money supply loose during times of despair. Basically the Fed has to use countercyclical policies.

&gt;Declining prices is the way the economy fixes itself. Say you wanted to start a new business, but it's too expensive now. When your input costs lower, it is more feasible to start that business. Low prices are the market's signal that resources are available for entrepreneurs to take advantage of. Propping up high prices keeps inefficient businesses in play, wastes resources, and ultimately destroys wealth.

And what if there's no demand for the product that you're selling? What if there's not enough demand for *any* product? Or if there's only enough demand for X businesses, who will employ Y people, but still leave millions unemployed?

"Warhammer","t5_2qqd4","It's certainly gotten more expensive, as you 'require' more models for an 'average' sized game. However, that being said, I find that complaining about price is pretty useless - you either find value in what you do, or you don't. Pretty simple, really. I find that there are certain items I won't buy, not because I can't afford them, but because I can't justify the price (40 of the new Phoenix Guard, and the Mangler Squigs), but I am willing to drop money on items that I think hold value in what I want to do (the Space marine mega-force, High Elf mega-force, etc).

I can't really comment on the hobby at large with any real experience anymore, though. For years now I've really limited my playtime and who I am willing to play against. I hold myself to a ""fully painted, fully based"" standard and I'm flat out won't play against a primer-only or bare plastic army - and my group feels the same way.

On another hand, I won't play against folks who take the game too seriously and get bent out of shape easily. Folks sometimes forget that it's an entertainment activity and that the overarching goal is to have fun with your friends. Roll dice, charge your warboss into his big stompy death whatever - it's what he would do! Laugh when things go wrong, cheer when they go right! I tend to find myself only playing games anymore against folks that that same mentality and attitude - have fun!

That being said, I certainly am enjoying hobbying at my local GW and meeting new folks. I worked with the company for 3 years, and had a blast and still keep in touch with a lot of folks I met. The staff at my local shop are pretty awesome, and don't meet any of the cliche GW staff hard-sell crap.

As to how the hobby has evolved, I will reference 2nd edition 40k. Some folks look back at it with nostalgia, I look back at it and wonder how I'm still playing this game. I hated 2nd edition, it was nothing but an argument no matter who you played against. I love the lore, I love the models, and I choose my own company (not to try and come off as snobbish). 

The game itself now caters to a more relaxed atmosphere while being acceptable for hardcore tournament play. The current meta-game is a bit top heavy, with certain armies being left in the proverbial dust, while others are shooting orbital death lasers and crapping out nuclear bombs. I feel that hopefully the game meta game will be rebalanced with the advent of 6th edition (right around the corner!),and allow for a tighter rules set that helps more than hinders competitive play as well as 'friendly' games.

Long winded, and sort of rambly, but I hope I got my point across? :)","1328056455"

"UofT","t5_2rbaq","EngSci has more hours in the first and second years than other engineerings (~35 hours), a lot of homework (~one problem set per course =&gt; ~6 psets / week), plus projects and midterms.

The difficulty of any single subject is not much more than in other courses (perhaps 10 to 20% more content covered). ...but, since the course-load is higher, it pushes you harder. Also, EngSci students tend to be uber-keeners who all had 94+ in high school, so you have to study in order to pass (whereas, you can coast with a decent grade in most other engineering programs).

But... it all really depends on how you work and what your standards are. I had friends who only studied (not many extracurriculars), and got 4.0 in EngSci; I know others who barely studied and did OK too. It gets much easier in 3rd and 4th year.

Overall, if you're looking into engineering at UofT, I'd recommend you try EngSci. If you find it too challenging, it's very easy to transfer out into the other engineering programs. If you choose another program, you can't later swap into EngSci.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Its not a strawman at all. You have said: ""The environment would be proper fucked"" and ""Are they to die off because they can't afford to produce vegetation to eat""  Seems like your extremeism is the issue at hand, and thus not a strawman at all.  

&gt; to only eat a vegan diet is more harmful than good

And I disagree.  But my view is not the issue at hand.  The issue is your support for that claim is flawed.  That is what I commented on.  Please give a better argument.  

&gt; Some tribes will dig for hours to get to one animal underground so their village can eat

They choose to do that.  Just because they do one thing does not mean they have no other options.  Again, the issue is not about how, its about whether they can.  They can farm, they can outsource, they can do any number of things that don't require them to dig to catch food.  The possibility is there, and there are no consequences for doing it.  

&gt; Over time

exactly... 

&gt; But it would come at great cost, and much suffering

Again, where is the proof?  You claim that everyone will starve because there is not enough plant life, but you fail to take into account the energy used to produce the meat and the efficiency loss associated with it. Meat is not free.  In the US, it takes 3lbs of food to make 1lb of meat, and far more water than it takes to grow plants.  Grain can be stored easier and is less prone to making the people sick.  It can be distributed easier too.  

Show how it causes more suffering, and we will have a discussion.  

I am not advocating that the world moves to veganism today, and I dont see anyone else who suggested that.  The only things suggested are that its more efficient, its cheaper, its healthier, its a valid lifestyle.

You if anything are arguing a strawman.  Nothing can change overnight, and to suggest that vegetarianism is wrong because people would die if we took their meat and did not replace it with anything is outrageous.  ","1328056463"

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","i know i'm late to the party and i don't want to insult you but your train of thought is just off the wall. 

The first thing i invite you to look at is it seems as if you regard the extra money to have been plucked out of nowhere. It has not. If wages were lowered it would mean extra money for multi billionaires. So you're faced with a choice; give it to poor people or give it to rich people. It is well known that poor people are orders of magnitude more likely to spend money, which travels around the eocnomy. Here's a thought experiment: give £5 to a homeless man and he will spend it all within an hour. Give £5 or even £5,000 to a multimillionaire, what will he do with it? He'll put it on top of all the other money he has.

It is no coincedence that societies with the highest minimum wage are the most prosperous. Look at Norway, Demark etc. As Henry Ford said when asked why does he pay his workers so much: ""because i want them to buy my cars"". In other words pay people more and they'll buy more of your stuff, pay people less and they'll buy less. Finally, the minimum wage is the most important benchmark to which all other salaries are fixed. That means that office work is pegged at a little above minimum wage, then middle managers are pegged slightly above that. Just like a tower, if you remove the bottom piece, everything above it drops- i call it the jenga theory of economics. What you're arguing for for a reduction or lowering of the minimum wage is a reduction in wages for anybody who is paid a salary.

Regardless, any refinery started even now would be a measure of decades.  So there is no rush on a plan.

2) Good, but that ties into

3) We already provide canada.  Anything further we refine has to leave the country.  Guess what, that means pipelines need to be built...  So what are we proposing to do again that is currently bogged down in red tape?

More than likely they're storing the password plain text (or in some way the password can be reversed)

To clarify, the current (read: like the last 10 freakin years) method of storing passwords is via a one way hashing algorithm. This takes any amount of text, from 1 character up to 1000 characters, and gives you a fixed string that can't be used to get the password (there's things like salting and stuff I'm leaving out as a feeble attempt to make this short).  By saying it can't be more than 24 characters that's more than likely because the field in the database to store the password is only 24 characters long.  If the database gets compromised than hackers would see your password in clear text.  If it was sent through a hash they wouldn't.","1328056479"

I support home birth, and the right to take risks within your own comfort zone.  I am, however, not comfortable with having a home birth myself, given my distance from hospital.  Trained midwives are very cautious and often have ample time to transfer people who planned a homebirth, long before it gets life threatening. 

In my jurisdiction, there are certain criteria a pregnancy must meet to qualify for midwifery care.  High risk pregnancies will either be handled in conjunction with a doctor's advice, or transfered to a doctor altogether, depending on the risk involved.  Home birth is only covered for low risk cases.","1328056480"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Thanks!

The Jon thing might fit in here somewhere. When I came across the theory that [the Night's Watch is Lightbringer](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/59078-could-lightbringer-be-the-nights-watch/page__p__2788220#entry2788220) and that the Lord Commander might be Azor Ahai, it made me reconsider Jon's story arc. So far, his story has been all about him sacrificing for the Night's Watch in a way that parallels Azor Ahai's attempts to forge Lightbringer. 

First, he gave up his family and the possibility of a normal life in order to join. Jon's presence at the Wall was important because he saved Mormont from a wight and helped train his brothers to be better fighters. Second, he gave up Ygritte in order to return to the NW and defend the Wall against the wildling attack. Jon's death is the third sacrifice, the one that will reforge the NW's into a better, stronger weapon. That is, maybe *Jon* played the role of Nissa Nissa, not Ygritte.

I like this theory because I am not keen on the idea of a literal prince wielding a literal fiery sword in order to defeat the Others and 'cause I'm a fan of the Night's Watch. But *how* exactly Jon's death/sacrifice would make the Night's Watch better is beyond me. If anything, I think his assassination will make things much, much worse at the Wall.

Still interesting to think about, though.","1328056480"

Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.""*

I will start off by saying no, it will not produce bad karma.  In terms of thinking, thoughts come and go.  Clinging to anything, positive OR negative, is not proper mind.

So, thinking about kicking someone into a bus as it drives by? Is that bad karma? Well, do you think all the people who write movies or act this in a movie are producing bad karma?

What about a passerby who is no writer or actor? Just a random person? 

Depends? Do you follow the karma that would follow? Do you care about the karma and feel guilt towards both the action and fear from what is going to happen next?

Or do you laugh at what happens (truthfully and honestly, not while you're playing Grand Theft Auto).

If the idea sounds like great fun and it's exciting to hurt people, then ya, chances are your thinking is producing bad karma.  It becomes habitual.

Thoughts come and it's our clinging that makes the karma.

It's hugely addictive and fun trying to figure out how to get close to an enemy vehicle and blowing it to shit (giving you double/triple kills). And there's something very satisfying about properly timing and setting off C4 traps on roadways, rather than relying on AT mines.

And now anytime I try out the Engineer class I squeeze off maybe one or two RPG's before the tank takes me out. I can't explain why but the Support just feels deadlier to me.

No volume snapshot errors or weird errors, not slow and crappy.  BESR does a system image, (It's like Norton Ghost but on steroids).  Additionally you can cherry pick files out of the daily image backups you make.  It does incremental backups just like BackupExec.

Why is it better?  It takes less than 2 hours to learn and deploy; it's stupid simple, you want backup you have backup (no need to learn how tapes works and their weird quirks, no need for dedicated computer for backups).  You need good NAS (get 2 at two different sites).  How is it different?  No more tapes.","1328056501"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Maybe you are just imagining how science already is.

The modern scientific method essentially regards knowledge as probabilistic in nature, not true/false. Although frequentist statistics are still used and still useful, there is a consensus amongst high-profile philosophers of science that Bayesian methods have subsumed the traditional paradigm of Popperian falsificationism in which null hypotheses are either accepted or rejected. This is especially the case in evolutionary biology. So yes, scientists are now very comfortable with the idea of ""degrees of belief"", which equates to the likelihood of a given model. You can even now do effective science without having to regard anything as absolutely true beyond the personal assertion that ""awareness is occurring"" (Lichtenburg's minimal domain of truth, a subset of Descartes ""I think therefore I am.""). This is not something, incidentally, that is emphasized by people like Richard Dawkins who are better polemicists than they are philosophers of science.

In this framework, and given the available data, evolution is retrieved as an extremely highly likely model, within which many further models can be applied to infer the detailed structure of diversification. This extremely high likelihood of evolution in explaining the origins of biodiversity leads to practical terminology like ""law"" or ""fact"", which is really shorthand for ""so likely that it is impractical for the purposes of further investigation to regard it as not demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt."" It really falls into the same category of assumption as ""let us pragmatically assert that what we perceive as reality is really real."" 

That does not mean that science fails to allow for correction or modification at the ""law"" level. There are many, many types of observations that would provide disconfirmatory evidence against evolution. It's just that no such observations have ever been made.

By contrast, most formulations of creationism are not even testable because they are neither predictive nor contingent on empiricism (and versions of creationism that *are* testable are retrieved as astronomically unlikely).","1328056504"

There's exceptional teenagers the same as there's adults who fail at life. But being able to think that you can make it at 15, 16 or even 17 is much much different than sitting down and doing the math to find out if you can make it. 

I moved out in the middle of an argument with my parent (father) at 21 in the peak of the recession and *almost* didn't make it. I was literally 4 weeks from being evicted, jobless and homeless before I got a job through a friend. Through a series of ""rock solid"" plans that fell through, I was on the third backup plan on my list when I was hired. If I had made the same choice at 18, or 15, then I definitely WOULD have been homeless without the job network and job experience that saved me.

Near homelessness, and especially real homelessness, is not a situation I would wish on anybody, which is why I would strongly advise the op to make sure things look right several times over on paper before even considering looking into emancipation, as it's a dangerous fantasy that might become a bad situation.","1328056509"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","Lets compare Byron to TMI:

Byron:

* Electrical fault causes reactor trip (expected plant response).
* Power is isolated to switchyard due to failed equipment, plant has no offsite power (required to fix switchyard).
* Diesel generators provide power to safety systems (only safety systems) which start the aux feedwater system to cool the plant. Non-safety systems have no power (expected).
* With no non-safety power, the condenser cannot cool the steam generated, so the non-reactor coolant side is steam vented to atmosphere using atmospheric steam dumps (standard design feature which is NRC approved).
* Steam has trace amounts of tritium (known fact. rates are so small that even on site contamination detectors cant detect it. even union of concerned scientists and the NRC says it poses no health risk).
* The plant reports there's tritium even though it is extremely low (likely in response to state law after underground tritium leaks were not reported in early 2000s)
* Steam release through atmospheric steam dumps is a standard, NRC approved, safety function of PWR reactors
* Reactor reaches cold shutdown

TMI:

* Event causes turbine trip/plant trip, plant shuts down as expected
* Aux feedwater system valves are manually closed (violation of procedure and plant operating license/tech specs)
* With steam generators nearing dryout, operators have to use the pressurizer PORV to control reactor pressure (normal procedure)
* Reactor Pressurizer PORV gets stuck open (known industry issue that wasnt fixed at this plant)
* Emergency cooling systems kick in (as expected)
* Operators think the emergency cooling systems should not be running and disable them (Operator/procedural error)
* No engineering support in control room to aid in diagnosing the problem (issue all plants had, was fixed as a result of TMI accident)
* Pressurizer relief tank rupture disk ruptured and radioactive water flooded containment (due to PORV failure)
* Fuel melts and now radioactive waste escapes through the stuck PORV into containment (loss of the primary and secondary radiation release barriers).
* Containment pressure nearing limit and TMI releases steam containing nuclear waste products (ultimately) to the atmosphere to reduce pressure (causes low radiation release, hundreds of times more than byron in this case).
* Plant does shitty job informing NRC and public and makes the rest of the industry look really bad.
* Half the reactor is melted.
* Industry is fundamentally changed, causing tons of new regulations which cause many plants to not even finish construction. INPO is formed for knowledge sharing to prevent recurrence of the PORV problem and other process issues. Safety features are greatly improved along with operator training. An engineer is required in the control room at all times. Increased requirements for emergency plans and drills, along with data systems to transmit real time plant data to the NRC for accident analysis.","1328056517"

It seems most of the people who strongly disagree with a sparse amount of the things posted in r/atheism simply unsubscribe, while those who voice their opinions against the *norm* tend to be downvoted and berated rather than justly debated.

This is obviously not always the case, but it does tend to happen quite a bit. Naturally, because of this, a lot of the stuff in r/atheism has very little opposition and therefore seems -- to an outside viewer -- to represent Atheists as a whole.

One can quote the ridiculousness in the Bible fairly easily, but retort, one can easily quote the ridiculous things that make it to the front page of r/atheism, which makes conversing or debating a believer on Reddit much more difficult.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","tl;dr: Yes, I walk alone at night, no limit to the distance and I don't carry any weapons.

I feel safe enough to leave the house, but seriously: Never feel safe! I have 10 years of experience in martial arts and this has taught me some major things any girl can do and should do. First is: Your carelessness is your enemy's friend. I never listen to music in such situation. I'm at my nerve's edge as soon as a stranger passes my way on an empty street. I either wear sneakers (good for running) or combat boots (you guess what for?), being alone at night. Martial arts do not enable a small, light-weighed girl like me to fight off a grown man who knows, what he is doing (or who is drunk), but they have given me a good hint, what to expect and how to be prepared. Being aware of your surroundings might not be able to throw a fist at someone, but it gives you the chance of running. Being able to fight, but being blind otherwise will not help you at all.

Also a good thing my mother told me: Always make sure there is someone who knows where you should arrive that night. Maybe also the hour of your arrival.

I was lucky enough to never be harassed, but I know at least three women (2 coworkers, 1 friend) who were seriously injured because of walking alone at night. If you are confident and know, what you'll do when shit starts getting serious you have a good chance of getting away fine. If you are insecure and just walk along thinking ""That stuff surely won't happen to *me*"", stay at home. It can happen to everyone. You have to find the middle between fear and overconfidence/blue-eyedness, before walking alone at night.","1328056526"

Definitely go for the Bruny Island trip - it's glorious and there's nothing like the feeling of being in the middle of the ocean. 

The pancake train at Margate is also fun. Nice drive out from Hobart (only 20 mins, I think) and the pancakes are tasty!

Me Wah is overrated. Sure, it's a very pretty restaurant but you'd get much better food at non-ridiculous prices at any Chinatown (but Hobart doesn't have a Chinatown).

A few days ago I posted a huge rant on some moron programmer who basically equated coders to data entry clerks.  Ok WHATEVER!

A real pro would make use of the GC's finalization queue to call CleanUp automatically *for* you after each Gen1 garbage collection run (i.e., each time it's possible one of your dictionary's keys has been collected).  For instance:

    public class WeakDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;
    {
        // Private class that's used to put an object on the heap that'll never be rooted,
        // so that object will always be added to the finalizer queue on the next Gen1 GC.

            // so that it 1) can't possibly keep the owner dictionary rooted, and 2) knows when
            // the owner dictionary has been GC'd.
            private WeakReference m_dictRef;

            ~CleanerUpper()
            {
                var wd = m_dictRef.Target as WeakDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;;
                if (wd != null)   // If the owner dictionary is still alive...
                {
                    // Clean it up.
                    wd.Cleanup();

                    // Then create a new CleanerUpper that's never rooted (we create
                    // an instance with the new keyword, but don't assign the created
                    // object instance to a local or a field) so that during the next Gen1
                    // GC the new CleanerUpper ends up on the finalizer queue again so
                    // we can continue to automatically cleanup indefinitely until

"swtor","t5_2qxih","Yeah, 50 FPS would be okay, the problem is, there is constant, completely FPS-unrelated, stuttering.

For example there are certain places on Balmorra where the ground will flicker aggressively when I drive by with my speeder. It's almost like screen tearing but it's not screen tearing, it's more stuttering.

I now have to use an FPS limiter (Dxtory) and when I artificially limit my FPS to 55, it's noticeably reduced. Now, if I disable Dxtory my FPS don't go over 60 anyway, so even while my FPS don't change at all when I limit them to 55, that flicker/stutter effect is very much reduced. Also, Vsync doesn't do anything to help with this. Nothing. So it's not actually screen tearing. It's something else.

I get this in a lot of places. Huttball for example has some of this flickering/stuttering. I'd really like to know what it is, because even with Dxtory FPS limit it's not completely gone.

EDIT: And I believe that there is no way of FRAPSing it, because FRAPS itself imposes such an FPS limit while recording. I heard someone say this has to do with DirectX calls that aren't properly handed but that are intercepted when one uses such an FPS limiter (or FRAPS which does the same thing when it records) and then work properly.","1328056550"

The first cat we took in he puked up worms in our house. We had to take him to the vet to get dewormed and we then also found out he had feline aids.

The other cats we've taken in, one had leukemia who died a while back after having her for quite a few years. The other ones we've also had for years always come back as we let them be outdoor cats, they always had the option to go home if they wanted. We've had our strays for many years now.

They leave one of their windows open with a plank going to the ground and just let their cats roam free. I live a street over from the beach and there's a huge wooded area and lake on the other side of my neighborhood. Anyway their cats have become feral and mated over and over again to the point where the town had to become involved. There are fucking hundreds of cats running around my neighborhood. It's sad.

Anyway a beautiful Persian mix started coming to my house and would sleep under a bush in my yard. He was literally there for two weeks before I convinced my aunt to take him in. Unfortunately her cat Olive (the stray is 1 1/2. her's is about 1) didn't like the stray. So my family took him in. Lugnut (my dad's idea) and Gizmo (mine) are twin cats we have, and are sister's to Olive (my aunt's cat) but they can't stand Duncan (the stray). They corner him in the litter box and just generally treat him like shit. I feel bad but he was outside starving in this harsh North East winter. I'm sure it will be fine.

...wow I digressed. Anyway Duncan looks to be too beautiful and healthy to be a stray. He had no collar/tracking chip, and wasn't neutered.

A year and a half later I'm still paying the bill for that. And no answers to why it happened.

"SRSGaming","t5_2t5qh","&gt;Its success killed WebOS, has hobbled the adoption of Windows Phone, and who knows what other innovative phone OSs would have came about if device manufacturers couldn't just slap Android into something. We could of had another era of innovation like we had before the Windows era. Software like AmigaOS, NEXTstep, BeOS other platforms like that may be forgotten now, but they had a huge effect on everything that came after. Smartphones right now are basically a duopoly, and that sucks.

Why blame Android for other platforms' failure? And even with the duopoly, there's still plenty of innovation going on with each major release, and from forks like CyanogenMod.

&gt;It has exacerbated the worst tendencies in device manufacturers, such as piling features in with no respect for how it actually changes the device's operation and dragging their feet when it comes to updates. Basically, not thinking at all of what the customer will do with their phone after they buy it. As a result there is no Android phone worth buying.

Manufacturers suck, but they were like that before Android and they'll always be like that no matter what the OS. It's kind of a double-edged sword of FOSS that manufacturers can do almost whatever they want with it, including locking the hardware. Thankfully, there are some devices out there that are fully open, like the Nexus and Geeksphone lines, as well as at least one other really nifty phone that plugs into a tablet thing that I've completely forgotten the name of.","1328056567"

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","Obama only has tangential power over what Congress does or does not spend time on. Unemployment benefits were discussed at that time because that's when they were to expire and the other stuff I mentioned had been worked on for months beforehand but final passage had been blocked.

You mention the bully pulpit which was the way that most presidents set the tone of their administrations. However, the past decades have seen the domination of the 24 hour news cycle and more recently the emergence of blogs. Both of these have effectively neutered the efficacy of the pulpit, no one just watches presidential addresses if they watch at all. Instead people will read/watch analysis of anything the president says and generally they will choose analysis that fits pre-existing biases.

Add into that the extreme polarization of elected officials that we have been seeing. The impasse that we are talking about was all 42 republican senators standing in lockstep to prevent anything from happening unless they got their way. Further examples are plentiful, the sole purpose of elected republicans (aside from a few) these past 3 years has been obstructionism and propaganda. Anything Obama tries to do is stopped early and often, if it isn't then it is portrayed as evil, overreaches of the government.

Finally, coming from Chicago doesn't help his case. Since the start of his presidency he has been accused of playing ""Chicago politics"" which is forcing and/or bribing people to support you. It doesn't fit with the type of president he is trying to be, but it has definitely stuck in much of the republican circles, using the bully pulpit fits right in with this attack on character.

Extra: Playing into people's conceptions of an ""Angry Black Man"" is also never good for politics.

Essentially, you want a president who throws away all of his political capital on worthless symbolic gestures rather than works within the system that he is given to achieve moderate but still real, pragmatic change.","1328056573"

The reason I ask is that I thought my kitty had FIV. She hit 10 years old, and showed absolutely no signs of any problems related to FIV. Decided to have another test run, and it came back negative.

Apparently, awhile back the FIV vaccine was really popular (Or rather really pushed on cat owners by various vets). While the FIV vaccine didn't harm the cats, it will show up on FIV tests as a false positive. The cat has the antibodies for FIV, but does not have the actual virus.

FIV+ really doesn't make a ton of difference in my experience (As long as they are well cared for and monitored), but sometimes knowing they don't have it, is a nice thing.","1328056579"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","While the US and Australia have different laws and customs, in a US context, outlawing firearms would force many Americans to either turn in their weapons or be charged with a crime. Many would refuse, based on personal grounds, and would as such be then considered criminals in spite of the fact that they would never engage in a violent action without sufficient cause, i.e. self defense.

In Australia apparently, if you have a gun you are a criminal. That is not the case here, and I would argue gun ownership does not mean one is a inclined to engage in violent behavior.

In regards to the homicide rate, cultural differences are important. for instance, Australia does have an intentional homicide rate of 1.2, but Switzerland has an intentional homicide rate of 0.6, and every male is required to own a firearm between the ages of 18 and approx. 45. Shooting is a large part of their culture.

Standard of living among other factors is very important in overall murder rate, and the example of the small town, and the overall shift in crime rate I would view as significant because the likelihood of abrupt economic change/standard of living change is low. In many countries with a low standard of living, guns are officially banned, and yet their homicide rate is quite high.

Also, in regards to that community, a murder rate of 2.1 in fairly impressive for the US, (which saddens me) which has an intentional homicide rate of 5.0, which is actually lower than the decade's average. If gun ownership could bring the overall intentional homicide rate down to 2.1, I would consider that reason enough.

Another example in the US (I'm sorry I can't bring up examples about Australia, I just don't know enough about gun law history in your country) is that of New York. New York is one of the strictest states in regards to gun ownership, and has a homicide rate of 6.3.

Also, another thing which bothers me greatly is the statement ""potential criminals"", in the US atleast, innocent until proven guilty is very important (ignoring NDAA and patriot act, *sob*) and as such, denying someone a basic right because they *might* become a criminal is a truly awful crime in itself.","1328056584"

"MLPLounge","t5_2t403","uhm...well I was in ""Diamond League"" in Starcraft2 which could be considered impressive i guess, considering the skill cap and rather huge learning curve. 

only other thing that comes to mind is my life of soccer. I played soccer every year since I was three years old. Eventually getting on my High School's Varsity team my second year of high school. Being younger than most of the team I didn't get to play much that first year. The 5th game in, the head coach decides to put me in for the first time in a game that counted. 5 minutes after stepping on the field i send a pass to the outside to a team mate who takes it up a bit and crosses it the center of the goal. 

I was there. Everything was happening in slow motion. Just like in those movies. The other team's keeper jumped for it and it went right over his fingertips. From there it was an easy re-direct off of my head for a goal.  The ball had to travel 2 feet, but it felt like I had all of the time in the world. I just guided it in with my head, using proper form, just like all of those years of practice. Everything was silent. Then suddenly, cheering from the crowd and from my teammates. No one ever cheered for ME before. My coach subbed me out and said ""I knew I made the right decision."" 

Fast forward to my senior year of high school, my team manages to win a district championship, which my school has never done before. 

I don't know why I kept breaking out into tears writing that. I swear it never happens when I'm writing.

"self","t5_2qh96","I was born in Belgrade in the late 80s, Serbia has been a mess my entire life. The scariest thing for me was the NATO bombings in the late 90s, I had a lot of family that had to stay away from major buildings and hope they wouldn't get blown up. It's scary to have your home attacked for something you have no control over like that.

I had two haunting experiences that still stick with me. The first one was seeing a hotel in New Belgrade (yeah, there's a new Belgrade), that was several stories tall, with a giant crater where a bomb hit. When I saw it, a few years passed already and it was just an abandoned hotel that's partially exploded. There was no effort to fix any of it (what money?), it just stood there like some war relic. And it didn't look like some tiny hotel nobody cared about, it could have at least been a source of jobs for a few people.

The next one was walking with my cousins by the river and them telling me that this was where they waited for the bombings to stop every night. I was there and saw the whole city just taking up my view, and I remembered watching the tv coverage at the time and seeing everything going to hell. I was so mad at everything, I hated that people I loved were just trying to live their life and getting attacked.

Speaking from a utilitarian perspective, if they really want to be circumcised as an adult they'll go ahead and do it, and the value of allowing someone who does not want to be circumcised to be so probably outweighs the pain that would be incurred by the person who wants to be circumcised having to go through it as an adult.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt;Theory of evolution is a theory, not a fact.

Yeah, same goes for gravity. That's how science works.

&gt;but we have many evidences of situations, when this evolutionary line appears broken

It's called punctuated equilibrium. Look it up. The gaps in the fossil record do last tens or hundreds of thousands of years.

&gt; Genuine scientists are not looking for support from the facts for their theories, says Popper, so there is no need for any inductive inference from the observational to the theoretical.

Theories are the only way to produce predictive models in science. Without prediction, science is just a catalog of human knowledge that tells us nothing about the way the universe works and nothing about how things will behave.

&gt;there is still probability of various panspermia events, which would make the evolutionary model more creationist

No, extraterrestrial intervention is creationist. It offers no predictive framework and anything that is discovered can be incorporated into it. 

&gt;There are some evidences of visits of extraterrestrial creatures

The evidence is weak at best and circumstantial. The ""theory"" of extraterrestrial intervention makes no predictions whatsoever about the kinds of facts that you will come across.

&gt;These things are simply possible and we cannot exclude them in advance.

Virtually anything is possible, but the theory that offers the best predictions about empirical data is best.

&gt;the stance of contemporary science, which is very biased toward its paradigms

Spend some time looking at evolutionary theories and you'll realize that there is actually quite a bit of infighting about exactly how evolution occurs and which aspects of it are most important. Scientists are careful to point out flaws in one another's arguments and the exact model of evolution is still a work in progress. There is no mob mentality here, only a common agreement that models should be tested before they are accepted.","1328056613"

&gt;Unfortunately, I had the same impression from you and your comments. If you ever got a confrontational and snide tone from my comments, I apologize, and guarantee you It wasn't my intention.

Rereading my own comments, I probably was not helpful in this regards. I accept your apology and offer my own, and I hope that I can help clear up my position on things in a more friendly and constructive manner.

&gt;Not exactly special, but yes, different from physics in the same way that mathematics and logic are different than physics. This is the main ideological difference, it seems to me, between Postal and Chomsky. Postal's wants to treat linguistics is like mathematics and logic, while Chomsky wants to treat it like biology and physics. It's not about linguistics being special in any kind of magical or spiritualist way.

Right, but the difference between mathematics/logic and physics exists more on the type of theoretical constraints and approaches that one takes on in a research paradigm. Hell, you could go the whole hog and say that mathematical/logical rules are discovered empirically, and then the difference becomes rather moot, if not non-existent. Either way, I think the dichotomy between mathematics/logic and physics exists mostly in a methodological sense, rather than anything special about the fields themselves - the main saving grace of physics is that we have a world to test it against, but we've still made the most progress by making abstract, idealised *mathematical* models of physical objects.

&gt;In fact, a lot of mathematicians are Platonist and that doesn't seem to scandalize the scientific community and the physicalists. They are not laughed at, they're not called insane. We do math, and we study math, without requiring it to be an organ. Without requiring that I don't think that giving up on the idea that language is an organ makes it any less interesting, real, or anything else.

But I think this is where the problem lays - the study of math as an organ can and *has* been done. It's actually the study of our mathematical ability and the processes by which we can use math that is studied, but it's no different from calling it our 'math organ', though obviously we do that to make the comparison with the 'language organ' more apparent. This isn't a question about our *abstract notions of math*, it's a question about whatever we do that allows us the ability to produce math *which we identify as abstract*. The math itself, to the brain, isn't abstract but the idea of sets we apply to our ability to infinitely count (interestingly enough, if we could *only* count in integers, then that'd be your discrete infinity right there) are. It's sort of like the difference between a given, physical computational engine and the abstract Turing machine which represents that computer - you could research the abstract possibilities of Turing machines of its class without problem, but the physical make-up of the actual instantiation of the computational engine would provide their own limitations, and these can (and should) be studied alongside its abstract notions. Now, the engine itself does not produce sets, but it can represent them, in principle, infinitely. I think you can see how it'd be a very interesting and insightful manner into understanding a computational engine by knowing *how* it computes (i.e. what physical changes it undergoes in order to get from one configuration to another, in which we identify these configurations as being representable by an abstract class) and its limitations - that's definitely something useful scientifically, and gives more information to help decide theories about computational abilities.

&gt;I'm not arguing for either dualism or non-dualism. And I'm not siding with Postal. I'm trying to get to the bottom of Postal's arguments in a fair way. Also, abandoning Chomsky's ontology doesn't mean that languages suddenly have nothing to do with brains. And monism doesn't have to be reductionism.

But this is the old demand for ""psychological reality of linguistic entities"", which Chomsky himself has written upon quite a lot. The general gist of it is that people want to know ""where"" this abstract linguistic entity is in the brain and actually demand that they be shown something akin to little tree diagrams and equations in the brain. This demand isn't placed on any of the harder sciences, and it'd be considered laughable if it were - I demand you to show me where the equations that govern transpirational pull are written in the xylem of plants, or that you show me exactly where Maxwell's equations are in a photon. You'd laugh these off, because obviously the whole point is that the physical object is *not* the abstract object it's just a representation of it. This same research methodology should be applied to linguistics (as there's been no proof to suggest that it's special from the rest of the sciences), but this extra burden of showing where a physical process produces 'abstract objects' is heaped on with no justification for it. If you are to be fair on this, then I think you should go ask a physicist how subatomic particles produce Feynman diagrams, and where you can find those in reality. I think you can imagine the reaction.

&gt;I don't think the faculty of language is immaterial, I do have doubts about interpreting it's grammar as having a precise organic counterpart with simple one-to-one mapping between grammar and brain structures, though I wouldn't be able to argue it and explain it properly or coherently at this point.

Right, but I presume you'd have no problem with a computer being able to represent a grammar with having a simple mapping between its physical structures and produced strings or the like. Since we're treating the language faculty as a computational engine (as we do the rest of the brain), then I don't see why you'd have a problem here, unless there was something else stopping you?

&gt;Postal is the one ridiculing that position, which he interprets (rightly or wrongly) to Chomsky. 

Postal isn't ridiculing that position, he's saying that linguistics is different from other sciences in that you *can't* compare it to idea that light produces Maxwell's equations - that argument, that linguistics is no different from any other science in principle, is the argument that he specifically tackles. The response he has to handle is why this extra condition is required, because if you apply this extra condition to the other sciences like physics, then you get this idea of light and Maxwell's equations, which Postal obviously realises is laughable and doesn't want to defend. The problem is that he just says that you can't do this argument, and provides no real reason for it - why is linguistics different? Why is there such a confusion between a physical object and its abstract representation? This issue isn't repeated in physics, so I don't understand why linguistics should have it.

&gt;That is the whole point: How do you have infinite generation from finite physical structures. Honestly? Don't you find this at least dubious, logically and philosophically? If the grammar of a language is a real world, physical, finite object, a state of the universal faculty, how does it produce an infinite number of expressions? I must be missing something obvious, or it makes no sense to me.

This isn't a trivial problem, and indeed this formed the basis for Descartes' idea that man was special and not a machine - he couldn't imagine how a machine could produce the infinite array of expressions a man is capable of, and so he concluded more or less fairly that man couldn't be a machine. This actually served as a basis for his dualistic beliefs, so it's not entirely obvious. Thankfully, we've had developments in computational theory since Descartes, and we know that a *recursive operator* can generate an infinite set of out of a finite set of elements. Hell, there's things called [primitive recursion functions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_recursive_function) of which the successor function is one of them. The successor function is quite simply the ability to add a number to itself, and you find that when we formalise this, then we get the infinite set of integers quite easily. A computer can physically represent a recursive function and yield infinity out of a finite set from that, so I see no real reason why our brains cannot.

"49ers","t5_2rebv","Crushing loss, to be sure.  I tend to agree with the overriding sentiment that, as it is with a win, a loss is the result of a TEAM effort.  Seeing all the Superbowl hype and thinking how close we were to being one of the teams in the middle of it is hard.  I thought I had ""moved on"" past the Championship loss but it turns out I didn't.  I watched the game again last night and it kills me that there are so many little plays (drops, stumbles in a hole, almost stripped balls, etc) that could have put US in Indy.  FUCK!!!!  

But I digress.  The hurt I felt on Championship Sunday was NOTHING like the hurt I felt in 1991 when the Giants beat us on a last minute filed goal in the NFC Championship game and went on to beat the Bills in Superbowl XXV (Thanks to Norwood's ""Wide Right"" kick).  That was the hardest day in my life as a Niner fan.  Had we won that game we would have been the first (and to this day ONLY) team to Three-pete.  

That team in '91 was EXPECTED to go to the playoff's.  That team was EXPECTED to go to the NFC Championship Game.  That team was EXPECTED to win the Superbowl.  

The 2011 squad wasn't EXPECTED to do shit.  We HOPED we'd finish .500, we thought MAYBE we'd get to the playoffs.  We PRAYED the rest of the NFC West would collapse.  

13 - 3?  2nd Place in the NFC?  NFC Championship appearance?  If you REALLY saw this coming you should go to Vegas.

I love the Niners, have my whole life, but now that the dust has settled and the sharp bite of the loss has dulled a little; I look back at the GAME vs. the Giants as a LOSS but the 2011 SEASON....it's a victory.  ","1328056633"

As I did so, my girlfriend, a huge TES fan who is completely unaware of this discussion, asked me ""Wait, are you playing the GW1 login theme overtop of it like you did for those Nickleback songs?"" Suffice it to say, I was not.

&gt;I don't think so. I'm very clear on the fact that a physical process can be described in a formal way and that this process does not produce the formal description. Instead, it produces a physical effect. This is precisely the problem that Postal is talking about. You can't have a physical system with transfinite cardinality, it's a property of abstract and mathematical objects, not real physical material objects. In other words, as you said, it is [EDIT by it I mean Chomsky's language as organ] capable of producing an abstract entity, which you don't agree with, just like I don't and Postal doesn't.

But the physical system *doesn't* have transfinite cardinality precisely for the reason you point out - it's a property of *abstract and mathematical objects*. The physical system is *represented* by these abstract and mathematical objects, which in turn have the properties of transfinite cardinality. Again, I think this just shows a clear confusion over the relation of abstract formalisations of a physical process and the assigning of properties to it. The physical system, through whatever change in physical configurations it does, results in a change which can be represented or mapped to by an abstract formalisation. For example, a hard drive's individual electrons don't contain transfinite cardinality, nor if you put them enough together into a program (or what not) do they suddenly get it - it's known quite from the beginning that the electrons represent *information* which *corresponds* to the abstract formalisation to which such properties can belong; a bit is flipped in the platter and the physical configuration goes from representing a 0 to 1. We don't say that the bit has now gained the precise abstract properties of 1 as compared to 0, but we full understand that the physical configuration represents the number which now has its own abstract properties which corresponds to itself and not others.

&gt;Look, I feel stupid just by saying this, and I probably am, it's obvious I'm no expert, But how?How is an endless amount of sentences possible with a set of physical objects? How exactly is Postal misreading Chomsky in that relevant passage (the one on page 110) which I quoted in my previous comment. It seems perfectly reasonable and logical to me.

As above, I advise you to look into Turing machine and other developments in the field of computation.

&gt;If I understand correctly, you're implying that Postal is saying that, while Postal actually makes it clear in the article that he is in fact accusing Chomsky for taking ""that laughable route"" as you call it.

To quote Postal from 114:

&gt;The aspect of Chomsky’s ontology just criticized has also been defended by supporters of Chomsky’s position in private discussion. The defense claims in effect that Chomsky’s appeal to formal science (e.g. his set-theoretical discussions) are no different than e.g. a physicists appeal to mathematical formulations. In using formal structures, the defense runs, Chomsky is no more committed to claims that NL is formal than a physicist’s use of mathematics involves a commitment to the abstract nature of physical reality.

Which is essentially the argument I'm running. What I am saying is that if Postal insists that Chomsky is committed to the physical configuration is of an abstract entity, then he's committed to saying that the physicist is committed in the same way. What Postal is saying is that Chomsky is somehow committed to this while physicists are not. Postal goes on to try and defend in the quote you've provided:

&gt;But as in (11), Chomsky takes the putative biological entity to be constructing abstract objects, sets. This is entirely distinct from using some piece of formal science to describe something nonformal. And this conflation by Chomsky of formal and physical objects is one of determinants of the incoherence of his ontological position.

Which is what I've been disputing all along, and hence my above argument about the confusion between the relation of physical realisations and abstract objects.

&gt;This interpretation and accusation of Chomsky by Postal can be debated and proven false, but you cannot reasonably claim that Postal is taking the position for which he is attacking Chomsky.

What I am saying is that Postal must be committed to the same critique of physicists as he is of Chomsky if that's the argument he's running. He (very wisely) denies this, and tries to give a reason why linguistics is apparently different from the rest of the sciences, but (in my mind) fails because of a repeated confusion over the relation of physical configurations and abstract entities. Quite simply, what Chomsky is doing is really no different from the physicist's use of abstract mathematics, and there's no objection to it taken seriously in physics, so I don't understand why Postal expects us to take it seriously in linguistics.","1328056644"

Yeah, we said - us. They were totally shocked, apparently they (and everyone else in the building) had thought they were just very well-fed strays, and they were on the verge of adopting them.

If the cat's well-fed, it's not a stray. They're just trying to mooch.

You hate all women because you've had one hurt you in the past so you aim to be a misogynist, and you succeed.

"UofT","t5_2rbaq","Third year Energy Systems engsci here. Firstly, when you apply to engsci you aren't actually choosing an option like energy systems. It's only in third year that you will be doing energy systems. Just so ya know.

To answer your question, it entirely depends on you. From what I've gathered from my friends in other disciplines, it is quite a bit harder. Engsci takes a different approach than the other streams. It is significantly more mathematical. There is some applied stuff, but it is a lot of equations and a lot of math. It is totally learnable though. Based on your high school average, you're certainly not too dumb for engsci. Your success will probably more depend on your work ethic than anything else.
There's a lot of homework, but it is not all consuming. If you don't do it though, then you're probably in trouble.

It's a lot of work, but completely do-able. I will warn you though, AER201 in second year has periods where it will consume your life. It teaches you a lot, but it is a LOT of work. 

If you're pulling 80s in english, you definitely won't have a problem with engsci. You'll be marked more for your communication skills than your actual ability to be grammatically correct.

Sorry for how rambling this is, I should be doing work right now...
In summary, it's a lot of work, but I was able to balance it with a varsity sport and still pass. Just make sure not to get behind. And your english skills should be fine. Good luck!","1328056669"

From an administrative and maintenance standpoint, mediawiki isn't that great. We went with it anyway because its wiki syntax is just better than the other popular solutions we'd tried. It means our IT guys bitch a bit more about this or that plugin blocking the upgrade cause they can't get it configured, but I think some of our users (including IT staff) would refuse to use something like moinmoin.

Science and Christianity are not in conflict. People may use them incorrectly and attempt to apply them in ways they are not meant to be applied (i.e. a person attempting to use science to disprove God, or a Christian trying to use the Bible to prove a scientific principle. In both cases, the people in question are using their tools [scientific method, the Bible, respectively] in ways for which they are not intended [speaking to non-material matters, applying scripture to the scientific method, respectively]).","1328056680"

From what you've said, it sounds like he's been told a bit of misinformation (whether or not that's to give him the hope of keeping trying, who knows). He does say that it is very hard going on his mental and his physical state as he comes out of sessions feeling very drained. One thing that he's noticed lately though, is after 3 years, every night, of waking up screaming in the middle of the night, he has found that in the past 6 weeks, he's had 5 nights where this hasn't happened.

On occasion, I add incandescent lighting for extra IR (they're great for that plus a 630nm peak from tungsten boosts typical photosynthesis) and growth is noticeably better, as well as flower development and fruit development 

I should note I love to read Jorge's stuff as much as anybody else. He's a great guy, but his words on LED were only true about 5 years ago. Semiconductor tech, especially in optoelectronics, has come a LONG way. New ceramic conversion tech to improve internal efficiencies, better less-flawed die production for higher efficiency in light:photon conversion, and many more are making things possible.

4.  ""Everyone with the ability to change the status quo in Modern America has no desire to be the first one to do so, even if maintaining it goes against their core beliefs.  This is mainly because they don't want to get sued."" -me, just now and I think it is quite to the point.

number 4 is probably my favorite way to describe america today.  reckless lawsuits are absolutely destroying the credibility of our justice system.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Top diamond players think the same thing about master players, top gold players probably think the same thing about you.  The big skill difference is just speed, if it takes you 8 minutes to get to a certain point and a number of workers, they get to that same point in 7 minutes and 30 seconds.  And then there is snowballing effect in starcraft games, slight edges early allow you to take quicker safer expand faster and get further ahead and frees you to take even more bases while being able to deny your opponents.

It's probably isn't even really that most diamond players are that much 'better' than you it's simply that they are faster and starcraft is first and foremost a game of speed.  Don't get me wrong faster in starcraft is better, but my point is that as a general rule it isn't until pretty high up into master league where everyone starts playing the same speed, that is where the main factor in deciding games are things like deceptive tech switches or fancy micro, before that point the main deciding factor is just who macros better.

If you can help it you should never be afraid of or intimidated by your opponent in a starcraft game, what you should be afraid of is falling behind, playing from behind is scary, do everything you can to avoid it.","1328056683"

"progressive","t5_2qlqk","I realize that the only way we can get anywhere in this world is if we work together. No matter what anyone says about limited government we must come at things from a unified front. If a child starves you say then its the parents fault, but why? Is the parent educated, is there a problem that makes it impossible for them to get a job. If so we need to fix that as a society to make sure it doesn't happen more.

Then i look at this small blue dot and realize why do we fight these endless wars. There is a better way and better tools. You say that everyone has a right to be happy but when was making money at the cost of the lives of others and their happiness right? 

I believe treat a man with respect because the golden rule of all religions is universal. Treat others as you wish to be treated. If you don't share and don't help your fellow man, they will not be there to help you and share when you might need help. I believe in realizing not everyone has the same point of view. I believe in Consensus through democracy and that the parties need to be broken up so not one party controls more that 25% of the mind share. There is a voice of the people the majority who represent a plethora of ideas ... but extreme on left or right are the only ones heard. There is no middle ground.

I'm progressive because I understand that there are people beyond just my self in this world. I would rather have a well running community with a crossroads of culture and tradition melding together than be filthy rich man alone on my house on the hill any day. I understand that that community will not run the same 20 miles or 100 or 500 miles away because of the situation of resources or land, or cultures of people trying to get along.

Its why i support the idea of the UN. AS we are a family we are a village from a village to town and from a town to a district and from a district to a state and from a state to a country and from the country to a world. Everyone with different views all fighting to be heard. No one is i willing to offer respect in that voice and the conservatives are usually the most offending of that in the current political climate.

Politics is not just liberal or conservative. Black or white. Its shades of gray and some only want to see the pigments of White or Black and never where the rules do not always apply. This is why i am liberal. I try to keep open to the idea but realize there is more at stake than just my life or world view.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;There's a lot more aspect to intelligence than what you can be tested on in a standardized test.

True.

&gt;An IQ test doesn't factor in for creative intelligence

True, however it doesn't really claim to.

&gt;It's no way to judge how much a person is capable of learning

Actually, I would imagine there would be a very strong correlation.

Yes, IQ tests have their shortcomings, quite a lot of them. But the correlations are there.

Indeed, nerd is a made up word, but I'm just saying that if we allow anyone with a strong interest in anything to be called a nerd, then we defeat the purpose of the word, and by itself it means nothing. I agree that using ""car nerd"" or ""art nerd"" is still useful, since it defines a small subgroup of people. But I don't think you can use your definition in general, as if we allow most people to be called nerds then as I said, there will be no correlations.

You're right though, you don't exactly have to be smart. But I would imagine there might be a correlation. However my original point was simply that in order to discuss whether or not there was a correlation, we would have to discard the idea of the ""Harry Potter nerd"" being counted as a nerd in general. I doubt anyone will come up with a great source any time soon to prove the correlation right or wrong, so I guess I will avoid that discussion if possible.

But as you will have noticed, I have failed to give my own definition of the word nerd. If I was pushed, I guess wikipaedia's definition isn't bad:

Nerd is a derogatory slang term for an intellectual but socially-impaired, perhaps obsessive person who spends inordinate amounts of time on unpopular, obscure, or highly technical pursuits, or relating to topics of fiction or fantasy, to the exclusion of more mainstream activities. Nerds are considered to be awkward, shy, and unattractive.

Without further clarification, I don't think my Harry Potter friend, nor the autistic child fits this definition without first being ""an intellectual"" (defining that term is of course another mess...).

","1328056714"
"networking","t5_2qkaf","So....

IP addresses are in three classes that you use: A, B, and C (ignoring D and E). A goes from 1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.254. B goes from 128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254, and C goes from 192.0.1.1 to 223.255.254.254. Now, these are decimal representations of binary numbers.

When you buy say, a class A address, you will be buying an address and only the first octet matters. That is, you cannot buy 11.1.0.0, you buy 11.0.0.0. You get ALL the addresses from 11.0.0.0 - 11.255.255.255. So if you are running a network, that is around 16 million hosts you can run on that network, which is ridiculous. Way too big. You need to break that down. 

Oh, class B addresses use the first two octets, and class C addresses use the first three octets.

This is where subnetting comes into play. The subnet mask tells you which bits in the IP address is reserved for the network. Look at your home network for example. It is 192.168.x.x, lets say 192.168.1.0. Your subnet mask will be 255.255.255.0. This in binary is 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000. Wherever there is a 1, that bit is used for the IP address, and the 0s are hosts on the network. So in the home networking example, the first 24 bits represent the network (192.168.1) and the last 8 bits (.0) are reserved for hosts on the network. In home networking, you usually can leave this mask as the default. 

Let's say in your home network, you want to create two networks. (As to how you would do that, I won't go into.) Now, as it stands, 192.168.1.0 can handle 256 (2^8 ) addresses (To anyone else reading, I know, there is the network address and the broadcast address too, but I'm trying to keep it simple). You could *subnetwork* this, and use a mask of 255.255.255.128 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000. This means you have created two networks from one IP address. Since you have only the last seven bits to work with now, since the first bit in the last octet is still reserved for the network address, you can only have 128 (2^7 ) addresses on each. Your two networks would be 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.127 and 192.168.1.128-192.168.255.

These two networks wouldn't communicate with each other and they would be completely independent. So subnetting basically allows you to take one big network and make smaller networks. As to figure out what mask you need to use, it depends on how many hosts you want on each network.

As an example, my cable connection at home uses a 255.255.254.0 mask on my IP address (check your router to find yours). This is 11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000 in binary. That means the IP address I am assigned through Comcast is on the same network as 510 people (2^9 -2 (one for the network address and one for the broadcast address, just ignore that), looking at the zeros) and we all share the same bandwidth.

My IP address is 174.53.5.5 (making up the last two digits here). This means it is a class B address, and without subnetting (the default would be 255.255.0.0), I would be on the same network as 65,536 other people! That is why we subnet.

Hope this made some sense. Shoot me any questions. As to how to figure it out, which is what the OP was asking how hard we thought it was, I would say you would have to look that up. I've already written a wall of text and am too lazy to explain all the math into figuring out exactly how to do it. Basically do 2^x where x is the amount of zeros at the end of your mask, and that is how many hosts can be on that subnetted network.","1328056714"

"cars","t5_2qhl2","Not really; those are two separate concepts addressing two different issues.

The first is that if you watch crash tests of older cars (1960s/70s), their main weakness is in the A-pillar/firewall area. Much of the rest of the structure acts the same as modern, safety-oriented contemporary cars (the finely-calculated, energy-absorbing crumple zones of the front and rear virtually disappear on newer cars in head-on or rear-on crashes, just as the front and rear sections do on some, but not all, older cars.) So my first point is that if an older car merely had the improved A-pillar/firewall design of the current cars, it's crashworthiness would be greatly improved, possibly approaching the level of newer cars. Their main weaknesses usually seemed to occur in that specific area.

The second point was addressing the advances in technology used over the past 35 years to improve weight savings while maintaining structural rigidity and integrity. This includes the precision of digital design to improve the crash behavior of the materials involved while achieving the best weight-saving design possible. By creatively finessing the best approaches of this design philosophy, I suspect that the current Challenger could be up to 400lb or 500lb lighter without compromising safety, comfort, cost, or performance. (Obviously performance would be improved in the lighter version.)","1328056714"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","The fact is that male and female bodies with the exception of certain sexual organs are, except in the most polarized specimens, not very dissimilar as you are led to believe.  Males are identified in western culture by generally being slovenly and lacking all but the most basic grooming.  Women wear fake faces, remove body hair, prosthetic, etc.  You have two forces at work.  One is the perception of shape.  Certain shapes are attractive to you, and those shapes are not as gender-specific as you suppose them to be.  Secondly, you believed the ass to be attached to the female.   None of this makes you gay, but it might make you aware the many of the differences between male and female bodies are illusions created by dress and grooming and not specifically by shape.","1328056715"

&gt;To the second sentence, you fail at reading comprehension. I said the majority of unemployed immigrants refuse integration, not the majority of immigrants are unemployed and refuse integration.

You're just showing me how you fail at reading comprehension, since i never stated that you said that the majority of immigrants are unemployed and refuse integration. Try to go back and reread and maybe you'll catch my point this time around. Good luck!

&gt;Of course I do not deny the benefit of immigrants that hold a job. But you were talking about our moral obligation of giving asylum to every refugee that can come up with a good enough persecution story, even though he or she has no qualifications, no language skills, and ends up being unemployable here. I'm a utilitarian, not a bleeding heart liberal like you seem to be.

Im talking about the societal obligation of governments to educate and utilize laborers. Unemployable is a reflection of a faulty job market, not a faulty individual.

That aside: most of those people are probably men. I live in suburbs of Seattle, but when I go into Seattle, after a certain point (and made worse by certain areas) ...Fuck no. I don't feel comfortable. I do it, but that doesn't mean I feel safe. I will also make sure not to go more than about a mile (10 blocks) by myself unless I have to.

Even in the suburbs I live in now or that I've grown up in, I don't feel ""safe"".

That said, I do feel safer in Seattle than when in other cities.

Here I usually keep my cell phone handy, and depending on nerves have my finger on speed dial to 911. I've never bought Mace or anything like that although I've been encouraged to. I just keep an ear out and am hyper-cautious about any movement in the corner of my eyes.","1328056732"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","For the same reason it is in dota.  A support will be earning next to no gold in the game, even with multiple gp5 items you're basically just making enough to keep a few wards up.  25 gold is worth a hell of a lot more to a support than it is to a carry (difference between 0 and 1 cs compared to 200 and 201), and if your support is the one buying wards/counterwards they're going to be the ones who 25 gold matters to.

If you're in a dangerous place then just autoattack and let whoever kills it get the gold.  But if I do something like invest in an oracle, I'm pretty pissed off when other people ""steal"" the last hit on a ward.  Full disclaimer, I play both carries and support and I always let the support take the ward gold if possible.","1328056733"

Guy goes to get back in car and drive away. Cop tasers guy while he is walking away toward car. In the old days they would have gone up grabbed an arm and put him against the car in order to stop the guy. Maybe the guy fight, maybe not. The cops use tasers to enforce laws and prevent people from doing things that are not ok with ie walking away from a cop while the cop says they can't.

The good thing about tasers is that statistically they create far less injuries than going ""hands on"" or physically trying to stop an individual. However society, including myself, has a hard time dealing with people getting tased to enforce less clear cut issues ie the student at the UCLA library or this dog walker. But what was the appropriate course of action for a cop in the dog walker situation? Tasing is not pretty but should she have physically stopped him from leaving after he violated the law and tried to flee? ","1328056738"
