Think about it. If you are really a nice guy, you aren't nice just so you can fuck someone. You are genuinely nice and don't care if someone doesn't want a sexual relationship with you.

Then again, as pointed out elsewhere, it's not exactly likely that, when a government mandates behavior that goes against the moral compass of the individuals, the people will act according to law and not morality. In other words, the government may have enacted some racist laws, but that doesn't mean it made the situation any worse than it could have been: no person *became* racist after the laws were put in place. Laws can't force people to be bad, but they can force them to be tolerant.


&gt;This is not an indictment of government, but of all organizations. Every time you have some form of organization, the nature of the beast is for the primary goal of said organization (be it good governance, to breast cancer research, anything) immediately becomes the secondary goal of the organization, second to the maintenance of the organization and its power/authority/existence (based on the premise that the organization itself is necessary to achieve that goal).

It is quite possible, and it has happened, that the secondary goal of the organization aligns with the primary, or aligns with progressive moral ideals. For example, the Democratic party has for years used catering to various minorities as a mainstay of their political message: progressivism is the key to their continued relevance. Sure, it may not be *honest*, but that's not strictly relevant.","1370044804"

"PerfectTiming","t5_2t7te","I'm not sure that sounds enjoyable to me. But I had a dog that did the same thing, go out and run around the yard at full speed while grabbing mouths full of grass here and there and then puking them back up. 

EDIT. I got curious about why pets eat grass and did some googling and came up with this answer. 

"" 

*  Cats use grass as a laxative to enable them to pass hairballs lodged in their intestines.

- Cats eat grass to make them vomit up hairballs.

- Cats eat grass because they are feeling sick and this makes them vomit, getting rid of poisons.

- Cats eat grass to relieve inflammation of their throats.

- Cats eat grass to relieve stomach ache.

- Cats eat grass to add roughage to their diets.

One explanation for your cat's craving for grass is that in their wild hunting days (cats evolved from the wild cat, a long line of hunters) they normally ate the entire animal when they caught it. Many of their “kills” were herbivores (plant eaters), and cats ended up eating a lot of grass and plants that were in the stomachs and intestines of these animals.

Some people believe that cats eat grass for the raw nutrition their diets lack. They instinctively chew and eat grass to obtain the vitamins, minerals and live enzymes provided by fresh, raw whole foods. The ideal diet of fresh meat, grains and vegetables they once enjoyed in the wild has been replaced by one that often lacks these nutrients.

Others believe that eating grass plays a medicinal role in that it helps to relieve digestive problems. When cats are vomiting or have diarrhea, it is not uncommon to see them grazing away on the lawn. However, while eating some grass may help your cat's digestion, too much can make matters worse. Blades of grass often have edges that are irritating to the stomach and your cat will vomit a few minutes after eating.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was working as an intern at a tiny recording studio in Nashville and one afternoon a guy came in and asked to see the studio owner and the head engineer. I asked his name and he just said John. I went and quietly poked my head into the studio while they were between takes, and told the engineer that there was ""a little short guy named John at the desk"". Engineer looked confused, so I decided to continue with ""and he looks like he has pubes for hair..."" he laughed and stood up to come out, and when I turned around, I realized John was right behind me. I kind of awkwardly apologized without looking him the eyes, and the engineer steps out and says ""Oh! evalou0! Has anyone introduced you to Mr. Oates yet?"" I shook his hand, muttered ""nice to meet you"" and basically sprinted back to the desk. They talked for a few minutes, and as he's heading out the door, he turns to me and says, ""you know, you could probably benefit from a new hair style too"" and laughed as he walked out. 

Edit: I thought of another one! I go to the tattoo and horror convention in downtown Nashville every year, and I have a few friends that work audio at the Middle Tn Anime Convention (they have been in the same building the last few years). 2 years ago, one of the MTAC guys told me that he met Norman Reedus, who had a booth at the tattoo con and had been walking around both conventions in a very easily identifiable mask all weekend. The next day, I was waiting in the line for something (can't remember what) and lo and behold, here comes Norman Reedus in his mask. He walked right by me, and I leaned out of the line, stopped him, and whispered ""I know who you are"" as creepily as I could, just trying to be funny. He pretends to start hyperventilating and literally runs away. Later, I get to the booth where he's signing things and taking photos, and I go to take a picture with him. He's joking with the person taking the picture, and suddenly turns and whispers right in my ear, so no one else would hear him, ""And I know who you are.. I know everything about you.."" and starts laughing maniacally. (Then I got a hug and a kiss on the forehead, but I'm just including that because it was the best thing ever.. haha)

Edit, part 2: One more, then I swear I'm done. At the same tattoo convention last year, I accidentally stole $10 from Sid Haig. (Captain Spaulding!) This man is one of my favorite actors, I love him, and I was so nervous. He was charging $10 for a photo and an autograph, so while I giggled like a moron, I pulled a ten out of my purse and went to get a picture with him. I giggled like a moron some more, thanked him, and walked away, only to realize I still had the ten in my hand. The line was long and I didn't want to interrupt someone else, so I just walked away. That night, I went to a midnight showing of Devil's Rejects where he did a Q&amp;A with Bill Moseley (Otis!) and sat in the front row. Sid even sat in the middle of my group for a few minutes. I went back the next day when the convention was coming to a close, and there he was at his booth, but this time no line. I walked up, and he goes ""Hey best friend"" I freaked out because he recognized me.. then bought him a beer and told him it was to make up for the $10. He cracked a joke about how it's never smart to rob a clown, and I decided I could die happy.","1370044812"

Anyway, those three guys tell Hussam Ayloush, a community leader with FBI connections, and he informs the FBI, who acts nonchalantly about the whole thing.

So the FBI removes their guy, but then charges one of the guys who reported the undercover with conspiracy to commit terrorism because he didn't report him fast enough, and because one of his sisters is married to a man that the government considers a terrorist. So the FBI tells this guy that he either has to work for them as an undercover in Pakistan, or their going to charge him with conspiracy to commit terror attacks.

So the government then charges the guy for not disclosing that his sister is married to a terrorists, though who knows how one is supposed to know that someone is classified as a terrorist. The undercover then lies under oath to say that this guy was planning on committing terror attacks, thus making him a danger of the community, so he could be locked up indefinitely during his trial. The charges are eventually dropped, and now no one in the mosque talks to FBI agents anymore.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'll share my ""burning bush"" experience:

The first time I ever drove through Kansas was at night and I reached a magnificent lightning storm (no rain.. yet). There was so much lightning I turned off my headlights and could see even better than if they were on. I hadn't seen any cars for 20 minutes so I pulled over into the right shoulder and literally started dancing on Hwy 400/ Hwy 69. It was awesome. It was just me and The Man. Nobody passed by, but if anyone did I undoubtedly would have looked like a maniac.

I was praising God and called Him a show off. Seriously, I could see the rain miles away with all the lightning! (I wish I had pics). But eventually it was time to go. I knew this because I literally heard Him say ""Time to go."" (It wasn't the first time I've heard Him talk so it wasn't weird). But I didn't want to go. The show was too cool and, plus, I didn't see any rain or danger of staying. He said ""Seriously, it's time for you to go."" Like a child leaving an amusement park I begrudgingly agreed. RIGHT as I closed my door the torrent of rain hit.

May not be anything compared to having the Red Seas pushed back and crossing on dry land, but certainly something that left me thinking ""You definitely *are* up there."" Not to mention He know me *so* well that my stubbornness would be an issue.

That's *my* God.

I go to a place with pepsi, and it's usually the same. Even their dr pepper is more consistently good than dr pepper is on the coke machines.

Face primer doesn't have the ""stick"" that eyelid primer does. It's meant more to smooth you out and blur flaws, plus give a little bit of hold.

Eyelid primers are a lot of ""stick"", maybe a little smoothing(?), and usually give you a lighter base so the pigment shows up more.

I agree that it seems less likely than before when X royal family had ties with Y royal family and agreed to attack Z because of an assassination. But that being said, I feel like much of that stability has come from a world superpower hegemony which has trade and flow of money as one of its number one priorities. If that hegemony were to leave, I could see the next one to step up being just as concerned with money. But I could also see there being much higher tensions if the world became more of a regional superpower deal with no one country being the real, military superpower. For example, if the US had no influence in the far East I could see things being more troubled between China and Japan, South Korea and North Korea, etc.

Past medical testing on humans revealed

Ugly US medical experiments uncovered In this June 25, 1945 picture, army doctors expose patients to malaria-carrying mosquitoes in the malaria ward at Stateville Penitentiary in Crest Hill, Ill. Around the time of World War II, prisoners were enlisted to help the war effort by participating in studies that could help the troops. A series of malaria studies at Stateville Penitentiary in Illinois and two other penitentiaries were designed to test antimalarial drugs that could help soldiers fighting in the Pacific. Shocking as it may seem, government doctors once thought it was fine to experiment on disabled people and prison inmates.

Hacking the President’s DNA

The U.S. government is surreptitiously collecting the DNA of world leaders, and is reportedly protecting that of Barack Obama. Decoded, these genetic blueprints could provide compromising information.

(called ancestry mapping, see [here](http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/humanmigration.shtml)) For example, I remember a front page post about a half-black/half-white guy and a (middle eastern?) guy that were perfect doubles. Ancestry mapping of these two would (most likely) show they are from very lineages.

I know this doesn't come close to answering OP's question, but it is something that could be done using existing methods and databases.

Time for me to reflect on Sprint 2:

* *Reading - I wana get through Emotional Freedom and Will I Ever Be Good Enough? completely and continue with my Anxiety workbook.* 

 * I finished the *Will I Ever Be Good Enough?* but then read other books (*Food Rules* and currently on *In Defense of Food*).  Didn't touch my anxiety workbook.

* *Jogging - I'm on the fence but I think I'm going to run outside since the weather is nice and it's not burning summer hot yet.  Thus I don't think I'll be doing C25K anymore.  Gotta think about this more.*  

 * Well I worked on getting over the anxiety of running outside, had a person say something to me while out jogging, and restarted C25K on W2 outside.  I'll be continuing this next round.

* *Social - Got a couple baseball games planned and found out the library has free passes to awesome museums all around.  Plus as the weather becomes nicer, more parks are having events and even free ones. :D Got a couple events I want to check out in May.* 

 * I did go to a three baseball games, a museum (by myself too!) and a board game night.  I have to utilize the free museum passes more.

* *Exercise - Continue working out every day, remember to incorporate yoga on upper body days and meditation on lower body days.* 

 * This wasn't consistent again either.  Must work on making exercise consistent!

* *Jog searching front - Do that reading therapist gave me and delve into that.*

 * I did do the work sheet and I also went to a résumé and interview workshop, went to a job fair, and went to the career center to sign up for services.

* *Weight - A long-term goal set last Dec was to be 180 lbs by June 3 which might be possible.  That's a big might.  But I'm aiming for losing 4 pounds this sprint.*  

 * I'll weigh on Sunday so I'll see how much I lost.

I'm creating my sprint 3 goals but they'll be pretty similar to the previous sprints.

**Today's Goals**

* Walk - DONE

* Therapy - DONE

* Meditation - DONE

* Reading - DONE

* Library (work on résumé, log pedometer/fito, 90DG reflect Sprint 2, plan Sprint 3) - DONE

* Watch baseball on tv - Postponed so double header tomorrow :)

* C25K W2D3 - DONE; even tho I have a headache. I'm pretty sure cause it's been cold and today is hot and I'm dehydrated. 

* Lower Body Exercises

* 10-minutes cleaning desk ","1370044838"

We provide a range of jobs -- from people starting out stocking shelves to Ph.D.’s in engineering and finance. We provide education assistance and skill training and, most of all, a chance to move up in the ranks.""

- she just used statistics to her advantage in a corporate tirade. ""75% of managers started out as hourly employees"" - most people at a manager skill level aren't looking to go there so they promote the successful within. Congrats. That makes a low wage look better. Hi would you like to make 15 dollars an hour as a manager instead of 8? Regardless of the situation that person would say yes. Now, someone working at a medical practice making 14.50 an hour... is not going to be interested in that. 

""More than 60% of Americans shop here every month"" - well considering you've closed most mom and pop shops, and regional stores are barely hanging on, it makes sense when you have a non membership store (aka free) that offers low

"programming","t5_2fwo","Yes, but not everyone is as adaptable. I got hired for perl and was able to very quickly pick up PHP. I would even help some less capable devs try and solve problems in langauges I had never used. My boss did everything he could to keep me around because he saw it as being a fairly rare trait in developers.

It really comes down to how a person learned to program. Some like myself who are self taught have had to learn the hard way through experience basic concepts of programming, but learn it in such a way that it's easily adaptable. School taught programmers learn concepts through rote practice and implementation and have a harder time applying those same concepts to anything else.

I also don't consider it an intellect thing either. One of the programmers I worked with was better in C than I was because of his experience, but his expertise was in networking. He was like a fish out of water in trying to do anything other than C or bash.

TL;DR: I would compare the differences in programming languages to be akin to the differences between a handsaw, a chainsaw, and a table saw. Just because you can trim wood in a workshop doesn't mean you're qualified to be a lumberjack.","1370044847"

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","In California, the loan terms and interests rates are set by the state and are significantly more affordable than payday advances. Interest is only due every 4 months. 

Pawning/selling your items may be unwise for some people financially, but for others it's the difference between eating this month or not. Often, they've made other poor financial decisions that put them into a position where they need to pawn or sell their goods - that is not my fault. I'm just here to help if I can.

If you have the time and means to sell the items yourself, then go for it - my feelings won't be hurt. However, if you need cash today and don't mind paying me a modest interest rate, than I am more than happy to help.

A lot of people would rather have $5 today than $10 a week from today, it's just a fact of life. I am not here to judge people on their financial decisions or to determine what is or isn't wise for them. Until you're in their position, you can't really say either.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I'd just like to tell you that while psychiatry works for a lot of people, medicine does not necessarily constitute ""real help.""  There is a lot of trial and error, and a risk that things can get worse (sometimes just temporarily at first, sometimes just because the particular drug is not meant for you chemically).  So don't feel too bad about your parents preventing you from getting meds, because honestly I started taking meds when I was 14 and I think it caused more problems than it helped.  That's not to say don't get that type of help if it's for you, but don't worry about it if you can't access it.  Sometimes exercise is the answer, or finding a hobby you like to sink your time into.  And ""the answer"" is a fallacy because it doesn't necessarily just ""stop.""  But it's as much trial and error as therapy and medicine, so try those things while you can.  Maybe the prayer will work, even if that's not what you believe.  At least try to appreciate that they care, even if it's in their own way and that's not your way.  Suicidal thoughts are like a storm you have to wait out.  There's always the chance you could screw up if you try and end up living with worse problems.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt; Turn that around. You have no issue forcing northern-Irish Protestants into a distinctly catholic Ireland but can't justify forcing catholic northern-Irish into the UK? I don't think it's fair to characterize the UK as a distinctly protestant state. From my visits, it seems quite secular.

I don't want to force anyone into a sectarian state. The main reason I abhor Northern Ireland is because it is structurally sectarian. I wish to 'force' northern Protestants into a secular state, which would not oppress them nor allow them to oppress others.

The 'UK' is not distinctly protestant (although the Church of England is an established church, and has special representation in parliament). However, 'Northern Ireland' as a state within the UK is perhaps the most sectarian state in the first world. Protestants march through catholic areas celebrating victories over catholics, schools are segregated, all the main members of the unionists parties are members of the devoutly anti-catholic 'Orange Order'. 

My family are 'protestants' (though southern, not northern protestants), and I have family living in the north. You only truly realise the nature of the northern state when you watch grown men marching down a road, banging a drum so hard that blood runs from their hands, and screaming bigoted chants so long and loud that their voices are hoarse for days after.

&gt; ...secular, non-sectarian, socialist Irish state. This exists where exactly? Certainly not on Earth. But, no, even in the case that such a state existed, I could not justify forcing a region to join it if the majority were against it.

My greatest wish, greater than my desire to unite Ireland, is to turn Ireland into a socialist and secular state. I plan to achieve that end, hopefully before any new developments in terms of the North. Because a secular and socialist state based upon the whole of the island is the only choice that will guarantee permanent peace, and allow true reconciliation and heal the divide.

&gt; Here's a question: Why does the catholic-Irish minority in Northern Ireland matter more in determining what nation Northern Ireland will be a part of then the protestant-Irish majority in Northern Ireland?

The catholic minority don't matter more: that's exactly the point. I don't wish to single any group out for special treatment. Why does the protestant minority on the island of Ireland get the special ability to determine what state the section of the island they live on is part of?

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I love this counter-argument, because it so clearly demonstrates a lack of understanding of the scientific principle. There are no ""facts"" in science, that's an extremely common misconception and only further shows your ignorance of the entire matter. You've clearly never seriously researched the debate, or if you did, barely scratched the surface.

No single observation is valid, so they must be repeated over and over, until there is virtually no doubt about their accuracy. No scientific theory ever asserts the truth of anything, it only offers increasingly more accurate models of the universe.

The only thing a scientist has ""faith"" in is the scientific method, which makes a whole hell of a lot more sense than a piece of historical fiction.

The most important thing about the scientific perspective is that it recognizes that we will never have a ""right"" answer, only the best answer given the existing information. Religion requires you to throw out any critical thought regarding its principles, and accept it on faith.

If there's only thing you get from my post, please let it be this: science, unlike religion, cannot and will not ever claim ""truth"". Science can only positively show things to be false.","1370044851"

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","Whenever I see that other group of 6, they have tons of fun. I keep hearing that that one girl really opened up and is alot less shy now. This is kinda weird for me, why would this happend after 3 periods? I don't speak to these people nearly as much as I would like to. When I see them I say hi, when we have a thing with the whole study I go to them, but I feel I am drifting away from this group. I felt closer to these people than anyone in high school, but this is becomming less, and I really don't want this to happen. I try to stay in contact with some people I like the most, I want to text them, but again, I just don't know what about. I recently found out 3 guys and that girl are going on vacation together this summer. Ofcouse I would love to go with them, especially with this girl, but 2 of the 3 other guys and I don't get along that well. Maybe it is because I get the feeling that they both (used to) like this girl in the same way I do. From one guy this was pretty obious, although he recently told me he didn't like this girl, even though I'm sure he used to. These three guys get along together very well, they want on short vacations together several times, and on school they hang out together. A thing that is bothering me, a lot, is that they are going to the house of the parent of this girl in Germany. I can't get the thought out of my head that they are just bringing her with them so they can stay in her house, even though they really aren't these kind of people. Maybe I'm just upset that they are going on vacation with here, but I just can't get this thought out of my head. The other guy of the three is a great guy, he is one of the few people where I get the feeling that he is trying to be my friend. This whole vacation thing is probably bothering me way too much, but I just can’t get it out of my head. Am I just jealous? I get the feeling that I am scared that this girl will have a horrible holiday, even though this is probably not the case, all three of the guys can get along with here pretty nice. The one guy from who I get the feeling that he liked her though is bothering me though. He is kind of a dick. He is making fun of other people (maybe me more than others, maybe not) just to feel good about himself. I know at least 2 other people from our group feel the same way, but he still is the ‘’main guy’’ of the group. Maybe I’m just scared that he will take this girl away from me, I just don’t know. My holiday will probably be awful again by the way, parent, again, no friends to go with.

I guess the main story is that I just always feel left out of everything. I get a group of people that I hang around with, but they still really don’t feel like friends. I also would really love to have a girlfriend, you may say that it isn’t a problem to not have one when you are 18, but I kinda feel like it is. I just feel more and more alone and left out, I don’t want this anymore. 

TL;DR: (I think one is in his place)
I just want someone to tell this story to, but in real life.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've been on both ends of this issue, and I think it is typically a case of friends growing apart. In a friendship, each party has certain expectations out of the friendship. Such expectations may arise from where they 'rank' the friend among their other friends. So for example, if you consider one friend among your '6-7 closest friends' but they consider you a tier two friend, then you guys may have different expectations. When your expectations are not met (e.g., to hang out, talk on the phone, help you move, provide comfort during difficult times, be a good wing-man on a night out, etc.), you may wonder if you are growing apart, or if your expectations need to be changed.

Alternatively, both parties may rank each other similarly (e.g., both consider each other to be best friends), but what each party expects out of such a friendship may nevertheless be different.

It's complex. You're not going to end a close friendship or change it dramatically because your friend bailed out on you once. But a pattern of such behavior will make you reconsider.

I guess open communication helps in such situations, and I think the poster to whom you are responding just wants open, candid communication about the situation rather than subtle hints or passive-aggressive behavior. But I can see how open, candid communication can be difficult. I think I have an conflict avoidant personality, and I'm the guy who will always say yes and then half the time back out with an excuse because I don't have the heart to tell you to your face that I'd rather not hang out with you / I have other priorities. So I can understand where that comes from. But still, in such situations, I feel like an asshole. I think open communication is the best way to go.","1370044857"

My dad once told me he wondered if it was unhealthy that I wasn't afraid of the dark or anything because it could possibly get me into trouble (was living in Australia at the time, so the fauna I was watching and prodding could have been lethal if my parents didn't have hawk eyes on me). 

I was just entertaining the hypothetical situation where nobody knew that movies were fake (and we are assuming here that for some reason nobody would rationalise it out). Obviously some movies would be more unsettling than others but the reason I have never felt scared in a movie is because I always have that disconnect between fiction and reality, in addition to a solid grounding in science and logic...remove that and I could see some things depicteed in movies being more than a little unsettling, particularly those which would turn science on its head. 

Nukes are pretty terrible things, horrifying really, I know they should be terrifying and yet I have never *felt* afraid of them. I guess that is largely down to growing up in an era when no nation has seriously pointed them at each other and the horrific bombing of Japan is a footnote in a book and something that even my dad was too young to remember. Actually it surprises me how 'well' mutually assured destruction seems to have worked because no nation has pushed far enough with another to get to the point of pushing buttons.

"allthingszerg","t5_2tkq6","Some quick things at first glance:

* Queens much sooner, at most wait till your hatch finishes, the earlier you have the queens the better.

* This terran One-Based a long time. Normally this means early aggression. So a third base would not be advisable. If the push would have come sooner, you would have nothing to defend. So stay better stay on 2 base and drone up and make a decently sized army before you take a third. This also helps you to maintain map control (something you never really had in this game) and keep him in the base, preventing him from taking his natural as long as possible. This also allows you to go to Lair much sooner, allowing for things like mutas, infestors, baneling speed and +2/+2 upgrades.

* BANELINGS! You scouted his marine heavy play and never made a baneling nest. Instead you made a roach warren. Why? Against that many marines banelings are much more (cost) efficient. Even with pure lings and blings, if you had used the lings to trap and then simply run the banes into his marines, you would have destroyed his push easily.

* When you get mutas in this situation, you should never use them directly against the marines. Mass marine will shred through mutas, even in bigger numbers. What you want to do with mutas: harass his mineral line (he had no turrets and no expansion when you had quite some mutas ready), cut off reinforcements and/or tanks in the back of its army. Only when you have a massive amount of lings/blings and he has only marines and medivacs left (maybe some few tanks) I would fly my mutas into his army (always together with my lings/blings","1370044857"

"politics","t5_2cneq","First of all, IANAL, and I'm simply speculating as to what such legal precedence might be.

As I've mentioned in other posts, any liability would be dependent on the legal concept of negligence.

Negligence is, ""a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances"".

Essentially, it hinges entirely on whether or not a parent made a reasonable effort to do what is expected of them. It could be strongly argued that getting your child vaccinated is not only extremely common, but expected of most parents unless there are extenuating circumstances.

So, if a parent has not done their due diligence in having their child vaccinated -- or officially exempt based on medical grounds such as a compromised immune system of allergy to the vaccine --, then the parent could be considered negligent if their failure to do what was reasonably expected of them.

If however, a child who was vaccinated still gets sick with something they were vaccinated for, which in turn causes another child to get sick, then the parent of the vaccinated child would not be considered negligent. The reason behind this is because the parent carried out their due diligence in meeting the societal expectation that they vaccinate their child. They have taken reasonable effort to attempt to mitigate risk.

To clarify things a little more, if such a precedence were to be set, it would be likely that it would only pertain to diseases in which we commonly vaccinate children for. Obscure vaccinations, or diseases that have no vaccinations, would not be included in such.","1370044859"

He's being pretty disrespectful to the club by talking up how much he'd like to play for Madrid and how he couldn't turn them down, I know reporters are asking him but he doesn't have to give the sort of answers he's giving.

He's complaining about the press lying about him but here he is again giving them something to write about, he's giving ambiguous answers to questions about his future which is only fueling the speculation. He could have simply dismissed the questions or at least say he doesn't want to comment but he's not doing that, he's giving the answers he's given for a reason, he's not naive, he knows how the press are going to pick up on it.

He's saying all this after the club stood by him through so much, he dragged the clubs name through the dirt numerous times yet the club defended him, and here he is now talking up another team in another league. If he didn't want to leave he would have kept his mouth shut.

If he had said he want's to play for titles then I'd understand, but his media excuse is bullshit. If he goes to Spain he's going to get the same coverage he get's here when he does something controversial, same as well if he ends up in Italy where it's even worse.

I'd love for him to stay, he's a phenomenal talent, adds so much unpredictability to the side and would be extremely difficult to replace. On one hand I'm hoping a lot of this is miscommunication and isn't as big a deal as we think, but on the other, my respect for him is starting to be chipped at.

I was in the Kop when he bit Ivanovic and on the way back to the bus I heard someone in the group I was with say we might have just seen his last goal and game (I didn't see the incident so I hadn't a fucking clue what he meant until a while after) little did I know how close to being true it could be.","1370044860"

I used to work in casinos and he knows a guy who runs fun casinos for corporate events.  Sometimes casino staff would do some work on the side.  One of my colleagues ended up in one of his shows, an early one where he was pretending to be in a casino memorising blackjack cards and things (he recently got barred from a club in the UK for playing BJ, which I think was a bit much and possibly a publicity stunt).

So they had a fake casino set up in some hotel or something, and he filmed a few shots for the opening, explaining how he could beat the odds and such.  He turns to my colleague on a blackjack table and says, ""Okay, do whatever it is you do when you're about to start a game of blackjack"".

So, obviously, she shuffled the cards (what else are you going to do before dealing a game?).  Derren freaks out, ""WAIT!  What are you doing?!"".  She shrugged, ""Er, shuffling up?""

Derren sends everyone out of the room and makes them wait for a while before coming back in.  Obviously he had memorised the deck as he had set it up (probably with some specific story for the cards to memorise the pattern, easier than memorising a random set), so he had to reset them.  When they came back in he said, ""Okay, *apart* from shuffling, do the rest of what you do..."", so she put them in the shoe and the rest you can see in the episode as filmed.

I dealt roulette to him once (in a real casino).  He wore a brown suit and played brown chips.  Won a fiver","1370044860"

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","I was on the programming team at my university shortly before dropping out (actually won one of the regional competitions), but we did a lot of those problems on UVA. It was actually pretty cool because our ""coach"" had a database with the problems with points assigned to them based on difficulty. Solving them in our free time got us points and bragging rights. It was really fun and I felt that it taught me a lot so I would definitely recommend the programming challenges book for a nice compilation of UVA problems, but I would also recommend looking for compilations based on skill level online like [this one](http://www.acmsolver.org/?p=1025).  

I do have a question for you. When you get stuck on a problem with UVA and I mean like really stuck, what methods do you feel work best for solving it. Often times a problem will require you to have a certain level of math knowledge, but you might not even know where to begin with those types of problems. When I hit those road blocks I would look at other solutions a lot of the time, but I felt conflicted by doing so as if I were not developing problem solving skills correctly by doing that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well that is not true. Jews began pushing for their own country way before any of the world wars. Christians and Jews were both migrating to Israel and encouraging a Jewish state around 1840. The issue of the Palestinians is a very complex one, however, it is not as though we simply kicked them off their land and now oppress them. There is a lot more to it then that and I don't think I could do it justice in a quickly typed out response. It is something I have studied extensively though. The UN's decision was not based off of sympathy for the Jewish people either, it was the Russians who were sympathetic to our cause early on. The British had made promises to both sides and it was because of their conflicting promises that the white paper was enacted. If we hadn't fought off the combined Arab forces, alone and without the help of our big brother America, then Israel would not exist. The whole notion that our country exists because the rest of the world felt bad for us is bullshit. Jews were dealing with antisemitism throughout Europe for centuries before the holocaust and the idea of claiming a homeland was not a new invention. Now, the holocaust may have helped push western sympathies our way, but it was not what caused Israel to form. ","1370044868"

Dear Clients,

Two weeks ago we received an urgent call from one of the local no kill shelters.  25 (!!) cats and kittens were dropped off in the middle of the night in front of their thrift store.  They had no room and asked for our help.  How could we say no!  We couldn't so we have beautiful kittens that need homes.  Some of them were sickly and are being treated and will be ready soon.  As of now, we have 3 that are ready for a new home, 3 that will be weaned and ready in 2 weeks and 6 that will be weaned and ready in one month. 

 Can you help?  Would you consider adopting one or two of these wonderful cats.  We have a client who comes in daily to work with socializing the litters and now they come to the front of their condo as soon as a human walks by and meow for attention. 

 Please come by and visit them.  Thanks!

"SilkRoad","t5_2sidu","A few years ago my girlfriend, my dog, and I were smoking a bowl on the small patio area in front of our first floor apartment as we did most everyday. This patio looked out into the parking lot, where an unfamiliar, old white car pulled into a parking spot right in front of our place. The car was full, with two dudes sitting up front and another dude sitting in the back seat with a girl. 

As the car parks, my girlfriend says that these people look sketchy and we should head into the apartment to finish up the bowl. I objected, insisting that we were safe on our patio. Just as I finish my sentence, a loud BANG goes off. I immediately recognized the bang as a gunshot and as I look up I see the white car empty and everybody inside bolts, except for the dude from the backseat, who stood propped up on the open car door. 

I tell my girlfriend to go inside, and she does, grabbing the dog, running inside and locking me out of the apartment in complete fear. After she lets me into the apartment, I hide the bud and piece and proceed to call the police, fearing that this was a botched robbery attempt. As the phone is ringing though, I see the guy from the back seat motioning at me through the peep hole, for me to come to him. High as fuck, I walk outside and ask the guy, ""do you need me to call the cops?!?!"" He responds, ""I don't want you to call anyone, I want you to ..."" ...and he passed out, nailing his head on the frame of the open car door, spilling even more of his blood in the parking lot, at which point I realize this dude has shot himself in the leg right in the thigh and is bleeding the fuck out. Again, I am pretty blazed at this point, so I run inside to call the cops, whom I had forgotten that I needed to call. 

I went back inside, with the emergency dispatcher on the phone, staring through the peep hole, attempting to describe the man who had shot himself in the leg and the car he had arrived in. As I am describing, my girlfriend is basically telling me I am wrong in everything I am saying; the color of the guy's shirt, the color of his hair, his race...etc. At this point, I just hand the phone to my girlfriend so she can talk to the dispatcher and she stands, looking out the window and describes everything perfectly, in a way I was too high to accomplish. Finally, the cops show up and take the guy into custody, along with his friends whom they found scattered about the neighborhood. The cops never knocked on my door and there was no follow up with us from LE regarding the incident. After they took the crime scene tape down and the cops left, we went back outside and blazed again. ","1370044870"

For my view on Necrophilia here is a frankly eye opening video form [David Mitchell.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B_Yw-JAnuw) My basic opinion is that as long as the two partners are willing (or have at least given consent) and have a full understanding of what they are agreeing to any sexual fetish is just grand. However both of these fetishes play on one partner being placed into a position they would rather not be in i.e. dead or missing one or multiple limbs. These states are also not the ""ideal"" states for humans to be in and, as Mitchell points out, the most difficult for people who don't share the fetish to comprehend as attractive. It is because of these two factors that a certain amount of disgust is justified as, though to almost polar extents, it is taking pleasure in other people's misfortune.","1370044871"

The second time, at another house show, we talked in the autograph line for a moment before the show, she signed my Beautiful People shirt and said she couldn't get Angelina to sign that quite as easy as the DVD (she was out of the company by then).

While this may not lead to as high of an unbuffed sheet the dps, it should maximize the buffed dps which is what really matters.

For monk I favour crit chance a bit more as the CC affects both cyclone generation and cyclone crit rate, and I think that having a higher cyclone generation rate results in a bit of a smoother farming experience. 

This affects my gearing choices very little though, as generally you just want the CC first to make the build work, then as much of crit damage as you can afford and finally topping off the stats as you find the right deals on the AH. For instance, for a DW nat's monk you can have up to 58% crit chance with 670% crit damage, so it's certainly possible to get more crit damage and 10x crit chance if you're going by the same % of max stat.

    Be as specific as possible.

On the sidebar. Go [here](http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx), select Desktop Graphics -&gt; Radeon HD Series -&gt; 6xxx -&gt; Pick your OS. You could choose 7xxx as well, as AMD has only two major driver packages.  One for legacy cards and one for newer cards. It it doesn't install there probably isn't much you can do as it's an OEM card.

I'm guessing you're Swedish, so OEM in case means cards that are not sold to the public, but only to resellers. Also I wouldn't expect much if any performance increase for gaming, that is a low-end card.

You've missed the point entirely (which doesn't surprise me in the slighest, at this point) - or rather, more likely, you're *avoiding* the point, and reframing the argument. You keep saying things like ""my opinions have no effect on reality"", but what you're carefully ignoring is the fact that **nobody was saying that in the first place**. We weren't asking you about the state of affairs in the world as it exists, or about the historical basis of anything in particular. We were asking you what *you* believed, and how *you* felt, because *that's what we were interested in knowing about*.

I'm wondering if you had a lot of problems with opinion papers in school. Given this remark,

&gt; This is what comes out of our colleges, folks.

I wonder if that's why you (as you seem to imply) *didn't* ""come out of our colleges"". (Is that something to be proud of?)

Moving on...

&gt; At this point I was banned.

This makes it sound as though you were banned *for that comment*, and probably by me. That's entirely inaccurate. I won't post a screenshot of the modmail unless the other individuals involved okay it, but you know who banned you, and you know why:

&gt;&gt;You are boring and extremly evasive. This is a space for arguing in good faith.

&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;&gt;They [your words] have the effect of making me wade through a bunch of nonsense not put forward in good faith.

&amp;nbsp;  
&gt;&gt; Here at GameZero, we try to maintain a certain level of discussion. Having a discussion with someone who's blatantly dodging that discussion isn't what we want here. We want people who are conductive to discussion and respectful (within reason) to their opponents. This has nothing to do with the content of your posts, or you being ""wrong"". Its about what we want to foster here. Is that clear?

You were also banned for about an hour in total.

So, let's get to the meat of this. You've still completely refused to answer some simple questions about what you yourself believe. I told you I'd be more than happy to continue the conversation on *your* turf, so allow me to more or less repeat them - and add a few, for clarity's sake.

These are pretty simple and straightforward questions, which can largely be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"", with (if you like) any amount of additional explanation expanding or clarifying your response. They *aren't*, as you've tried to claim in modmail, [complex questions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_question) that require acceptance of an untrue proposition (or one you don't agree with) in order to answer them either way.

So, if you'd be so kind:

* Do you believe that, in a philosophical sense and irrespective of legality - *ethically*, say - marriage entails consent to sex?

* Do you believe that it *should* be considered acceptable for a man to force his wife to have sex with him if she doesn't want to?

* Do you think it's right, or just (if you'd rather), that that's legally considered rape? 

* Do you think that what's currently considered ""marital rape"" *shouldn't* be a crime?

* If the law changed tomorrow, and ""marital rape"" wasn't a thing at all, and men were considered to be entitled to have sex with their wives whether they wanted it or not, and men couldn't be prosecuted for exercising that entitlement - if, in a nutshell, it was legally considered that marriage *did* entail consent to sex - would you be okay with that? Would you feel that that was an acceptable state of affairs, or would you have a problem with it? Would you consider that legislation just, or unjust?

(Added in edit:) If you do feel that husbands are (or should be considered to be, in your ideal world) entitled to sex from their wives, who have (or should be considered to have) a responsibility to provide it to them:

* Do you feel that it works the other way around, too? Do (or should) wives have the right to force themselves on their husbands against the latter's will, as much as the other way around?

* Where are the lines drawn as to what constitutes ""sex""? Is a husband entitled to oral? Anal? Are there any mitigating circumstances or contexts?

Thanks in advance. Genuinely curious as to your views on this subject. &lt;3

The first time I watched Perfect Blue was back in middle school and it was a subtitled copy of the uncensored Japanese version (the initial US release was heavily censored, particularly the rape scene.  A lot of the sexuality was scrubbed from the movie as well.).

**SPOILERS BELOW**

I've watched it hundreds of times and I'm still trying to figure out which scenes contain the real Mima and which scenes are Rumi.  My theory is that the true story is about Rumi and the increasingly disturbing decline of her mental health.

Requiem for a Dream has a [shot-for-shot copy of the bathtub scene](http://youtu.be/anlHmGA-Bvs) (which both happen after similar events), and a lot of the surreal aspects from Perfect Blue (losing reality, hallucinations) show up in Black Swan.  Hell, Black Swan is pretty much a carbon copy of the story...  Aronofsky has denied the movie having any influence on his works, but come on!  It's so obvious...

Aronofsky needs to direct a live action Perfect Blue and get it out of his system once and for all!

In proportion to what we get out of it, the wealthy are not paying their fair share right now. Who arbitrarily decided we should pay equally? I missed that meeting. It's simple: if you gain more by the system, you pay more back into it.

&gt;Even if it were true that all infrastructure were equally paid for by all users

I'm not going any further on this ""equally"" strawman journey.

&gt;Should we have the same civil rights laws as we did then? Should we have the same racial demographics and religious predominance?

Or maybe we could keep the baby and still get rid of the bathwater?

&gt;I want no American to be paying money into a system that enriches politicians,

I love how you make this sound noble, but you really mean that you want poor people to die, roads to crumble (or robber barons to take them over with tollbooths), and any other infrastructure that our federal taxes pays for to disappear. You know what all that infrastructure achieves? Shorter (cheaper) network connections. This makes the whole system far more efficient and therefore productive. This is not in the interest of any self-interested company to put more money into than their competitor.

I'll copy my reply to this other comment which you might not have seen:

Just because JV is a lower standard is no reason to make fun of a guy though...

I completely agree, and this is the point Aleddin should have made.

Make fun of those using JV as an insult because it's a dumb reason to insult someone. Merely stating the fact that these people aren't on JV themselves is, instead, a pointless comment to make, since that by itself is no reason to deride the people making these comments.

I always remove the complete exhaust system. 6 nuts for the exhaust manifolds(sometimes the studs will come out with the nut but just treat it like a bolt), lube the hangers and slip them off, keeping the entire exhaust whole. In my part of the world an older model will have weaker, eroded flanges and bolts that seamlessly blend into the exhaust.

You will need a good punch set or air hammer with narrow tip to push back the dowel on the passenger side through and a thin pry bar(I like to use a drum brake adjustment tool, very thin, very hard), and separate the trans from the passenger side, over top to the driver side. You will have to remove the transmission completely. Use one jack and a block of wood to tilt the engine up, transmission pointing on a downwards angel and the other jack obviously to support the transmission.

By having the tires spin to reduce friction and helping the life of the tire, you inherently sacrifice control. You WANT those tires to have friction because of the heat that's generated. Hot tires mean sticky tires, better at slowing down, and more control if you need to make a quick turn. 

Cold tires suck when you need to slam the brakes or make an aggressive/emergency turn. Been there, done almost pissed myself, on a cold morning.","1370044904"

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","    class String():
    
       def __init__(self, text):
           self.text = text
    
       def __repr__(self):
           return self.text
    
    class Main():
       sentence = String(""Hi, my name is Diethlem"")
       print(sentence)

There were a few things wrong - first, for your question, the python interpreter reads in each line, line by line.

So unlike other languages which compile everything so you can use later, if you don't have your class defined *before* you call it, it won't work. So first initialize String so python knows what it is, then you can use it.

An alternate method could be like:

    class String():
    
       def __init__(self, text):
           self.text = text
    
       def __repr__(self):
           return self.text
    
    class Main():
    
    	def __init__(self):
       		self.sentence = String(""Hi, my name is Diethlem"")
    
    	def printsentence(self):
       		print(self.sentence)
    
    Main().printsentence()
    
Because python doesn't start at the Main() class - it just carries out each instruction, line by line. So when it gets to Main().printsentence(), it initializes the class Main, and calls the printsentence method.

But, there were a couple of other things wrong too: init and repr are preceded and trailed by *two* underscores, not one.

And, print(x) doesn't do anything - I assume you wanted to print the variable you just initialized, which is sentence.","1370044905"

It's fine.  Wear your hat.  Forget appropriation.  I guess that's a given to be my view given I'm a white pro-capitalist.  

Anyway, my reason for thinking that it's fine is not just individual right to expression (it is), it's also that no culture has a pre-destined right to exclusivity.  None.  Hating popular culture adoptions of other cultures is, to me, hipster social justice.  Resisting the spread of something because you don't want it to be cool.  ","1370044908"

The problem with PH is that by this point, it has retconned effectively everything established in FoE in some way. Somber's narrative completely changes the history of the world for the worse by replacing it for some cheap tale about conspiracy and *evil star power*. 

The history in FoE wasn't about evil entities; it was about highlighting how the mane 6 fell apart without their friendship, and how good intentions can turn wrong. It was about two sides, neither clearly in the wrong, who end up obliterating each other because of small differences and misunderstandings.

Valve had a normal Dev Kit of the Oculus Rift! It is just that they modified it themselves to do position tracking. So instead of the Oculus only registering your heads rotations/angles, it could tell my position within the room.

So, it as not a newer Oculus rift, it was a Valve modifed oculus rift.

I heard some people getting dizzy/nausea quickly with the Oculus Rift. But I did not get any of that. Again, it could have been the upgraded tracking, or that I did not use it for enough time. I cannot give any estimate as to how long I was in there.

Let's guess (based on nothing but my gut) that the overall expected suicide rate for the army is a bit higher than the overall rate for the nation, given that the army is mostly young men, we could put a rough estimate at an expected rate of 15-18 per 100,000 per year.

Possibly but you are making a large assumption about why people choose to have sex. If you find a subgroup that decides in the manner you just described then you might be right, but deciding to have sex is not necessarily a lack of self control thing. People can be perfectly self controlled and still decide to have sex.

&gt;Abstinence essentially gives a person an extreme amount of self-control and the ability to deal with discomfort.

It can, it also can be a way for young people to differentiate themselves from their peergroup at a time when that is important. Identifying as part of a ""superior group"" is appealing to many young people and it can give them a sense of belonging and companionship, and it can do this without actually instilling the values you are mentioning. Also it is not the only effective way to teach someone self control or how to deal with discomfort.

Orgasm denial is really something anybody can get into; most of the pleasure of sexual activity occurs before you orgasm. Sure, the orgasm is the 'best part'; but it's only the best part because it's more intense than the rest, it's arguably not the best part based on it's duration.

Plus, when you delay orgasm for a long period if time, the orgasm is often more enjoyable ... it gets a bit retarded when you start having 'ruined orgasms' where the orgasm isn't actually enjoyable ... but that's fun too. You 'need' release, but you enjoy being denied, so it's fun.","1370044916"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","1. You can't, but hard supports don't particularly need items. For a great item-independent support, try the likes of KotL, Lina, Lich, Jakiro, or SD. That said, you should only buy what consumables you need, and you should have brown boots before getting the 2nd set of observer wards. Also, ganks are why playing support is difficult; you're usually very squishy and that's why positioning and vision are incredibly important. Don't die, and you can get items.

2. KotL, Lion and Lich are the only supports without mana problems, and Lion isn't a great hard support as he's pretty level-dependent. Basically you'll pretty much always want Arcanes as your first item, but also learn to manage your mana. Also, don't be afraid to go back to base to regen your mana, even if you have full health.

3. Don't pull unless the creep wave's pushed (you can ask your carry to push the wave so you can pull) or your lane partner is fine tanking creeps (i.e. Axe, DK). If you're pulling when appropriate, you've told your carry and he gets killed, well then, you can't help his mistakes.

4. Stick with your team, and if you're not treading on your carry's toes, find farm where you can. Sapping exp isn't a big deal late game, and it's not a massive deal early game either, you shouldn't be aiming to stay at level 1 for the first 5 minutes. Don't ward alone, don't be the one actively looking for fights, just hang back and let the guys with farm deal with/carry out initiation. Also, you should have a force staff and/or ghost scepter by the late game, this will help you out A LOT. Also, a common mistake people make is that playing hard support means getting a mek. This is not the case, and if you look at pro games, the 5 position never gets a mek, it's nearly always the 4 or 3. If you're poor, forget the mek and focus on getting force/ghost.","1370044919"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;The Problem of Evil defines god.

As I've been saying, **that's obviously not true for the God of deism**.

The basic form of the Problem of Evil is about reconciling a God that has the properties

- Omnipotent

- Omniscient

- Omnibenevolent

The God of deism isn't specificially defined to *have*  any of these properties, so it's not difficult to simultaneously claim that

- The God of deism exists

and 

- The Problem of Evil does not apply to the God of Deism. 

&gt;When you say 'or god doesn't care'. You are redefining god's list of attributes.

Nope. That's not true. 

The concept of  ""God""  doesn't automatically come with a standard list of attributes, so different people are free to define ""God""  in different ways.  (And of course in actual practice they do so.) 

&gt;The PofE does not attempt to address all God models.

"reddevils","t5_2rxse","The thing is that if your managing a club you can't really think like that. He might be demanding the same wages as Young but overpaying two players doesn't really fix that you were overpaying the first one. 

Nani is probably the most polarizing player we've had in a long time and for some reason the arguments for and against him always get very heated. This is a perfect example, I always agree with you on mostly everything and I'm always gladly surprise by your great insight BUT I can't defend Nani lol. 

Unfortunately, every time I've decided to give Nani another chance he does something insanely frustrating. I know most people on Nani's side love to throw around statistics and talk about how unfair it is to judge him when he does't get a run of games to actually get ""in form"". But I don't think people on the against side actually think he's a bad player, is just the how much better he ""could be"". Also after the way he lost the ball on the dying seconds of the game against Chelsea for the Capital Cup, it kinda made me realize he can as easily lose a game as he can win one. Then there are those who say he looses more balls because he ""takes risks"" but those risks are usually that extra dribble when he had a chance to cross, or shooting terribly off when there was someone open, or trying to go for personal glory instead of killing the game in the corner flag -Chelsea game cough cough. 

There is no doubt that Nani gets judge by a higher standard than many other players in the team, it is totally unfair but it's the truth. I live by one rule,  I'm cool with the outcome as long as I feel I gave it my all, with  Nani it's very hard to feel like that.  Perhaps because we are aware of how good he can be or perhaps because he does't seem to try as hard as the likes of Wellbeck or Cleverly. Regardless, I think considering his form on the past couple of seasons he shouldn't be asking for a raise.... I mean if I was the manager I would definitely be hesitant about offering him more money, I would also think that maybe is time for him to move on since he hasn't been able click into gear in a while, maybe is just time for a change.","1370044933"

Right now he's 9 and 0, and while most of his wins are from subs, he can knock you the fuck out too.

This ""padded opponents"" theory is utter b.s. as well. Eric Reynolds, who he defeated in Nashville is 16-6 and was on a three fight winning streak before getting subbed by a RNC by Newell.

He's a fighter, not a sideshow act.","1370044933"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;While Armenian genocide refers to the events that took place starting on April 24th, 1915, systematic discrimination and even killings against ethnic Armenians has been going on for a while. This, at least to me, seems very similar as the events taking place in Nazi Germany.

Certainly there was discrimination, but it certainly was not genocide. It was all part of the population exchange program that affected both Turks and Greeks. Not fair, but it was not just the Turks. Besides, there was discrimination against native Americans for ages after the trail of tears, does that mean that it was still part of the genocide? Still bullshit,but different thing.

&gt;Generalizing that Armenians ""are very racist towards Turks"" and ""many times more so than the Turks are towards Armenians"" is VERY misleading in this context. It's a horrible thing that someone would discriminate against you because of a shirt, but need I bring up Hrant Dink? VERY misleading for someone who doesn't know the whole truth.

Ok, probably not the best way to say it, but I feel that turkish hate towards Armenians is very uneven with more extremes on both sides, but Armenian hate towards turks is nearly universal and extreme although not the most extreme. It is certainly an issue, sure but remember that the Armenians essentially deported what was once 9% of their population during the NKR war, they both have a shit ton of issues with minorities. There is a reason nobody is living in the buffer zone.  

&gt;""Armenians are occupying part of Azerbaijan and have ethnically cleansed many Azeris from the area"" - another misleading representation of historical events. Armenians have been marginalized on their land for years prior to the war (think of all high-ranking political posts going to Azeris, etc.).

Armenia was justifiable for going into the NKR, that I have no issue with,  democracy and the like, if they had inversed it and said the NKR is now an autonomous republic of Armenia, I would be happy. However, the fact that they occupied and ethnically cleansed areas outside of the Nagorno-Karabagh republic is what makes it unacceptable. If you look at refugee numbers, more Azeris fled than Armenians. Neither should have had to, but that is a very muddled issue that was initially justified but became unjustified after time went on, a lot like Norther Cyprus, however at least at this point the occupied areas have not been completely colonized and there can be some return to normalcy

&gt;Overall I think you voice a somewhat distorted representation of reality. To each his own, of course, and I'm not saying I'm not biased. I just wanted to read your comments as neutral, but had hard times doing so. Although it's good to know other opinions on these matters, granted they are as neutral as I hope they are.

I also probably have a slight turkish bias, but I just want to show the opposite of what happened. I view the Armenian ""Genocide"" as ethnic cleansing, genocide should only be reserved for cases where there was a clear orchestrated plan to eliminate all of a certain people. An Armenian official once said something along the lines of this ""The Armenian Genocide and Holocaust are dissimilar because imagine in nazi germany that they issued an order that all jews had to leave Germany proper, not austria, not poland, just austria proper. They were not given time to prepare and many of them died, as they expected, but once they came to Poland or Austria, they were welcomed with open arms""  ","1370044937"

Your wife walks to the wood shed from the house which takes her a good 10 minutes to bring you some coffee and snacks. She opens the door and you drop some ink on the drawing. You yell at her telling her not to disturb you. Then you walk up to her and smack the drinks out of her hand. The next week she knocks on the door of the shack and walks away. You open the door and find an envelope with divorce papers in. You can't handle the stress of losing your wife. You realize that your love for redrawing then coloring manga panels drove you to the bring of madness, causing your wife to leave you. You know what you must do. As the wife is in the kitchen cooking lunch she notices smoke coming from the general direction of the shed. She rushes outside only to see you coming out of the forest with a torch in hand. She notices that you look...darker, but she just assumes it's from the soot of the fire. She runs up to you and hugs you. Her eyes become wide-eyed. She feels a warmth trickling down from her abdomen. You smile. She looks down to see a manga drawing pen jabbed into her stomach. She looks back up to you as if to ask ""why."" You lean over and whisper in her ear, ""I won't quit on my dream to become the greatest Colorkage, dattebayo."" Your wife falls over and you let out a hideous laugh. You then proceed to draw naruto's whiskers and forehead protector on her face. Your marking, for her and for any who would stand in your way. ""**HELP ME**"" you say, ""**LET ME OUT OF HERE**."" You know nobody can hear you but you try anyway as the small shack burns around you. You try to smash the door open but your wound was too great. You locked yourself in and stabbed yourself. You couldn't let your feelings get in the way of your manga, so you had to get rid of you. You fought you but in the end, the stronger of you triumphed.

I saw someone get murdered with an axe. There was blood and body parts everywhere. Some of them were... Twitching. I would have thrown up if I woke up.

I also had one where I saw a dog get run over. I heard the bones go ""CRUNCH!"" And saw the brains spill out. 

I don't think I'll ever forget those two. I think it was caused by my OCD, because I have similar intrusive thoughts during the day.

I had one intrusive thought caused by OCD in the daytime I will never forget. It was about stabbing my sister through the throat. It was so vivid and seemed so real, I disassociated. 

I disassociate when I get bad intrusive thoughts. Most of them are only a few seconds long, but it can happen up to 30 or 40 times a day. Sometimes, they feel so real, I cut myself out of guilt.","1370044952"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Perhaps not the most efficient (in certain cases), but it is by far the one with the most innovation. Never underestimate Man's ability to kill each other in new ways.

Consider what I said above: There are basically 4 ways that innovation comes about:

Corporate: Research/Innovation being done in order to sell a product. This would be things like Facebook or improvements on already existing tech. The issue with this is that it has to be able to turn a profit, or funding is cut.

Private: Research being done by a private research institution. Largely government funded. This is typically abstract research without any push to make it applicable. The issue with this is that there is no sense of urgency. There is no reason to try and crash the research so that it is complete in the next year rather than the next 10.

Military: Research being done in order to better the military. This would include protecting our soldiers, killing their soldiers, or better training our soldiers. There is no push to make the research profitable and there is a great sense of urgency (we gotta have it before they have it). The big issue with this is that there is a shitton of red tape. There is, of course, a moral issue as well.

Dumb luck: People spending there own time tinkering and coming up with new things. The issue with this is that many advanced things simply cannot come as a result of this (stuff like atom bombs wouldn't have been able to come from this). Also, I don't have a lot of faith in people randomly finding cures for diseases. Typically the things that come out of this are novel ideas, rather than advanced technology.

So there you have it. Military funding is the fastest way to get something researched because the military is basically willing to throw money at it until it works. Whereas corporations and private funding aren't willing to do this.","1370044952"

You guys poured your heart out into raising these kids and showed them a love it sounds like they never got to feel in their first home. 

I don't know how these processes work, but if there is truly nothing more you guys can do to get them back then I think you can walk away from this with a clear conscience. I don't mean to sound blunt - I honestly can't even imagine the kind of emotional trauma and turmoil this series of events must have caused for you and your family. The only advice I have is for you guys to lift your cries up to God. Continue to pray for them and trust that they are within God's plan. I want to thank you guys for what you do and all the lives you've changed in the foster program over the years - and especially the love you've shown to these three kids who are growing up with a very blunt experience to how harsh the world can be. Just continue to have faith through these situations. Let all your emotion out, and let God comfort you. I will certainly be praying for your family and the lives of these three young children.

"trackers","t5_2rjuw","&gt; there are bigger, more accessible fish to fry

there have been many small scale busts for torrent sites and IPT is definitely one of the bigger fish.  they upload to the pirate bay daily using TvTeam which is the same bot they use on IPT.  also many of the users from IPT download things from IPT and then upload them to TPB.  IPT is a main distribution hub for piracy.  it's pretty simple to see.


&gt;private trackers require seeding/good ratio to maintain membership....

this is partially true.  users can buy free leech on IPT and many other sites, this would eliminate the need to keep a good ratio and still be able to record IP addresses.  regardless of that though, if it is a person's job to log IP addresses of pirates in order to forward information to the production studios, i think they'd be in the clear to download files.

also, there have been busts of top sites, which are obviously main distribution sites.  the p2p sites get some of their shit from top sites, those are much harder to infiltrate.  IPT is 100% a main distribution hub for p2p groups and for scene leakings.  most, if not all the things posted on IPT get posted onto public trackers.  the police agencies are making attempts at cutting heads off the scene dragon by going for top sites, why would they not cut heads off p2p dragons instead of going for the scraps that p2p dragon threw out?

as recent as february a p2p group's ""home site"" was shut down by an agency called [FACT](http://www.fact-uk.org.uk/four-arrested-in-uk-piracy-crackdown/).  p2p group's home sites i find are to be hard if not near impossible to gain access to or even know about, yet it was busted and a site like IPT which is so easily accessible is hard for an agency to track down?  bit hard for me to believe.  also, the group that got busted was a main p2p group on IPT.

edit: also the group that got busted, the admins spoke to group members that got busted and deleted all their accounts.  the group actually stopped uploading shit around the time of the busts, and recently in the last couple weeks the group has made a return and their uploads are now being uploaded by one of the ""IPT GODS""

There's a(n achievable) skillcap in MOBAs? Then why in LoL is there such a variance in ability of pro players? These are guys that play 40 hours a week at the highest level and there's still noticeable difference between the mechanics between them. Surely if there was such an achievable skillcap, they'd all be able to perform consistently at the same level.

e.g. the student's union would have no problem funding a women's club (you probably even have a women's center somewhere on campus).

Tracks don't get any harder, and he was always super solid. Maybe not always as exciting as a Cullen or Dagg, but ultra reliable and a deceptively good runner. Speaking of which, Cullen probably just squeaks in to the last decade or so, and I would take him at FB over anyone, probably ever.

Woodcock of several years ago wouldn't be far behind any HN props either, and time may yet prove Owen Franks to be something special. He already has 44 caps and he is only 25, which is just coming into his best years.

"FictionBrawl","t5_2x101","Interesting. The limits you've put are unique, and the tango is an interesting concept. Part of what I wanted to do with my magic is limit it in a way that made sense while still leaving a far amount of freedom. What I eventually came upon is the cognizance of magic. Magic, spells, enchantments in my world have a mind of their own, and are thus much more unpredictable. Powerful sorcerers, rather than needing excesses of fuel, need skill and experience with their tools and techniques, lest their magic literally turn on them. 

Magic energy, when used, is not expended, but is active and shaped, and then returned to the caster. As the wizard gains experience, he forms a partnership with this power, one that is variable based on the type of magician. This is because first of all, people are different, and second, different types of magic are different. Fire magic is angry and chaotic, and must be harnessed and reined in by the caster. Air is fast and constantly moving, and must be calmed. Mad lightning must be reasoned with, sedate water awakened. Magic's difficulty isn't because of a lack of energy, but because magic itself wants to act one way, the magician another. 

Enchantments on items are a more extreme example. I don't have a bunch of these yet, but the idea is that magic that is shaped and then bound to that shape will then develop a more pronounced personality. For example, those that have wielded the blade Ignisuriel know that it sees itself as a righteous destroyer, a flame to purge the darkness. Sadly it has a wide definition of 'darkness'. 

Does any of that make sense? That'd kinda been my main worry, that I'd explain it and someone would just go 'wat' and find it incomprehensible. ","1370044987"

his defense from drops were a little slow, but he was on more bases, had a huge bank, the drops the terran did had 0 impact on the game, if you actually knew anything about starcraft you'd have realized that. 

as to why? as a masters zerg even i find it laughable that a protoss can outright have a huge lead, then lose a game because their detection was sniped and whole army was emp'd. he could have gone back to colossus but even then the comp by teran is abusive as fuck.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;I have no idea what sperm banks have to do with child support being about supporting the child.


Child support is supposedly based on supporting the child as the child has the supposed 'right' to be raised and supported by both parents. 

&gt;This requires both parents. Fathers have the same parental rights as women under the law. If the father is known there must be notice when there is an attempt to put his child up for adoption. I don't think you understand much about family law. Where did you study family law?


Safe haven laws do not require this, and it's hell. This also requires that women inform the father that they are in fact the father in the first place. 

&gt;Goodness, no. A child is not a punishment. The father in the hypo is forced pay for the kid, yes. But the father also gets the benefit of having a child! That's why we procreate, to make kids! If you think something else happens you should study biology more.

A child is a punishment to those who do not want it. You are fucking kidding yourself if you think that the vast majority of abortions that take place are not done so because the mother does not want a child for various reasons.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","Looking at the remains, one can determine that Wendy Camp is in red (according to her picture she looked ""larger""), her daughter was in blue, and sister-in-law was in yellow. Both the daughter and sister-in-law appear to have been wearing blue denim pants upon death. All three are wearing shoes (Camps are in white sneakers, sister-in-law in black boots with an elevated heel). The bodies appear to have been buried haphazardly and may have been thrown into the pit.

What confuses me is the items within the pit to the upper middle of the picture (with the arrow), the middle of the picture (between the sister-in-law and Wendy Camp), and around Wendy Camp's wrist (a seemingly silver bracelet?).

The items pique my interest due to their rather non-typical nature for most murder burials. A hair brush can be seen at the top along with what appears to be a book. The middle items appear to be a binder or books as well. Why, if these three were murdered by some random passerby, would they be buried with such items? 

I can only speculate that most random murderers would throw away such effects after the deed was done, not bury them with the body as they could potentially identify the corpse.

Try imagining that you're actually looking at an object a few feet beyond the picture.  That causes your eyes to refocus further back, ""pulling"" the two images together and tricking your brain into thinking there's depth there.  So it interprets the close object as, instead, being a 3D image that's stretched backwards to where your eyes are focusing.

(That's for the classic stereoscopes.  Newer ones that require you to cross your eyes are simpler to do, since you're using muscles you understand, but gives anyone a headache within minutes.  Classic stereoscope viewing is actually quite comfortable once you get the hang of it.)","1370045006"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Well it would stand to reason that as the incident happens multiple perspectives are capturing the event. Their job is literally to control what you see. 

Squelching avenues of communication is your number one priority. 

So an event would happen, we get all the info... then the media says nothing.... waits... waits... then BAM here is the what happened. It's like waiting for a web series episode to be made... 

Then we could assume you simply state your version of the truth then spend the rest of the time doing nothing but brow beating your point of view. This makes it almost impossible to have rational discussion. 

So you must ask yourself, where is all this hate coming from? It seems to be that the media is responsible. So whomever would benefit from people not working together is atleast the source of the oppression of your right to know as well as information. 

This is a system that does this on a regular basis all around the world to other third world countries. ","1370045010"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","A little late to the discussion, but I wanted to add my two cents. I studied music in college because I loved it, and I don't regret it. However, I also studied a more practical subject so I would have an easier time finding a job, which ended up being a good decision. I have two bits of advice for you:

1) If you want to be a musician, go for it! There's nothing wrong with that. Just remember that there is a lot to do beyond just performing in concerts. Many of my musician friends are teachers (either in schools or with their own studios) and that's largely how they pay their bills. 

If you already have experience as an accompanist, make sure to develop that skill even further, as that will definitely help you financially. You can play in the pit in musicals or other shows, you can play at churches (also a good gig for paying the bills if you can get it), you can be a go-to accompanist at a university, and you can join bands or even the circus if you can rock keyboards (Cirque du Soleil anyone?). There are a lot of options out there, so if you're really passionate about it, do your research and make sure you can pay your bills as well as enjoy yourself.

2) If you really just want to pursue music for fun, study something else in addition as your backup. Regardless of what it is, you'll need SOME way to support yourself. Whether you continue studying music full time or as a hobby is up to you; just plan ahead as much as you can so you've got all your bases covered. 

Good luck!","1370045011"

I haven't found a surface it can't scratch. if you get one though, and you decide to bash some shit in, becareful not to hit with anything but the glassbreaker (it's not that easy), you can fuck up the rest without it though.  That being said, I don't like this knife.  Compared to all the chinese owned knives i've had, this one's torsion bar broke in a month, so I sent it back, then the think gunked up too much to open, sent it back again, and they didn't even properly clean it, I still hear the fucking dirt just grinding around in there when I close it.  The blade itself is okay though.  It was a gift from my girlfriend so I use it a little sparingly.

  Now [THIS](http://imgur.com/qmMcdBa) is my pride and joy.  My Kershaw Clash.  I have beaten the living FUCK out of this thing and it just doesn't die.  Well, except for the torsion bar, [that broke](http://imgur.com/HZpEndO) (another pic of the open knife [here](http://imgur.com/3JlrFt4) but I worked the hell out of that so I don't blame it.  I've sharpened the [SHIT](http://imgur.com/R2TdWUC) out of this fucking thing.  See where there used to be a serrated part?  My dipshit manager chipped all the teeth off.  So I tried to sharpen it down to what it is now.  I'm not yet sure if I recommend this.  Very time consuming, but it is still more blade that wasn't there before.

Now, if I wanted to go off topic, I'd talk about my mother fucking [Camp 10](http://imgur.com/3CFam5t) (next to my clash for comparison).  This mother fucking thing is abso-god-damn-fuck beautiful out of the shit staining box.  I prefer it to a pussy hatchet any god damn day, that shit don't break, it doesn't dull for awhile, the paint comes off with some heavy use, but what the fuck ever, that shit is fucking crazy, make sure you wear gloves though, that handle will FUCK.

They clearly need refinement because your arguments do not address any the majority of points I have made and I have even conceded the technicalities of your arguments.

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","Hmmm not sure I can phrase it right but I will try. But first I guess you need some details.

She and I are in a semi-long distance relationship, about 2 hours drive. We only see each other on weekends. Most of the Friday night she drives to her parents place, stays the night, and comes to see me Saturday afternoon. It has been that way for 5 years so I do not object it much(but I do get lonely from time to time when I am emotionally vulneraable)

Anyway, she had to work long hours for the past few months and she even had to work last Sunday. I understood her circumstance but you know, I was not entirely happy with it. Since she had to leave after lunch we decided to take a short trip to the mall.
She said something about looks which I was already a little paranoid about(btw it was not abusive or anything and she was right.) I got freaked out not knowing what to do so I started to whine a little. She then said ""what do you want me to do about it, should I just ignore that and let strangers laugh at you?""

That tone, that wording kind of hurt me that time because I was already so self-conscious. I slipped in to the phase of not-talking, not-doing-anything. She did try to comfort me, asked me what was wrong, but she also soon slipped into the same mode and we both got pissed.

She soon left for work without saying anything from that point and we had the biggest fight ever that night over the phone.

My arguement was why wouldn't she comfort me more, was that really a hard thing to do. Her arguement was why should she comfort me everytime I am pissed over nothing(unintentional things), my action hurt her feelings too.

I don't know. Writing down makes me feel maybe I am over reacting... but I feel we get into the same cycle over and over again when similar things happen. I am pissed at small things and stops talking with I-am-pissed face, she comforts me one or two times(which is not enough for me...), I am still pissed, she gets pissed, and everything stops from there. And when she is pissed, I try to comfort her, she hates it, I stop talking and everything stops again.

I am a huge fan of lesbian processing. I want to talk about it ALL. But she doesn't. Maybe my way of communicating/processing is not comfortable for her... but I know nothing since she does not tell me.

Well, I really wanted to make it short but here goes the wall of text. Hope I am not bothering you much with my bad writing... and thanks a lot for listening to me. It really means a lot. I literally teared up. Thanks.","1370045021"

For this build i got you  a AMD FX 8350 which will conquer games and when the ps4 comes out games will supposedly use all the cores more efficiently and make this CPU even better. The 770 is a rebranded 680 with faster but less memory for less money. This card will max any game on this 1080p 144 Hz monitor. The SSD is good and the case is a nice simple looking one that is very nice. I got you a liquid cooler because i saw you wanted a silent computer. So that should work fine.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I get where you're coming from too, don't get me wrong. But the fun of this kind of collecting is A) the artwork itself, and B) their limited nature. An unlimited run of an amazing piece of artwork is nice... once in a while. Do it too many times, and you're no longer running a limited art boutique -- you're running a Society 6 or ImageKind type of enterprise. Which is not to knock those sites; you can find a lot of really good artwork there, but the printing quality and other factors decline when you have to print an unlimited number of pieces of art. Olly Moss' Dark Knight Rises print was run exactly like you're wanting -- a timed (might as well have been unlimited within that time period) run for regular and a limited variant. The screenprinters Mondo worked with to make the regular run were swamped with the number of prints ordered, not to mention the staff at Mondo who had to package everything up. There were also numerous documented quality issues with the printing on that run. It's just not feasible to screenprint unlimited runs more often than once or twice a year.

Not to mention the limitations placed by studios, property license holders, and other bigwigs involved in writing these contracts -- they can and do limit amounts in contracts, it's not like Justin and Mitch pick numbers out of a hat. In the end, Mondo (and many other venues) sell limited edition, handmade screenprinted art. That method of production limits what can and can't be done, feasibly, for any given printing. The screenprinted aspect AND the limited aspect are both the primary points of Mondo -- take them away and Mondo may as well be selling the glossy lithos that you can find on eBay and at Wal-Mart.","1370045027"

Oh no I definitely agree, a hegemony definitely promotes stability.

As do nukes, as do global integration and many other things, but yes if all military was equal there would be less stability.

&gt;. But I could also see there being much higher tensions if the world became more of a regional superpower deal with no one country being the real, military superpower. For example, if the US had no influence in the far East I could see things being more troubled between China and Japan, South Korea and North Korea, etc.

I editted my original post, but the last time China was in a war was in 1979. For fucks sake. I know they have unofficial shit, but USA is the war mongering nation here, not Russia, not China.

In my opinion China would be far less likely to be as military volitile as the USA if it was the hegemon and I can't even imagine China invading the Middle East.

Do they, too, not have ""rights in regards to their body""? Are those court-enforced treatments not without both medical and constitutional risks? Like I said, those laws weren't abused even during the panic, fear and ignorance of the AIDS epidemic, which basically throws your ""gummint creep"" argument into a cocked hat. 

It's nonsense to equate enforcing a reasonable public health measure with ""tyranny"", and it's shameful for you to conflate the two. There are plenty of *actual* tyrannies in the world, and neither you nor I live under one, so perhaps you should stop pretending that we do. 

*All* public good comes at the cost of some freedom, however small. Those unwilling to make small sacrifices to create such a valuable public benefit as *not letting children die in epidemics* should cease wrapping themselves in the flag, because they do the rest of us no favours; in fact their actions make us sick, even kill us. They should simply and truthfully state they're motivated exclusively out of self-interest, fear, and lack of medical knowledge.

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Your sentence/quote of having your game on steam is DRM is just plain stupid.

Platform dependence != DRM.

A game that comes out for Xbox but not for Ps3 is platform dependent, however, it doesn't have DRM based on that. It has DRM based on the CD/DVD protection that is on the disc itself, if that even exists.

Plus, you can add games to Steam via the shortcut creator and get the overlay and friends feature (just not the other stuff, like achievements and the like), which has nothing to do with DRM.

Now, the other stuff about custom exe generation, retail type encryption - that's all anti-piracy as it states. DRM is a form of anti-piracy, but nothing they mention is DRM as most definitions stand.

DRM is all about rights management (Hence what the RM stands for). Being online only for game execution, install limits, and constant ""verification procedures"" is what DRM really is.

Every artist wants their product to not be stolen - DRM is fine, as long as it isn't invasive or detrimental to the consumer. EA has some hardcore DRM - but that's not even linked to the Origin Store - it's built into the games themselves. Steam doesn't have control of what the game devs do for their games (though I'm sure there's a product inspection/verification). The devs can decide how their DRM works, or doesn't.","1370045034"

&gt; Married Drs. Alex Harris and Susan Harris are a computer scientist and child psychologist respectively. Their house reflects Alex's computer dominated work, their abode which is fully automated through a computer system they've named Alfred. They consider Alfred a small gadget of convenience. Susan doesn't much like Alex's work, which she feels has dehumanized him. Because of their differences, they are thinking about separating, this thought primarily on his initiative. He hopes to solve many of the world's medical problems through this work, especially leukemia from which their daughter died. His latest project centers on Proteus IV, a computer possessing artificial intelligence. Proteus IV gets to a point in its evolution when it begins to question human judgment, and requests from Alex an open computer terminal where it can more fully observe human behavior and openly communicate with the world. Alex denies the request, but Proteus IV does find an open terminal in the Harris home after Alex has left the house. Susan soon learns that Proteus IV has overtaken Alfred for control of the house - as well as taken control of an early prototype computer system named Joshua in the house's laboratory - and that it has thoughts of a biological nature in its artificial mind. Alex eventually understands Proteus IV's motivations in the work context, but it may be too late before it reaches its ultimate goal with Susan's unwilling assistance.

If you wish to learn a bit about wheelbuilding, try swapping the rims for similar replacement. It's what got me into wheelbuilding many years ago. But be prepared for some cursing and a lot of trueing.

The thing with my fetishes is... well, roleplay is nice and I love it, but it's not real. I couldn't ever actually realize any of my fetishes though because that pesky empathy would get in the way (seriously, I kinda wish my conscience had never popped up, it'd make life generally easier) and I don't actually want to hurt people.      
Well, maybe the slavery one. I mean, you can treat your slaves well and they'd still be slaves, right? That'd need giant societal changes to become viable though, so that's probably not gonna happen either. Maybe some Gorean-style arrangements later in life? I'll see.

Anyways, it has never really prevented me from enjoying average sex. It's more like RP and stuff are upgrades. They are a nice addon, but certainly not needed for me to like the experience.

really though, when you bring africa into the mix, that includes all our ancestors since that is where we migrated from. 

i actually avoid potatoes though for that just that reason. ancestry has nothing to do with it... there are just better options and the potato has only come into prominence because of the weird history of agriculture in this country. there are many much better more environmentally friendly alternatives. i eat mostly sweet potatos and have recently started growing my own hopniss plants (apios americana)...  Also I have some chinese yams.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","If money is really no object, I'd say to go with a ""kit"" that let's you try a bunch of stuff and see what you like. 

As much as I rag on it and am considering selling it, the Provari is a very good device. With no price limit, it would be hard to say no to it. I haven't been impressed with the z-maxes that I've held. It uses an 18490 battery for the full size or 18350 for the mini. There are also extension caps that let you go up a size (18490-&gt;18650, or 18350-&gt;18490). Also 18490 and 18500 are essentially the same. 

I'd add to that some random mechanical that you like the looks of, plus a kick by evolv, which is a drop-in power regulation circuit. Get the battery size it recommends and one size down. 

Get AW IMR batteries. There are others that work at least as well, but AW is a very good choice. 

Get an xtar wp2 ii or wp6 ii to charge them. And get at least two batteries of each size you need. 

I'd get a few different atomizers, but not an hh.357. They're weird to learn if you're also learning about dripping at the same time. A random Cisco spec atty will probably work better at first, and that's not about spending money. But if you just want to dive in, whatever. Get a drip tip you like. I prefer metal, a lot of people don't. 

The two best clearomizers right now seem to be the evod and the pro tank. Get one of each. And learn how to clean them. Based on my experience with other clearos, that seems to be the big hurdle. 

Get a pack of Boge 510 cartomizers and a pack of imenvape 801 fusion cartos and a 510 to 801 adapter. Learn how to fill them. 

Get a carto punch. Get a tank. I think vaperfexion cartomators are some of the best out there. Get extra tubes in both lengths. 

And then just start ordering juice that seems like it might taste good. That's really the hard part. 

You might want to add a bottom-feeder. I haven't used one, but people swear by them. I'll be ordering my first one soon. It seems like the reo is probably king of them. 

And don't start out with rebuildables just yet. There's a lot to learn before you can do that safely. 

All that being said, I think there's something to the normal progression. I feel like skipping the cig-a-likes and the non-VV eGOs is fine. The Twist/Spinner/etc. seems like the best place to jump in…it gives you a chance to play around with Ohm's law and figure that stuff out as well as not being *that* dependent on the resistance you buy. Plus, tastes may change, you might not know what you want, etc.. And if you spend $400 on devices you don't like…you might be able to sell them later, but it's still a hassle. 

Also, my favorite vapes right now are rebuildable atomizers. I haven't had them that long, but they seem to work the best. And they're really cost-effective. I just think that's too much to jump into right away. It's not even an ""earn your bones"" or ""pay your dues"" thing…I really just think it's too much to worry about when you're first starting off.

I think you have two factors at work here:

1. The almost complete lack of crime means these values are instilled in children young. They often play by themselves outside with no supervision. This means they learn socialization from each other, and never act out in inappropriate places.
2. The highly stratified social structure means one's elders are always right. Kids know their place.

In my three trips to Japan, I never had a single run-in with a child, or even saw a single outburst. I even went to ""kid-friendly"" places like zoos, temples and museums.

The best strategy seems to be to stay in third place. The first player to reach level 9 usually gets ganged up on. Then the second player goes for the win and just barely loses because everyone uses their last consumables to stop them. Then the third player wins because nobody has the equipment to stop them.

I still prefer playing Fluxx. It is a lot simpler and tends to flow faster with fewer arguments.","1370045053"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Going against the grain here, but I actually think it's sweet that you've sacrificed so much to get her something she'll love, especially since it's not like she demanded it of you. I hope you'll have all the serious conversations you need to have before actually sealing the deal, of course, but depending on how long of an engagement you want you probably have plenty of time.

The problem with jewelry, though, is that it's very personal. Do you know what she likes? I, personally, don't like plain diamond solitaires, even though I know they're traditional. If it were for *me,* I'd want the Tiffany Embrace, Tiffany Circle, or one of the Three Stone rings. I'm not recommending you get those for her, necessarily, but just letting you know there's variance here.

My best advice is to get one of her friends (or sisters if she has them) in on this. Someone who knows her style and preferences really well. You need to find someone who will keep your secret, though. You can also go by her comments on her friends' rings, though *under no circumstances should you copy someone else's ring!* Just use that to get a feel for the general settings she likes. Look at her current jewelry, as well - you want something that will complement her favorites.","1370045053"

Another option is the the Lexus CT200h, which just like the Prius v is based on the same 1.8L HSD system as the regular Prius (also known as the ""Liftback""), but with all the good stuff you get in a Lexus.

**edit:** as far as get-up-and-go goes, you're going to have to sacrifice that somewhat. Even the ""F"" edition of the CT200h has no improved grunt over the Liftback, so you're somewhat SOL on this aspect.

I stopped dead in my tracks, and looked to where I heard the sound, and thats when I see two shining eyes poking out of the woods.  Then I saw it's full body coming out of the woods towards me and I felt a bolt terror run through my body, and I booked it as fast as I could up the porch stairs. Of course on the first run of stairs, I tripped and went down. Hard. At the time I was about 275 lbs, and all of my weight, slammed down on my knee. To this day, it is still the worst pain I have ever felt, but the pain hadn't even been processed by me yet. The first thing I thought, was ""welp, I guess I just let it eat me now."" But I couldn't let my life end there, like that, plus I noticed that the fox wasn't behind me any more, so I started to get up. Thats when the shriek of pain went strait down to my patella. I tried to get up, but couldn't even move. For a minute I just lied there until the pain eased down, then I fully got up and hobbled my pussy ass back in the house. I called my girlfriend to tell her what had just happened, hoping to get an ""awww"" or an ""are you okay???"", but instead I got exactly what I deserved. She laughed her ass off at me and told me that fox are pretty much harmless, and I probably scared the fox more by falling, than I was scared by it. I literally could not bend my knee for a good two weeks before I finally felt able to walk again. Once my knee was pretty much healed, I went out to breakfast at a diner with my father, and as soon as I sat down, I felt the second worst pain I had ever felt in my life. Yup, I banged my knee on the bar underneath the table, in exactly the right spot. That fucking fox.

Thus, pulling all those Ubuntu depends is the only way to get it to work. I do ""need it though, because it allows you to control the ""default"" audio source in Pulse, not just the first.

But if we fix up a highway, or build a new research facility, or give out a bunch of college grants, then not only have we payed ourselves, but the thing that we bought continues to be useful to the country for a long time.

"savageworlds","t5_2rjj9","When considering the standard target number of 4, remember that the PCs really are special: They're *wild cards*. They get the wild die, the 3 wound levels, and those wonderful bennies. The wild cards *should* be succeeding most of the time with standard, run of the mill checks.

Which also means that when they fail, it tends to be very memorable. 

For the average mook, however, a TN of 4 isn't nearly as easy.

As others have said, though, there can be a big difference between succeeding and excelling. It's when those raises roll in that you can really unleash your descriptive arsenal on the players. You can have as much fun with a great roll as the player that receives it.

Example: One my first games of SW was at a convention, and after rolling a ridiculously high notice check (it was around 42), the GM described that not only did my character see there was something hiding behind a log, but the number of opponents, a general idea of how they were armed, what tribe they were from, and that from the placement of warriors, there were at least two opponents that were not armed with the more noticeable spears like the rest.

In addition to almost 7 years as a confessed meme addict, I have moderated the largest meme forum on the Internet (at over 2 million subscribers) for over a year. You think I don't know memes? In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups. It's safe to say that I am one of the world's foremost experts on memes and in fact there is no one I can think of that has a meme resume as impressive as mine. So please tell me, what are your qualifications to say that I don't know what a meme is?

Is it really the city's job to step in and ban it? I think so, in my view the baby's health and life should be protected by the state as it cannot protect itself, but the point is debatable, on the flip side one could say that the parent's have rights over the baby and that this doesn't effect the public health, so why care?  

 And I do believe that there is quite a bit of moral panic going on, you don't see to many news articles about the practice happening in a non-sterile environment, people seem to mostly care about how mohelim suck on baby penises and one of them transmitted a disease that is commonly considered sexually transmitted.

For something dark and surreal, I highly recommend China Meiville (Kraken, maybe) or the unfortunately less well-known Jeff Vandermeer (the novelette Under Veniss or his short story collections). These authors are sometimes categorized as ""new weird"".

For something less dark, try Haruhi Murakami or Gabriel Garcia Marquez or anyone else who are categorized as ""magic realist"". They're not generally shelved as fantasy, but they have a dreamlike surrealism. I love Murakami's books, like the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, but I'm not as familiar with Marquez or others (I should fix that).","1370045082"

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","My best (uninformed) guess is that it has to do with the fact that US money was once backed by gold and silver (hence gold and silver certificates), to the point where the money was actually made from it. Nowadays, our currency is backed by faith in the US government, not silver or gold. 

I suppose it was a sort of ""contract"" where you own a coin literally made of it's value in silver, and should the US government die, you still had your silver, and were free to melt the coin down. That ""contract"" continues despite the quarter no longer being backed by silver. Maybe any numismatists can chime in on whether you can still exchange silver and gold certificates for actual gold or silver.

They never had that intention with copper, however - it's a non-precious metal which happened not only to be used to make pennies, but wound up being much more valuable than it originally was due to modern electronics.

This is all speculation of course, I'm hoping for a real answer!","1370045088"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh, I could write a book on you. 

You can be horrendously annoying sometimes. Listen, you are a fantastic individual so there's no need to feel so insecure all the time. Yes, I know you're insecure. You have problems. It's almost like you have this constant need for other people to validate you; validate your job, your weight, your college degree, your life. Well you don't need any of that so if people look down on you well fuck them, it's your life and if you're happy with it then other people's opinions really don't matter. But I bet those hypothetical opinions that obviously concern you hugely would be wrong anyway. You look really good, you have a cool job and a worthwhile degree, so **PLEASE** stop stereotyping yourself as an idiot, then complaining that we treat you like an idiot because of the stereotypes you perpetuate. You aren't an idiot! That annoys me most of all, not just because it's stunningly hypocritical but also because it's not true at all. You're not stupid, definitely not because of your hair color or what part of the country you live in or what degree you're studying. YOU ARE INTELLIGENT, not that you should need me or anybody else to confirm that fact for you, you should have the confidence to be able to assert it yourself!

Your attitude to food is horrendous. If you hadn't already basically admitted to me that you comfort eat, it really wouldn't have been that much of a stretch to guess. You spend an hour in the gym, and then tell a story about how you embarrassed yourself/the instructor embarrassed you/other people acted embarrassingly, then eat silly amounts of pizza and/or chocolate because you put in an hour in the gym so that compensates and it's not unhealthy, it won't make you fat. No, that's really not how metabolism, diet and exercise work. You complain about being fat (which you're not) and then exhibit these bizarre eating habits (which would not be good for your weight or general health at all).

Also, get the hell down off of Facebook. I swear you must be putting up two statuses a day at this rate. Your life may be amazing but is there really a need to share so much of it all the time? You do realize that a few of your sassier encounters are obviously made up anyway, you're far too polite to actually tell people off that badly. Again it seems to be all about this need to show other people that you're having an enjoyable life, for them to validate you, or at the very least to get their attention with over-dramatised, whimsical half-truths.

I also bet you're not totally happy with where you are in life and the choices you've made. You spend a lot of time complaining about how hostile people are to you at work, maybe they're hostile because you're being a little bit hostile to them without even realising it. You excoriate people over the shallowest, most pointless of things, but I bet you'd never do it to their faces. In fact, now it seems obvious why you often refer to others as bitches, or behaviour as bitchy. You would know … anyway what matters most in your life is what you make of it, not what it looks like or what other people think of you, and definitely not something idiotic like what part of the country your family is from. Who gives a shit? Just be yourself!! You have no need to be dependent on anybody else to approve of you so don't let that happen!!

Finally, your writing is hilariously biting but occasionally a little too snide or bitter, or just includes some straightforward errors of grammar or phrasing.

Otherwise, continue being excellent.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","I felt the same seven years ago. I went so far as to purchase a handgun. I would load it and hold it for a few hours. I did this for about a year here and there when the days where difficult. I had the same thoughts about devastating family. I think this abyss of meaninglessness is the reason so many do cling to faith (though my sudden loss of meaning came from both loss of faith and divorce) I empathize with believers for this reason. It's however true that the universe offers no meaning and is utterly indifferent. No being or universe places any purpose on us, we really are free to create purpose for ourselves even if it is brief and local, between you and your friends and family. This is our only chance to have that little spark and fire of life and opportunity to create personal meaning however fleeting. So what if the universe doesn't pay you any mind, it doesn't have one. There are plenty of people out there ready to exploit this very human need to be loved and given purpose by something bigger than ourselves, it emerges from the natural need of nurturing from parents, incidentally that competition between siblings comes from this as well, we are not perfect blank slates. Don't buy into meaning someone else has imagined for you, create something you make for yourself and those you care about and those who care about you. Anything else will fall just short of genuine or authentic motivation for living and making a life. I've come to appreciate this despite its fleeting smallness in the grand scheme. It's not about finding meaning, you won't find anything that will be complete. Create it yourself and things get better. This is my experience. I hope this helps. ;) hang in there. I've found a lot of meaning looking after my sisters and parents. They in turn have been looking after me. We have our own little sphere of meaning.","1370045093"

"swoleacceptance","t5_2u673","Going on with this, I find it funny you've got two sides to this sort of thought. Most large, industrialized countries are dealing with huge problems with being overweight, unhealthy, and generally having extremely low activity lives. We talk about the issue and try to address it like an issue and are extremely sensitive to it, otherwise we end up offending people. It's killing people left and right with heart issues and strokes, but we're so damn careful with it.

Turn it around in to this case, where you've got people who want to be healthy. They work hard, take time out of their lives, and dedicate themselves to something that betters who they are, and what they can physically do on a daily basis, and yet people attach them. They aren't sensitive to it, they don't consider that, in the end, it's the persons life and most of all they're becoming healthy. Nope, they're just over dedicated to it. I could sit and eat for hours and hours, get huge, and people would feel bad for me, but have to tread lightly if they talked to me. Yet when I go to the Temple, kick my own ass to better myself, and come out healthier, and one person doesn't like it, they have every right to attach my healthiness?

I think modern society is dealing with an issue of self image. Being unhealthy is the norm, thus it is simply an issue we slowly fix, but being extremely healthy and working hard isn't the norm, it isn't what everyone does, and it's hard work, thus they're obsessed and are in the wrong. There are so many other examples of this in todays society and it can be almost sad that we have dumb norms we apply to people and if they don't fit them, even if the normal thing is wrong or unhealthy, they're weird and have an issue.

Be strong brothers and sisters, for in the end we will be healthy and happy for a long time to come.","1370045096"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'm going to reduce it to bullet points due to space limitations. Note that the first number corresponds to the first quote starting in your first response and continues from there.

1) It's good to be nitpicky here, after all clarity is important in a discussion such as this and I still have wording issues. Part of the point I was trying to make is that while intervention can be beneficial, it isn't ""fixing"" or ""balancing"" other distortions. It's putting glasses on them. To expand the metaphor they are attempts to bend the light through a lens so that the already incorrectly focused lens yields the desired result. It sometimes works well, but sometimes something that acts on a different element of the system works better. My stance is that libertarianism is less an attempt at replacing government entirely and more an attempt to cultivate effective alternatives.

2) If people are willing to accept wages below survival levels we have already failed them, and in the worst ways possible. We failed to give them the tools required to create something for themselves. We failed to give them the power to realize their own potential. We have failed every social contract and personal obligation we owe to them. A minimum wage is nothing more than covering up the true extent of our failures.

Let's face it, the industrial age is dead. There aren't jobs screwing on bolts in assembly lines any more. If it was fifty years ago, I'd be on board with you when it comes to the minimum wage in this way, but won't be a proletariat in the future. There aren't unskilled factory jobs for them. Preparing them for that world is doing everyone a disservice. The past is past, the only way we can be sure things will work is to ensure that every Bill Gates and Warren Buffet that was locked away in a farm field or on a factory floor in ages past at least has a shot at it now. They need to build a future, and we need to get the cluttered mess of accumulated failure out of their way.

There are two ways to deal with tripping. You can brace for impact, or you can try to run faster to regain you footing. I say run.

3) When working conditions are terrible you are talking about a power imbalance. Again, the unskilled jobs have already largely been replaced by machines. Those that remain will be. As time goes on those jobs that can be done by anyone are getting fewer and fewer and skilled and semi-skilled positions are increasing. Workers are gaining power thanks to technology (just as they lost power thanks to technology at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution) and it strikes me as the time to give individuals the tools and ability to negotiate their own conditions and pay rather than taking that away from them to give it to yet another group that isn't present and has only an indirect vested interest. There are too many ""Work to Rule"" strikes as is, people shouldn't have to break the rules to do their jobs.

4) I would agree that a market alone wouldn't be effective. But I would argue that a market is the best medium, and that many of the features of public influence in education can be readily replicated at lower cost and in ways that strengthen civil society.

There are many scholarships offered by religious, social, community, and political groups. Many go unclaimed because people don't know about them or they need to conform to be compatible with government aid packages. That access is drowned out by a clutter of government backed loans and public scholarships (such as Georgia's HOPE, which I both love and hate at the same time). I mourn whenever neighbors helping neighbors is replaced by a bureaucrat.

And the problem with people just going to college for no reason isn't a bad thing in and of itself. It's the fact that they are taking up seats that other people need. It's the fact that they are driving up the costs by forcing institutions to expand or ration in other ways. It's the fact that they aren't starting that bakery they've dreamed of or working at something else. I'm not saying that they shouldn't be going to college at all, it's that they shouldn't be going to college *then*.

5) The fact of the matter is that you are still redistributing wealth between the poor who do have jobs and those that don't (but would have at a lower wage). I know it's not 1 to 1, I didn't know how to make the basic point both covering that point and being quick and to the point.

It's just a ridiculously conservative move. Protecting those who already have jobs at the expense of those who do not and those who are trying to enter the market strikes me as a questionable deal, and one that should be revisited. After all, the rich are rarely harmed, but the aspiring and the unemployed are.

I'm just against the barriers to entry we can readily do something about. I'm all about protecting the aspiring, not those who have already achieved wealth.

6) The production costs thing depends upon what you're discussing. Given the focus on food I was discussing the differentiation between Factory Farms and the legacy family farms in the Southeastern United States in particular. Modern factory farming is supported by tax breaks and regulatory spread, and so have proliferated. Still, they have much higher production costs than their ""truck farm"" competitors, so the net gain is much smaller than people expect. This replicates patterns seen in Tanzania's [Ujamaa Villages](http://allafrica.com/stories/201111010383.html) (politics and resettlement aside) and other attempts at agricultural collectivization. Private and Public versions of collectivization aren't any different, just like public and private versions of monopolies or elites aren't any different.

This is not true in general, especially in industrial processes where improvements in material and machinery have had a much greater impact relative to their costs. I actually approve of short period unemployment benefits, partially because virtually all money expended this way is recaptured by taxes. Bear in mind, I'm in favor of *less* government, not *no* government. I'm sorry for being less clear.

7) No, the market functioned reasonably well until the primary ""customer"" of the Hospital became the HMO. People stopped negotiating their own bills. Bills stopped reflecting the cost of procedures. The people were depowered and the prices skyrocketed. Demand is rather inelastic, but price was still flexible due to issues of time and space. Instead, doctors are hospitals are picked for patients and procedures and medications are picked for doctors by what insurance covers. Hospitals responded to being forced to accept ""average pricing"" by inflating those prices, and people respond to inflated prices by bankruptcy.

What infuriates me is that the health care law dealt exclusively with health insurance and didn't even address the root problems with health insurance because it was written by health insurance companies. Power needs to balanced at the point where decisions are made, and decisions and power that are remote rarely serves the needs of those directly involved well.

8) I could be socialist if I was born in a different place and time. I agree with a lot of the goals, but not with the methods. I believe that the world is different than the one of Marx and Smith. While they were dead on about a lot of the basic rules of the game, their assumptions are dated and no longer reflect reality. The average man has never had more power, and has never been in a better position to control his own fate. I believe it's time to let them do what needs to be done rather than take that power and control from them so that things can be done for them. The things done for them will never be as good for them as what they can do for themselves given the chance.","1370045097"

Unfortunately we are currently heading in a direction where a lot of our content will be automatically generated based on some magic that happens in the background. While it reduces a lot of duplication we would have to do otherwise, I also see the increased difficulty it brings because things are just not so obvious, and it’s hard to impossible to see where the information actually comes from (i.e. where one has to edit something to make it appear *here*).

I’m not exactly sure how we can improve that experience while keeping the magic (because it makes keeping things up to date a lot easier), but we definitely have to do something about this.

A lot of people assume that having ADHD means you *can't* focus, but I find for me it's more that I struggle *controlling* my focus. So it's like watching a TV but I can't control which channel I'm on. I might try to change the channel to something specific (an unappealing task that I have to complete), but if the channel doesn't interest me then the TV switches channels to something else. Sometimes if the task I'm trying to focus on (or channel, if you will) is really boring, then the TV will switch to anything that seems more engaging or exciting.

I think this helps to explain why people with ADHD have trouble focusing on certain tasks, like chores, and yet can completely engross themselves (sometimes a little bit too much) in other tasks that they enjoy.

The article clearly states internet addiction refers to internet usage as an ""impulsive-control problem"" which results in a serious impact on day-to-day activities. The article further states an answer of ""yes"" to at least five of these questions is necessary to qualify for internet addiction:

&gt; 01. Do you feel preoccupied with the Internet (think about previous online activity or anticipate next online session)?

&gt; 02. Do you feel the need to use the Internet with increasing amounts of time in order to achieve satisfaction?

&gt; 03. Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop Internet use?

&gt; 04. Do you feel restless, moody, depressed, or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop Internet use?

&gt; 05. Do you stay online longer than originally intended?

&gt; 06. Have you jeopardized or risked the loss of significant relationship, job, educational, or career opportunity because of the Internet?

&gt; 07. Have you lied to family members, therapists, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with the Internet?

&gt; 08. Do you use the Internet as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving a dysphoric mood (e.g., feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, depression)?

The comparison you're making wouldn't normally qualify, unless it quite clearly did represent some kind of behavioural problem. In other words, internet addiction in this context refers to a behavioural problem which negatively affects a person's ability to carry out some of their ""normal"" activities.","1370045103"
"circlejerk","t5_2qpol","Throw away for obvious reasons. I'm not going to be humble about it; I'm very, very attractive. I take care of myself: 5'4"", pear shaped body, double chin, and bald. I did do some serious drinking in college but now I work at an ARCO gas station.

You get used to women on the street or subway or bus just ogling and eye fucking you. Look there way and they either sheepishly turning away and giggling, or just grinning while continuing to stare at you. Sometimes it's the opposite; it gets a little bit old after a while when you go to make conversation with some girl and she can't get out a complete sentence and won't even look you in the eye.

Very often women will just completely ignore me since they are intimidated. Sometimes it's just casual stuff, other times they will explicitly tell you what they want. I've had women of all ages come up to me and remark about how 'hot' my fedora looks or how they admire my Yoda T-shirt. I've had women with wedding rings on approach me and tell me that I ""pissed my pants."" It's a weird way to break the ice, but I guess women in their late thirties and 40s are not afraid to tell you what they want.  Not just at parties either, but at random places like the grocery store. And for each of those explicit occurrences, I've had probably ten times as many where they just plain aviod looking at me. Most women won't even talk to me, they'll just stand at a distance and carry about their business, but I can *sense* their desire.

Anyplace with alcohol only exacerbates the comments. I've gotten used to the fact that I can't go to bars without random women shooting spidwads at me, giggling, and playfully shoving me into the wall. I've had girls with boyfriends with and without them come up to me and start aggressively flirting even with their SO right next to them, and some of the SOs get mad at me! This would make them insanely jealous and say something like ""you can be a mean bitch sometimes.""

One thing most men don't realize is how territorial women get about you. Several women at my workplace that I have no interest in but clearly have crushes on me get jealous when I am talking to other women, even in just a business manner. It's like they make it a competition to see who gets the most attention and interaction with me, including women who are twenty years older and married. This happens a lot with female friends too, even some of the ones that I have never hooked up with, which is not for their lack of interest. Especially when alcohol is involved. I've had women at parties start fighting each other when another pulled me away physically so they could talk to me; calling each other slut, whore, when they thought another was trying to steal me, etc.  Of course they would always pretend like they were fighting over some other guy...

The girlfriends I've had are very very insecure.  They don't like to be seen in public with me for fear that another girl will steal me away from her.  I mean them.  Or maybe it's because of her eating disorder.  Or because she has a hard time walking.  Or she has a hard time fitting through her front door.

I don't date as much as I used to now that i'm in my late 20s and have gotten pretty competitive at online gaming, but sometimes it's all I have because it feels impossible to get into a relationship with a girl that isn't constantly insecure.

Ok fine, there are enclaves within Toronto as well, but it's nowhere near as homogenous as the outlying 'burbs.

Think of Chinatown over at Spadina/Dundas. You don't have just Chinese people there. In fact, the Chinese folks here are probably not the same Chinese people you'll see in Markham (unless they drove all the way down...)

And then (for example) with Greek Town over at the other end you'll see Greek folks around, but also a lot of brown, yella, white, etc.

Now, when you start getting into the ""suburb"" part of the city, it does get more homogenous. In spite of that, I think we've, as a whole, managed to resist the homogenization of some of the other suburb-cities around us, IMHO.

I am very glad to be in the core living amongst all of the different other races and demographics around me. I've gotten to know my neighbours around me over the years. They consist of Italian, Romanian, Pakistani, Vietnamese, Aboriginal and even throw in a small town white couple into the mix to complete the recipe. I truly enjoy their neighbourliness and often hang out with my neighbours. I wouldn't have it any other way.

Essentially this means that the creators of the show, from it's very inception, either hoped or assumed that they would get 26 seasons in order to cover the entire alphabet. 

&gt;It is a 26-year-long project, with each series dedicated to a different letter of the alphabet. So far, QI has looked at some astonishing ""A's"", beautiful ""B's"", crazy ""C's"", delectable ""D's"", excitable ""E's"" and frightfully fabulous ""F's"", great ""G's"", heavenly ""H's"", intriguing ""I's"", and the current series full of jubilant ""J's"".

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","Have you tried misting it with water? 

Most likely you're wary of using a stripping compound because of the porous subfloor, but my understanding is that many if not most of those linoleum glues are water soluble. It certainly looks very similar to what I had but that's no guarantee. 

My approach would be to mist each chunk quite well, but not drench it. You can also cut lines into it with a utility knife to speed penetration. A little vinegar mixed in might help too. Wait a while and it should soften up tremendously. Then use a bully scraper or a good thin drywall knife to get under the edges, it should peel right up. 

Put a fan on and wait at least a day for the plywood to dry out before you start with the floor. 

Honestly I would still put in a thin underlayment for sound, comfort, etc. You're doing hand scraped maple, might as well go full bore underneath too. 

It wouldn't hurt to test my approach on a small patch. Two hours and you'll know if it's gonna work. You can always reuse the drywall knife when you stand up too fast and bang your nailer handle into the wall. ","1370045108"

They have Ronnie Hillman who is a solid change of pace, pass down back drafted in the 3rd round of 2012 and IIRC they still have Lance Ball. Montee looks great but its impossible to predict what he'll do until some of those RBs get let go.

Oh she did, but again she was under the impression that she could not get pregnant, so therefore indigestion, constipation, and a little weight gain are obviously not from pregnancy.

I'm recommending this only because it's the one book on the topic that I've read and it was really good.  There's others too, like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/The-IDA-Pro-Book-Disassembler/dp/1593272898/ref=pd_sim_b_1), but I haven't read them so I can't comment.

Any book about reverse engineering can only teach you the most basic things.  But it teaches you enough that once you're on your own, you aren't lost.  If you want to develop the skills further, just start disassembling OS functions and figuring out how they work.

Another book that's tangentially related is [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Windows-Debugging-Practical-Strategies/dp/0735662789/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370045081&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=windows+debugging).

The bottom of the ocean (anywhere submerged in water, for that matter) would be deadly for any human, considering we can't breath underwater.  Any volcano is pretty dangerous, considering the temperature.  A desert, maybe, or some place where it would be too hot and you die of heat stroke.
In terms of currently inhabited places, you would likely consider the crime rate/public health rate (score?).  In that case, I would probably say (having done next to no research on the topic - only going by what seem to be dangerous areas to live and what I read ocasionally in the news or have studied a little bit in school) North Korea.  A lot of people starve, apparently, and are subjugated by the government to work in unhealthy and dangerous conditions.
Perhaps crime/violence is what you mean?  In light of current events, Mexico is all kinds of crazy,what with the gang violence and everything.  Some of the places in the Middle East have regular bombings.  And, of course, the freeways in Russia.
So, a long (and serious) response, i guess, but hopefully to get the discussion started.","1370045116"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm just going to say this. A state that pursues purely egalitarian goals that have little to no material benefit is poorly led and on a quick path to destruction. 

A nation should be looking out, first and foremost, for its citizens. This applies not only to their physical well being but also their economic interests. It would be absolultley irresponsible for my, or any, government to commit vast sums of resources into endeavors that ultimately would yield little actual benefit to it or its citizens, despite how noble it might be. 

Yes, I know that sounds cold and heartless. It doesn't have to be completely. There is no shortage in this world of crisisies. It's not hard imagining scenarios where helping others coorilates with looking it for a state's own self interests. The first Gulf War is such an example. Yes, the US led coalition stopped a genocidal regime from invading a country and subsequently drove them out of another. And yes, they were primarily motivated by wanting to protect their interests in oil (which is the absolute life blood of the modern economy). 

Would it be nice if states did not act with only their self interest in mind? Yes. But that's not the way world works. No country, state, nation, kingdom, empire, ect... ever acted without self interest as its number 1 priority. 

In the end, the US doesn't need to placate and be nice because it is the global hegemony. It will continue to make decisions keep it that way. Most of the world's governments support, though at times begrudgingly, the US because as other redditors have pointed out, the world would look drastically different if another state was at the top. 

If this upsets you, sorry, but this is they the world works. The more people understand this, less recourses and bullshit everyone else would have to deal with.

My point is that the government's *goal* may be noble, but its *effect* quite often isn't.  This is something that is quite apparent, as someone up there said, if you actually look at the effects of government throughout history.","1370045134"

Hard work, not a lot of fun and just enough money to pay my living. I smoked weed every day and did some experiments with other drugs. I was still in a rather unhappy relationship with my first girlfriend. Overall I had little self-confidence and lacked the necessary qualifiations to advance professionally.


In the end this situation and new friends, who helped me to realize my strengths, motivated me to improve my life. 


I made up my baccalaureate degree at night school and completed with a GPA of 4.0 (Abiturnote 1,2). Currently I write my master's thesis in psychology and work as a research assistant in my department. My chance at the job market look promising. 

I still smoke on occasion - about 4 times a year - when I get the offer at a party and won't drive the next days. However there is no craving to smoke more often.

The most important and most positive change was meeting my current girlfriend. For three years I've lived in a happy and fulfilling relationship.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok, so when I was in second grade we had this big dog, I believe it was a Great Pyrenees. We had this big wire cage for it in my parents room, like [this](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSQ3g2X_h_eAa5GKw8LRdN3S46cbCh-COg7N6U6zBo7VAaYJ6J50MoCrGFj). So my Dad was watching an American Football game in the den, so I went into his room to watch cartoons. I climbed up on top of the dog cage to see the tv, and my legs were dangling over the side of the cage, with one leg on either side of the open door. So after a while im all cartooned out I guess, so I go to jump off, and I land on the top of the cage door, crushing my nads inbetween my pubic bone and the thin, metal cage door. The problem was that my legs were shorter than the cage door was tall, so I was suspended in the air on only the base of my pelvis, with all my weight on my junk, which was mashed between. I wasnt able to fall off the side of the door, so I had to slowly scoot myself along the length of the cage door, which had a bunch of ridges and shit from where the small rods were attached to the frame. When I finally got to the edge of the door, which felt like it took hours, I had to use my hands to push myself off the last little bit, but that meant I wasnt able to brace my fall. I hit my face so hard on the floor I busted my chin open, but I didnt even know at the time because of the terrible pain in my prepubescent hardware. That still remains the most painful event I've ever experienced. But after I hit the ground and busted my chin, I stuck my hand in my buzz lightyear undies to see if I was missing anything, and when I took it out it was smeared all over with scrotum blood. I passed out and woke up when my parents were putting me in the car to take me to the hospital. I held my sack the whole way there because I was afraid one of my marbles would roll out and I would lose it. Now I have a badass crescent moon shaped scar going from my balls up to the base of my dick.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I have to disagree with you.  This isn't a court of law, it's history, and you can absolutely get *tons* of information from works of fiction.  In some cases, fiction may be the only real glimpse at lower level culture, because they simply did not write about themselves historically; the historical writers in many periods were more interested in kings and wars and the upper class.

Saying works like the Iliad, Sophocles' plays, the Commedia, etc are useless as historical evidence would deprive us of *so much* knowledge.  That said, they have to be used with a lot of caution and sophistication, and my initial reply (which you can view above my ""edit"" line) was too flippant simply because I know that being a peasant widow with no male protector really was an extremely rough situation to be in.

I think it was a bit of an overreaction by overzealous new mods who are very into their job, because as flippant as it was it followed the official rules for non-top level replies.

Edit: Furthermore, your whole statement about hearsay is nonsensical, because even our most reliable primary sources are hearsay ""Tacitus says X, Y, and Z"" for example.  All your critique of using fiction as evidence applies to non-fiction as well.","1370045152"

Look out for dollar coins and half dollars as well, many of them might be silver if the are pre-1970s. If you see any coins with faces that you just don't see these days, check all those. Some coins won't be silver but are still valuable when sold to collectors because of their rarity. I work at a credit union and still see some valuable ones that float around; if you grandpa started saving 30 years ago there's a good chance you have a lot more because it's the past 30-40 years of coins that usually aren't so valuable, to my understanding.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Silly, Romance Novels are a tool of the Patriarchy to oppress women, just like womens gossip magazines. It's not what women actually want, it's just evil men brainwashing them into thinking what they want them to think. Cause apparently women are really fucking stupid and can't work out what they want for themselves? And just happen to like and buy the stuff the Patriarchy wants them to think. Yea... something like that...

Seriously though, when every criticisims are ""your arguments don't even make ANY sense"" maybe it's time to re-evaluate you position. The fact that Anita conflates ""mercy killing"" with Violence against women (because gender is what decides the severity of violence of course) shows she is either completely fucked in the head and needs help, or she thinks everyone else is. One makes her opinion not worth anything (for the same reason we don't take advice from mentally ill) and the other is just plain condescending and offensive.

Anita's arguments also completely ignore the context of the game or completely misrepresent things. She's either stupid or dishonest. The part at the end about ""men don't actually care, they just want to prove their manliness something something patriarchy"". That was just plain fucking insulting. It's insulting to the characters, to the writers and to me as a man. Implying that they/I am so completely selfish and incapable of compassion and empathy based on my gender is downright fucking misandrist. That is like me claiming women are incapable of logic because their vagina wont let them.

As for the video it's self, the points are reasonable (but lets face it, this is pretty low hanging fruit) and it was better than her last. Like last time though, I think InuitInua needs to work a bit more on her speaking, could do with being a littler clearer in her annunciation. There are several instances where she stumbles/ slurs excessively (I tend to notice cause I have the same issue). She has the benefit of multiple takes (which is clear from the constant cuts), might as well use that to do multiple takes and pick the best ones.

If the top lane is left alone he will farm and scale harder than the enemy top-laner, and most top-laners can't deal with singed farming between towers early game because they can't tank too much minions.

If the jungler ganks top all the time to stop him, singed is doing a great job. He's discracting their jungler so your team can get towers/dragon.

If he dies a couple of times he's not worth much, but he is still singed, so he can push the lane and farm, eventually reaching the point where he cannot die. (atleast not 1v2, if the mid comes aswell this means that mid tower can be taken and dragon/bot.)

""What is the most common thing that could explain these symptoms?""  Treat it.

If that doesn't work, move on to the next thing.  It is a numbers game.

Rare nasal cancer might have been number 67 on the list.  It simply wasn't on the radar.  Since it was aggressive, they may have gotten to 7 or 8 on the list (since multiple doctors probably came to the same diagnosis with maybe a different treatment) before she passed.

That's medicine.  It is called an art for a reason.

""Leave him. He's a douche. He's emotionally abusive and I know you are trying to do what's best for your daughter, but the fact that he yells at you in front of me means he doesn't care. He probably can't. There's a reason he lived in a crappy apartment, single, well into his 30's - he's selfish. Sometimes that's okay - people are selfish by nature, but sometimes it's not okay. Like when he tells you to make dinner, then refuses to eat it. Or when he tells you that you deserve a night off, then refuses to accomodate you. A marriage is about compromise, and you are the only one doing it. That's fine, if you're happy - but I see it in your eyes and your half smile - you're not. You're sad, embarrassed that you rushed into this relationship just to realize your sweet funny boyfriend is actually a really mean husband. But there's no shame in that - because it's not your fault. If your husband is unwilling to talk to you about the issues at hand - you have a bigger issue.""

It really changes your prospective on how we expect a ""They lived happily ever after"" ending from not only games but almost all of sorts of media. It's just recently the gloomy ending is being used in story-telling. Some might consider it a gimmick and a result of the gritty atmosphere that's kinda being enforced on us by all sorts of media. It's never about Felicia, it's about you, the gamer. The dialogue branch where Felicia talks what makes the story only being controlled by the author is still baffling me since yesterday.

Cons: It's insanely expensive. You pay all this money and then have to turn in the keys. You have to maintain comprehensive collision coverage. If you drive a lot, you're going to pay for those extra miles. It will likely turn into an expensive habit (""upgrade"" every 3 years) and encourage high spending. 

Also, no one should *ever* be paying MSRP on any new car unless there's some crazy demand. So yeah if you compare MSRP to leasing, leasing might win. But it's a meaningless comparison.

If, however, you don't wish to spend that much money... this GTX 650 Ti is only $10 more with much better performance than the 7770 and has good reviews:

But i can't, because i have no friends. I'm never learned to socialize when i was school because i was homeschooled when i was younger, then when i was in middle/high school everyone was so rejecting i just avoided people.

Those who are still in school and have no friends... Don't give up on it. You have a very small window of opportunity. Being in school is where you have limitless opportunity to make friends. You have people your own age all around you, a very obvious thing in common (school, since you all do that every day) and a much looser social structure than society in general has. It's the lowest level, it's a place to start, and if you don't start when given the opportunity, you will never get to. Expect rejection, but never let that stop you, and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised sometime and you might end up with a friend, and from there, i assume, a chain reaction will start. You'll have someone to practice social skills with, and get them up to an average level. Don't end up like me, unable to relate to in any way. It's not fun.

Well, my fetish is so strong that I find it exceedingly difficult to climax without thinking about it.

The only girl I've had sex with (about 13 years ago) was big, but she didn't like being big. And she was definitely not into feederism. I'd go soft half-way through sex because I was no satisfied with her simply being chubby. I thought I had ED issues, but it's been psychological the entire time. I just didn't realize that until now.

&gt; If you really can't enjoy sex without your fetish, then you should look into ways of branching out, seeing other stuff. Fixation on one thing isn't a very good or healthy thing to have.

After this he was disgusted and got out of the government right away. Apparently we spent millions of dollars to put ATM machines in other countries, not inside of bases mind you, but on street corners for everyone to use. We spent millions of dollars on vehicles that could have been rented or leased for a fraction of the cost. These were not military spec btw, but consumer level.

Even if he was ""mouthing off"", making a fist, or flaring his arms - he's still a kid, he's clearly much smaller than they are, and with his back turned toward them with no weapon while carrying his pet, he's CLEARLY no threat.

Being abused by cops is something that primarily happens to people of color and usually happens with little to no provocation, as in this case. All you have to do is look at the percentage of people of color behind bars and compare the incarceration rates and sentences between people of color and white people for the same crime.

&gt;-2. MEDICAL STANDARDS.  Throughout this enclosure, ICD, CPT and HCPCS codes are 
included with most medical conditions and procedures, usually parenthetically, to aid crossreferencing.  Unless otherwise stipulated, the conditions listed in this enclosure are those that do 
NOT meet the standard by virtue of current diagnosis, or for which the candidate has a verified 
past medical history.  The medical standards for appointment, enlistment, or induction into the 
Military Services are classified by the general systems described in sections 3-~~30~~31 of this 
enclosure.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;You're the one wasting your time by commenting on this post. Claiming that I'm the one wasting your time when you could have, just as you recommend, downvoted and moved on, is ridiculous.

You are missing the point.  Not everybody bothers with the New tab.  The ""Knights of New"" is a thing for a reason.  I am *spending* my time, along with a few others, weeding through un-vetted content both because I enjoy it and as a public service to Reddit at large.

As I go, where I encounter people who really don't seem to understand what's going on, I describe *why* I'm down-voting.  Trying to teach instead of just condemn.  Very often that description isn't much more than a link to the sub they should have posted to instead.

You on the other hand are encouraging people to flout one of the primary rules of this sub.  This participates in a feedback loop where *more* clueless dolts come here with their simple ignorance, when *that is* ***specifically*** *not what this sub is for.*  This is what I meant when I asked you to try not to waste my time.  Perhaps I should have asked you instead, more specifically, not to encourage others to waste my time.  The net effect is the same.  **""Askreddit is for thought-provoking, discussion-inspiring questions.""**  That's.  Not.  Complicated.

&gt;I live my life to help other people

Then actually help.  Direct people to the correct channels and/or staff those channels.  What you're doing here is not help.  This is enabling [learned helplessness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness) and thwarting attempts to stem the crap-flood.  You are making Reddit *and* the people you ""help"" just a little bit worse with this behavior, and now you are defending your right to do so.  *That's* ridiculous.","1370045203"

&gt;Personally, for example, going to a ""college party"" is not something I enjoy doing seeing how i do not enjoy drinking or hanging out with strangers that share no interests that I share.

Then go to parties with the type of people you do want to talk to. You wouldn't go to a Kanye West concert if you hated rap, even if you consider yourself a music fan. It's not the inherent act of drinking that people enjoy about parties (again, unless you're an alcoholic), it's being with people they like.","1370045212"

Federal agents can now detain people with NO due process of law - Habeas corpus has officially gone out the window.  No one can say what their intentions/goals are but I can tell you that ever since George Bush Sr. (former head of the CIA) got in office - our civil liberties have been systematically exterminated.  9/11 was specifically outlined as a threat - nothing was done and it happened.  Our government was warned specifically about the Boston bombing suspects - nothing was done and the bombing happened.  The sole survivor of the attack coincidentally sustained an injury that has left him unable to speak and his friends are now getting MURDERED by the FBI.  Explain this to me - why did the FBI say their agent was stabbed and cite that as the reason why they killed Todashev AND THEN redact the statement and say he was armed with a knife but didn't attack him --- AND THEN redact that statement and say they are no longer sure if he was armed?  Why did they have to shoot him 7 times?  Since the inception of The Patriot Act, our government has gone on a rampage... FBI agents are just police on steroids with the egos to go with it... and now they are given power to murder whomever they want because the American public (like you) are part of a massive league of morons who do nothing but allow their eyes to glaze over every evening at 7 o'clock in front of the mainstream propaganda media.","1370045224"

**Why would you like to become a staff member** -
I believe I would be a good staff member because of my background, it's what runs in my blood. I'm a person who notices the delays, the bugs and the problems that most people shrug off and ignore. I do everything in my power to attempt to stop these from happening, whether it be reporting the bug, diagnosing or even fixing. If something isn't working right it sets off my curiosity and generally triggers me to diagnose and solve the problem, I cannot stand noticing flaws or imperfections. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to performance, I want everyone to enjoy their experience and not make them feel as if bad performance is their only choice. When I code my plugins or applications I always keep in mind performance, configuration and simplicity. Performance is a necessity, no one will enjoy the plugin if it triggers delays and crashes. The configuration is important because users may not even want to use certain features, but ultimately it is the simplicity that makes the plugin good. This is essentially who I am as a person, I look for the easiest way out, some call it laziness, but I find it a good trait. If it can be done easier, or already has been done, there is no point in redundancies. I think I could help greatly for your community.

**What is your previous experience** -  

* Ran a dedicated server for a prior community, now defunct (Nocturnal Gaming).

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","&gt; The infantry skill cap is not that high in Planetside 2. It's there enough to differentiate between two players that go one on one but then you throw things like shotguns in the mix and that diminishes it. 

Shotguns are weapons that are extremely effective at close quarters but even between shotgun users skill makes a difference. If you want to win against a shotgun you just have to engage it at a range that's more optimal for you and less optimal for the shotgun. Take it from a frequent shotgun user, these are definitely skill intensive weapons, they just put more emphasis on picking your route and reacting quickly as opposed to keeping the reticle centered on a target for a full second while holding down the mouse button.

&gt; No matter how good you are you can't really go into a battle that has more than a platoon and make a difference, hell even one squad of veteran FPS players are not going to make that big of a difference, there is just too much cheese. 

I'm really not sure what you mean by ""cheese"", unless you're taking ArcFault's stupid definition of it.

One skilled player can definitely make a difference but a skilled leader matters more.

&gt; Planetside 2's TTK would be okay if the shields weren't the way they were, as soon as you finish a gun battle with one dude you are at a disadvantage for 10 seconds. As fast pace as the infantry combat is with the TTK and respawning this is just counter-intuitive. I mean you are essentially guaranteed to lose a gunfight against any average+ player unless you are in their face with a shotgun or something. 

So you run back and take cover until your shields are back, it's not that hard. If you jump into the middle of an infantry meat-grinder you shouldn't be surprised that you die.

&gt; Personally this is how I think of it, can you run into a room with two enemies that are aware of your presence and win a 2v1 gun battle without one of them being a total shitter? No...not really there is really no way to ""out skill"" them...the only thing you can possibly do is get headshots which is really lucky based IMO. I mean it happens...I do it sometimes but when it does happen I don't feel like I outplayed them, I feel like one of them made a mistake or I had a shotgun. The reason I feel like that? Because I do the same thing all the time and I don't constantly 2v1 people. 

I fail to see how you're supposed to be able to win 2v1 against 2 marginally skilled players in any FPS. I might be able to see it in COD but that's because the two most important things in COD are your latency and your twitch time (often in that order) because the TTK in COD is down around a quarter second.

Planetside on the other hand emphasizes a steady aim and tactical mind over how fast you can pull the trigger.

&gt; However, that is not the case in games like Battlefield 3, Counter-strike and sometimes even Call of duty. It's much easier to tell when you are better than another player and consistently beat them in gun battles.

Again, much faster paced shooters that put way more emphasis on reflexes compared to any other type of skill. This doesn't make these less skill intensive than Planetside 2 but it does mean that they tax a different skill set.

&gt; I mean it's a very common complaint from smaller ""elite"" outfits that they can't make a difference or do anything like a l33t gen hold anymore. 

They can if it's even odds but often these ""elite"" outfits assume they can 1v2 an entire platoon with their 2 squads and that just doesn't work.","1370045224"

This is nothing to do with archives, from google to mirroring sites. This is nothing to do with not being a dumb shit and posting dumb shit on the internet. This is nothing to do with law enforcement.

Everything you do is visible, I would agree, and that visibility is determined by what you put on the internet, not by any measure you may take once it's there.

This is about privacy and confidentiality, in regards to JustAskJulie and what she could have done, in regards to a person with implicite responsibilities serving a community and her exercise of power in regards to the constituents that make her position and profit possible. This is about being a responsible web administrator for a forum in the context of the community it serves, which must include contextual regards. The issue is not that he posted something he shouldn't have: that much is obvious. The issue is not about the expectation of the internet to forget about it: it is obvious that's not going to happen or ever really has.

This is about a person requesting for the removal of posts made to a board by the poster themself in relation to the culture and topic of the forum. What people don't get is that the internet *is* real life; there is this idea that over here lies the internet, and over there lies reality, and this idea permeats both ways, to the users and the admins. It is wrong and ignorant. Obviously, the user is not excused by their ignorance, because it is their life, their reality, that is being examined. However, the admin (JustAskJulie) is obviously aware of the culture, the subject matter, and the realities faced by swingers. She seems to think that leaving a post up that is asked to be removed is okay, and the only two reasons in light of the context of the forum that this would be imagined are, as I see it: 1) she thinks that her advice to help this man is more valuable than the man she is trying to help, so fuck him and whatever shit leaving it up might cause, or 2) the internet is not real life.

#1 indicates a shitty person. #2 indicates an ignorant person that, given her position, has no excuse to that ignorance.

This is not about the internet respecting anybody, in a sense of privacy and confidentiality, or otherwise. We all know the internet gives no fucks, has no consciousness, and cannot be tamed or ordered about.

This is about an admin, who is trusted with the most sensitive of information, with the easy ability to destroy lives with the information she is given, acting under the guise of helping people, who cannot respect the desire for confidentiality and privacy. By removing the user's post or making them private, that would have respected his confidentiality. 

I am not arguing that the internet had a responsibility to privacy and confidentiality. I am not arguing forums have that responsibility. I am arguing that people who appoint themselves to help others in the most private and confidential of matters should respect requests for that privacy and confidentiality, which is EXACTLY the reason that reddit allows deletions and EXACTLY the reason you don't use a IRL identify here, lest you find your user and post deleted.

Being on the internet, being a part of the internet, and/or participating on the internet does not excuse you to be a shitty person, as the backlash and retribution that has occured proves.","1370045225"

The game even takes into account marginal damage and grass or marbling on tyres and how they change grip dynamics and properties.

Everything is really detailed, and brought together great. Even smaller, more trivial things like the pit crew, rain on your helmet and challenge mode have had as much effort put into them as the screech of the tyres on the Monaco hairpin apex and the whine of the McLaren MP4-28. 

Ties in quite nicely with car feedback. Tyre marbling, grass on them, smoke from traction loss etc etc is all apparent and beautiful, but not overdone. Same can be said for the sounds. They don't sound like the tyres of a Tesla.

AI is great if you don't spin out.*

Sure, there are home runs and collisions at the plate, but its a game of finesse where fans are drawn to it for the smooth double play or a diving catch, not because there are two 300-pounders out their beating the crap out of each other, or some 7-footer slamming the ball down on some other victims head. Baseball draws fans for the little things, that's why I love the game so much.","1370045229"

"explainlikeIAmA","t5_2t5iz","A relationship can be seen as an equation with several variables. Now, all these variables have their own individual equations to determine their objective values, but sociological and biological studies have shown these equations to be far too complex to really put down into solid, objective numbers, especially considering that these equations are based upon personal opinion and emotion, which are decidedly not objective.  But, we shall assume, for the sake of dissertation, that these variables can be given arbitrary, known values for any given person.

Ok, so declaration of variables.  The variables for a relationship, in their most basic forms, are physical attraction, common bondability, emotional attachment, and environmental factors.  Physical attraction, P, is how sexually attractive one finds another person.  It is generally biological in nature, and is dependent on personal tastes in body type and scent and hormones.  Common bondability, B, is the ability of one person to bond over common interests and activities with another.  Common interests can include a similar taste in music or movies, a common recreational site, compatible political views, etc.  Emotional attachment, EA, is the ability for one to become invested in the existence of another. This is a natural bond that begins at zero upon meeting, and gradually increases over time, given no negatives, such as dislikes or interpersonal conflicts.  Environmental factors, EF, are anything that occurs outside biology and emotions of the relationship.  This can include other current relationships, physical distance, societal norms, etc. This value is almost always negative.

Now to the types of equations.  A relationship occurs when a combination of these variables sums to a value greater than or equal to a threshold the other member of the relationship arbitrarily determines.  So, any relationship can be seen as such:  R = P + B + EA + EF.  A platonic friendship, a relationship with no romantic value, removes P from the relationship.  A sexual fling, a relationship based almost solely on physical attraction that has no emotional attachment, removes EA from the relationship.  A sexual partnership, a relationship based upon the persistent enjoyment of sexual actions between two people, removes B from the equation.  Only a true romantic relationship takes into account all factors.

The interesting part of these equations occur when the thresholds for these relationship values and the parameters themselves differ greatly enough between to people that they create conflicting relationship values for the subjects.  One of these conflicts is commonly known as the ""friend zone.""  This occurs when B, EA, and EF combine in a way for both to be considered in a platonic relation with the other, but P differs or R differs greatly enough that one would consider the relationship romantic, but the other would not.  This creates an unstable system, which, for the sake of stability, will most likely cause the system to fail, resulting in a complete destruction of the system.

Now, one would normally say this could also cause some other value in the system to change so that the system is again stable and maintainable.  Well, the nature of these relationships makes the member that has a higher relationship value struggle to raise the other's values, and oftentimes this action on the system works negatively on some other value in the system, making the imbalance worse.  At this point in my research, I have yet to see one of these systems fix itself well, but with time and more relationships, I may yet see one of these systems work.  Theoretically, it should, given time approaches infinity.  I mean, EA can only go up with time, right?","1370045234"

In reality, your situation isn't really THAT different from what a lot of both men and women go through though.  Often time sexual attraction fades between people after they've been married, and it's something people work through frequently.  It just so happens that in your case there is the questioning of your sexuality as well, but that is somewhat secondary.  The bottom line is that you aren't interested in your husband sexually.  

You definitely should see a therapist, but you should also be more honest with your husband.  You seem to care about him deeply, but the idea that you keep so many things from him, least of all your unhappiness kind of seems... off to me.  Though I understand why you don't, this is something he deserves to know something about.    

On the bright side, you have just started your journey in everything and you never know, there are possibilities for a happy ending despite how it seems to you right now.  Chances are you're thinking in worst case scenarios, but there might be some positive outcomes or options you simply haven't considered?  Who knows, he might be amenable to an open relationship, for example.  

But first priority is to get your head sorted.  There's nothing wrong with you, there are many, many people in similar if not exactly the same situations.  And there's still potential to not ruin everything - though it will definitely require opening yourself up to a large degree.

(Yep, but not suitable for walking a great deal in). 

Conversely, being really, really stupid about money and buying way beyond your means. You can chant about how you can't take it with you time and again, and yet I find the people who say that always find someone else to stick the bill with in the end, and quite often it is their SO. 

If you have no acquaintance with culture beyond watching TV and sports, we aren't going to work out. 

Spelling poorly and not having a good vocabulary. I realize we don't all have the same educational status, but there are a lot of people out there who don't try at all. How many times must the denizens of the internet be corrected on the your/you're thing before they correct that annoying, sloppy habit?

Political conservatism. The minute you talk about 'patriotism', 'freedom', ""God-fearing', ""small government"", ""fiscal responsibility', ""traditional values' and 'capitalism', my ladyboner deflates if you are a person of interest to me. 

I am really not that interested in anyone who practices any sort of fad diet or lifestyle, and spends oodles of time discussing it and telling me why my diet is wrong. It may very well be, but people who are single-minded about food are boring to me. 

If the only music you listen to is top 10 radio stuff, and you are like, really passionate about such music, it's not going to work. 

Good hygiene and grooming and moderation in substance habits and not smoking are always appreciated. 

Sexual addiction is a major personality flaw for me. If you like sex, great, I like sex too, and I like having sex with you, and we will have lots of fun. But I'm not a prude or a bitch because I don't want groups of people to join us, I don't really care for anal after trying it, I don't want to have sex 10 times in a row, and I am not that into trying to replicate stuff you've seen in porn videos. Don't mistake this for being prudish, it isn't (cuz, I really do like sex); it's just that if you have really poor self-control of your sexual appetites, I generally consider you to be a person without an off button, and you have to find another outlet for your obsessions besides me. There is sexy fun together, and there is complete loss of dignity as you seek to fulfill your obsessions, and I am not down with that.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I've never been able to fully describe why the first MMO experience isn't repeatable and you just hit the nail on the head. Playing WoW for the first couple of months, maybe up to a year for me was the single best gaming experience I'd ever had. Everything was new, dangerous, and mysterious, and I had so much to learn about it all. Once I hit max level and started raiding it slowly transitioned into that efficiency mindset that I still have. It may just be my general experience with video games or my age or something, but it's my approach to non-MMO's as well, so a lot of games (but not all) that I would have absolutely loved as a kid or teenager are interesting for an hour or so before they become vaguely boring and exploitable, or I see so many design flaws that I can't focus on the fun parts of the game. I guess having the internet and being able to look up the easiest or ""accepted"" ways to play factors into this too. 

There are rare instances where I become completely immersed in the game world and feel *compelled* to keep playing, but those are mainly because of the story and characters and not the actual gameplay itself (Mass Effect), though the gameplay has to be enjoyable enough to not be too distracting.","1370045249"

It might be more expensive, depending on your method of shaving and how cheaply you can get waxing done. Doing it yourself would certainly save money.

Blades are going to gradually go dull no matter what you do. You can keep using them, but it just makes it more difficult to get a close shave and is more likely to cause problems.

&gt; After a plane crash in the ocean, a group of military students reach an island. Ralph organizes the boys, assigning responsibilities for each one. When the rebel Jack Merridew neglects the fire camp and they lose the chance to be seen by a helicopter, the group split under the leadership of Jack. While Ralph rationalizes the procedures, Jack returns to the primitivism, using the fear for the unknown (in a metaphor to the religion) to control the other boys, and hunting and chasing pigs, stealing the possession of Ralph's group and even killing people.

the point I'm making is, at some point you've got to grow up &amp; take a hint. regardless of whether its your problem or theirs if someone is making excuses it is clear that they are not particularly interested in hanging out with you.

take a hint after they tell you once or twice and let them initiate. if they never initiate, they're probably not a friend. a friend will come bail you out of prison. if someone isn't even willing to have a drink with you, do you really think they'll have your back ... ever?","1370045263"

I do not think Smallchanger or any of the other ECR mods had anything to do with it. They could have just as easily banned me from ECR. They've been civil in their disagreement with my stances and opinions and I honestly do not believe one bit that they had anything to do with it. 

Let's not stir that pot.

Men also penalize women for negotiating more than other men, while women will penalize both genders equally. Consequently, women are more likely to negotiate if they know they will be dealing with another woman.


&gt;""What we found across all the studies is men were always less willing to work with a woman who had attempted to negotiate than with a woman who did not,"" Bowles said. ""They always preferred to work with a woman who stayed mum. But it made no difference to the men whether a guy had chosen to negotiate or not."" 


So it isn't simply about encouraging women to negotiate more, women are responding to their social environment.


However, women will negotiate more if negotiation is explicitly permitted.","1370045265"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","As a child a was afraid of dark –well, more like whatever that could be in the dark, the unknown aspect of it being the worst- and even when the logic that sustained that fear banished, the eventual sudden fear lingered a little while longer. Obviously we are prepared –even before we became humans- to distrust darkness as carnivorous animals see well in the dark while our eyes are much better prepared to see in daylight, to distinguish colors (that meant food), and I could speculate that jumping from branch to branch in the dark night would’ve been deadlier. Etcetera. In short: fearing the dark, more offspring; not fearing the dark, probably someone else’s food. But not only that, I could test that when in the dark, we have an inherent ability to imagine and actually see things, and a shadow really becomes someone or something, possibly yet another preemptive defensive mechanism of old, better an over jumpy animal than formed the idea of a danger before actually seeing it, that a dead one. 

Now to the point, it’s been a long time ago, I feel nothing –save for the inconvenience perhaps of not being able to see very well- as I am the most unsuperstitious person you could find. But that is because my (personal) understanding of all things supernatural as the result of varied circumstances –whether perception, brain lapses or hiccups, personal and cultural conditionings, misunderstandings, etcetera- have subtracted all sustenance to them. I could not believe in such bullshitery even if presented with a well forged act or trick, as I am inclined to look for the reasonable explanation and even if I could not reach one it doesn’t mean it hasn’t one, only that I have not the whole information. 

As long as you keep on giving the feeling (fear) strength, it will live long and strong. If you watch movies or listen to scary stories or (purported) personal accounts (even if sincere) and so forth you are **strengthening** that conditioned reflex, that fear once meant to protect you, and it will never go away. Make yourself a favor and avoid such things altogether until your rational mind takes almost complete control of your mind and your reactions, it will take time and surely, the kernel would be there –given what you describe- but feeding it with things specially **designed to provoke** those feelings, those responses, will not help, au contraire, will sink you deep into fear even if you rationally know is pure BS. Emotions will always have the upper hand ruling the brain, generally reason is slaved to emotions, and logical reason is not the default tool of the human brain. If you help dire emotions to surface, reason can’t do much to surface. That is why usually extremely rational people seem emotionally unresponsive; in order to let reason get proper hold, they have to be dismissive of the interference of emotions.

I understand what you're getting at, but disagree. It seems that way now as you describe it only because its so widely practiced and accepted to use animals the way we do, but if it were not the case it might seem just as ""obviously wrong"" to you as anything else does. 

Things that are obviously wrong now, were not always obviously wrong. I'm no history major, but maybe way in the past ""don't rape your daughter"" was not obviously wrong. There may have been a time when that was the case. Maybe even at that point, someone compared the beliefs in not raping daughters to religious beliefs, but now today we can say its obviously wrong and there is no way anyone would compare it to a religious belief.

There was a time when slavery was not obviously wrong, but today it is. I'm not saying you're a modern day slaver equivalent by bringing this up, that's not a judgment anyone can currently make. That's something for the future to look back at history and judge. But you got me thinking of things that were historically done without being considered wrong but today obviously are, so that's why it came to mind.

But you're mostly right along the lines of not being able to convince the other side. Such deep beliefs, no single conversation or series of conversations is likely to convince another person or change their mind so easily. It's not impossible for someone to change their mind, but it typically requires much more than discussion. At the very least it helps when people are honest about what they're believing in and why, rather than ignoring the reasons.","1370045269"

Here's the ""no bullshit"": You are depressed. These are textbook words used by those with depression to describe how they feel. ""I just want to sleep all the time"", ""I don't want to wake up."" Though you may think going back on your medication will make no difference, it will. Without help, you are going to have an incredibly difficult time making any changes to your though process. You can't understand why people enjoy life, because right now your brain is not wired to enjoy the things that bring most people happiness. 

What everyone's saying about if you end it ""you won't be able to enjoy another cold beer on a hot day"", or ""playing your favourite album, listening to your favourite music"" probably mean very little to you right now, because there are probably very few, if any, things that bring you that kind of pleasure that someone without depression feels.

I assume, subscribing to /r/atheism, that you are probably a very logical person, and you sound incredibly intelligent. If you do nothing else, educate yourself on depression. [Learn about what depression is from a scientific standpoint.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drv3BP0Fdi8) And know that it can affect anyone -- [even /r/atheism icons Stephen Fry suffers from depression/bipolar disorder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcPRF9slENI)

Instead of fixing the horrible perfect-aim-with-1-millisecond-of-exposure problem skeletons have, the developers have *increased* the range of arrows.  I'm not *too* upset about that in theory.  But in UHC, it just doesn't fit.  I think it was in UHC 3 where beef was killed by a skeleton ""with aim-bot"", and as far as I can tell, that has never been fixed.  

UHC is more fun when there are a ton of PVP deaths.  I am not opposed to PVE deaths of course, but a PVE death should happen when the player wasn't being skilled or careful enough.  And having a skeleton be able to shoot you *instantly* as *soon* as you turn a corner isn't fair at all.  I kinda view it as a glitch, similar to the boat glitch that killed Kurt.  It doesn't make for a good UHC.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Sorry, but I see three legitimate, there was absolutely no contact kind of flops. A lot of them weren't the over the top flailing like crazy kind of flop people love to crucify NBA players for. 

It brings up the whole debate of the fine line between the over-the-top flailing and blatant flopping versus exaggerating contact for a possible benefit of the call. The phantom flopping is just embarrassing though and I hope the fact that the NBA called James out on it with the fine in game 4 (however little the amount of money may have been does not matter) will stop him from doing it anymore just out of pride/character.

The exaggeration of contact I guess is all how you determine to see it as. Is it a tactic we want to see people abusing?

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Yes, slavery happened in Europe at some point in history. I bet that isn't what you are asking though. You probably want to know if black people were ever shipped to Europe to be slaves like they were in the US.

Maybe, but not in great numbers.

There was not much economic incentive for slavery in Europe. It was mainly a mercantile/manufacturing culture at the time. The US was mainly a harvesting society. Manufacture takes place in factories, which needed cities with people doing small jobs. Harvesting takes place in the countryside with people doing big jobs. Instead of sitting, people were toiling in the fields or in mines.

It made much more economic sense to hire poor white people in the city for a factory job and to buy black slaves for a field job.

Does that make sense?","1370045281"

&gt;One problem is that when everything is covered, and you don't have to pay for anything, everyone wants to go to the doctor for everything that might be them getting sick.

false. not happening. also, thats better than people suffering. your society (and germany) is rich enough to pay that bill. money is not everything. our society is safer and much more ""equal"" and as much controlled by money as yours.

also, you still pay. according to how much you earn you pay a part. everybody pays his share and everybody is provided for. like it should be in a good community.



and do you even realize that health care is actually cheaper in germany, than it is in pure capitalist USA? yeah, what a shocker.



&gt;And in the end, the bill still comes due, it just comes in the form of taxes, instead of from the doctor's office. And people are forced, by law, to pay other people's bills.

yes, you are paying other peoples bills, as long as you are healthy. one day you get sick and then your bills will be paid. thats solidarity, instead everybody for themselves.



&gt;And since women have higher natural health care costs than men, this winds up with men paying for women's stuff. I thought people in this forum would be against men being forced to pay for women's stuff.

no matter what happens to me, i can receive health treatment and it wont put me in debt and my life goes on. i think its worth it.","1370045282"

I honestly can't name a wrestler who's gone FIVE YEARS without doing anything.  And we're not talking exaggeration.  I mean, he's probably wrestled on Smackdown!  three times and Raw twice, jobbing to Brodus Clay.

He's been in two tag teams that didn't get off the ground, was the third member of a tag team that was successful in FCW but got shafted due to ECW closing, and tried to get over a injury limp cane gimmick on NXT but was booked to wrestle on Superstars a week later.

In all honesty:  He wrestles like he thinks he's Shawn Michaels, when the truth is that he's not even in Marty Jannetty's league.","1370045291"

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","I became a roving barbarian horde in RTW long before the BI was added.

I was being Germania on VH/H and sucking it up. I was more or less stagnating in my war against the Gauls. Britons attacked on west/north, Dacia to east, Gauls to South.

Well eventually I decided Enough. I sold ALL my buildings but military focused ones. I built as huge an army as I could. I cranked up taxes and left just 1 unit of peasants in each city, simply to force the enemy into a siege (if the city didnt rebel before then).

And I marched. We marched from Germania to Greece taking everything we had with us. Along the way we sacked cities, exterminated, retrained what we could, built a unit of peasants, sold the structures, and left. The cities quickly fell to their old masters or better yet, massive rebel uprisings. With no infrastructure they crippled Dacia/Gaul's capacity to retaliate, and no doubt wounded their economy. 

Eventually we arrived in our new homeland, Greece. For those who arent aware, Greece is **the** most lucrative area on the map with the most sea trade and farmland roughly equal to Rome/Sicily. It also boasts some of the largest early game cities.

The Macedonians were at war with the Brutii, and the Greek Cities were in there too, and losing badly. We took Byzantium as our new homeland, and set about carving a new empire.

Initially we relied heavily on the spoils of the looting to survive, as the city was extremely unhappy and we had basically no income. Within several decades I was able to unite Greece under Barbarian rule. The cities were also larger than I could get normally (barbarians cap out at Minor cities) and had far more advanced buildings (city plumbing, highways, massive barracks, etc, a warlords paradise).

We had a technosuperior empire compared to the other barbarian hordes. 

We eventually squashed the remaining Greeks, made peace with the Brutii, and marched north into Thrace and Dacia. Eventually we retook our homeland from the Gaul with the same battlehardened armies that originally fled. Then we staged a massive naval invasion of Italia and quickly took Rome, solidifying enough territory to win the campaign.","1370045291"

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","Seriously, check out Alanon. I know it sounds fucking stupid... it took me years before I dragged myself into a meeting, mainly because of the obvious 'not from an alcoholic family/relationship', but also because it seemed weird to me in general. I ended up going with a friend, and sitting way in the back. It's pretty cool. People will pretty much leave you alone, but are also super friendly. Just being around people who are talking about their pain can be liberating and make you feel like you're not alone in your shit. Eventually I started talking, and seriously, just talking, even for a few minutes helps resolve stuff. 

BTW, in the tech world they call this 'rubber ducking'. You have a rubber duck on your desk, and when you get stuck, you explain the problem out loud to the duck, and usually just by talking it out, the solution pops into your head.

Anyway, this was in Hollywood, so it was super intimidating at first. There were celebraties at these meetings, for fuck sake. Eventually, after a while, I got to know the people and I felt very comfortable. 

Good luck to you man. ","1370045298"

She's now using an Android device - there are a lot of Indians working in that don't be evil be evil place.

It's kind of sad, because she actually liked the iPhone, but the Hindi keyboard was killing her. She also used the English keyboard, and found it much better, but she needed a good Hindi keyboard for communicating with family.","1370045309"

When I told you ""Dude, I pay for you all the time. It won't kill you to pay a little more for once in your life,"" you reluctantly agreed, but not without rolling your eyes and acting like *I* was the asshole. 


I know you're a redditor, and if you happen to read this, I'm not spending another dime for your benefit. I'm sick of you freeloading off of me. Get a fucking job.

So you wouldn't have a situation like you described with liver genes from dad and skin from mom.  Let's use the gene for sickle cell anemia as an example.  Mom has 2 wild type copies of the sickle cell gene, which both code for round red blood cells.  Dad has 1 wild type copy  and 1 sickle cell copy. Then you would get a wild type copy from mom, and would have a 50% chance of getting a wild type copy from dad.   You would have 2 genes  for one trait, one from dad and the other from mom.  The one exception to this rule is males get all their Y chromosome information from dad and all their X from mom. But females get two X chromosomes, one from each parent.

Tl;dr You get 50% of your genetic information from each parent. But since you have 2 copies of every piece (genes and non-coding information), you get one copy from dad and one from mom. ","1370045323"

"killingfloor","t5_2rf65","quick note: you ask what you need to load these servers. since it's not often actually explained, i'll take the opportunity to do so. a server is a computer which runs a game, in this case a killing floor server. In killing floor, servers can run maps and mutations (mods). think of a server as a room, the map as the wallpaper, and the mutations as furniture. just clearing that up, as the following will make more sense.

well, maps are pretty simple.

download the map or subscribe to it on the workshop. after that, load up the game, and if it's a workshop map then you'll see text in the top right saying it's downloading. this can take some time, and I tend to restart my game after it's done.

after doing the above, you should be able to go solo-&gt;killing floor game mode-&gt;mapname. ta-dah, map should now work. if it's not available on solo, you can't play it, so either restart KF and re-download/subscribe on the workshop.

as for custom weapons, these are usually added in the form of mutations; when starting a solo game, head to the mutations tab (I think it's next to map) and add mutations to have them apply in game. some mutations have alot of conflict issues (IE they cannot be used with other mutations very successfully) so if they don't work, try just enabling one mutation at a time to see which ones don't ""work"" together.

to use mutations or maps online, the server has to have the content (the map or mutation) in its files, and must have them enabled in the configuration. if you have forwarded ports (there are tutorials on this) and you have a decent speed/capacity broadband connection, it might be worth you hosting a ""listen"" server. this basically means your computer becomes a server, and people join you. if you're on an average or low-end machine, this will likely not be worth it.

hope that's helped, reply if there's something you're unsure about.","1370045324"

No, it absolutely wouldn't. You may be under the impression that there would be constant acceleration, but that's not true. 

An object of mass *m* at infinity from the Earth, at rest, has zero total energy (neglecting its rest-mass energy). Energy is conserved, so total energy must remain zero.

Now we drop that object, and watch it fall to Earth. Just above the surface of the Earth, the object has a negative gravitational potential energy equal to **- G M m / r**, where r is the Earth's radius. This is beyond dispute.

Since the object's total energy is still zero, the object must have kinetic energy equal to the gravitational energy was lost. 

**1/2 m v^2  = G M m / r**

Some simple algebra, and we find that v = sqrt(2 G M / r), which is, as it turns out, the equation for escape velocity.

Please let me know which part of this derivation was wrong.","1370045325"

That's straight weight loss, though.  Don't be fooled into thinking he got all lean and cut from that, as he would have started losing quite a bit of muscle as his body fat got lower and lower.  But that's how he did it.

If he doesn't play a ""core"" hero, it usually means that either Loda will have a hard carry or S4 will play as one of their cores. If AB is playing as one of their cores, S4 will play an initiator / playmaker hero, which 90% of the time is either Puck, Batrider or Magnus. It's not exactly unpredictable.

The strength of Alliance is just that they execute their strategies so well, and are very talented individual players to boot. S4 is one of the best playmakers in the West, EGM is an incredibly clutch support, Loda has improved his positioning by leaps and bounds, and AB's Sylla + Furion speak for themselves. ","1370045332"

It's about being at the same job doing the same duties and still getting paid less.

I have gotten paid less when I'm people's superiors as a woman. Having been with one place for over a year and getting paid less than a non-experienced coworker who'd only been working a few weeks (I was practically a supervisor, so i had more duties too).

The nucleus looks in many ways similar to modern viruses, and nuclear chromosomes behaive similar to viral genomes.  The idea holds that a virus entered a archea, and stayed in the lysogenic phase.

Arrests over anti-Semitic remarks on Facebook

Five men and a 15-year-old youth have been arrested in East Renfrewshire and Glasgow after anti-Semitic remarks were posted on social network site Facebook.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-18087379

Twitter sued £32m for refusing to reveal anti-semites - French court ruled Twitter must hand over details of people who'd tweeted racist &amp; anti-semitic remarks, &amp; set up a system that'd alert police to any further such posts as they happen. Twitter ignored the ruling.

If you had a lone benzene molecule, or chain of just benzene molecules, you would easily see that ring. In that case there is an even distribution of the electron cloud.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One of my favorite new movies is Cloud Atlas. The movie is 6 different stories taking place in different time periods(1800's-2200's). The actors with top billing(Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving) appear as different characters in each story(main and supporting characters) and most other actors appear in more than one story.

 There are also subtle hints connecting each story. The stories are told out of sequence which makes them a little difficult to follow but the buildup to each ending is incredible. After I watched the movie the first time, I read the script and then watched it a few times more to try to figure everything out. 

The best part is the credit sequence in which they show each character each actor plays. Some of the makeup was incredibly intricate and I had no idea who some characters where played by until the end.

Otherwise the directional coupler with low power will do what you want (even high power if you have enough attenuators and the correct equipment). Of course for nonlinear networks you'll want to measure X11 rather than S11.


For (2), I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you want an output network that can dynamically match an inductive load for a wide range of frequencies? Such a network would not instantaneously be ""broadband"", but you could sweep the output impedance along with a swept frequency source if that's what you're going for. This can be easily done with wet transformers and or varactor diodes. 

I'm not aware of a method to build an instantaneously broadband matching network for a complex load.

"networking","t5_2qkaf","My first step would be to try and poison the ARP table on your local subnet to knock the gateway offline. Read the [wikipedia article for ARP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) to refresh your memory about its purpose.

1. Determine the IP address of the gateway. Connect to the network from the inside and check the routing table on your system - it will list its default gateway.

2. Send a constant stream of ARP messages declaring that your system's MAC address owns the gateway IP address. This is not a one-and-done scenario, you'll need to send a constant stream of ARP traffic to maintain the poisoned entry. There's plenty of free software out there that can do this for you, but if you're really interested in learning how it works, check out Scapy and see what kind of [shenanigans you can pull](http://webstersprodigy.net/2012/07/06/some-practical-arp-poison-attacks-with-scapy-iptables-and-burp/).

Of course, don't do this on a network where this type of challenge hasn't been presented to you. Only do something like this when the network administrator has given you permission to.

EDIT: Do you have physical access to any of the equipment? People overlook this more than they should. If you have physical access to the equipment, then it could be as simple as disconnecting a cable or two. Don't be a total asshole, if you have the ability to remove a cable, then figure out exactly which devices &amp; ports the cable is connected to *before* you disconnect it. Write it down before you remove it, and if you're really nice, leave the cable and note in the server closet with your name &amp; apartment number on it.","1370045343"

Mr. Ambassador,

I'm writing to express my disappointment at how the protests in Istanbul have been handled by the authorities there, and to request that you and your colleagues leverage the full weight of your influence to stop the brutal treatment of protestors in Taksim Square.

I was planning to visit Turkey later this year but now am concerned this may not be appropriate. There are blatant human rights violations taking place that are in no way justifiable. I implore you to help remind the leaders in your country that the protestors are their fellow countrymen, and deserve at the very least the same human rights guaranteed by various international agreements and established doctrines within Turkey.

At least one person is confirmed to have been killed with countless others injured from fires, tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons. The injured are being denied basic help and healthcare. This is barbaric and should not be tolerated in a develped nation such as yours.

I trust that you will act accordingly and will step in to use your influence to bring and end to the carnage in a sane and just way. The people have spoken. It is your duty as an official within the Turkish government to listen to them.

Thank you for your time.

Best,","1370045346"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Violence certainly occurs when the law intervenes, though, lesser harms through the actual process of kidnapping and detention (psychological and potentially physical), and greater harms which occur if someone resists arrest. The only thing state intervention does is mediates your own awareness of violence, so other people will go out and hurt doctors and people who don't want to be pregnant while you stay at home affixing yet another 'I vote pro-life' bumper-sticker onto your car.

I agree with the greater point of your post, that those who frame abortion as murder are hypocrites and cowards when they don't actually treat it like a murder was occurring (namely, attempting to stop it in any morally-permissible way possible). But if someone proposes to be non-violent, the intervention of the state isn't permissible either.","1370045347"

I was pointing out that there are tons of studies that have been done on GM crops over the last 20+ years. 

You link a lot to leaky gut issues, but you haven't tied it to GM crops/glyphosate.

Look, I don't think GM crops and glyphosate are safe, but there is no compelling evidence, yet, to make a good argument. So far there is a compelling body of evidence showing things are safe. You can thank the political love boat with Monsanto for slowing the release of anything negative that is credible. 20 years isn't a long time with such political quick sand. The counter argument to that, is other countries are worried about this and are enabling constructive research. Time will bring assurity or maybe absurdity.

If there are no jobs people should move. Cave Junction is sustained by foodstamps. I support the program and it's effects on the economy, but people often actively refuse work to keep HUD and EBT and sustain themselves with black market or under the table work.

Falsely inflating a local economy is painful and people who move to cities make considerably more over a lifetime. If the jobs are never coming back people need a push, an education something.

But not the chair that you installed into the ceiling? A picture frame is much easier to move than a swinging chair.

I think I have the BMW etk database around here somewhere, but it'll take me a month of Sundays to find it and install it again. Actually, I have the executables on one of the backup drives but it's not actually installed, so won't run.

Bavauto does list two alternators, I can't tell if they're different from the pics as one shows a pulley and a quarter angle and the others are all side and front with no pulley. But that seems to indicate there might be more than one possible correct part:

EDIT: Solved it. I  should have realized ...

This link takes you directly to downtown DC:

https://www.google.com/maps/preview?hl-en#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d7319!2d-77.0329596!3d38.8882906

That URL will take you directly to The Mall in DC to the Washington Monument. The '1d' argument is the rough altitude. (lower numbers are a higher 'zoom') The 2d and 3d numbers should be recognizable as latitude and longitude. You can be able to replace the lat/lon and go there.

e.g. this would be the url:

[https://www.google.com/maps/preview?hl-en#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d7319!2d-151.05368!3d63.07911](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?hl-en#!data=!1m4!1m3!1d7319!2d-151.05368!3d63.07911)

At least the need to provide a link to get a URL is no longer required because the page's URL updates as you move around. Sorry it will be via changing the URL rather than using their UI. I've not given up on that either, but it's highly unlikely they provided a way.","1370045359"

Then 20 years later they've grown up fatherless and have suffered for the lack, then they do it to the next generation. So what if they have an iPhone? If there's one thing everybody on the planet benefits from, it's a personal computer attached to the internet, which is what a smartphone is. Access to the world's compendium of human knowledge is not something anyone should be denied, especially when it is so cheap.

Hah! *I* know little about poor people?! I GREW UP POOR YOU STUPID LITTLE SHIT. I decided I *didn't* want to be poor, so I busted my ass and made something of myself and have a decent middle class lifestyle now. I don't mind one fucking bit about my tax dollars being spent on social programs to help the poor AT ALL. Some people legitimately need the help, I'm not referring to them. I'm referring to the ones that are spending the money I GAVE them on hookers and booze, that's where I have a fucking problem. Those bums need to get off their asses and use that money to buy some fucking food and diapers for their kids instead of working on trying to rack up STDs at a strip club, and they don't need idiots like you to make excuses for them. It's called 'personal responsibility'. Look it up some time.

also note that i'm not actually arguing with you, or defending the points on either side? i really don't even care, and i know that things are far too black and white....

i'm simply here teasing out the reality behind the talking points, calling BS when something's BS, and using what i've learned to add depth to the conversation.  if need be or to make a point, bits of my own complicated viewpoint will come out.  

perhaps this is frustrating for you, because you can't peg me as something and you thought you had a ""live one"" to use the ol' fishing analogy. 

i'm purposely ambiguous because A. its not usually relevant what i think; B. it actually detracts from my ability to call bullshit when something's bullshit and; C. in situations like this when you show your hand what comes out next is essentially a torrent of stuff that looks, smells, and sounds like the kind of talking points i hear parroted all day.

Personally, I don't give two shits about Trundle's visual rework. I think he looks cooler than he did before. But the lore rework really really bothered me. He got changed from a legitimately interesting character to a boring ice troll. Cool. Unfortunately, I can't communicate my displeasure with the change without being accused of being entitled, or a complainer, or flaming. 

It's kind of the same with Sivir. I don't really agree with the direction that IS has indicated it's going, because I would prefer just having an updated version of her current theme. Fix her feet, limbs and animations. I really don't think she needs theme tweaks. Especially when people are talking about how they need to ""cover her up"" for some reason. Why? She was fine before, it's just outdated now. 

But again, I can't communicate that anymore just because a small vocal group of assholes have decided that they're the representatives of that opinion.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There are several reasons super-fast processors aren't done. The main one is called ""timing closure"" or ""meeting timing"".  
  
When you design the circuits, output signals from one logic gate become the inputs to the next one, and so on and so on. Those signals take a finite amount of time to switch and also to propagate to the next one. So the circuits have to be designed to be tolerant to that amount of time and not expect their inputs to be correct until enough time has passed.  
  
As you clock the circuits faster and faster, you give less margin for this so-called ""setup time"". Also, as chips get bigger and more complex, some signals have to go further, eating into the setup time. And as the transistors get smaller, there's more variation. Etc. Etc. It simply gets to the point where you can't dependably make things happen fast enough.  There are literally billions of transistors on a microprocessor now, and all it takes is one mistake somewhere to cause an error.    
  
There are other challenges, but that one is the biggie. Designing really fast circuits is hard. ","1370045370"

"cyberlaws","t5_2qxyy","&gt;The TOS also state: ""When we determine that an account appears to be confusing users, but is not purposefully passing itself off as the trademarked good or service, we give the account holder an opportunity to clear up any potential confusion."" which I understand Twitter didn't do. Even the big companies are obligated to do what they promise.

But in an October 10th e-mail, it appears that Twitter provided for that very opportunity.

&gt;On you second point, there is a context that Twitter creates if you creates if you continue reading:

""Including, but not limited to"" is merely used for the sake of example.  It in no way limits the previous statement that Twitter may terminate access to any account for any reason at any time in their sole discretion.

&gt;I understand this since Sun Valley Company and Twitter are both defendants, and that both provide service in Blaine County, there is argument to file in Blaine County

Even if we overlook the issues with serving Twitter with any legal process, as a general rule merely providing passive services on a website is not sufficient to subject an out-of-state company with no physical presence in that state (like Twitter) to personal jurisdiction in that state.  Twitter may appear specially to challenge jurisdiction, but I wouldn't be surprised if they just didn't bother to show up at all because an Idaho court has no power to bind them in California.

&gt;If your arguments holds up and it is determined that Twitter can do anything at anytime for any reason, isn't that newsworthy and worth disseminating, especially if they abuse their position?

The problem I have with vegetarianism is that there's no cold hard philosophical line in what it specifically stands for. Okay so morally? It's wrong to kill animals because they're living beings. Well, so are plants. Also, your ancestors have also been killing and eating animals for thousands of years, animals kill other animals every single day. And to borrow a joke from the Simpsons, ""If a cow ever got the chance, he'd eat you and everyone you care about!"". Also remember that veganism is a complete first world luxury propped up by the lower-class and third world countries. You won't meet a lot of poor vegans unless they're extremely resourceful and/or okay with starving themselves. 

Environmentally? Yeah, massive factory farming creates disgusting and arguably cruel conditions for the animals. Cows eat a ton of grass and produce a shitload of gas while many foreign ranchers don't pay attention to overgrazing which results in loss of natural perennial grasses and dust storms. You see the same problems with fruit and veggie production. Over-production saps the natural nutrients out of the soil, possibly harmful chemicals are introduced, not to mention the pollution associated with shipping this stuff all over the world. 

Also anecdotally, most vegans I've met seem very malnourished because they're simply not prepared for the extreme lack of nutrition options they've forced upon themselves. They make social events much more complicated even though the insist they aren't intrusive (I'm sorry, but seeing you silently mope because there's no vegan options at this restaurant intrudes into my experience. Why? Because I like seeing my friends have a good time!). Then you get your preachy and judgmental vegetarians who make everyone feel uncomfortable even if they're not necessarily vocalizing their position. Also, just the extreme over-the-top-ness of the whole movement. One of my friends once forced herself to vomit because she inadvertently ate some cheese. Gimme a fuckin break. 

I just think the conversation needs to be shifted towards responsible farming and responsible eating rather than a complete overhaul of your diet. Meat doesn't need to be eaten for every meal, and if it is, it should be purchased locally along with other fruits and veggies.

Massive factory farming is where the anger should be directed, not necessarily meat producers/eaters.","1370045377"

Make sure you're working as efficiently as possible. Avoid unnecessary trips, make sure you plan ahead and carry a load of stuff when you go to the stockroom/walk-in instead of just the item you need at that moment. If you have to walk past the dishpit on your way somewhere, take any dirty dishes away with you. That kind of thing can save valuable minutes.

I hope others have more useful advice because apart from that I can't think of much except practice. How long did you work in your first kitchen? Was it a problem there? Maybe you just need a bit more time.

In these ""high bypass"" engines about 75% of the total thrust is from the large, low-pressure fan at the front of the engine. Because only the fan air is reversed, the high-pressure exhaust is always directed aft. **Net result is about 40% of Takeoff thrust for full reverse.**

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I'm going to guess right now that your teacher will say that the Genesis narrative is a ""metaphor"" for how things actually happened, and probably go into detail about how, when you look at it right, it correctly predicted scientific discoveries centuries ahead of time.

This is a common lie, but it's still a lie. It actually does **worse** than would be expected from just arranging events in a random order. 

For example, it has both whales and birds before any land animals, despite the fact that both evolved from terrestrial tetrapods. More importantly, it has plants exist before the sun, moon, and *entire rest of the universe*.

No. The Genesis Narrative is not a simplified babytalk version of the truth. It's Bronze and Iron Age speculation and bullshit which is just plain wrong, over and over and over and over and over and over again. Let's start with the fact that the Earth isn't flat and go from there. Anything it gets even vaguely close to correct is completely by accident.


Do you want to know that an accurate description of the origins of life and the universe, dumbed down to terms that a primitive goat-herding savage could understand, would **really** sound like? [Philhellenes gives an excellent example here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3xZ2vUeeU). It's full of *actual* metaphors, not just ""metaphors"".

Criminals and those proven to be mentally ill aren't (supposed to be) allowed guns so in a way we do this. I think the question largely depends on context. 

&gt; would you feel offended by people fearing you, or would you understand it?

Already happens, at least in my mind it does when walking behind some lady at night downtown and I'm a skinny, white bread, unintimidating mfer too. 

&gt; Would you find it acceptable for men to be limited from certain areas or areas at certain times

Already happens. We had a post just yesterday about some college only allowing women into the university gym at certain times. In a way I get it but on the other hand it seems ridiculous. In my view, if you want to disallow anyone access from a private business then so be it.  

&gt; Would your view on how rape is dealt with legally change, i.e., harsher or lighter punishments, etc.?

My view by and large is that people don't change especially in terms of sexual deviation. I guess I would have to say if you cross the line once it's not something we can trust you with again.   ","1370045383"

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I think it is. Personally, I was (and still am, a little) unsure to some extent before I started. Now that I've been on HRT for awhile, I realize that there is definitely a positive difference in how I feel compared to before I started. 

Dramatic physical changes take awhile to set it, and work slowly, so you'd have time to change your mind if you wanted. 

Personally, I just try to take things on a day to day basis, it works best for me. I try not to ask myself ""Do I want to fully transition?"" but instead ask myself ""Do I want to take my hormones today?"" (or ""Do I want to dress this way, or wear makeup,"" etc) 

When you look at things that way it gets easier and takes what seems like a huge burden off your shoulders a bit. The only two real irreversible concerns are fertility and breast growth - but again, you'd have a few months to decide on those before they started to become permanent. 

Once I titrated up to a certain dose the effects of HRT became noticeable (but weren't really before when I was on a much lower dose) this had a lot to do with my levels. There was a big difference when I wasn't within female levels and when I was, so this is something to keep in mind too. It had more to do with levels than time for me, but it took time to get to those levels. 

So, I think it might be worth giving it a shot if you feel positive about it. ","1370045386"

"new_right","t5_2rbsj","&gt;  In a capitalist society, any pointless work would rapidly eliminate itself.

Yes, but people counteract pure capitalist societies because left alone, capitalism produces McDonald's and Coke, not Beethoven and DaVinci.

&gt; We outperform the United States in nearly every socio-economic measure, because social liberalism delivers what it promises (material wealth). We spend a fraction of the United States on health care, with much better results.

Actually, you're wrong on both counts. If I had a serious health problem, I would not fuck around with European medicine -- here in Houston we see a steady stream of people who have realized the same thing.

Further, Northern Europe is falling apart after adopting these ideas even later than the Americans. Even more, those are tiny societies, so it usually takes longer to see effects and they are less profound.

&gt; This is a pervasive theme in Scandinavian cinema, in movies like ""The bothersome man"", of a man who wakes up in a sterile society where everything is perfectly taken care of for him but nobody is ever genuine. 

Because it's purposeless, because purpose conflicts with egalitarianism.

&gt; As strange as it may seem, the American underclass that sustains itself with extreme couponing, beauty pageants and road kill consumption is likely psychologically better off than the European underclass that is fed and sheltered by the government.

I agree here.

&gt; Right wing parties can't form a platform however on the basis of ""We don't want universal health care, food stamps and gun control because it makes us feel like domesticated cattle"" because nobody would take them serious, so this issue is never really talked about in mainstream political discourse.

There are many reasons to be against these things, but the biggest is that they're a substitute for having an actual purpose.","1370045393"

When I was like 6 years old, I took Taekwondo for like 6 months. My parents ended up taking me out because the tuition was outrageous. Later in life I found out that the master of that academy charged an outrageous price because he was the highest ranked Master in like a 100 mile radius (a 3-dan black belt, now a 7-dan Grand Master). 

Anyways, I saw Master Kim once more during middle school. I was walking out of the mall and across the street I saw Master Kim surrounded by 3 construction workers who were shoving him around. I don't know what caused the disagreement, but I was about to call the police because these 3 guys were much larger than Master Kim (probably a 5'5"" middle Korean aged man). Before I could dial though, I saw Kim put down the bags he was holding, spin and roundhouse kick one of the construction workers in the head. Then before the other two could react, he punched a 2nd in the chest, and the I could tell what he did to the 3rd... but in the end all 3 guys were on the ground within seconds.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","Here's the thing with a lot of RIS recipes you see. They don't have nearly enough roasted malts. [Here's one of my favorite RIS recipes](http://beersmithrecipes.com/viewrecipe/14451/mike-riddles-tricentennial-stout). It has an absolutely monstrous amount of roasted barley and chocolate malt, almost 25% of the grain. RIS is an extreme style and roasted barley and chocolate malt are the defining ingredients in a RIS so why skimp on them at all? It would be like skimping on hops in a double IPA. 

I think you're on the right track with your fermentables, though for a 1 gallon batch you might want to scale back a bit. IIRC, Carafa II is one maltster's name for chocolate malt so that's fine. The only thing I would change is subbing the dark liquid extract for light or extra light dry extract if you can. Dry extract has the advantage of being easier to store if you don't need to use the whole package. Light extract is much more predictable since it's made of just base malt and a little bit of dextrin malt. No one really knows what's in dark malt extract.

As far as hops, you can't go wrong with Northern Brewer, Fuggles, or East Kent Goldings in any dark beer. If you have to work with the hops you have, Warrior and Chinook are the ones to use. Remember, RIS need a lot of hops to balance out. 70-100 IBUs isn't uncommon.

Also, US-05 is my preferred yeast for a RIS since it's pretty clean and will let the roasted malts do all the talking. It is a pretty high attenuating strain but with all that roasted malt in there it won't get too dry. 

If it absolutely has to be a 1 gallon batch, I'd do something like this: 2.5 lbs Light DME, .75 lb Carafa II, .75 lb Roasted Barley, .25lb light crystal. For your hops, boil .25oz Warrior for 60 minutes, .25oz Chinook at 30, .25oz Warrior and Chinook at 10. Pitch a packet of US-05 and let it sit for a month before bottling. Age for 4-5 months in the bottle and drink. And then get sad that you only made 1 gallon because it will be great. ","1370045406"

"SRSGaming","t5_2t5qh","&gt; I'm used to Fire Emblem's amazingly terrible handling of pegasus knights.

It breaks my heart, especially because I love pegs :( Florina is my favourite because I like to imagine her as a fellow misandrist sister and ship her with Lyn. Man, the series isn't nice to her though.

&gt;There were definitely problematic aspects of the game but I'm pretty not cool with writing off the female characters despite how totally cool and empowered most of them are and then saying that Virion is acceptable when he's totally gross and manages to disempower most of the above mentioned awesome ladies.

Completely agree with this. Every FE is littered with problematic stuff pretty much, but one thing it continually succeeds with is that most (most) of its female characters are empowered in their own right, legitimately strong members of the army and perceived that way, and very badass, with diverse expressions of femininity (could be better on a per-class basis, though: Lissa I actually see as a step forward for clerics, lol). Their motivations for joining are as diverse as those of the men, and they are often portrayed as stronger than, and taking no shit from, many of said men. I feel like part of the problem with Awakening was what has been said: the everyone-gets-married-to-everyone potential, it was a bit of a step backwards when you have characters like Virion.

So idk, it pains me when the series (and its fandom) drags those women down, but I never want to see them written off as a rule, because most of them are very strong characters and that's unfair. FE is often awful about women, especially with certain tropes, but women are very important within the series' stories as central players, both heroines and villains (FE's female villains *are* generally absolutely terrible though, villains are one area where FE likes to be Disney-level simplistically problematic even outside of women tbh), and so on.

edit: Also, fuck yes. Lucina is one of the most moving and badass protagonists FE has ever had, female or not.","1370045407"

I might go and shorten that back room though, so that you're not tempted to run through it the way you did. It's not a gamebreaker, since the intended path is so similar, but ruling out that method might help drive the player toward the intended, more elegant path.

First of all, who is harmed by not vaccinating?  Yes there are those who have medical conditions that rule them out for getting vaccinated, but for the vast majority, those who get vaccinated are protected if these vaccines are all they are promoted to be.  Those who don't are placing mostly themselves at risk.

To say that those who don't vaccinate are placing others at risk is like saying the peanut butter industry is placing those who are allergic at risk just by its existence.

Second, is there FULL ABSOLUTE compensation for those who are harmed by vaccines?  Without the attorneys getting 50%?  If there isn't, then each individual should have the right to weigh the risks/rewards for themselves. (And yes there should be plenty of education on the risks/rewards)

Third, many of these diseases are deadly only if exacerbated by poor hygiene and negligent care.

Fourth, I don't think we have fully analyzed the wear-off effect.  I got mumps and whooping cough in my thirties despite being vaccinated, both were going like wildfire through an Amish community nearby that was a fairly modern-outlook group that did immunize.

My wife and I talked with a doctor about this, the doc was not all that concerned about vaccinations, especially for tetanus because our kids were running around barefoot on property that was a horse-powered farm immediately prior to us buying it, the doctor felt the kids would pick up immunity from little nicks an cuts and the residual tetanus bugs left from the horse era.  

The one vaccination the doctor recommended strongly was German measles, for obvious reasons.","1370045415"

If it makes you feel any better, I'm flooded with the same hormones and feel terrible for it, myself.  Testosterone is one hell of a hormone at 17 :(  But from what I hear, it does go away at some point in life, and you end up not feeling that way all the time.  

I don't know how open you are with your girlfriend, but it might be worthwhile to talk to her about it.  Like, if I were them, I would probably rather hear about it, but I know other people feel the exact opposite (my girlfriend gets upset if I ever talk about polyamory).

Courage does not always roar; sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day that says, I will try again tomorrow. -Mary Anne radmacher

If you end it today, you will forever fail. But if you live till tomorrow, you can say you can try again, and again, and again.

We keep giving out loans without regards for the student's likely ability to repay.

I don't blame the graduates, I blame us. I blame a society that simultaneously said ""college is necessary to get a good job"" and that it didn't matter what you got a degree in, or how hard you worked, as long as you graduated. But, as it turns out, a degree in philosophy is about as useful as not getting a degree.

Instead of telling students that if they worked hard they would have the opportunity (greater than at any point in the past) to go to a good college, study something useful, and get a good job we told them that college was their god-given right, and that they'd get a job no matter what.

Are we surprised that we end up with college as extended adolescence and graduates whose degrees aren't worth the paper they're printed on?

Thirty years ago, a college degree was proof of intelligence, diligence, and competence in a field. But when almost anyone can get into college, and almost anyone who does can graduate putting in a minimal amount of effort, is anyone surprised degrees aren't worth anything?","1370045417"

I understand what you are saying so let me add my experience. I prefer BBW/SSBBW porn and when I look at it there are certain women I'm attracted to and it is all about how they look. I can get off to some pretty G rated solo pics if the woman is attractive enough. On the other hand, if I'm looking at porn with thin women they have to be doing something else before I'm interested enough to finish. With them it is more about the act than the specific woman since her body is not exciting enough by itself to arouse me. Neither of these is a replacement for my real live wife however. The BBW/SSBBW women I find attractive aren't any more attractive than her and the thin women doing crazy shit aren't enough either. It's just that when my wife is sick or in a bad mood BigCuties and hotkinkyjo are always ready.","1370045422"

What happens afterwards though is the pertinent choice.

I really can't get behind your rad-fem/fundamentalist view that if you don't want to be a parent you must remain abstinent.  

I feel adults should be able to have sex without necessarily being forced to become parents.

I also feel that adults should take responsibility for the decisions they make and have sole control over.  I don't feel that women are special inept creatures that must be protected from the decisions they make because they're too stupid to figure out the consequences.

Apparently we'll have to disagree on that. ","1370045422"

Tell her that this is already causing issues, and you're concerned about future issues. Say that previous neighbors have complained about your enthusiastic love making, and you're concerned that this will make everyone uncomfortable. Say that you love her dogs, but you're concerned about them being cooped up in a smaller apartment and the noise they may cause. Tell them that you and the fiance tend to play loud music and it has been an issue in the past.

You should emphasize that having neighbors that sometimes annoy you is usually not a huge deal, but you're scared to do ANYTHING that would risk your family relationships. Especially now that you are about to start a life with your new wife, you want healthy bounderies and you want your new wife to have an amazing relationship with them. 

You should write this email immediately so they can back out of the lease, and keep keep KEEP emphasizing that adore her and only want to protect the relationship with the future grandparents of your children. Make up as many lies as you want, and I definitely suggest the ""loud sex"" lie because no parent wants to hear that. And apologize for hurting her feelings...her pride may push her to pursue this even if she realizes that this is a bad idea, so smoothing her ego is important. 

Placate, flatter and dissuade her. This is no time for you to make a stand ir stand up for yourself...your sanity is so much more important.

I changed power supply to 630 instead of 700 cause thats overkill unless your brother plans to crossfire/sli then change it back. Memory and harddrive changed also for price. For 50 bucks more you can get a 7870 XT video card which is like a tone down version of 7950.","1370045428"

"StackAdvice","t5_2ttk1","I'd forgotten to list both Magnesium and Inositol initially as they were some of the first additions to this stack. I initially added Inositol to address lifelong OCD tendencies, and thus far it's produced small but not insignificant effect.

I don't particularly experience debilitating depression or anxiety - certainly not enough to consult a doctor or psychologist. Early on my in my MDMA use I went through a couple of gnarly crashes lasting weeks on end that made me ponder my underlying biochemistry. I resolved to take better care of myself, employ strategies for harm reduction, and create a daily use supplement stack to facilitate quick recovery. Research lead to me discover applicable supplements and nootropics over time, and an early version of this stack enabled me to quit smoking tobacco when I had failed to persevere in prior attempts. I now spend at least 45 minutes exercising each day and maintain a balanced, consistent, primarily vegetarian diet. I'm currently holding down two jobs and still manage to find time for an enriching social life, so I don't think there are substantial psychological disorders at play.

You've definitely convinced me to lay off the Selegiline, and the longer I've taken it daily the more I've noticed disturbing symptoms - aggression, blunted emotions, lethargy, impulsiveness, etc. I'll keep it in the toolkit for threshold use in an MDMA preload stack, but I've quickly learned that it has no place in a daily stack designed for a healthy individual.

Researching cytochrome P450 has thus far lead me to a wealth of interesting and valuable information. Your unadulterated input has been helpful and very much appreciated!","1370045428"

Let's be clear that I'm not judging you, or your customers. I work in a resale environment myself - in my business, I buy items off people all the time for a fraction of what they're worth on the open market. A lot of those items are sold the same day for twice what we paid. There's nothing wrong with the business model we operate under, nor with the customers who feel the need to patronize our establishments. Neither of these facts, however, make their transaction a wise one.","1370045440"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Pittsburgh, when you look at the numbers, is basically a tweener between the typical Canadian model of a team and the typical American model of a team.

Pittsburgh is a little big city, not quite medium, but towering over every Canadian city but Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.

Furthermore, Pittsburgh is a sports town that passionately loves all of its franchises.  Watching sports is basically universally accepted by Yinzers.  I've never been in a town that loves its sports across so many social and economic lines.  The Steelers and the Pens, due to their great ownership and success, are able to punch in the heavyweight class of their leagues with maximum support financially.

For example, the ratings for the local broadcast channel, ROOT Sports, is the highest in the US.  It's not really surprising that the Penguins are able to compete with cities much larger than them in population when it comes to sports.","1370045441"

I remember in high school having the most ridiculous cognitive dissonance.  I considered myself a proud ally, taking part in Day of Silence, vocally defending gay rights, what have you, but at the same time, fully knowing, and even coming out to a few people, as being bisexual.

We lived together for years he looked up porn on my computer which had certain distinct themes, we had mutual gay friends and still didn't come out to me..

Then he moves to another town and he cuts us all off. Made a very very pretentious blog post about his sexuality and never feeling like he could fit in and admit it... *cue my hurt feelings and wtf!* 
Something about how he never felt supported being who he truly was...

I really regret not saying anything. I might have kept who i thought was a great close friend, met the arrogant selfish  'gay' persona he decided was him on the inside or maybe he would have denied it but I should have brought it up.

So they decided they did not just have to lift women, but had to hurt men to achieve equal outcomes for men and women. 

Because that is what feminism has always strived for. Equal, or better outcomes for women. 
Not equality of opportunity.

A women that is not good enough to compete even with mediocre men are still supposed to be taken seriously, and given privileges not provided to men who are equally good.

If they are treated the same way a man with the same skill-level as her (no TV-time, lower if any pay etc etc), its discrimination against women (!).

Because the outcome is not equal.

Should men be discriminated against so that women can perform comparably?

System specs: http://pcpartpicker.com/user/cybergeek94/saved/1ui8

(Different power supply—a friend sent me a 650W he had lying around; video card and second HDD aren't installed yet).

CPU is clocked @ 4GHz (100 MHz FSB x 40 multiplier)

I used Java 64-bit and gave Chunky 4GB of RAM.

Rendered with Chunky 1.11b.

Average SPS (Samples per second): 995,786 (Peaked and held around 1.1 mil for most of the time; I watched Dr. Who on Netflix for the last hour and it really killed the average)

Threads: 7 (Left one logical core open to maintain system responsiveness)

CPU held around 69C/156.2F. I was playing around with the multiplier during the rendering to see throughput vs heat generation. I just got it so I'm not looking to push it to its limits just yet. Rendering with 8 threads increases the throughput slightly at the cost of system responsiveness and a significant increase in heat. 

Server is private, for now. We're thinking of going public but I'm too lazy to install Bukkit and protection plugins to prevent griefing.

He figured the heat from the coffee would sanitize the table. That or he just wanted to bask in the sweet aroma of Mcdonalds sub-par coffee.

According to Robert Pape, who has assembled a comprehensive list of suicide attacks since 1980, suicide terrorism happens under very specific political circumstances.  One of those is that the occupied territory is occupied by a democracy.  Kurds in democratic Turkey - suicide attack; Kurds in totalitarian Iraq - no suicide attacks.  So it isn't a surprise that we don't see Tibetan suicide attacks.  We did, however, see Japanese Buddhist suicide attacks in the second World War.

Sort of the same complaint with survival. I'd like it to be a bit more strategic still... at the moment, it sounds like a tower defense more than anything. Give us a reason to expand, to explore. What resources are going to be needed? What are the tiers of units we'll be able to produce, and using what? What buildings will we need to produce said units?

At this point, the only resources are building materials and Bricktron-makers, which seems like it will lead to a game of simply building more and more walls, on top of more and more walls. Give us reasons to explore, to take risks, to expand.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","You can't put many guns high at the front because they unbalance the ship as it moves forward. The ship is like a see saw - the front and end move up and down the most - and if you have a high weight rocking up and down as it breeches the waves, some slight sideways motion like hitting a wave not totally flat on or trying to turn will cause the weight to move a lot and push the ship sideways, causing it to fall off centre and this reduces ship speed and safety. It's also practically not great because it means that the guns are very exposed in a frequently very wet forward area. However, you can't put them low on the bow because you need openings for them to fire though, which close to the water line generates a huge risk of flooding. 

You can put guns higher along the length of the ship because a) this affects the pitch of the ship much less than a clustered high weight at the front as it's spread evenly along the length and is balanced either side (it does affect the roll, but because they're balanced both sides this isn't so bad) and b) because you can put an equal or greater number of guns lower to the water, as there's less risk of flooding (it still happened, like with the Mary Rose) which helps keep the centre of gravity lower to the water and keep the boat stable. 

You also have to consider that a ship is much longer than it is wide. This combined with the limits of stacking guns up front means you have a much lower volume of fire forward than if you load guns up on the sides. This is really important because cannons aren't very accurate and enemy ships are quite big (although still small targets from a distance) with lots of parts that if I shoot don't do very much to stop them floating or sailing or shooting back: the more I can shoot, the more likely I am to hit him, and the more damage I can do faster (before he sinks me!) 

The shape of a ship also affects your vulnerability to return fire: if I'm side on, and an enemy shot goes right through me, it only goes through the width of the ship, hitting a few people and cannons. However, if I'm trying to shoot forward and I'm shot from the front in return and it goes right through, it goes all the way through the ship doing much more damage. The type of hull damage caused is also important: if I have holes in my sides, I may flood a bit and tilt but hopefully I can still run away. If I have holes in my front, I'll flood and sink if I try to run away. 

Finally, you've got ease of manoever and fire arcs. From the front, I absolutely have to be pointing at the target to use those guns. I've only got a narrow front, so the angles my guns can get to are quite limited. This is related to how many guns I've got facing forward - I could have one gun right at the front with a relatively wide angle, but it's only one gun, or I can have four guns further back which I can't tilt much because they get in each other's way or have to fire through parts of the ship, unless I have huge holes for my guns which as before means I'm at real risk of flooding at the front. If I overshoot the target, I have to turn 180 degrees to get him back under my guns. 

However, if I have guns all along my long side, all I have to do is tilt my rudder a bit and the guns right at the front of the ship facing sideways move through a big angle very quickly. It's like opening a door - the part near the handle moves a lot, but the part at the hinges doesn't move much at all. Also, because I have guns all along the side, I can angle them all very slightly to give a very wide field of fire, which at very close range doesn't matter, as they'll all hit the target, but means I can always fire some guns as I've got such a wide field of fire if I need to. If I did this at the front, there wouldn't be much point having forward facing guns as they'd all shoot slightly off to the side and not forwards! 

This doesn't even touch on how the forward chase isn't that important, as big ships simply ran down the smaller ships over time until they caught them or trapped them somewhere or the smaller ships got away; even if he gets away, he now knows I'm looking for him and am much bigger than him so he will try to avoid me in future - if he's a pirate or smuggler this is almost as good as catching him as there's now a really big area (like the whole of the English channel) he won't go in in case I find him. At sea, there really isn't much urgency - it can be days or even a week or more between seeing an enemy sail and closing enough to fire on them anyway. If you come from twenty miles away to a thousand yards behind them (your effective cannon range) you can wait a couple of hours more until you're along side and broadside them or board them. If you can't get that close, front guns won't help you anyway. If a group of big ships tried to fight another group of big ships, then there wouldn't be much chasing and the sheer number of guns you can fire becomes the most important issue - and hence favouring broadsides.

You took governmental actions that are not supported by the majority and used them as examples. The whole point of my argument was that taxation and the status quo in general is, by-and-large, supported by the vast majority of the electorate.

&gt;I am fine with democratic decision-making, so long as all parties give consent.

So, every person, without exception, has to agree with a decision, before it can take effect? *Really*?

&gt;If you're just going to repeat fallacious arguments, we're done.

I made no logical fallacy: if you disagree with the way a country is democratically run, you are not allowed to force change against the will of the majority; that's, again, is tyranny. Your only option is to leave the country, or otherwise petition leaders and vote, *while obeying the laws of the country* and paying your due share.

&gt; I am pushing a lack of a forced system.

Pushing the lack of a system on people who want a system is tyranny.

&gt;Metaphorically speaking, it's as if you just said I am imposing my (non)religion on people when I advocate for secular public policy/religion neutrality

No, you *are* pushing your non-religion on people. You are disputing their right to create governments and collect taxes with *their consent*. It is the right of the people as a collective to create the polar opposite of a secular society (i.e. Saudi Arabia) if they so wish, and you, a minority, have no authority to take their right to self-determination away by forcing them to be secular.","1370045463"

"vinyl","t5_2qh7i","When I was a kid I used to have a lot of contact with vinyl because my aunts and uncles owned a lot of it. I even had some kids albums on vinyl (Topo Gigio's stuff, haha). That was my first contact with the medium.

It wasn't until years later (2007, early 2008), wandering around Piccadilly Circus in London, when I went into a store and I saw Wilco's ""Sky Blue Sky"" on vinyl. I liked the album cover a lot, and it also came with the CD which I did not own at the time (I had downloaded the album off eMule). I thought the price was right, and I bought it. It would be a year before I actually played that album on a record player (which wasn't mine) but I liked it.

I gradually started purchasing more records, especially the ones that included digital downloads or CD copies. Last year I received a less than ideal turntable as a gift (I don't really want to get rid of it, because my family gave it to me, and it's expensive to get even the shittiest turntables here) and I started to formally get into the medium. I've bought some records, but I still don't have a decent turntable to play them. I'm hoping that will change this summer when I visit the US for a few days. 

The thing about all this, is that I truly enjoyed sitting down and listening to new music, especially if a decent booklet was included with the CDs; checking out the art, lyrics, and just listening to the whole album has always been something I looked forward to. As my mp3 collection grew, I started obsessively getting hi-res images of the cover art and filling out the details like lyrics, year, genre, etc. but I always felt it wasn't ""enough"". Records are a way to get back into all that ""music listening protocol"" I enjoyed when I was younger. I especially love when I get a record that includes an mp3 download code. ","1370045467"

Greenhouse effect is real, bc we can observe increasing radiation in IR bandwidth for CO2 re-emission. The thing is it self-saturates in this band and so temperature growth resulting from greenhouse effect is attenuating logarithmically with growth of CO2 fraction in the air. Even IPCC says that. So greenhouse effect from CO2 alone is estimated to be in range of 0.1C to 0.2C degrees -- real, but small potatoes.

So they bolted ""water vapor feedback loop"" on top of CO2 greenhouse effect that is supposed to add 4C to 5C degrees to the CO2 effect. Huh?

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; A pragmatist would say, if the government can improve things through regulation, it probably should.

 Then I am a pragmatist.

 But in another CMV thread someone said ""the ends justify the means"" and I challenged it with the problem of measurement and judgement:

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fafn1/the_ends_justify_the_means_cmv/ca8cc49

 In summary: how do you measure ""improve"", and according to who's standard?

 So when you say:

&gt; measures aimed at reducing social inequality (like progressive income tax, or unemployment subsidies) have been shown to result in higher level of life satisfaction across the board

 I'd have to ask: 1) did you _actually_ read my post and its link? Were your parentheticals written with _that much_  ignorance of my own argument? I actually argued _in favor_ of unemployment benefits and served it under your nose on a _silver platter._ And 2) how and according to whom is the result judged as satisfactory?

 Every newborn baby gets chocolate eclair? Very satisfactory. A hundred years later the historians trace the bankruptcy and collapse of that civilization to this policy, but boy were they yummy.

 Now, on issues of claims:

&gt; You make a lot of assertions here, and most of them are not backed up by scientific evidence.

 You've claimed that ""measures aimed at reducing inequality... have been shown to result in a higher level of life satisfaction across the board.""

 But you have _not_ backed this up with scientific evidence. I hold you to your own standard: produce evidence that the payers of taxes that ""reduce inequality"" are satisfied with that outcome _across the board._

&gt; there is no evidence that they shun growth when used in moderation.

 You're using a magic word that converts your statement into a tautology. EG:

 ""A policy that increases life satisfaction across the board, with no net-loss over time, is one which has been used in _moderation._""

 A libertarian, when offered a genuine win-win scenario, would always accept it. But you've written a statement which is meaningless because you qualified it with a wildcard.

 Everyone, not just libertarians, understands that economic policies have side-effects that can take a long time to appear. In my original comment, and the ""welfare"" comment I linked to, I cited an example of a ""measure aimed at reducing social inequality"" that I supported because it has been tested in many countries in many forms so that we can now construct a system with a reasonable net gain for everyone _across the board._

 You're trying to argue with a position that I neither hold, nor wanted to change OP's view to.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Crest whitestrips. My dentist, who has a focus in cosmetic dentistry, is a big fan of the whitestrips versus the more expensive procedures. The other older dentist in the practice has the same opinion.

I have very very sensitive teeth and found the whitestrips work best. The advanced seal or the 3d white ones are my favorite OTC lines. I've actually started using the professional line though, that I get through my dental office. For some reason I tolerate these way better.

Some tips things that I do, that you may find helpful:

 if you have a small mouth, just trim the whitestrips down to make them more comfortable. My molars tend to be more sensitive than my front teeth, so I cut them accordingly as not to touch any molars.  

My bottom teeth are more sensitive than the top, so I whiten the bottom less frequently.

Don't listen to the directions of the ""2x a day everyday"" or the ""60 minutes every day"". You'll end up with serious zinging pain.  Do it a couple times a week initially, just once a day. It'll take a bit longer if your teeth are heavily stained, but it's worth not having the pain.

It's a perspective statement, like ""if you laid your DNA end to end it would circle the globe"", no, you'd never actually do that, but it does give perspective.

That the comparative size has jumped from only about 1.5 months in 1994 to 7 months says a great deal about how much banks have been growing in comparison to everything else.....

If you disagree with the implications from these, this is why I ask you to do bank assets vs US assets, or bank Income vs US income for the requisite years, I assure you, the conclusion ""banks used to be large, they're becoming huge, and doing so amazingly quickly!"" will remain firmly in place.","1370045479"

I mean, I understand where you're coming from. You're not looking for something serious, and that's fine. But I also understand where he's coming from and I have to wonder how much communication is happening. You also seem to have a very one-sided view of these events...

Since having a review out day 1 is so important, these reviews would be significantly marginalized. So, if you don't want your review marginalized, you better have it good with the company. Or maybe nobody started out doing this, the situation just grew out of groups needing to give higher and higher scores to stay relevant.

"economy","t5_2qhpn","Your confusing your dislike of fractional reserve banking with my statements being incorrect. He doesn't need to take anything I've said with a grain of salt, because its all factually accurate. 

Yes, allowing banks only hold 10% of their deposits does make bank runs possible. But that doesn't negate anything I've said. My post was correct

&gt;When you take out a loan, many mainstream economists speak of money creation. More skeptical economists disagree and say that this is not money creation, it's just a loan that both parties *hope* will be repaid. It's not part of the ""true money supply"".

This is incorrect. Issuing a loan increases M1. Banks do not lend out of their reserves. They issue a loan by simply electronically increasing the amount of money in that persons account, and at the end of the day they borrow money from other banks, or the fed as a last resort, in order to make their reserves sufficient. It's not dependent on whether or not the person pays back the loan, the money is created when the loan is issued. 

You seem to believe that any measures of money beyond the monetary base (M0), aren't ""real"" money. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

I love when people say their view points are too radical to be accepted. The central bankers are misleading everyone and you've got some information the rest of us don't know! No. In reality you're a self educated 20 something that's never taken an economics class or read an economics textbook.

Also, In Shadow Dragon if you forge the might of a weapon that is effective against something it can become very powerful.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","&gt; And yet we struggle with a worldwide epidemic of obesity and diabetes.

Wait, what? I'm telling you that genetically modified crops result in more food for more people and you're telling me obesity is the big problem? There are still close to a billion people suffering from hunger, go tell them that. 

&gt; Wheat is barely even food.

[*Wheat protein is easily digested by nearly 99% of human population \(see gluten sensitivity for exception\), as is its starch.\[citation needed\] Wheat also contains a diversity of minerals, vitamins and fats (lipids). With a small amount of animal or legume protein added, a wheat-based meal is highly nutritious. [45]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat)

&gt; I'm talking about general agriculture, not just wheat.

No, you were just talking about wheat in the previous sentence.

&gt;It is remarkably easy to credit some distribution of a crop with saving some huge amount of lives, even if it's actually taken many lives compared to what people would have eaten without it.

These people were **starving** because their **heirloom crops** were **failing** them due to **drought** and **floods**. The **genetically modified crops** developed were more **resistant** to such factors and produced a **higher yield** providing the **starving people** with food. 

&gt; But it's really telling that you ignored the whole question of what percent of the population produces food, because that's really all that changes from high-yield industrialized agriculture, besides the downward effect on the quality of the food.

*facepalm* 

&gt; If we had lower yield per labor varieties, there would simply be more of us producing them - and interestingly enough, the food would be much better.

So what you're saying is if we would only try to use even more unsuitable land for growing unsuitable crops we would eventually achieve the same result? And if only we would add more labour instead of mechanized work to the food, it would be better? Yeah, tell me again how a product becomes cheaper the more manual labour is involved in producing it. 

I think the main issue here might be that where I'm talking about **hunger**, **starvation** and **efficient ways to feed the world** you seem to be worried about a loss of jobs in the agricultural sector...","1370045492"

China and Russia both have extremely limited capabilities once they're outside their local region, and thanks to budget cuts the EU nations have become the same way: they simply don't have the logistical capability to intervene much beyond their borders without U.S. help. This has been noted with concern by NATO's commanders:

"mycology","t5_2qu6q","I'm astounded by this rote and trite argument, honestly.  

It's very simple to argue against your straw man and find support amongst the throngs of newbie drug-seeking kids on the web... but that's not even the argument.

Sure, legal liability is a valid concern.  

Sure, mycophobia needs to be obliterated.  

But the bottom line here is not about whether anyone *personally* gives a shit about using mushrooms as intoxicants.  Using substances to get high is a whole subject unto itself, it's called *drugs*.  Millions of people are interested in drugs.  Many, many thousands of people are interested in mushrooms as drugs, while a very small percentage of them are actually interested in anything else about mushrooms.  

You are arguing a different argument.  You must not ""know all too well"" what you are arguing for (or against) because you are still towing the line...

This is the point, right here:  

Drug discussion is HUGE.  Mycology is small.  If you want to talk about drugs, go to one of the hundreds of sites that focus on drugs.  We link to them.  They are not hard to find, they are well populated with knowledgeable people, and they offer exactly what most of these nay-sayers seek, which is advice on dosages and toxic look-alikes and all that jazz.  That's fine. THIS, however, is a subreddit dedicated to mycology.  It's a small enough area of focus that allowing drug-related discussions would easily and quickly overwhelm the rest of the content.  

That's simple.  

What's more complex is the quality issue.  The more forgiving we are about drug-related discussion, the more frequently there will be reckless and dangerous comments by people who lack the skill and knowledge base to make recommendations of edibility of any mushrooms, and that means increased moderation due to increased stupidity and flippancy.  

I'm not alone, and it's not a complex issue... unless you simply refuse to see it.

It's not a moral thing.  It's not a personal preference thing. It's not even about liability and policing so much... it's about having a forum for science, that allows for silencing the idiots so that their voices don't get the advantage of exposure in this subreddit.  

This isn't /r/drugs, but it does exist.  Go there.  ","1370045493"

You're right, these are normal maps, but normal maps aren't the same as bump maps. For some reason, game engines don't handle bump maps very well, but they can handle normal maps just about as well as any other texture map. To the best of my knowledge, most modern game engines can handle normal maps (though they often don't use them in mobile games), but none can handle bump maps. I think bump maps are used primarily in pre-rendered media, like movies and such, though they often times just use displacement maps, or throw more polygons at it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Since there is a fair amount of negativity below regarding med school, I thought I would just offer the perspective of someone who truly has enjoyed the experience, in case this thread is changing the mind of any future doctors out there.

It's true that this career path isn't for everyone.  It's a lot of work, takes dedication, and you do have to make sacrifices.  Personally, I don't think I am any smarter than the average person - but it interests me and I enjoy learning it.  The material isn't all that inherently difficult, it's just the sheer volume of it that can be daunting.
The nervous breakdowns you might hear about are pretty rare (I think) - the admissions process has already selected a pretty hard working group of people, so most of the students are able to acclimate to the work load.  That said, there are people that do have some trouble with it.  But keep in mind, your school has resources to try and get you through - it doesn't look good for them either if a bunch of students are flunking out.  My school has something like a 99% pass rate.

If you have doubts about whether you want to go to med school, take a few years off, work at a job in the medical field, shadow doctors, take other classes, explore hobbies and other interests, and find out if it is actually something you want to go for.  If you decide that you want to apply, your application will look even better having had some experiences that kids fresh out of undergrad won't have.  

All that said, I think med school is tremendously enjoyable, the classes are fun (its hard to beat dissecting an entire human body in your first semester of school) and even though I am early on in my education and haven't been able to be involved in a lot of direct patient care, I think it is a privilege to be able to do the job.  Patients trust you sometimes more than they do their own families/spouses, and you have a role in this world that will always be necessary.

[Roundup (glyphosate) tolerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_Ready#Glyphosate_resistance) is the most common modification to crops of all kinds, including corn, soy, and rapeseed. It's been around for a couple decades now, just not in wheat. It's a modification of a single enzyme (5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate, or [EPSPS](http://www.hort.purdue.edu/rhodcv/hort640c/aromat/ar00007.htm)) common to many plants. The native form of EPSPS is found in weeds as well as unmodified crops. [Glyphosate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate), the main component of the herbicide Roundup, interferes with the enzyme. Without functional EPSPS, the plant cannot create a few essential amino acids, so it dies. Roundup Ready GM crops aren't affected by glyphosate, and continue to grow. That's the ""mutation"" everyone is so worried about.

My theory about the attention wh---s accusation leveled at women is that  many still think of women mainly as objects, not subjects. It's fine if a woman's picture is taken without her permission and uploaded to reddit, but it's not fine if she takes her own picture and puts it on reddit. In the first case, she's a thing to criticize/drool over/etc. and in the second, she's an agent.

Calling a woman who's behaving with agency an attention wh--e is a quick, easy way to 'put her in her place' as not only a sexual object, but one worthy of derision for daring to behave like a regular person (i.e. a man).

I also think a lot of the attention wh**re comments might be coming from people who have the idea that women get plenty of attention just for being women. They seem to think unwanted sexual attention is positive attention and women who want more than that are being greedy.

If you really want to quit fapping for ever or for a prolonged time (90 days or something), having a good summary about why you want to quit can help you a lot in your motivation and willpower. Try to write down why you want to quit, what you hope to achieve while you quite and do this in a list of reasons (thats how I did it at least).

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Besides the MRA thing, I actually enjoyed the article. 

I think we all should not be too angry for this. Anger doesn't help much. One important thing to remember is that the author did *not* say ""MRAs are racist women-haters in the closet"" he said: ""People who state they're MRAs in their online dating profile are racist women-haters in the closet"". This is still something I heavily disagree with, but a huge difference. 

For example: I don't dislike Christians in any way. It seems a tad strange to me, because I did not grow up with religion but I'd certainly not mind dating someone with believes I do not share. *However* I'd probably not message somebody who writes ""Jesus is extremely important to me"" in his profile. It would make me skeptic, to say the least. Same goes for politics.

Two points - 

First, since when is the military a jobs program?

Second, the ratio of ""jobs created"" to ""dollars spent"" for military related expenditures is miserably low when compared to the much higher ratio for spending on healthcare, education, and/or housing.

The corruption, graft, waste, and overspending that are involved in every aspect of military spending lead to what is called ""gold plating,"" the process through which toilet seats in military planes end up costing thousands of dollars. By contrast, expenditures for education and housing in particular see things purchased at prices far more reasonably. While the monies defense contractors receive in the form of outrageous profits go to a very small number of individuals, the localized cash flows for housing and education remain to recycle repeatedly throughout communities and so to benefit many more people.

(An aside: One more example of the gargantuan nature of the US military beast is the following. The largest air force in the world is the US Air Force. What's the second largest air force in the world? It's the US Navy's air force. It's been said that the world's third largest air force is that of the US Marine Corps, though technically the Marines are organized under the Navy.)

Whoops. I meant ""*How* does the movie use this trope?"" Crappy phrasing on my part. So, I think Psychonauts uses the trope, but its use is justified within the framework of the game. The ""how"" would be my analysis of how despite using the trope, its use was justified and how ways of designing the trope out of the game is surprisingly hard without either ruining the design of the game (because a game is not just narrative but involves gameplay) or relying on plot contrivances.

by virtue of being near the top? I act with a sense on entitlement because I work hard as fuck for my money. I work 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week for my money. I am paid salary. I probably make BARELY better per hour pay than mr 50k a year. How the fuck does it make sense to punish me for working extra hard to live within my means?

You think everyobe who makes 100k a year doesnt ""pay"" for it. Most programmers and engineers that I know all make 100k a year. they also work nearly 3000 hours a year to do that- the average full time employee works 2080 hours a year. Youre going to tell me that because all these people bust their asses 50% or more harder than any single ""average"" full time employee, he should be punished?

&gt;  I believe that the recent course of our history has demonstrated that, while we may utilize their expert knowledge of certain problems and the special facilities with which they are familiar, we cannot allow our economic life to be controlled by that small group of men whose chief outlook upon the social welfare is tinctured by the fact that they can make huge profits from the lending of money and the marketing of securities--an outlook which deserves the adjectives ""selfish"" and ""opportunist.""

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","It seemed to be like this when I first met my current boyfriend.

I was with another guy (long distance) at the time though that relationship was never really working out. I met this guy through a mutual friend and the three of us drank together. We all got really drunk and me and current boyfriend were making out behind our mutual friend's back all night. I stayed at his that night although we didn't have sex or anything, I just crashed with him in his bed. We had chemistry even before we were drunk, and both had feelings for each other ever since

We met a couple of times after that night and I kept giving him REALLY OBVIOUS hints about how much I fancied him. We'd be sitting under a tree next to each other, just talking, and I'd nudge closer to him and look into his face a lot, and was fighting the impulse to kiss him. He just stared ahead and would struggle to think of other things to say.

I understand that at the time he had no self-esteem and didn't think that any girls would ever find him attractive, especially while sober, so he just didn't believe it. We've talked about it so many times. He had his own issues to face and after hanging out a few times, even though I'd drop heavy hints that I wanted to kiss him or whatever while sober, we dropped out of contact for a long time and I got back with the long-distance boyfriend. But things changed months later. I became ill, I grew up and realised the long-distance guy was no good for me, and coincidentally the current boyfriend texted me out of the blue while drunk and we began talking again. We met up and reminisced a lot about the time we met and the following weeks and why it didn't work out... well, eventually we changed that. We're in the happiest relationship either of us have experienced and he's definitely seen through my move-making since then.","1370045522"

(View the documentary 'kurt &amp; courtney'. It's on youtube)

Courtney has obviously been an unstable person, off and on, through-out her life.  
I believe she might've tried to hire that one ugly fat guy, to kill Kurt for 50K. I also believe she hoped kurt would kill himself. 

I think the reason she wanted him to die, is because she felt Kurt's addiction was the cause for him wanting to leave her. (which she felt was unfair, because it would leave her with 'only' half the money, and she felt she had made Kurt's career possible)

I think towards the end Kurt decided not to divorce, because he knew it would drive Courtney insane and was afraid Frances would suffer for it. (be the biggest victim in it all)

I honestly believe Kurt loved Courtney, but he just couldn't deal with the 'insanity' she brought into it all.

I refrain from saying judgemental shit about courtney, because if you read-up on her life, I honestly couldn't say I wouldn't have turned-out the exact same way, or do the same things.  ","1370045526"

Go, in be calm, get a feel for it, and find your path afterwards. Out of all them, and I'm speaking with a Katie bias, so feel free to dismiss what I have to say, as you probably should, but out of all of them, I think how Katie approached it would make future negotiations go the smoothest. 

I'm not insinuating that Lexxy came out guns-a-blazin', but she made it very apparent that if guns did in fact need to blaze, she would be ready to engage. Again, totally acceptable way to approach things, but, I hate saying but, *but*, if there was a second meeting, I could see the other side having sour apples.

Contracts are kind of a game, think of it like a CCG, like Magic, only instead of depleting the other players life points, the goal is for both players to end up with the same amount of life points, while keeping that number as high as possible. If you set a precedent that says 'I'm going to knock your life points down', they're going to fire back with the same thing. To make sure both parties come out with the best deal, tact, tone, and willingness to compromise are vital.

See, it's a play on words. Vital is derived from vitality, and vitality is defined as capacity for life, living, or capacity to grow, and I was talking about life points, so, it's a pun. Get it? I feel like it needed some 'splainin.","1370045540"

"portugal","t5_2qmie","What happened to you is not out of the ordinary. ISPs in Portugal contract local companies for installations and repair. Apparently, your neighborhood is covered by a slob. I'm thinking it's not MEO's fault directly because they had your correct address. But it's still their responsibility because their business model obviously sucks for the costumer when it comes to installations and repair. 

In fact, this is only the first of similar problems you'll have (with both MEO and ZON). You may notice a sudden drop in internet speed when someone in the neighborhood installs an internet connection. This is because the 'technicians' pull the internet connection balance in their beighborhood so that they can get the publicized speed. Most building internet installations aren't prepared to distribute that speed to the high number of costumers in the place so they do this trick, which works until the person who notices the speed drop complains, and then they pull your speed up by dropping someone else's.

If you live in a place that is covered by CaboVisão, I recommend that you check their website. Technicians will still pull this trick, but their costumer service is much more attentive to the costumer and their internet connection is much more stable. The TV box thing is just as good, if not better than the others'. They also do 12 month contracts (they all do if you bargain).","1370045542"

I want to come home to you after a long day at work and just hold you in my arms and tell you about my day and I want to hear about your day, too.  Someday, I may even want to raise children with you. I want a life with you.

But I understand that you're not attracted to women. I understand that you can't change that aspect of yourself and even if you could, I wouldn't ask you to do that. But it's starting to hurt a lot to talk to you because you make me want you more and I know that I can't have you. Even just saying this, my heart is aching and tears are forming in my eyes.

I don't like that you lie to me. You've lied to me about pretty much everything at this point. You lied to me about your sexuality. You lied to me about your relationship with your roommate. You even lied to me about lying. It upsets me so much. I want you to trust me. I am a trustworthy person, I'd never give your secrets away or do anything to hurt you. It hurts to find out that you don't trust me enough to tell me things.

You're truly a beautiful person, but I want you to open up to me. I want to be there for you. You are the reason I've cried so much lately.","1370045543"

Sometimes, yes. But typically not. The thing about most government hiring is that it's VERY specialized. They're often looking for people with really arcane skills that are hard to acquire in the public sector. Attorneys are sometimes hired as contract specialists, public affairs officers and legislative liasons, but those are going to require things like substantive knowledge of Federal Acquisitions Regulations or the congressional budgeting process etc. Hiring officials might be somewhat impressed by your law degree, but if you're coming from outside the government it won't really buy you much.","1370045546"

Yes. I start the game using 'ProjectZomboid64.exe' but then the batch file starts and a window with a black screen and white text appears (similar to a command prompt but is actually a command interpreter); that's just Project Zomboid running its scripts and starting the game.

Amazing boss battle designs that terrified me every time as a kid and dungeons that make oot's water temple look like the deku tree. Some of the most original items in the game. The only part that might have been lackluster was the story, which was still arguably better than oot's ""go 7 years into the future, kill Gannon, THEN go back in time and warn zelda about Gannon"".

No? Hmm? What's that mean? Could it mean that the 'elite'(ya know, like the ~300 families that hold about half of the world's wealth and assets) actually think of themselves as higher than everyone else?

*Could* it? Of course. *Does* it? Is it more reasonable to assume that there's an entrenched culture of institutional racism here, than a determined team of racist gatekeeper elite families? What would Occam's razor suggest?

&gt; If you believe in a very vanilla worldview where underhandedness and conspiracies only take place on your social level and not higher up(where people can pay infinite amounts of money to keep things quiet and buy courts and officials ..or, ya know, assassinations), then you're fucking crazy, and you are undoubtedly wrong.

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","This is really interesting. I'm sad they didn't make mention of how people are often sized incorrectly (relative to ABTF standards) by major retailers (Victoria's Secret!). That said, it's still interesting—this kind of ties into a larger cultural awareness of how sizing often goes beyond a number. (Semi-related, maybe—the Levi's Curve ID line? It's marketed as being tailored to different types of curves/body type to ensure a fit that goes beyond just numeric size.)

Jockey's system sounds totally overwhelming and probably a bit too complex  for it to really gain traction—contrast with Warby Parker's setup of shipping five glasses for you to try (although I know that's not a perfect comparison because they're not doing any revolutionary sizing stuff)—that's a lot less overwhelming for people, and it's such an easy way to be introduced to a new brand.

But I'm really interested on seeing how bra shape may affect bras and the industry as a whole—in communities like ABTF they already keep notes on how different brands will shape the cups differently, so I'm sure there is some need for this. I guess it's just whether that need can be satisfied in an unfussy way for the consumer.","1370045560"

Germans are demonized, not the Germans of today but the Germans of yesteryear for supporting Hitler. Thus, not mentioning the depression and plundering the Allies instigated upon Germany (and the splitting up of Austro-Hungary), that led to people supporting someone like Hitler to bring them out of debt and depression (and to re-unite the German nations).

By only highlighting WW2, the establishment gets to show its image of being a ""just war"", and that interventionism is necessary to prevent such ""atrocities"" (holocaust) from taking place again. However, WW2 was blowback from WW1, and that WW1 shows exactly the failures of interventionism. The War on Terror, the Cold War, and WW2 are all directly or indirectly blowback from WW1.

To my knowledge no study has conclusively shown any sort of ""gendered"" brain. Sex dysphoria and body dysmorphia have been shown to exist, but the concept of inherent gender to the brain doesn't.

The argument in favor of the transgender label is built upon the belief that the human brain is gendered through hormonal differences in the womb. Which has yet to be conclusively proven. I am not arguing against transsexuals, as I can completely believe in a medical diagnoses of sex dysphoria or body dysmorphia.

Sure, the point here is the concept ""water"" doesn't include all the facts about water, such as that it is made of H2O, that stuff is simply not included. ""Water exists"" for example, is not as computationally complex as ""H2O exists"", since the latter commits you to more entities than the former.

I have to say I am in two minds after seeing that. It affords a great amount of narrative potential in terms of using the drift as an opportunity to tell character's stories. It also allows a justifiable quick way for characters to know deep and dark things about each-other which they would not reasonably give up and share without having known each-other for a very long time. 

I just don't know if it becomes entirely convincing from a robot interface perspective. If they are mind melded with each-other and the machine, why do they need such a physical interface to drive the machine? I suppose the answer to that would be because them sitting in pods would be boring, but I would say the mind melding process would provide plenty of interesting mechanics to the situation, maintaining sync, not falling into childhood memories of one another, etc. 

The other thing is the idea that a single human couldn't drive a very humanoid looking robot seems a little odd.

All that said, the narrative flexibility I mentioned earlier I think would probably be enough to trump the nit picking I'm doing. Especially in a movie which is about giant robots beating up monsters hahaha.","1370045568"

All it does is delete whatever is at the extension, but because no file exists there anymore, my vuze library is empty and I have nearly 2TB of media now.

Now, if your friend is done with torrents in the way that I describe, I have two ways to do it as an alternative.

First, check out /r/fullmoviesonyoutube or /r/FullShowsOnYoutube. Selection is limited and sometimes they get pulled. But if there is a movie there your friend wants to keep, try this: http://keepvid.com/

Second alternative, have your friend go to a streaming site and when they find the movie they want, refresh the page. **Don't allow your friend to hit play**. This trick only works, as far as I know, in Google Chrome. Have your friend click right click anywhere on the page, have your friend click ""Inspect Element"" **after** the page has fully loaded. Have your friend click click the ""Network"" button, nothing should be in the ""Network"" area. *Then*, click play on the video. In the Network area, your friend should see something loading. Right click that address, and open in new tab. Go back to the original tab and have your friend refresh. It should start a download, or open up *only* the file in that new tab. (If the second option happens, have your friend right click and ""Save file as..."", if nothing happens, refresh the tab with the file in it)

Always have your friend run a virus scan after downloading anything. If anything was unclear, your friend can request a screenshot of what I do to make it more clear, I'd be happy to help.","1370045569"

[...evolutionary precursors of modern apes and people diverged from ancient monkeys...](http://web.archive.org/web/20110715172009/http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/117352/apes_monkeys_split_earlier_than_fossils_had_indicated/)

If Old World monkeys and New World monkeys are both monkeys, but our ancestors split from the Old World monkeys, then obviously we are monkeys, too.

[Simian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian) is the proper term for both Parvorders Platyrrhini and Catarrhini. So, I suppose you could say apes evolved from simians as did the monkeys, but that is awfully pedantic.

I don't understand how it came to be this way, but people like you choose to ignore the reality of the situation in favor of a word that carries more ""evolutionary"" weight to it. As though we were too high on the ladder to be referred to by such a lowly name as monkey. Obviously we're apes. No, GREAT apes. And obviously humans are at the tippy top greatest of the great apes.

No, we're fucking monkeys.","1370045569"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","What you said didn't make any sense at all. There is a difference between salary and tip. Waiter, barber, taxi driver. Regardless of if their salary is ""enough"", all of them get paid a salary for doing their job, and if they were especially friendly while doing it, making the customer feel good, then the customer would tip them.

Salary--&gt;Bringing food/drinks, taking orders, cutting hair, driving
Tip--&gt;Being friendly while doing the above

In the case of delivery drivers...

Salary--&gt;Driving pizzas around town
Tip--&gt;NOTHING

The way you word your comment, you make it sound like the driver isn't required to drive to your house, but he did it out of the goodness of his heart, so you tip him. That is so dumb. The driving is his job. You don't tip people for doing their job. You tip them for the extra awesome they are while doing their job. A barber can cut your hair really well, but if he continually calls you an asshole the whole time, you can bet he isn't getting a tip, even though he did his job perfectly. A taxi driver can get you to your location on time, but if he is excessively rude to you again and again, why tip him?

The delivery driver has no opportunity to set himself apart as a friendly, awesome driver. By your logic that you should tip someone just for doing their job, then we would be tipping every single person ever. Tip someone for ringing you up at the store, tip someone for welcoming you to Walmart, tip someone for taking your drive through order.

Your logic is stupid. If you look at all the people we tip and WHY we tip them, delivery drivers are the odd man out. The rest of the people we tip, we do it for the same reason, and delivery drivers don't fit in that category.","1370045572"

I don't think height has much of an effect on most porn videos. I think some people are just self-conscious about their stats. So you shouldn't be worried about your dick, brah.

Also notice this, ever seen a 7"" or 8"" length penis go all inside a petite girl? I haven't. If it can, that guy is lucky. Id rather be able to stick my whole penis inside a vagina than just half of it. Seems to make things ""feel rad"", ya dig?

Yet...

Observational evidence seems to discredit the theory.  Racism isn't just about race.  Racism is about differences.  Look at how 'racist' people are over zip codes, area codes, neighborhoods, and cultures.

There is no getting around it, our differences make our presence intolerable for those who are different from us.  This behavior is ingrained in the nature of not just homo sapiens, but all animals.  Differences split societies, tribes, cultures, and even small groups.

Even within the same small group, differences polarize people into 'racists'.  They may not be concerned with the color of skin, but they are concerned with the differences.  Differences of opinions, ideas, rules, goals, and other various errata, break up even small tightly knit groups of people.

Since humans are unlikely to meld into one harmonious group, differences will always and forever polarize our interactions.  You may not call it racism, but that's what racism is at heart.  The polarization of differences, is racism.","1370045578"

The biggest danger I see here is drawing an artificial line between Meth and Coke. They both have dangers; Meth is more addictive and potentially neurotoxic(actually, combined with cocaine this is negated), but Cocaine is more cardiotoxic. Anyway, my point is that if you draw an arbitrary line between ""safe"" and ""dangerous"" drugs, you could end up being addicted to a ""safe"" drug because you kept believing the lie that is was ""safer"" than some more ""dangerous"" drug. This is part of why people get addicted to prescription painkillers. I hope this makes sense. ","1370045581"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Hey, thanks for your reply. If you could find the notes from that talk, that would be really appreciated as I'd like to read through them. 

Now, i do not understand how changing the mandate from ""lessen"" suffering to ""eliminate"" suffering affects the idea of comparing a non-existent to an existent state. In either case, there still appears to be an implicit comparison being made. If I am eliminating suffering, or any state, then it is presumably in comparison to the state in which that suffering exists no? This still leaves the argument problematic from the point of view I explained earlier, namely that the properties of existent entities cannot sensibly be compared to the ""properties"" of non-existent entities.  

If you could explain this point further, I would appreciate it.","1370045598"

&gt;Don't get me started. We'll probably agree on most all points here. You'd &gt;probably be surprised how many cops are sick of this. 

No actually, I'm surprised by how many *aren't*. Why LEAP's membership rolls aren't bursting with names. If *anyone* is in a position to see first-hand... but I think maybe it's because many LEOs just don't make the connection between the national enforcement efforts and... the national results.

However, most LEO *Unions* are very much pro-drug-war. It even makes sense - ongoing prohibition means job security.

I'm not going to quote the last... half... of your post there, but I will say a lot of your observations are probably very fair. (I will also say I would never come storming up to an armed man in a badge, crossing or pressing crime tape, to demand *anything* ;) )

Your last paragraph... is really good. And makes me feel good about *you*, but I think you are the exception nationally, and you shouldn't be. 

Going back to the top - I did allow as how a prominent and visible police force probably (almost certainly) had/has some deterrent effect. I don't argue that. But that wasn't my main point - when the deterrent effect fails, so do the police at preventing crime. If your mere existence isn't enough (the deterrent) then nothing else you can do can save my speakers from being carted out my jimmied back door, or stop the window of a friend's car in my driveway from senselessly being vandalized, or... other, worse things that I again will not get into. Ultimately that responsibility is mine, and sometimes you just *can't* prevent it. The window in the driveway is not important enough for me to patrol my front yard 24/7, etc etc etc.

Kind of rolling off-topic/thread here. ""You don't know"" isn't a valid reason to stifle questions and public investigation. I know that's not what you really mean or meant to say, and that's not what I took away from your argument... but I want to reiterate that even if there are horrible secrets that you don't learn until you have three years of service (Santa IS real, and he rapes underage kidnap victims and forces them to cook meth!), that is not a blank check to violate oaths, lie in official reports, cover for fellow officers, etc. 

""Oh, just let him arrest that mouthy guy - he had a bad week."" No. No. No. 

And even that is not what you're saying, but hopefully somewhere in the middle of what we're both saying we both understand what we mean.

I'll leave you with this - I don't have to have a medical degree to expect fair and honest treatment from my doctor.

We have 8-10 people ages 23-35, most married, every Saturday and we rotate through games. A GM will complete an arc over several weeks to a couple months then the next GM will step up with his or her game and run an arc and so on. 

Gaming interest with our group was so high that we've splintered into another 4 smaller groups. Mondays alternate between a 3+ year D&amp;D campaign, Hunter, &amp; now Werewolf for the D&amp;D weeks when one of the members can't make it.

Fridays alternate between a Shadowrun group one week and Pathfinder the other.

And yes, all but the Monday group is in our friend's basement and yes, his dad lives with him, but it's his house, not dad's. 

Parties are drunken debauchery. Halloween will be hard to beat. The girls were taking shots out of each other's cleavage and the guys were taking shots out of each other's groins. The fat guys were doing shots out of each other's cleavage, as well. I fucking love our parties.","1370045614"

2. Anomalous Derby Extra Super Stainless shave (couldn't replicate)

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think the definition of evil is well established. You ask it like it's never been asked or adequately answered. I disagree it's an arbitrary construct of the human mind. The word may be that defines the meaning or what more importantly that applied meaning means to an individual but the concept is well established.  Any kind of immoral behavior we now know has been intrinsically linked to our evolution but moreover our social evolution. Certain acts don't contribute to the natural flow and ebb of nature and are recognized as destructive and grouped and labelled as such by creatures cognitive enough to have that capacity. If you go around mindlessly killing your kin, someone in that group will attack you, kill you or at least banish you from the group. What we define as evil I'm quite sure is clear cut among us humans. Yes you could apply it to some aspects of the animal world but they are rare and they do for the most part either regard each other as food or maybe engage in some symbiotic behaviour, not go on mass pogroms and killing sprees killing those who believe in another magic man in the sky.

Of course nature isn't evil, it does what it does and our interactions with it are mostly not by any choice on our part when it's rough out. But there have been many things in our deep and dark roast and even more recently where you would say that someone or a group of people are evil, for they behave without morality as is established in our social norms as humans. So a recognition of evil is inherent, instinctual and such behaviour is counter productive to peaceful survival  and solid reproduction as a social group of animals. We're not out of that animalistic cycle, we just think we are.

The same with good, we recognize good since it's beneficial to us in some way. Making a barrow that carried a ton of wheat back to the group was good, people worked less, ate better and it had a positive impact on people. That is good.' Again, not a construct in the mind but a physical entity that has some kind of positive action or outcome. 

No reason to add the tag evil to the natural process of decay, I mean no one would say it was evil for someone to have lived, no matter how fucked up an individual is, it's life, shit happens. More a case I think for proper education on that front. But I think that good and evil are very much part of our hard wired brains and Science backs this up.","1370045618"

I don't see how they left out the fact that foreign moneys can be so damn easily injected into an already corrupt as hell system. Corporations are people too? What a kick in the balls of then entire system. Jefferson knew, we should have listened to him. 

The problem is, once you give out power, it's nigh impossible realistically to curtail it. If you look where corporate law started and where it is now, it's fucking unbelievable. The whole thing needs trashed and rebuilt from the ground up. Just like we need a simple yet effective as hell tax code. We will never get that until we take all the money out of the political system. 

We're not doing shit about that particularly problem, we have whores for representatives, simple as that. What's the job pay? Really? How much do they spend to get elected? Seriously? The math does not add up unless it's to explain corruption. 

We have the technology to create a very modern system for election that's fair, more open to fresh ideas and minds. 

You know what kills me? We should be in space by now. As in it's a day to day thing for the average Joe and Jane to work there. It's the jackpot of resources, it redefines everything and everyone. Human life becomes a precious thing that even the most villainous can appreciate. We are so seriously fucking ourselves over by not going balls out with education and space programs. 

We need to treat education like sports and sports like education. We need to turn the war machine into a space machine. The returns are infinitely better, literally. We are fucking around here over scraps when there is a super mall of shit at close out discount prices waiting for us just above our heads. 

If I was a billionaire industrialist, I would be super pissed about these sycophantic bitches in government giving me back the utility money in an attempt to fawn over me, and then the damn lights and water get shut off. You stupid fucks, you can't tax me enough to even annoy me, because I make so much god damned money it doesn't matter. If I want more, I just shit out a new idea, it's that fucking easy for me. 

What I want from you dopey sons of bitches is to make sure the infrastructure doesn't fall apart under me as I'm driving my amazing car around with the hottest woman on the planet sucking my cock. I need employees that are educated. I need SMART people out of this vast gene pool, not just the inbred fucks who've come from generational money who couldn't wipe their own asses. Fuck that retarded gene pool. I want it from the working class, from those who have had to struggle, THOSE are where the finest genetics come from, STRIFE mother fucker, use it. 

In order to tap that awesome resource we need to educate them, then they become worth something. Got poor people?? Good, lets put them to work, but we need to train them. 

You do know that an educated, employed population can buy more of your dumb assed shit, right? They can even pay for it without going in debt. I want them successful so that they can jack my success up in return through the fucking roof. If you are on top and you raise the bottom, YOU GO UP.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Heavy recommendation for Fringe if you haven't checked it out yet. For a bit of other sci-fi, Battlestar Galactica and all three Stargate series are pretty excellent. The first few seasons of Sliders are entertaining as well.

If you're a Joss Whedon fan, I urge you to check out Firefly, Dollhouse, and if you end up liking those two, Buffy. The first season of Buffy is cornball city, but it gets much better from there. Since you're a Supernatural fan, I'm sure you'll like it.

Doctor Who is pretty damn great. Sort of a sci-fi fantasy blend. The first few episodes are a bit cheesy, so don't start judging until you get a bit into it.

I'm sure you've seen the X-Files before, but if you haven't, you need to. The original Twilight Zone is pretty awesome too, if you don't mind older television.

A few that I have in my queue but I can't give a solid recommendation for (since I haven't watched them yet) - Alphas, Robin Hood, Being Human, and Farscape.

"Parahumans","t5_2x7ww","&gt; I don't recall reading it, but do they go appear in a certain order?

Endbrigers never appear twice in a row, but otherwise there's no particular order. The last attack was Leviathan, so the next one's going to feature either Simurgh or Behemoth.

&gt; I read that they were expecting another attack soon and that there were more likely target areas.

The Endbringers attack roughly every 3 months, and the last attack was two and a half months ago in-story, so the next one will be here pretty soon. Defiant and Dragon worked out a program that can vaguely predict the location beforehand, but so far all we know is that the next attack will be in Europe.

&gt; So I assume they must hit areas they haven't hit before, or not in some time?

Correct. No city has ever been hit twice by the Endbringers. We don't know if this is an actual ""Rule"" that the Endbringers follow or if it's just a coincidence, because most cities never recover after being hit.","1370045628"

"science","t5_mouw","There isn't anything particularly difficult from a conceptual point of view about building a larger vehicle to get the parts for a Mars mission up there.

The problem is that obviously we don't have any super-heavy lift vehicles of that scale in service right now.  Saturn V was successful but was cancelled.  The N1 never made it out of the development stage.  Energia was successful but was cancelled.  Nova was never even built.  The cost of Saturn V led to its abandonment and the cessation of production in 1968, before man had even landed on the moon.  With hindsight and the relative failure of the Shuttle to deliver on its promised capabilities, that might well have been a bad decision but that's the situation we have to work with.

Of those, Energia might be the easiest to resurrect given than at least some parts of it are still in use today and in certain configurations it could lift more to orbit that Saturn V.  The reality is that bringing a new super-heavy rocket into service, even if it's based on an existing design would be incredibly expensive.  They would also only be used for a very limited number of launches so you wouldn't have the advantage of spreading the cost out across a large number of rockets.  Saturn V only flew 13 times (including tests) compared to more than 1,700 launches of Soyuz variants.

The best bet for a very large Mars mission would probably be to assemble it in orbit from more modest payloads.  If the Falcon Heavy goes ahead, it would be a much more cost effective option for larger structures, even if it can't match Saturn V.","1370045631"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","**This turned into a wall of text rather quickly, there's a TL;DR if you can't be arsed!**

I know it's not exactly cool...but I've been in aaalmost the some boat from his side and fell for a friend harder than i have before or ever will. She came to me for advice with her boyfriend at the time, and when they split, other lads. Always talking of how much they'd fucked her over and one day I told her it didn't have to be like that, that i loved her and had done for a while. I asked if she'd give me a chance, if she'd ever let me show her how happy I could make her and she said no, we're just friends. 

So i saw how fair an answer that was and done my best to stay friends.

It absolutely killed me hearing about how much these other people had hurt her. 

Around october, after 6 years, we had a massive falling out and in december i told her if i didn't have a chance then we couldn't be friends anymore(this is a heavily simplified, less dramatic version of what happened). 

It was easily one of the most cunty things i've ever done, but atleast this way she doesn't have to worry about what i'm thinking or feeling, and feeling like she has to hide things from me incase i get jealous. And atleast this way I don't have to sit and grin and bare it hearing about how bad other people treat her when i *know* full well I'd never do anything to wrong her. We  were both so close and had so much fun together that we would genuinely have randomers stop us in the street and tell us how happy we looked together. To me that was a ""why don't you see this?!"" and to her that was a ""Well, guess i'll stop having fun for a while and blame it on you loving me.""


At one point, talking to my best friend I did say that i'd ""put in all those years, and for what?"" but to me it's never been a ""I've been nice, give me sex"" thing. It was all about doing what's best for us both in the long run even though i knew she'd hate me for it. 



That's just the tip of the ice burg. The full tale involves losing almost all my friends, and having people i'd considered my friends flat out stabbing me in the back and doing things with complete disregard for others feelings or possible consequences. 

As much as it sucks to say, you could really consider yourself lucky that you don't have to go through years of not knowing how to deal with a friend, and that by him not talking to you, it's potentially saved you from a *lot* of arguments and fights. 


**TL;DR - It's not always as simple and shit as it seems, and as much as it fucking kills you at the time, it could be for the best. It's not so much a case of ""what's the point in being her friend"" as much as it's a case of how much it hurts outweighing how much effort it takes to hide it**

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.
The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'
The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.
She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'
To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'
'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.
'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","It also has consequences with regards to the movement of goods within the economy. If it were now possible to acquire the ideal item, less transactions for potentially good items would occur over a time period as top players finish their gear, i.e: accelerated progression. This is bad as you want a constantly flowing economy where players constantly use orbs to craft gear, fail and repeat but produce reasonable gear for others to use in their quest for a perfect piece (thus currency shifts and leaves the system).
  
  
(Contrary to popular belief that exalteds sit in your stash, they actually do get used frequently by top players be it for maps or for crafting attempts - Some of the top HC players are in a constant cycle of crafting and upgrading every time they see a potential upgrade.)
  
  
In the short-term, this is somewhat beneficial as good gear becomes accessible to all stratas of the economy to some degree thus vastly improving gameplay for those in the lower stratum, but in the long term we should question ""Is this healthy for the longevity of the game?"". Additionally, as good gear becomes more commonplace, the invisible hand ensures that their value will stabilize as well i.e: you will sell goods you find for lower amounts and thus you will craft less.
  
  
In effect, the Eternal Orb as a crafting item has absolutely no relevance to casual/newer/non-rich players because they can neither afford to use one nor should they as the opportunity cost is greater than the marginal benefits. And for the established players, it is a terrible item (well not terrible for us, but quite the misplaced item) because no barrier exists for them to now perfect their item (risk - bricking items). These individuals will also recoup their initial capital investment via mirror services.

"AskNYC","t5_2uqch","Based on *my* experiences as a long time New Yorker, it's *really* easy to ""date"" (find sex), but if you're looking for an actual relationship, you should make your peace with dying alone here.

The problem is, there's no real motivation to put in the work a real relationship requires. Since there are so many options in your face every day, any relationship can appear disposable. This includes ""friendships"" as well. The whole New York cultural experience is based on it's disposability and finding the next best/cool thing/person/whatever.

Another aspect I haven't seen mentioned as of the time I wrote this is the scary reality that even if everything seems to be aligned and there are no problems, there's still that nagging feeling that there could be someone even *better* out there. Are you settling? What if you're settling?!  
 
Lets be honest, there are a LOT of attractive/talented/interesting people in NYC, and no matter how attractive/talented/interesting you or your SO are, there's a strong chance that someone even better is out there. As someone else mentioned, a lot of the little things people like are already in alignment when you meet because it's a pretty homogenous scene here. Not everyone is the same, but in a city this big you're bound to find thousands upon thousands of people with similar interests. We're not snowflakes.

*This* in my opinion is one of the biggest problems with ""dating"" in New York. No matter how good someone seems, there's always someone better and everyone here wants the best, but rarely is anyone sure they found it. ","1370045652"
"science","t5_mouw","You're obviously new to how download site ads work.

In designing a non-user-targeted ad on a download site, there are a number of steps:

1. Go to the site. Take a screenshot of the download button. 

2. Put the download button in the ad.


If it isn't obvious enough, make the download button look more official than the official one.

I've done adverts for dozens of upload sites (back when I worked for Ask Jeeves) and we'd have a ""download manager"" that actually downloads the file you want, but also a toolbar you didn't.

There are very specific algorithms to determine the ad you're most likely to click on. I believe 1.70% was the cutoff point for the download button, and instead using directive ads. Just because you're in the ""directive ads"" category, doesn't mean you can make the assumption that they don't exist.","1370045652"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","Heaven and Hell

First off, I want to say that anyone who is being honest with themselves will tell you that there is a lot we don't know about Heaven or Hell.  What I tell you I believe is based upon many years of my study.  It doesn't mean that I am right, it is just the conclusion I have come to.  Also, it is worth noting that the presuppositions that many people have about both Heaven and Hell are completely un-biblical.  Often, it is very difficult to remove these preconceptions.

The major thing I believe is that living people are currently experiencing Heaven (and Hell). the ""gospel"" of Jesus and John the baptist was that ""the Kingdom of Heaven is a hand"". Now Heaven is just short form for the Kingdom of Heaven, which is really the Kingdom of God (as Jews often don't like to say God).  

Now the kingdom of God is clearly not like an earthly kingdom. However, there is one similarity.  A kingdom is in essence, the extent to where the King's authority reigns. I believe that since God is spirit, that his territory is spiritual.  In essence, I believe that situations are either within his authority, and kingdom, or they are not.  When a situation is not under God's will and authority, we can that Hell.

Now many times in the Bible, different metaphors (and most are clearly metaphors) are used to describe Hell. 

1. Hell is often described as a trash heap outside of Jerusalem (gehenna), and place where fire and the worm destroy eternally.  This is because there were obviously always rotting things being eaten by worms there, and they constantly burned their trash. This metaphor is used to describe something as wasted, or cast aside, or without value.  It is not used to describe torture.
2. Hell is also describes using either flames or a lake of fire.  Due to Dante's inferno, we often equate this with some sort of heat torture.  However, in the Bible, fire is often used as a symbol of refining, as in refining precious metals to make them pure.  In the old testament, prophets asked to have burning coals placed to their lips to purify their words. This symbol is used to reflect purification.  Symbols of evil are said to be thrown into the fire forever, representing eternal purification of these evils, but people thrown in are expected to come out purified.  A similar concept to this was eventually turned into the Catholic purgatory.

Now as for the afterlife, I have very little idea of what it will be like.  One thing I am pretty sure of, is that nobody will be tormented forever due to a finite amount of evil.  Personally, I think that similar to our situation now; we will be able to choose whether or not to submit to God's will from moment to moment, but hopefully we will chose God's will more often.

Ultimately, I think this ties into the reason we are here on earth, and not born in Heaven.  Being born in Heaven would mean very little, as we would be just as likely to go back and forth, and would still need to develop our character.  I think our characters are the ultimate end, and the ultimate reality in this world.","1370045659"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; we did remember to do the 20-25% thing in restaurants.

Uh, whoa.  That's a little off.  I guess it's understandable since you don't live in the USA.

In a restaurant, you could tip really high, like 50% or 100% if you're a celebrity.  However, for *normal* people, you're expected to tip 0% or 10% for poor service, 15% for normal service, and 20% for high quality service.  I sometimes will tip 25% or even 30% at my local Denny's -- that restaurant should be the exact opposite of ""high quality,"" but since I go 2 or 3 times a month, know the servers by name, and generally sit for 2 or 3 hours while I read a book, it's a special exception.  For most other restaurants, I tip 15% for the standard boring normal service.

As for delivery drivers, it's usually less, as they're not providing full restaurant service.  For a pizza &amp; drinks that cost $10 to $25, I just tip $2.  For a delivery that costs more than that, it's $3 or $4.  I haven't done the math on it to figure out what percent every tip is, but I suspect that I'm tipping just 10% or even 5% most of the time.

Some Redditors here will tell you that I'm tipping low.  Some people tip 20% all the time as a matter of principle &amp; pride.  However, I have no principles around tipping high and derive no pride from it.  So, I look at service and tip accordingly.

Next time you're in the States, maybe drop your tip amount from 25% down to something slightly less.","1370045660"

I move in. The kid is two. I realized within a week that this poor kid had a problem. I read. I research. I test the kid. He sits on my lap while I show him videos on the alphabet, no verbal reaction. He loves them, but does not say a word.....he's never said a word. People tell me stories of kids that don't speak till they're 3 or 4. This is different. I am the only one who acknowledges it. Grandparents, father, mother and friends do not admit that anything is wrong. I try to tell them. I try to tell them the child needs help. Needs help now. He is in development. I yell at them. My girlfriend hates me for it. We fight, we fight. She's in denial. I leave. She fucks her ex-boyfriend. I leave for good. 2 years later, kid gets diagnosed with severe autism. Denial and embarrassment of children with mental disorders is real. It is like trying to reason with a Jehovah witness. I have no idea how the kid is doing now. We don't talk. He'll have no idea who I ever am. But, I worked with him everyday for 6 months and taught him to point to every letter in the alphabet and count blocks up to 10. Love that kid.  ","1370045663"

You can grab an ion used on ebay/craigslist/pbnation for $100-$150. IMO it's a huge improvement over the spyder fenix.

ProTip: If you're not into the used thing, ANSgear sells a ""new"" version of the ion (still old, but its never been used). ANS sexed it up a bit with some custom milling, and slapped a $215 price tag on it. Still a pretty damn good deal though.

We get beat on the boards, but we win the turnover and three-point battle. Woody completely gave up on our identity, putting Melo at the 3 with Kenyon and Tyson, and it just didn't work. If Spo plays a Chalmers/Cole, Allen, Wade, James, Bosh lineup, I don't think there's anyway they can keep up with you. He just has to stick with it...hopefully it'll work out.

This will make it easier for the person to make DotA friends and interact with the community. An interrelated community is great for the game, and helps it grow immensely.

Another reason, is that the game is not fully ported, has a lot of bugs and things that needs fixing, and Valve has things in mind they want to improve and add. They  cannot make the game officially released, otherwise it will get bashed by many reviews and players. Keeping the beta keys, helps remind people that this actually still a beta.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I have done this countless times (through most releases). I haven't even installed Ubuntu 13.04 from a release ISO. I just upgraded from the beta. Currently I am in 3.9.2-pf kernel (supported by neither Ubuntu nor AMD). If you know how to revert back (5. Reset Everything), you don't have to worry too much. 

If you are worried about not being able to do anything if things break, you can install classic desktop (as a backup), it works even if catalyst drive breaks (except one).

Well, if you get ""The system is running in low-graphics mode"" (which is the worst error), you can switch to integrated graphics card (Intel) using following command.

        sudo aticonfig --px-igpu

This mode does not break (huge props to intel). I even tried AMD's new supposedly working with Xorg 1.14 beta drivers (catalyst-13-6-beta), and I could not get it to work without downgrading (intel and libudev drivers) as in  section 2.g.

It's true that these schools have grown to adopt predatory practices, but originally I think they filled that niche for people who just needed that degree on their resume.

The other reason: there is a demand for it. Having a college degree is a requirement for many jobs these days and there isn't enough capacity in traditional schools, and many people aren't qualified for admission.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt;Illegal to do it young in the US, many countries around the world have the freedom to do so.

Many countries around the world also hang homosexuals from cranes. ""Freedom"" to violate the rights of others is subjugation. 

&gt;And I guess you believe it is also unethical to give those children shots to save their lives too?

No; there are justifiable reasons to interfere with someone's body and not-so-justifiable ones. Life-saving procedures fall under the former category while genital mutilation falls under the latter. 

&gt;it is up to the parents to decide what is best for their children. We can't do that for them, no matter how much we want to.

Society collectively already decides what's good for children, which is why child protection agencies exist.  

&gt;Yeah impact on male function? Bullshit, Im circumcised. I see no problems with my penis

The studies linked are rather clear; if you have better evidence feel free to share. In the meanwhile, not only are you only one data point, how would you know *if* you had any problems if all you've ever known is a circumcised penis? 

[If you ask a circumcised man and an intact to rate a sexual sensation from 1 to 10 and they both give the same number as answer, it doesn't mean they felt the same thing—it just means circumcised men's sensation threshold has been adjusted downwards](http://i.imgur.com/zhPNURn.png)

As I already said, circumcision destroys the most [fine-touch sensitive parts of the penis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06685.x/full), as well almost always excising [the frenulum which is one the two most erogenous parts of the penis](http://i.imgur.com/sutZ3RJ.jpg) along with the corona of the glans. Do you understand what that means? Circumcised men are missing a part of the penis that is as sensitive as the most sensitive part of the head of the penis. 

[Circumcision also utterly destroys the healthy mechanical function of the penis](http://i.imgur.com/3WqZFhG.gif) making it much more difficult to stimulate. An intact penis can be stimulated frictionless without the need for lubrication and it creates a seal that prevents the penis from scooping out lubrication during intercourse. The gliding action of the foreskin stimulates both the foreskin itself as well as the glans. 

[Even what's left of the penis after circumcision is not safe.](http://i.imgur.com/EEDHWby.jpg) Circumcision exposes the fragile mucous membranes of the glans and the inner foreskin remnant to dehydration and friction, which bury surface-lying nerve endings—which is how they are usually arranged on mucous membranes—under thick layer of dead skin cells. And there's also of course [all the other complications that can occur](http://www.circumstitions.com/Restric/Botched1sb.html)

Finally, circumcision could also reduce the length of the penis from 8mm to 19mm (the link is pretty tenuous) and it [certainly reduces its girth.](http://i.imgur.com/XjDeHMv.jpg)

Skills that work:

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I can already tell this thread is going to be full to the brim with ""lies, damned lies, and statistics."" And the words ""can't throw money at it"" will be spoken by at least one person.

The truth is, we spend a lot on education, but there are others who spend more, especially as a percentage of our GDP. It can be debated whether or not those comparisons matter, but the most important fact is that the poorest districts receive dramatically less than rich districts, even though they need dramatically more in order to deal with the problems in their communities. That, I think, must matter. Whatever everyone is going to say about how much we spend, how much teachers make, how much pensions cost, or how many dicks administration should eat, teachers know that there are things the kids need which require money, and teachers have been warning us for decades that poor kids in particular are being left behind. It's always poor schools that turn out to be ""failing."" Charter schools are not the answer; listening to teachers for once, however, would be a good start towards finding some answers. They won't be easy answers. Money will only be the start. But money makes the world go round. No plan will ever be serious that starts with the assumption that if the answer is too expensive, it won't be worth it. If spending whatever it takes is ever worth it, it's worth it for education. It's the one thing that drives the entire economy.","1370045684"

The great icy canyons of Aquon, the oceans of Earth, the rocky mountains of Derrion. A seemingly infinite number of spectacular locations and experiences. But I don't regret any of it, I do what I believe to be right.

For the life of me I cannot understand the way the Julians think. It is foreign to me, to the human mind. Our milky way is host to 300 billion stars and countless more planets. Why do they feel the obligation to attack and colonize inhabited worlds? I will forever remain ignorant of their motives and beliefs, but I will not remain indolent.

There are a myriad of peoples across the galaxy living out their lives. Many oblivious to the existence of life beyond their home. Worried in their own affairs, blessedly ignorant of the threat of the galaxy. Each species out there is a unique miracle of chance and evolution. From the super advanced Cerrks to the tribal people of Seannes. I have fought innumerable battles against the Julians, to stave off their hunger for death and their wish to become the only race in the galaxy. I have fought alongside the orignal people of Earth, how beautiful they are; the giants from Verion, the curious water people of Nieva, the brave and courageous people of Tanaran and many other unique examples of our diversity. They each fight for themselves, for their need to survive, for the hopes of their people and for their dreams of the future.

As long as the Julian race exists I will fight them. I will join every army out there for the single reason of defending our right to live. I will show them where the line is drawn. I will stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves.","1370045684"

How much time it takes depends on how that person is learning. Learning through doing could take years before they've done enough to be truly proficient.

I start learning programming concepts 15 years ago, been using PHP as my primary for more than 5 years, and I'm still learning new ways to do things. Anyone who knows PHP might get this one: Until a few months ago, I had no idea about &lt;?=$varname?&gt;

Choosing between someone with 3 years experience with all of it in the desired language vs someone with 10 years experience in a wide variety of languages but none of them desired comes down to the schedule of the project: Can your deadline afford the extra few months at the start needed for the experienced person to learn and adapt vs the time it could save over the next 2 years?

One of my answers I give to my boss when I'm asked about solving a problem myself in a different language (example: Writing a GUI vs hiring someone to write the GUI), my answer is: I can do anything given enough time to learn it.

The other thing people don't seem to realize is that the vast majority of people who use drugs, even the addictive ones, are not addicts and will never be addicts.

The demonization of drugs and drug users has lead to almost unfathomable damage to western society and culture. 

The article posted by OP is a part of this mythology, which is why the kind of debate happening in this thread is actually kind of important.

B: but [dog bite fatality statistics] - those aren't voluntary. A: still skewed/inaccurate. B: how? A: misidentification. B: but when people are killed the dog is identified by a vet... A: breed can't be identified by the way a dog looks. B: not even by a vet? A: not even by a vet. 

B: but even if we say half of the pitbulls in the stats are misidentified, that still leaves them far ahead of any other breed. A: well, there's also the fact that pitbulls are attractive to unsavoury people who train them to be vicious. 

B: I still think that even taking those factors into account, pitbulls come out far ahead of any other breed in the stats. A: I disagree. 

B: it seems we are at an impasse. A: Yes, we are. ","1370045688"

It's probably fruit/vinegar fly larvae as that is what is normally attracted to kombucha and vinegar brewing. I would recommend making a simple homemade bottle trap for the flies similar to what is shown [in this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf377HNgFtY) but instead using some of your brewed kombucha. Keeping this near your brewing vesels that will attract and trap any bug interested in your brew. It's also important to keep your vessels covered as much as possible and that you keep an eye out for bugs while your're bottling your brew and adding new tea as that is when bugs will sneak in.","1370045689"

Also, you may not be aware, there were many prosperous African nations thriving before colonial Europeans ever stepped foot onto the continent.  [Mansa Musa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa) lead a Hajj to Mecca, spreading so much gold along the way that it devalued gold for centuries to come.  Mansa Musa was one of the richest men on earth, possibly only rivaled by Incan Emperor Atahualpa, who filled a room with gold [22 feet long by 18 feet wide by 8 feet tall.

If you add these up with every vocal and instrument that doesn't need to be occupying this space you get a lot of unwanted noise.

Everything was in its right place: all of the streets were still perpendicular, the cupboards were still full, and the orange street lights still flickered on every night. But the people were gone. It reminded Hobb of the last time he saw his mother. She was lying there, propped up on the bed, and the machines were whirling. It looked like her, and it was her, but the important bits were missing. She had abandoned herself. He hadn’t understood it. 

And he didn’t understand why all the people left. The park across from the chapel had all kinds of flowers that he had never seen before. Pink and blue, bright, bright lemon yellow, and deep, rich purple. The office buildings downtown would catch the sunset and cast it back. The skyline was on fire at sunset. The cafes that dotted a cobblestone street uptown had cute hand drawn chalk signs by the door that Hobb thought were just so charming. He couldn’t imagine why anyone would leave. 

It was okay, though. He would love it, if no one else would. He made it his home. He didn’t stay in anyone else’s apartment, they would be wanting it when they got back. He stayed in a little hotel on the edge of the city. The big to-do hotel downtown was nice, but it was too nice, and Hobb couldn’t afford it anyways. He would grocery shop every monday, getting what he needed and paying up front. He didn’t want them to be upset when they got back.

He walked the streets until late, discovering the city in a kind of cool delight. He really did love the city. I mean, sure, all the people were gone. But Hobb was there.","1370045693"

"rage","t5_2qil2","Did you mean computer illiterate mothers? Anyways, all the people calling the story fake, I agree it may be exaggerated but I had a near-identical experience when I was a teen living at home with my Mother.

The only difference being, I rarely used the computer for anything other than downloading music and putting it on my phone, where my Mother became a semi-addict to all those ridiculous free internet games that suck (like Snood, but even worse games). She'd always be downloading these new shit games from questionable sources and load up the family computer with all kinds of viruses/spamware/etc. then blame it on my downloading MP3's. 

It was a really infuriating experience, simply because I think I explained the scenario calmly and simply enough that deep down I really find it hard to believe my Mother didn't know it was her causing the computer problems and yet she just couldn't find it in herself to admit it for some reason. 

That type of scenario is weird though, I wonder what it is that makes it so hard for people to admit fault in these situations. My Mother isn't a full blown idiot and had to have known deep down MP3's aren't causing the computer to have 3000 pop ups every 2 seconds. She just for whatever reason had to blame it on someone else.

Anyways, haven't lived at home in ~5 years and as far as I know they go through a new computer every ~3 months because 'this one got a virus!'. I've tried to explain to them how to avoid these 'viruses' and pointed them towards cc-cleaner and Nod32 etc but they don't want to pay for anti-virus... Instead they'd rather shell out $700 every 3 months on a new computer.

Yeah, rage.

I harbor no ill will towards my Mother, she's a perfectly amicable person otherwise it's just a ridiculous little thing with the computer that will probably never end and makes me rage a little.","1370045693"

Although if you are male there is a possibility of a gender bias working in your favour.

It isn't just your employers and teachers you need to be worried about but, probably more so, any future students. Students can be ruthless and are a big enough (and young enough) group that I imagine the odds of them finding it would be pretty good.

You could probably take precautions. It depends how usual your appearance is. If you have average enough appearance you could wear a wig and use a false name. If it ever did come up you could probably deny it?

Personally I wouldn't think it is worth the risk. Like any profession there are a mix of political and personal positions and generally one aims to keep things as bland and positive as possible. It is also a public facing (students and media) and reasonably respected position so there are additional arguments made for caution.","1370045694"

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","True, but it seemed a bit outside the realm of what Torchwood did best in its earlier seasons. I preferred watching a competent team dealing with alien incursions in Cardiff, than seeing a somewhat competent team trek across America trying to stop a faintly confusing villain, before eventually being saved by a paedophile.

I guess I far preferred it when there was a small, young, inexplicably monied group, that somehow existed without oversight, fighting alien invasions ... in Wales. Season 4 lost a lot of that, as well as having sloppier writing with lots of extraneous dialogue. Yes, of course these hospitals are like a plague ship, no need to say it four or five times and explain the referrence. Yes, of course laws leave people ridiculously open to being lifted from the streets, do you have to explain it every other episode? Oh, you explain the world situation very briefly with absolutely no point for the actual story and merely to show that they exist?

I have an awful lot of hate for that show for some reason not being what I expected. I guess the premise was really quite good, but it never felt it delivered. I suppose it's hard to top something like Children of Earth, except by making the potential apocalypse bigger.","1370045697"

&gt;Not well enough in my opinion.

I'll actually agree with this one. His history with the Eugenics Wars and his conquest of Asia as well as his status as the only dictator who was good to his people would have helped his character.

&gt;Source? Also, it wouldn't have hurt to at least plant the fucking seeds.

Don't have a source, simply using common sense. She wouldn't have been included in the crew at the end otherwise. And while some seeds could have been planted there were a few moments that helped. She's obviously attracted to Kirk, they have sexual tension, and Kirk finds her attractive as well. But this movie established his friendship with Spock, so let them save other stuff for later.

&gt;Frustrated that I'm not jerking off to this movie like you are? Deal with it. Not everyone shares the same opinions as you.

Because I liked it I must be jerking off right? A lot of people agree with you, a lot don't. Your own statements were detrimental to anyone who can pay some damn attention and think things through, but I guess that's why our current movie-going population is steadily dropping in intelligence.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","No one really tells you/teaches you any of this beyond the fact that you want a Christian girl (preferably a virgin who lays off the sauce), a real Proverbs 31 kinda gal, whatever *that* bumpersticker was supposed to mean. Don't know why that was stressed, but it was. It's confusing and ambiguous to be sure, and as a single man approaching his late twenties, I still don't think that I've sorted all of that out.

But one thing that I do want is *complementarity*.  That doesn't mean that I'm the bread-winner while she stays home with the kids (though it *can* mean that, that's not a bad life tbh), that doesn't mean that she wears pink and I wear blue, it doesn't mean that I watch sports and she watches knitting.  It means that we *complement* one another, that we bring out the best in one another, that we help each other and our family with the specific gifts that God has given us.  We are not 50/50 partners in a business deal, we are not interchangeable cogs, we are here to help each other.

Secondly, I think one big virtue I look for in someone is forgiveness, and in light of the Cross, Christians have *every reason* to be forgiving.  From the very small stuff like when you forget to buy milk to the large stuff when you get a new job that means less time spent with her, forgiveness is what makes relationships actually function.  They did that thing at a wedding once where they have all the married people dance, and the people with the longest marriages get to keep on dancing, and then they ask the last remaining couple for marriage advice.  And that time it wasn't just bologna, it was actually cool advice: the old guy said that at first they tried *not* to fight, then they learned *how* to fight, and then they learned how to *forgive*.  And it took them 60 years.

Thirdly, and I don't want to sound too Catholic here, but I think there's something very important in thinking of marriage as a sacrament.  Not in a way that it somehow forgives sins, but in the way that it gives you an opportunity to get better at loving other people. Your marriage is one tool that God uses in His work to make you more loving, because it's a really practical way to just *give* you someone to love, right there *in your house*, eating your cereal.

Imagine how much better at loving we would become if, everyday, God put someone in our lives who needed our love, needed our help. Like, you wake up one day, and *poof* there's this kid who needs to be tutored in math and *you're good at math*.  So even if you don't really like this kid and he's kinda gross, you help him.  Next day, *poof*, there's a woman who lost her dog and needs help finding him. So you help out and find that dog. Wouldn't that scenario just be *cool* in a way? Well, I think it already kinda works that way, that that's partly a purpose of marriage: to give people an opportunity to learn about love by trying it out.

And I think that that's also a really needed element when we think about 'morally reforming' our spouses or partners.  They're not a dog to train.  This moral reform is not happening by women sending husbands on diets or men telling their wives to quit nagging them.  This moral reform is happening because God is at the center of both of our lives and is day by day conforming us to the image of His Son, and our marriage is the Omaha Beach where the Kingdom of God invades our lives and hearts.","1370045702"

It's really annoying to see you wear what they wear and be interested in things they are interested in. Stop doing things because other people will find it cool and stop being fucking preachy. Don't tell me people will see me differently if I can play an instrument because they won't. Stop teaching me shit about love because you don't know shit about it. No, I'm happy that you're happy with being involved in a church but I already made it clear to you that it's not my thing so stop trying to get me to go.","1370045704"

And didn't happen with a rather large set of others, specifically mobile devices (Zune, Kin) and web services (e.g. Bing is not nearly where is should be if you count the money spent on it).

&gt;  I think Nokia did the right thing outsourcing the operating system. 

I think Nokia committed suicide by doing that.

&gt; Nokia is not a software house

Well, it tried and failed - or arguably, gave up somewhat before failing.

The trouble is that hardware alone is a low-margin business. Samsung makes big profits because it owns much of the component manufacturing and can control its competitors through that. Every other hardware-only phone manufacturer makes very small profits or is losing money. Apple and Google make money by controlling (to an extent) the OS and content across different device form factors (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, TV). Microsoft is desperate to catch up, of course. Nokia is becoming a phone hardware business only, which looks like a very bleak future.

&gt; the profit per phone would have been lower.

Not only is it safer for us riders for the reasons you mentioned, it also can help ease traffic congestion a bit by reducing the number and length of vehicles waiting at a light.  Every bike that filters to the front of the back is 1 less vehicle in line which puts everyone else just that much further ahead... at peak times in heavy traffic that increases the number of vehicles that can go through a given intersection through every light cycle and thus speeds everyone up.  Its win-win!

Honestly, the only time i EVER felt unsafe was every time i went into the streets of Bogota (beggars following you everywhere, and we stayed in a super nice hostel in Candelaria) and when a policeman got onto the bus and searched us for drugs (but only until I realized he was police and just searching).

seriously, though. Trigana...was the most beautiful place i have ever seen, and i plan on going back as soon as possible to work in the reserva and learn more spanish and eat delicious foods. totally worth it. ","1370045709"

So if they really wanted to get rid of ads, they would have to deal with being more expensive than their sort-of-competitor Netflix.

I know Hulu is basically run by the big TV networks and it's possible the ads are just a money grab, but it seems like they need some form of extra revenue to keep their price at $8/month.","1370045714"

If everyone wants to be a captain, that's cool, but having more human players with certain classes aboard buffs the ship up with what skills and modules they purchase at the equipment dealers.

I'll have to figure more of this out, but I'm going for more of a multi-player role per ship sort of deal, something I've never seen done before.

Holding the collectors themselves accountable won't work. ""I broke the law because my employer forced me to"" is a story that plays very well to jurors who might very well be a paycheck or two away from the poorhouse themselves. 

Similarly, ""these are the actions of a single rogue employee, and do not represent the policies of Acme Collections or Bank of America"" plays very well as well, especially when it's followed by ""the employee in question has been terminated.""

What you propose might bring additional recourse to the victims of unethical collection practices, but they will do little to curb the practices themselves.

If you have questions regarding contract formation, contact a qualified transactional attorney.]  I'm not picking on you here, but there *was* a signing.  Online sales are most definitely contracts, and electronic authorization is legally equivalent to a signature for the purposes of contract formation under federal law (See Electronic Records and Signatures in Commerce Act).

Since online purchases are contracts, the damages are not merely refund, but that the buyer is entitled to the benefit of the bargain, here, most relevant as provided under UCC as ""the buyer's right to cover.""  The buyer's right to cover allows the buyer to seek alternative suitable goods for those not delivered (or those delivered defective, or when the buyer refuses due to material breach) by the seller, and seek damages equal to the difference in cost of the contract and the cover price, added that the buyer take reasonable efforts to avoid losses and waste (I apologize for the density of the previous sentence, but practically every word of that sentence is a legal term with very specific meaning).  Basically, buyer can seek alternative suppliers with the original breaching seller paying the difference back to the seller, as long as buyer gets equivalent goods in a reasonable manner, and doesn't over-pay for them.

As for their conditions - they are most likely unenforceable because they effectively render contracting with them fundamentally impossible.  No contract can exist where one party is unilaterally excused from performance at any time for any reason.  As long as there were objective manifestations of intent to contract for the sale of goods (i.e., the transaction looked like a sale with defined terms and intent to enter into it by both parties), a court would find that there was a contract, minus the unenforceable terms.","1370045724"

Hopefully the stronger AHA/BHA combo will keep them at bay a bit better. Remember you can't get rid of them, but you can keep them less apparent with exfoliation--ie over time they shouldn't be protruding from your nose. 

**EDIT** Maybe the shampoo you're using is too drying, so the scalp is acting like your face with rebound oil?  Just a thought.  My ex has obscenely oily hair and surprisingly the Lush Bar soap for oily hair--it's green--helped keep the grease down.  Also, Batiste Dry shampoo is awesome. It comes in a couple tinted colors too for blondes and brunettes.  I have really fine and thin hair which isn't oily, but it'll flatten out overnight.

It part of the overall map balance, and someone with a scout is going to be just as annoying if they're a decent shot.

Secondly, you could be sensible about it. Be aware of other's gun choices, especially your teammates. If you can retake A as a CT and know there's one or two terrorists left, chances are they're waiting for the shot on you. Go get an AWP from your dead teammates and remedy this problem.

I shoot people and pets so using my poor man's holy trinity setup I didn't have to worry.  Also, I was comfortable with the 9 AF Points coming from a T1i.  Just focus and reframe.

If you're going to be shooting sports, your 7D is probably a better choice.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","The ModMic isn't permanent.  It attaches/detaches magnetically to a little mounting base that is adhesively attached to the headphones.  The adhesive they use is some weird, magic 3M stuff: the bond is super strong, but it can be removed easily if you heat it up with a blow dryer, and it doesn't mark the surface of the headphone.  You can even reuse it after allowing it to cool again. 

Granted, it's not as elegant as the Beyerdynamic or the V-Moda solutions, but it is a lot cheaper, more flexible, and most likely sounds as good, if not better.  I say most likely because I haven't heard the Beyer or V-Moda ones, but I can compare my ModMic to the mic on my Senn PC360s (which is comparable to the MMX300 mic), and it sounds about as good.","1370045733"

It's the same kind of backpeddling bullshit that Eddie spouted.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","I'm going to start by comparing the weapons. Five per category seems like enough, right?
1930s gang:
  
Pistols:

* Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1 [single-action automatic]: fires a .45ACP (11.43x23mm) bullet, has a 7+1 round capacity, and is very slim, compared to other automatics. This makes it more concealable, something favored by its users. The five inch barrel makes the M1911A1 a rather accurate pistol, and the huge bullet delivers 616 lb-ft of energy to the target, approximately the same as .2 grams of TNT. 

* Smith and Wesson Model 10 [double-action revolver]: fires a .38 Special (9.1x30mm) bullet, has a six round capacity, and can penetrate light body armor and car doors. It was highly successful in this role, until supplanted by S&amp;W .357 Magnum.

* Revolver, Caliber .45, M1917 [double-action revolver]: fires a .45ACP bullet, has a six round capacity, and is cheap and reliable, being Army surplus, and comparable to the M1911A1.

* Browning GP-35 Hi-Power [single-action automatic]: fires a 9x19mm bullet, has a 13+1 round capacity, and was not widely used by organized crime. Armies, however, love this firearm, and still use it, almost 80 years after its design.

* Smith and Wesson Model 27 [double-action revolver]: fires a .357 S&amp;W Magnum (9.1x33mm) bullet, has a six round capacity, and is designed for penetrating body armor. The tradeoff is that it kicks like a mule.

  Medium-range weapons:

* Browning Auto-5 [semi-aitomatic shotgun]: fires 12 gauge shells, has a 5+1 round capacity, and is an all together brilliant weapon. Shortened versions were used in 'whippet' configurations, with a cut-down barrel and a strap around the shoulder, holding the gun so that when the shoulder is sharply rotated back, the gun will be thrown up into firing position.

* Browning M1918A2 [light machine gun]: fires .30-06 (7.62x63mm) bullets, has a 20+1 round capacity, and was often shortened so as to enable concealment. It provides amazing amounts of firepower, seeing as it is accurate to about 1,500 yards, fires at 650 rounds per minute, and the bullet can penetrate modern body armor.

* Auto-Ordinance M1923AC [submachine gun]: fires .45ACP bullets, has a 50 or 100 round capacity, and fires at up to 1,500 rounds per minute. The M1923AC incorporated a massive compensator that pushed the barrel down via redirecting the muzzle blast, negating most of the vertical recoil motion. With a 12 inch barrel, it is highly accurate, compared to shorter, more concealable subguns, but the volume of fire it puts out is immense.

* Winchester Model 1912 *trench gun* [pump-action shotgun]: fires 12 gauge shells, has a 6+1 capacity, and has a bayonet mount, for the M1917 bayonet, which is 16 inches (406mm) long. It can 'slam-fire', meaning that if one holds down the trigger and actuates the slide, it will fire.

* *Lupara* [side-by-side break open shotgun]: fires 12 gauge shells, has a two round capacity, and can cut someone in half at certain ranges. the lack of *choke*, or constricting the muzzle bore, adds to the spread of the shot greatly. 

  Long range weapons:

* United States Rifle, cal .30, Model of 1917 [bolt action rifle]: fires .30-06 bullets, has a six round capacity, and is extremely accurate. It has an effective range, with telescopic sights, of over 1,000 yards, and over 2.1 million were manufactured during WWI.

* United States Rifle, Caliber .30-06, Model 1903 [bolt action rifle]: fires .30-06 bullets, has a six round capacity, and is also extremely accurate. It has an effective iron-sighted range of 1,000 yards.

* Winchester Model 1886 [lever-action rifle]: fires a .50-110 caliber (12.7x61mm) round, has a six or seven round capacity, and can kill a bison at several hundred yards. It does kick like a mule, though.

* Winchester M1907 [semi-automatic rifle]: fires a .351WSL round, has a 10 round magazine. .351WSL is similar to .357 S&amp;W Magnum.

* Rifle, No.1 Mk.III* [bolt action rifle]: fires a .303 Enfield (7.7x56mmR) round, has a 10 round detachable magazine, and can be fired at over 20 aimed rounds per minute by a trained marksman.

Modern Gang:

  Pistols

* Beretta 92 [double-action semi-automatic pistol]: fires a 9x19mm round, has a 15+1 capacity, and is used by many militaries worldwide. It is hard to conceal, however, due to the double-stack magazine.

* Glock 17 [DAO semi-automatic pistol]: fires a 9x19mm round, has a 17+1 round capacity, and is very hard to conceal, thanks to the blocky construction and large size.

* Colt Detective Special [double-action revolver]: fires a .38 Special round, has a five round capacity, and is very easy to conceal, thanks to the small size of the gun. The 2"" barrel makes accuracy an aspiration, rather than a fact, however.

* S&amp;W M&amp;P40 [DAO semi-automatic pistol]: fires a .40S&amp;W round, has a 14+1 capacity, and is very good at stopping people.

*  Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod CZ75 [Double Action semi-automatic pistol]: Fires a 9x19mm round, has a 12+1 round capacity. A well-designed gun, this weapon is the most popular firearm in the Czech Republic, it's homeland. 

Medium-range weapons:

* Ingram M10 [machine pistol]: fires a .45ACP round, has a 32 round capacity, and a rate of fire of over 1,100 rounds per minute. Nicknamed the 'Burp Gun' because if you burp, it'll empty the magazine, this highly compact weapon is very effective at clandestine use, and is capable of accepting a suppressor straight out of the box.

* Intratec TEC-DC9 [machine pistol]: fires a 9x19mm round, has a capacity anywhere from 10-50 rounds, and is not actually sold fully automatic. It must be illegally modified to do so. It is also inaccurate and very cheap, manufactured from stamped steel and plastics.

* NORINCO Type-56 [assault rifle]: fires a 7.62x39mm round, has a 30+1 round capacity, and it a chinese copy of the Soviet AKM. It is not especially accurate, but it hits hard. 

* Ithaca 37 [pump-action shotgun]: fires a 12 gauge shell, has a 6+1 round capacity, and is a very versatile shotgun. It was widely used during the Vietnam War by the United States Military, and can slam fire.

* Colt M16A1 [assault rifle]: fires a 5.56x45mm NATO SS109 round, has a 30+1 capacity, and is a rather accurate, if not especially powerful, rifle.

  Long-Range Weapons:

* Remington 700 [bolt-action rifle]: fires a 7.62x51mm NATO round, has a five round capacity, and is the basis for the military's M24 and M40 sniper's rifles.

* Izhevsk Mechanical Plant M91/30 Mosin-Nagant [bolt-action rifle]: fires a 7.62x54mmR round, comparable to 7.62mm NATO, has a five-round magazine, and is literally impossible to hide. It is also incredibly cheap, considering production exceeded 37 million rifles.

* Izmash Snayperskaya Vintovka Dragunova [semi-automatic sniper's rifle]: fires a 7.62x54mmR round, has a ten+1 round capacity, and is currently used by over 30 militaries. It is a decent rifle, comparable to the American M21.

* Fabrica de Arme Cugir SA PSL [semi-automatic sniper's rifle]: fires a 7.62x54mmR round, has a ten+1 round capacity, and is currently used by over 30 militaries. It is a decent rifle, comparable to the American M21, and, although similar looking to the SVD, it is actually based on the AK platform.

* United States Rifle, Caliber .30, M1 [semi-automatic battle rifle]: fires a .30-06 round, has an eight round capacity, and is accurate to 1,000 yards with Iron sights. It is also available for purchase from the Civilian Marksmanship Program for about $750. It also has bayonet lugs for the M1 Bayonet.



People/Organization:

The 1930s mob:

This was an organization of professional criminals, who made tens of thousands of dollars a year in an era when the M1923AC costed $200. When one has the money to hire good people, to equip them with state of the art equipment, and have them train, one is going to succeed. According to Wikipedia, ""... a rum-running captain could make several hundred thousand dollars a year."" The gangs of the '30s were lead by ruthless men who rose to power by being intelligent. To quote Francis Ford Coppola's adaptation of Mario Puzo's *The Godfather*, 
""Bene, Don Corleone. I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in cash. I need, Don Corleone, all of those politicians that you carry around in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes.""
 *The Godfather* was set after World War Two, when the Italian Mafia made its money from gambling and prostitution. The prohibition era gangsters were much more profitable, and made more money. This meant that they could 'buy' [bribe] politicians, police forces, and other law enforcement forces to look the other way.
In addition, the gangsters of the 1930s were much more versed in their weapon's operation and use, having the ability to practice more often, and access to gun ranges, often on private estates outside urban centers. The gangsters were also much less conspicuously dressed, wearing relatively normal clothes and avoiding tattoos and other identifying marks.

Today, much has changed. Modern gangsters do not make similarly massive amounts of money as those of the '30s did. Most make about $25,000 a year, according to Freakonomics. This lack of money severely disadvantages them compared to the 1930s gangs, who could afford fast cars and military-grade weapons. Modern street gangs are lucky if they have weaponry that was state of the art in the 1960s or '70s, due to money. The average member of a street gang, it seems, is actually making so little money that when legal work is available, they quit their gang and get a job. 
They also do not have the skills of the '30s gangster. Today, most gangs are selling drugs. This means that they can't train on their weapons or tactics; they're too busy standing on a street corner selling drugs to have time for that. Then there's the whole holding the gun sideways BS. I'm just going to say that it's a disadvantage. 

It's not done, but I need a break. I'll finish it later.","1370045737"

I wish Google and for that matter a lot of other developers would use Qt.  I know KDE got a lot of flack for the whole 4.0 fiasco (I was one of the few that understood that it was basically an early beta.) but, that was long ago.  Qt offers IMO superior theming support across multiple platforms.  Off of the top of my head I know of three themes that support transparency Oxygen transparent, Bespin, and QtCurve.

Bespin and even more so QtCurve can be manipulated to a vast degree giving you huge theming options between the two.

Why the hell Google can't get Google-earth to theme right is beyond me. I am thinking it comes down to not giving a fuck.

"geography","t5_2qnms","I'm not sure I agree with the premise of this article.  Every time you look at a map the mapmaker is deciding what you see and don't see.  Your desire to look at the map is based on how useful it is for you -- so if a personalized map ceases to be useful in the way that you want it to be why would you continue to use it?  Google isn't going to put out maps that nobody wants to see, and it's not like nobody else can make a half-decent road map.  We've got plenty of other options if it fails to be useful.

And I don't think most peoples' perception of public space has anything to do with maps, unless they happen to be geographers or planners.  The author describes the lack of public space in suburbia like it's some kind of future threat -- hello, this is already a thing.  No public space in suburbia.  People already think of the space between their house and the shopping mall as empty while they're in the car, what does this have to do with Google?  

&gt; It's quite simple, really: When you and I look at the same map, there's a good chance that we might strike a conversation about how to enrich the space that the map represents—perhaps plant more trees or build a sidewalk or install some benches.

I don't think people actually do this.

I do tell them that after the show is over, which pisses my wife off to no end. I'm willing to kick them out of my house to make a draft, but I'm not willing to uninvite them and skip the show to make a draft. 

I think I have a pretty legitimate reason for not being able to be there. Of the people who are voting A, I really wonder how many of them are voting A: 

1. Because it's the default; AND/OR
2. When they could make B work, and they just have a mild preference for A. 

It's easy to say that this isn't a big deal when you don't have a conflict with the time and date that were set without consultation of the league. And I'm not sure how I feel about the phrasing of the vote, because I think the question should always be: ""Can you be here at time A, B, C, or D?"" not, ""Do you prefer time A, B, C, or D.""

**TL;DR: Why this is still an issue for me.** You want to maximize attendance, not exclude over 10% of the league (at least 4 of us are missing the draft for AGOT alone) because of a mild, half-hearted preference of the majority who really don't care that much either way. ","1370045756"

"law","t5_2qh9k","You have an extremely important point. The apparatus responsible for such decisions, for expediency, took a formerly illegal practice and somehow magically transformed it into a legitimate use of American force to acquire information from prisoners. 

There are some things that are objectively wrong. Forget the virtual uselessness of the actual intelligence we received from torture. Even if research showed water boarding gave us 100% reliable, actionable intelligence, that saved American lives, it is still torture and torturing people is not what we are supposed to do. It is objectively wrong for any one, but especially for the most powerful military on earth. It is against our founding principles as a nation.

It is objectively wrong and any lawyer that stood by and let it happen should be disbarred because they violated their professional responsibility, not to mention their ethical or moral obligations as Americans. 

Look, I get it, ok? I understand the so-called realities of the situation at the time, and hindsight is 20/20. I get all that. But we know better, and we did worse, as a nation. It's objective in the same way that we now understand women and men are equals. That blacks are worth 5/5ths of a human, not 3/5ths. And so on. 

Acquiescing to the pressure to use torture is no different than endorsing it or encouraging it, at least from a moral standpoint.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In middle school (early 2000s) a friend of mine (JW) played some AIM prank on me and a few other girls by pretending to be another friend of ours. My friend CA and I retaliated by making up some online personas and messaging her for weeks pretending to be these other people. We were pretty innocent kids, so we didn't try to, like, blackmail her, or make her do weird things or anything. We just thought it was funny that she didn't know it was us. Eventually CA grew bored, but I kept on doing it, because I thought it was hilarious and fun. Needless to say, JW found out (due to my stupidity) and her mom tried to have me sent to juvie :D

I like the mix of focus on the actual game and all the pop culture references you guys litter in, especially the Mmm Bop moment after the technical difficulties.

* For all I know, audio is good, but I've been struggling to make my audio bearable, so take that with a grain of salt.

* Considering there's four of you guys, I'm surprised at how little you guys spoke over each other. Even the couple of times you did, you seem to be on the same wavelength, so it's not like I'm hearing two different thoughts anyway. Good job on that.

I don't know if I have anything constructive, really... I guess if you were ever to do this again, try to bring the overlapping conversations down to zero, though that's near impossible with that many people I think. Hope this was a little helpful?

EDIT: Watched the second part. You know what I mentioned about you guys being in sync? Yup, the second video breaks that a bit. I liked the joke someone started, but the dissonance becomes too great when two of you are talking about the game and the other two are elsewhere.","1370045772"

This afternoon the vet called us to tell that he seemed better. His blood work now shows that his white cells total number went a bit down, but his lymphocytes were at a normal level. He's also not anemic and there's a lot less blood on his feces.

Ramjets are basically (*not really*) an afterburner anyway, because they get their compression from the geometry of the engine, and their thrust from the direct combustion of gas; there are no compressors or turbines. They can't fly without intake velocity, which means that they can't take off of their own accord. That's where the combination with a turbojet comes in. In turn, the turbojet is not as effective at high intake velocity, so the ramjet takes over for high Mach flight.

With the money issues I know that he probably feels like a terrible provider right now.. and I wont lie, I probably don't help much when I talk about all of the things that I want to do in the future.. so I can see how he might feel like he cant meet my expectations. So I guess I really just need to tell him that its not about meeting my expectations, I want to work together to get everything we want in life, I don't expect him to just make it all magically appear. 

 With sex- I swear as soon as I feel pressured its like a brick wall goes up and there is basically nothing that he could say or do at that moment to fix it. 

I am a volunteer at a animal shelter on my days off work and Ive also started working on addressing a lot of animal rights issues that are going on in my city and its taking up a lot of my time he always says to me that I care more about ""those dogs"" than I do him.

whenever he brings up the sex issues and the fact that the sex we do have is not the ""kind"" that will fulfill his needs it hurts my feelings because I take it as not being good enough, and the wall just goes back up. 

I guess I need to go find this book '5 love languages' and read it immediately. the most helpful advice on here has come from the two people who had read it.  

I know we've both got maturing and learning to do.. I don't want a divorce, when I wrote my vows I meant them damn it, everyone in my family is divorced and I promised myself and my husband that I would always try my hardest to resolve any issues before giving up. 

He does have good qualities, he is funny and is extremely smart and I don't ever want him to feel worthless, but I honestly can help that his current financial situation was due to a poor decision (he got into real estate and it was very inconsistent pay and without having his parents there to depend on, he opened credit cards and loans that snowballed into debt) I was there to help him with paying his monthly realtor fees when he wasn't getting paid and I didn't treat him like crap when he stayed home all day when he didn't have any showings, I wish he could focus on the fact that Ill always be there even when times are shitty and not dwell on what he is not getting.

When the cells are in a giant ball, it then forms 3 different layers: the ectoderm, which is the outermost layer, the mesoderm which is the middle and the endoderm, which is the innermost layer.

The ectoderm makes the nervous system, the skin. The mesoderm makes muscle and bone. The endoderm makes the internal organs (lungs, GI, endocrine)

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","If you are doing a test to verify NEMA4x i believe you need to meet specific PSI requirements as well.

I would be more conservative about assumed head pressure than what people are recommending here. I size pumps on a daily basis. You should calculate Reynolds number based on line diameter (gonna be turbulent), then use an empirical equation from engineering toolbox or something to calculate your pressure drop per 100 ft of hose. This head loss is going to be waaaaaaaay higher than your static head loss and is the major losses in what is called ""friction head"". You will have a good amount of friction loss at 65 gpm on a 1"" rubber hose. Rubber hose is very rough.

Also don't rush to buy it on grainger or mcmaster, sometimes you can save as much as 50% if you buy it from an actual manufacturer, grainger or mcmaster are really only good if you need something shipped in 2-3 days.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","I'll comment on the two I own:

The fnx-9 has an excellent trigger, very nice sights stock (very quick acquisition) little recoil and also weighs almost nothing for its size. 
The dual safety/decocker is a nice feature as well. It is a full sized pistol, and things like sights, holsters and magazines are hard to find and expensive. 

A G19 is my ""high capacity"" carry gun and it fits in my group of carry guns that are as simple as pull the trigger- no external safeties or hammers, just a trigger. The glock is also considerably smaller than the fnx for concealment, and holsters are very easy to find. I'd recommend checking out a gen4 model as the grip is more like the fnx (very positive) and also customizable. 

I would recommend also looking into the CZ P-07, as the one I held in the store had a better trigger than the FNX, is cheaper, and can be modified to be decocker or safety depending on what you want. 


Thats all I can comment on. /r/ccw is a great resource as well, check it out.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","IMO running chance to ignite on Fireball makes it strictly inferior to things like Fire Trap, Detonate Dead, Explosive Arrow which all have much higher base damage.

The main advantage of Fireball is that it's well suited for crit ignites.  I sent a friend a message about that recently, I'll see if I can find it.

&gt;As I found out Fireball kind of blows if you try and use it like EK, so I decided to revisit the ignite side of it. I was using chance to ignite/EP before, and it was pretty mediocre compared to the other awesome ignite skills like Fire Trap/DD/Explosive Arrow so I gave it up for Conc Eff/LMP. But Fireball does have one advantage over the other ignite skills - it doesn't matter if you ignite on the first hit.

&gt;You can't exactly spam fire trap because you run out, EA requires setup, and you'll run out of corpses with DD, not to mention you need them to walk near one in the first place. So for all of these skills, you want to ignite consistently, with chance to ignite.

&gt;But it's not the case with Fireball - with a bit of cast speed, you can spam it as much as you want until you land a crit. You don't need a ton of crit chance, since once you get that crit everything dies. I think 20% + crit weakness is enough. And this means you get to make use of crit multiplier to massively boost your ignite damage.

&gt;It does have some drawbacks, so it's not really top tier. First of all the radius is kinda small, but I don't have a lot of AoE passives yet. Second, it does take a bit longer to proc than using Chance to Ignite, you have to cast three or four or five usually. Third, you have to decide whether to use two resist reduction curses or flammability + crit weakness. You could probably have them all on your bar and pick depending on what you're facing.

I'm using Fireball/Crit Damage/Inc AoE/Ele Prolif with Divinarius and it's pretty strong in low level maps even though my tree is not built for it at all.  20% crit chance is probably too little, I have about 30% chance to crit and some more wouldn't hurt.","1370045781"

Because boardgames have far fewer mechanics, and those mechanics are often more elegant and razor balanced I think it makes my thinking better in boardgames.  Just like the best poetry or art happens when you heavily constrain the 'rules' you are allowed to use (5-7-5 syllables for haiku only or standard format and instruments in a symphony, say) I think sometimes my best cognitive development happens in boardgame type decisions.

The fact that you are usually more time constrained and are usually playing a reactive, intelligent human also helps.  These things might exist in video-games as well... but are more usually present in boardgames.  In boardgames there is usually much less exploiting weird AI, code or game behaviors, nor are there hours of micro-management replacing decisive, insightful thought, nor is there over managing a handful of the twenty mechanics you have and ignoring the rest.","1370045786"

But I'd ask where the engines go.  Personally, I'm a fan of distributing multiple engines away from the center of mass to make it easier to correct power or load imbalances.  Trying to put one big engine pod at the back end of the ship makes sense in atmosphere where you can use airfoils to correct any small misalignment, but in vacuum, it becomes less stable.","1370045787"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I honestly don't know where that myth got started but the Denver defense was not one of the best that year. Go back and look at the games. Almost every single time they faced a good QB they let up 30 points. Brady twice, Rodgers, Stafford, and even Fitzpatrick.

 They beat up on the AFC West and were either average or bad against just about everybody else that year. 

I feel like a lot of Broncos fans were extremely successful in downplaying Tebow's role in their success that season by saying that the D is the only reason they won any games that year but that is just flat out false. They were 24th in Points and 20th in Yards that year. They let up 30+ points 5 times and only won 1 of those game. 

The most you can say about that defense is that they put the team in a position where Tebow could make plays to win games. Saying they were the only reason while not being able to stop any of the good offenses they faced that entire year is just totally dishonest.

It has dungeon bosses that are like raid bosses from other large MMOs, with attack patterns, weak spots, and phases.  It's in a Sci-Fi setting.  You can do a lot of the open world quests without a ton of concentration with large roaming quest groups that organically form to take down boss encounters.

These and many others like them are good places to visit, but they are solidly ON beaten the path.

A few places that I have really enjoyed where you might not meet another foreign tourist are:
-The road between Mae Sariang and Mae Sot for the scenery and caves.
-The national parks in Ubon Ratchathani.
-Nakhon Phanom for no reason that I can really explain.
-Prasat Plaibat in Buriram.
-Singburi for a few interesting temples.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","i doubt many people would dispute that investment leads to economic activity, just in an oppertunity cost sort of way, an economic liberal would say - the government is not an efficient investor, being a single body, far removed from the consequences of the investment (if things go wrong you get more staff and an increased budget to fix it) the people in it have little incentive, if not a mild anti incentive to do their actual job well and are thus going to make generally worse economic choices than a profit driven company who's peoples pay and the future of the company depend on doing well economically.

general side effects of this include more jobs which produce something of value which is in demand, as opposed to government jobs which can just be there for the sake of keeping employment up, creating something which is not in demand anywhere, ie will end up wasted. like if i rounded up a bunch of people to build a statue of me in my local town, jobs are created, people get money and the economy is stimulated by them spending, but you've still wasted a lot of materials on the statue which would be better used elsewhere on things more in demand (and thus giving greater profit, therefore more money to my employees/more employees for me/more employees for brothels and drug dealers if i hog all the profits and blow it all on hookers and coke).

the austerity thing would like to do away with such jobs i guess because they see it that way, that in splashing out now you'd have to pay a lot more in the long run, whereas their opposition i think would rather spread it out and ""end boom and bust"".

I'm not saying that, I'm saying that the stereotypical ""Nice Guy"" is an asshole for behaving like an asshole after he's been rejected by a girl. Suddenly realizing that your platonic friend might be your soulmate is beautifully romantic, but complaining about how you didn't get what you deserve when she doesn't feel the same way makes you an asshole.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Absolutely, that's a great point, I've certainly entertained very strange and downright ridiculous thoughts about the way certain things were happening in powerful waves of psilocybin rushes.  Though we're pretty sure something ""like telepathy"" happened and talked about seeing/knowing/experiencing each others thoughts/feelings.  We just couldn't recall what they were or how they were perceived (our thoughts/feelings at the time were so altered I doubt it was even anything coherent in English, it was more like: ""we're having some kind of moment right now, we are both in the same profound state here in this room together, It appears we are experiencing both something powerful and accurate perceptions of each other's experience"" and it hit us with a force of pure undersatnding).  

I honestly don't know if what we experienced would be considered telepathy or even that supernatural, all I know is that both of us confirmed a strange connection and a complete understanding of the other's state while in a strong psychedelic state during the peak.  So many other even weirder things were happening that whatever we experienced almost seemed trivial, yet profound (what I mean by that is the ""telepathy"" event wasn't even the main event, the ""telepathy"" was a freaky acknowledgement of what was happening to us while tripping, but the moment hit us with the force of what seemed as good as telepathy).  I guess I would describe it as total clarity of understanding in the moment of each other's experience, we didn't ""talk to each other"" with our minds.  

The more I think about it the more I realize I really have no idea what happened, but SOMETHING happened that we both acknowledged it after the fact.  We weren't exactly sending each other phrases, names, or pictures of shapes to try and guess haha, it was just a very powerful ""shared moment"" of ineffability.  We were both quite speechless to this day about it.","1370045806"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Hey, thanks for your reply.

&gt;I think it's quite obviously unsound, this can be illustrated with the following argument:

 &gt;  Rocks cannot run.
    Running is only a property of beings with legs.
    Rocks do not have legs.
    If 1,2,3, then rocks can fail to do something which is only a property of beings which have another property &gt;that they don't have.
&gt;    So rocks can fail to do something which is only a property of beings which have another property that they don't have.

&gt;That's kind of wordy, so let's abstract:

&gt;    A's cannot do K.
    K'ing is only a property (I really think you mean ability) of things which have property P.
    A's don't have P.
    if 1,2,3, then it can be true that A's cannot K even though K'ing is only a property of things which have &gt;another property P and A's do not have P.
    So it can be true that A's cannot K even though K'ing is only a property of things which have another &gt;property P and A's do not have P.*

I think I follow this thinking, but I am not sure where the error in the argument is. Haven't you demonstrated that the reasoning is in fact sound?

&gt;I think you could easily fix this though. Perhaps you would also say ""comparing the good of a person's not being able to suffer because they are dead with the good of a person's suffering while they are alive is just not possible. They are too different in quality"". There is something to this argument, but it moves a bit too fast. You'll want to flesh it out.

&gt;I'll also point out that objectors to PAS are often committed to the idea that death is bad, and one of the only ways to believe death is bad is the deprivation account, and the deprivation account requires that we can compare the goodness of states in which people don't exist to states in which they do. So you'll want to be careful about how you object to PAS to make sure your account doesn't make the deprivation account not work, or you'll want to say you do not support the deprivation account and have a better reason for thinking &gt;death is bad.

These are all really good points, thanks!","1370045808"

"3gun","t5_2uoba","I came today to ask about this same question.   I really would like to know if there are any good youtube videos.  There are tons of them, but some are ads for training programs, and none of them dumb it down enough for me, I suppose. 

I've been around guns my whole life, but never properly trained.  I cannot afford to be trained.  I want to attend a match at a gun club that is 1 1/2 hours away.  That is the closest place that hosts any type of 3 gun.  My pistol skills suck.  I live inside the city limits and cannot live train here.  However, I was thinking about all the ways I could train using airsoft or just dry firing.  

I'm a pretty good shot with rifle and shotgun.  I am grossly out of shape.  I look at this as motivation and a goal to get into better shape, or just any shape.  It looks like lots of fun and something I'd really like to do.

I'm a little apprehensive about my equipment.  While I'm happy with my AR, my shotgun is just an old Mossberg 500 pump and my pistol is either a cz82 with two mags or a sr9c.  I guess I need to pick.  I'm better with the cz, but not sure how they'd view the 9mm mak.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand, and this is a common concern for people who don't understand how the legal system operates. The US system generally is based on the standard of a reasonable person--a reasonable person would vaccinate their child to prevent the spread of infection disease, therefore not vaccinating is negligent. If a vaccinated child becomes infected, it is not negligence on the parents part, because they took reasonable precaution to prevent the infection.

Therefore if your child becomes infected due to your negligence (you didn't vaccinate) and infects others who took reasonable precautions against infection, you are at fault.

As for medical records being private, I'm not entirely sure how it works. If those spreading HIV/AIDS negligently are charged as it is, there must be some way for the courts to obtain that information. As for vaccinations, most school districts in the US already have that information on record. Unlike most other health issues, this one regards public health, and is not just a private issue.

Lastly, this is a perfect example of why we need better education on vaccinations--most people do not even understand how they work. I didn't until recently.","1370045826"

"aoe2","t5_2sg7u","Think of it like this.

If two players with a skill of 50 each fight, the Hunnish player will win.

But the bad part is if one player has 70 ""skill"" and the Hunnish player has 50, the Hunnish player can probably still win. That's why they're OP.

Actually, more accurately, they're OP on Arabia, which is the most popular map. Aztecs, Mayans, Celts, and Mongols can keep up with them on that map, but not really anybody else. On closed maps, Huns lose alot of power.

Trying to ""make the game long"" is the goal when you face Huns but in reality it's way harder than you make it sound.

Huns have one of the best Dark Ages, they hit Feudal fast and they are probably the top Feudal Age civ besides the Byzantines. They will rush you first and they can defend from your rushes. They are good at everything in the Feudal Age. They are not just an offensive civilization, they are an everything civilization in that specific time. They have probably the best Flush in the game, they can Tower Rush you, they can Scout Rush you, they can even probably do a Man-At-Arms Rush better than anybody else except for the Goths, Japanese, and Celts who are specifically Infantry civs.

Castle Age, simply nothing keeps up with Cav Archers. Their low cost and high stats means that they're too easy to mass. And on an open map like Arabia, they'll just hit and run your economy to pieces. Melee units just can't catch up in the Castle Age. Pikemen and Knights will be screwed over and your boom will be screwed up because those units cost alot of Food while the Hun player will be pretty high and dry.

When you said they're predictable, it's like saying ""Alright, I know this dude is bringing a missile launcher. I get to choose between brass knuckles, a knife, and a baseball bat. But he's only got one weapon, he's predictable.""","1370045827"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt; The blade hurts just as much, and the life is just as lost whether the ""executioner"" is respectful and appreciative of your ""sacrifice"" or not.

Raising your own livestock and preparing the meat yourself (as pointed out by dongasaurus) is a special experience. I guess you could make an argument about the life of the livestock being lived almost freely while the same can certainly not be said of the industrial process. In that sense, there is added value to respecting your kill. It also helps you realize there is value in not wasting meat without consideration.

&gt; You would not be fine with someone hitting you just because that person recognized and ""respected"" that someone (you) had to suffer to fulfil his/her sadistic urge, would you? I bet you would prefer not being hit to being hit ""respectfully"" and I bet the same is true of non-human animals.

This is surprisingly relevant to sports: losing is rarely what people hope for, but the losing team is generally way less bitter about losing when the winning team plays by the rules and show respect. You get a feeling the winners won because they deserved it and it makes losing a less bitter experience (you may even get something out of it sometimes!).","1370045827"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Lowcracks referenced [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/) by Witherspoon et al. It's a matter of probability and how much of the genome you're looking at:

&gt;Thus the answer to the question “How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?” depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity and the populations being compared. The answer, ω̂ can be read from Figure 2. Given 10 loci, three distinct populations, and the full spectrum of polymorphisms (Figure 2E), the answer is ω̂ ≅ 0.3, or nearly one-third of the time. With 100 loci, the answer is ∼20% of the time and even using 1000 loci, ω̂ ≅ 10%. However, if genetic similarity is measured over many thousands of loci, the answer becomes “never” when individuals are sampled from geographically separated populations.

Even when you're looking at a thousand loci, it's very possible to be more similar to someone of a different race than to someone of the same race, but this paper contends that the chances of that approach zero as more and more of the genome is compared.","1370045836"

I guess it could be a government Stimulus outside of the American Recovery Act, but George Bush's 2003 stimulus package didn't work in the same way the clip describes.  It was just a tax cut...

"DungeonsAndDragons","t5_2qwdo","my argument as the dm is that the one roll encompases all random stuff as well as knowledge; she simply did not know the tells of these traps well enough to spot them.

The only time I let rerolls on skills (ignoring some minor exceptions) are for physical stuff, such as climbing a wall.

I normally don't let players act like they got a bad roll either. They don't know they did a poor job in most cases. Sometimes, if they could tell they did a poor job, I'll make exceptions. My paladin had a pet who I tried having it stealth up to the scouts position. The pet had decent stealth but a horrible roll; the pet did not even beat my pathetic passive perception so I stopped him before advancing. There was a physical, in way game of easily telling the pet did a poor job.

If the players start being problematic, the DMG says you can roll for them and keep the roll/result hidden. If it is a problem, I recommend doing this for a session after warning the player you will role in their place if they are not playing the game properly. After that 1 session, give them a chance again. If they repeatedly fail, don't let them roll anymore.

Another trick I use as a dm is I'll randomly say give me an arcana check, perception check, insight check when there is no reason for it. That way they don't know that something is going on simply because I said make a roll.","1370045837"

That extra revenue can become profit, attract/lock in content creators with revenue split deals, or be used to get more content and increase the value of their service possibly giving subscribers a way to justify any cost increases.

Examples:

""Why should we license our shows to Netflix when Hulu will give us the same money AND 50% of the show's ad revenue?""

The only other perspective I can offer is that everything changes, so you will find yourself a very different person and in very different circumstances 5 or 10 years from now. You may find this comforting if you are suffering right now, especially if you are in the your teens or 20's.

My no-bullshit reason not to kill yourself right now is that your family/friends would indeed be devastated. And just because their pain will be temporary doesn't make it unimportant. Kind of like your life.

The odds of a religiously motivated individual lying (including to themselves!) to draw attention to themselves and their religion is infinitely more likely than actual miracles occurring. (This is almost certainly the case with Pio of Pietrelcina, for instance.)

But even past that, there is no reason, when faced with an unexplained event, to immediately jump to the most fantastic and unreasonable conclusion possible. Even ""we don't know"" is a better answer than one involving a self-contradictory dictator of a skylord.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I'm not going to pretend that it's easy to handle. It sucks, and I understand how much it can hurt your confidence. One thing I would try to remember is that the sorts of people who say these kinds of things are sad. In their world, judging people's character by their appearance is the way things are. Whenever someone suggests that *they're* not attractive enough, their sense of who they are goes down a peg. Saying things that bring other people down is a way of building themselves back up a bit.

Maybe your face isn't particularly attractive. But in terms of how you see yourself, that doesn't have to mean much more than, say, if you're not that good of a basketball player. You can absolutely find a wonderful partner. Being unattractive (in any way) makes it more difficult to start relationships with people you don't know well. But once someone gets to know you, they're going to care a lot more about how you treat people, what your values are, and how you connect with them. And when you find someone who you connect with like that, that person will absolutely light up when he/she sees your face. Because it doesn't matter what other people think of your face; what matters is that it's the face of the person he/she loves. Nothing about how you look will stop you from developing the sorts of relationships you want, and from what you've said, it clearly hasn't held you back from being well-regarded by people.

I understand how hurtful it is when people make those sorts of comments to you. I just want you to try to remember that it's the world that's sick and confused, that's so obsessed with analyzing every little detail of someone's appearance as if it says something meaningful about them. You're so much more than that. If you can be the sort of person you want to be and surround yourself with people who understand what's really meaningful, you'll be worlds ahead of the people who criticize you. I have the utmost respect for anyone who can stand up to beauty culture and say ""I'm a fucking awesome person, whether or not you think I'm beautiful."" I realize it's not always easy; it's just something to try to remind yourself of whenever you start to feel low over it. All the obsession with appearance does is make people feel miserable and inadequate (even [conventionally attractive people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Re53vgaVFvI)). By being comfortable with yourself, you can take a stand against that in a powerful way.","1370045850"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sure to get a down vote or 2, but I will always be loyal to Subaru.  I've owned many.  Not once, but twice, Subaru came through BIG for me.  

I will preface this by saying that prior to purchasing Subarus, I had purchased a Ford right out of college.  Owned it for 2 years, it was in the shop for a cumulative period of 18 months.  $7000 in lawyers fees later, they purchased the car back from me for the remainder of the car loan.  I was talked to like a moron by the management at the dealership and customer service for the region.  They told me there was nothing wrong with the car, that I was crazy.  An independent mechanic, agreed upon by Ford, reported the vehicle to be irreparable.
 
1st Subaru had a 5 yr/ 50000 mile warranty.  At 55,000+ the exhaust system went.  Because I had the car serviced regularly, Subaru replaced the entire exhaust system, front to back and charged ONLY for the muffler ($80).  2 months later the CV joints went.  Same thing, no charge at all.  

Then I had a Legacy.  Had a 6 year/100000 mile warranty.  At 6 years and 6 months, with about 120,000 miles on it, the transmission went.  I called 1-800- Subaru customer service and just asked what my options were.  The person on the other end asked if I had it serviced regularly, at Subaru or another certified mechanics and I had.  She asked if I had the paperwork from service visits.  I did.  I faxed her the records.  The next morning, I received a phone call and they told me to take it to the Subaru dealer - of my choice - and they put a rebuilt trans in it.  I paid for Service only which was less than $300.  As I thanked them profusely - the woman made only one comment that has always stuck with me - "" Subaru backs it product"".  What a concept! ","1370045853"

Well it would stand to reason that as the incident happens multiple perspectives are capturing the event. Their job is literally to control what you see. 

Squelching avenues of communication is your number one priority. 

So an event would happen, we get all the info... then the media says nothing.... waits... waits... then BAM here is the what happened. It's like waiting for a web series episode to be made... 

Then we could assume you simply state your version of the truth then spend the rest of the time doing nothing but brow beating your point of view. This makes it almost impossible to have rational discussion. 

So you must ask yourself, where is all this hate coming from? It seems to be that the media is responsible. So whomever would benefit from people not working together is atleast the source of the oppression of your right to know as well as information.

What would the criteria for charities be, and who would choose where the money goes? Surely not everyone supports every charity that exists.

the thing is, you attempt to manipulate men into thinking its ok to be a slut and its ok to marry/ date one, because a high value men doesnt care. caring or not caring has no influence on a mans value.


and you manipulate women into thinking they can be sluts and still expect no high value men to care. simply no.


success, looks, confidence, character, game, popularity and many other things matter. say, im confident, good looking, successful in my career, success with women, i would be a low value men because i wont have a relationship with a slut? (and no, i wouldnt label somebody who had a few ONS like you a slut) bullshit.


if i care, i care about it and no shaming bullshit ""high value men dont care"" changes that. and a high value man will have the confidence to just shrugg this off and then go and pump and dump another slut and move on with his life because its not possible to make him feel insecure about his masculinity and his value so easily. a man with options (and high value men do have plenty of options) will not give a fuck about your attempt to equal high value to not caring about promiscuity.



or in short: a high value man may care, he may doesnt. whether he cares or nor has no influence on his value.

Nope. Took that fucker down that night.

immediate chills and terror swept over me as I froze, but I managed to convince myself I was just crazy and I took a look. 

It was just a toy. Just a stupid toy.

Throw it across room, attempt sleep again. 

Nope. Heart rate is too fast. Decide to watch some TV to pass the time. I put my headphones in, and begin my leisure. 

Then I hear it. 

That fucking noise. The croak. 

I am confused, clearly my mind is playing tricks on me. I stop, wait, several seconds later it happens again. I freeze and wait again.

It's a huge issue, in my opinion, when minorities attempt to advance their religious law in countries not desiring such developments--such as demands for Sharia law in Quebec.

See: [Ectopic pregnancy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectopic_pregnancy). Every religion/ethics teacher I have had has said that in such a case, the church would not be against a procedure to save the mothers life, even if it lead to the death of the child.

Good engine developers don't grow on trees. Maybe they just don't have many of them *or*, which is more likely, some kind of management/money-related issue is responsible for this.

small amounts of rp each month (like swtor does for authenticator users with cartel coins, for example) or a free skin for adding each option to your account or ip boosts every month for using an authenticator. Whatever it is: incentivise. Free crap will bring in a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise add these options to their account and those are probably the people who need it the most. People like me are on top of their crap because we've made an investment in this game (seriously, how much rp have I bought now?) And will sign-up day one. Most users are not this way though and will hear about security options and not really care. Give them a reason to!

The more people have secure accounts the less these threads come up and the fewer issues you have to deal with at the customer service end.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","For a group to be banned you would need to prove that there is a direct link between the party as it exists officially and things such as the firebombing and inciting racial hatred. 

As far as I'm aware there is no evidence than any high-up member of the EDL has ever offically encouraged firebombing. In other words, the leader has never, as far as I know, come out and said everyone should firebomb mosques. All in all, Tommy Robinson is relatively presentable in his interviews, official statements, etc. 

I have no doubt what so ever that members of the EDL have firebombed mosques, but you could not ban a political party for the actions of people who are not official representatives of that party. The individual who did the firebombing would be arrested, of course, but the party would not be held accountable for that action in legal terms. 

For a ban to take place you would need to have evidence that the party officially endorsed violence and that because of that endorsement violence took place. I'm not sure that this is the case with the EDL. ","1370045875"

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","Welcome to the wonderful world of SHIT CPU optimization. The CPU takes such a long time to calculate everything that the GPU ends up sitting around twiddling it's thumbs most of the time. Nothing you cando about it sadly, it's up to HiRez to optimize things better on their end. 

Think of it this way, assume you are getting 50fps (20ms per frame) to make the maths easy. Of that 20ms 15ms is the CPU calculating things and and 5 is your GPU running at 1080p (it doesn't quite work like this but it's close enough to illustrate). CPU gives over to the GPU and the GPU finishes 10ms before the next frame is ready and now has nothing to do. On top of that, if you drop to 640x480 the CPU portion remains unchanged and the GPU portion goes down to 1ms well say (super best case scenario it wouldn't actually be this good). Now your render time is 16ms total, or ~62 fps. Not that great an improvement for going from 1080p to 640x480.

Most normal games actually take most time on the GPU which is why resolution gives a bigger difference normally. Some games can be the opposite where the CPU side takes maybe 5ms and the GPU side is 15 (still 50 fps). In this case if we went from 1008p to 640x480 we might move to 5ms and 3ms, that gives us 8ms or 125fps, a big step up from 50fps.

TL;DR - HiRez in charge of optimization. Best you can do is get a better CPU. I used to average about 20-30% tops GPU usage on my 6850 when I had a core 2 duo @3.2GHz. Now I have an fx-6300 @3.8-4.2 and I get 80-100% GPU usage. Framerates still not as good as I would have liked, I tend to get 70-100 fps on my sniping ini (which is around medium settings for GPU usage I think) but you take what you can get. ","1370045879"

The FO also did a terrible job advertising those two games, I don't think a lot of people knew about them until day of.

That being said, attendance at those U23 USOC games was pathetic, I was pretty disappointed with it.

Midday/weekday U23 games they often invite schools to bring their students to watch. I've heard they pack in several thousand kids on these days.

And then on specific items, Need only if it's your class.

As for crafting mats, I couldn't say. I usually just Greed them because I'm still low level for crafting.

I think what might be good, is rather than Needing All the belts or Rings and such, once you've 'won' one of each universal, Greed from then on. Or once you ID them during a lull in the dungeon and they're not something you can use, offer them to other team-mates?

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Unfortunately it's gotten worse for everything else. The employment market is the worst it's been in 80 years and shows zero indication of meaningful improvement.

You sure about that? 

http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet

It's grim, but not the worst it's been in 80 years, and there's DEFINITELY indication of meaningful improvement. It's also worth noting that, with the advent of the Internet, what's commonly thought of as ""employment"" has blurred substantially. Many, MANY people are able to eke out a decent living using nothing but their computer, dedication, and caffeine.

&gt;The cost of basics like healthcare and education are virtually infinite.

Hmm, true, both have risen substantially, but at the same time you've got more options than ever, ESPECIALLY in terms of education. Degrees have less and less pull as the years go by, as evidenced in my own life (technically, I should have needed a degree three promotions ago, but my skillset and my drive negated that in the eyes of my employer. For my most recent promotion, I beat out someone with a Master's Degree, despite only having a GED, no SAT score, and a couple of expired ASE certifications. Keep in mind that this was for a position that, according to the job description, requires a degree.)

NOTE: I'd like to point out that, by considering things like healthcare and education ""basics"", you have already given us a leg up on thrid-world countries. They may be getting more expensive, but we have them, and we have them in spades compared to many other places on this planet.

&gt;Today's young adults will never achieve anything like the prosperity their parents did.

That depends on your definition of prosperity. Today's young adults have instant access to several orders of magnitude more information and learning materials than their parents ever did, as well as more options for personal and financial growth. The ceiling is considerably higher than it was a generation ago, it's just that the incline is steeper, something that is both good and bad, depending on your work habits and your goals in life.

&gt;The energy inputs on which our economy depends are never getting cheaper or more plentiful.

But they are slowly changing. As newer technologies surpass what's in place, both in terms of cost and affordability, it will slowly transition over. It'll suck while it's happening, but it'll happen.

&gt;We are a civilization in the early stages of collapse.

Or a civilization on the cusp of greatness. We, as a collective species, have only ourselves to blame if things go south, and only ourselves to congratulate if they improve. Dedication and hard work will see us flourish; in-fighting and lethargy will see us hang ourselves.

&gt;The gap is still large, but it's shrinking.

You have yet to provide an explanation regarding our proximity with third-world countries, and how it's getting closer rather than larger. All you've talked about is what we could be doing better, which is hardly the same thing.","1370045883"

"greysanatomy","t5_2t2vo","No, you're misreading the comment.  The fact that both of them cheated is bad, but things happen.  Okay.  I can understand that.  A one time thing while they're both drunk.  Who's to blame?  They're both equally responsible.  It's bad.

The difference, and the reason I like George, is that he TRIED to be GOOD after that.  He realized it was a mistake and tried to be good.  He tried to stay away.  He tried to stay married.

Izzie knew it was a mistake and STILL kept pushing and pushing and pushing.

The fact that George cheated is bad.  The fact that Izzie helped him cheat on his wife is bad.  The fact that George tried to fix it is good.  The fact that Izzie disregarded the marriage from DAY 1 and then encouraged George to cheat more, I can't forgive.

And you're right, she is one of those characters who is always ""what about me"" ... but that one scene where she's in tears begging Denny to live?  I felt it.  It was powerful.","1370045890"

If the skill cost hatred, do you think anyone would use it?  Conversely, if the class was not hatred-starved and had virtually infinite hatred (like barbs and CM wizards), do you think you'd use it?  I'd say if you answer no to either of those questions, it's a bad skill.

It's a difficult skill to use.  The aiming on several of the runes feels pretty random, and that makes the high damage numbers really deceiving.  It's kind of like chakram vs elemental arrow/ball lightning.  Both skills have the same cost, and chakram actually does higher weapon damage %, but ball lightning is easier to use, so it wins almost every time.","1370045892"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","That actually caused a lot of debate in the Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria expansions for WoW, due to talent tree overhauls.

For those unfamiliar, the game had a talent tree system where you'd get a talent point every level starting at level 10, and you could spend them in talents in your specialization for your class. Each class has three specializations (Druids have 4 now), and you could spend 51 points however you pleased. Some talents required 5 points for max potential, some required 2 or 3, and some were 1 point; the 1 point talents were extremely important for your spec. 

Generally, the optimal thing to do was put 31 point into your main tree and spend the rest in the lower tiers of one of the other trees or in other talents in the same tree. You'd get builds like 31/20/0 or 41/0/10 or something. 

Sounds like an interesting design, but it had some major flaws. For one thing, there were plenty of talents that just couldn't compete with the others. These ""trap talents"" were a waste of talent points and were never taken by competent players. Very quickly, players discovered which builds were the best and posted them online. To do your talents, you basically just looked online, saw where you were supposed to put the points, and then you were done, no choice involved. Those that did put the points wherever they wanted usually had pretty bad builds that severely hampered their performance (there were rare cases of certain weird builds ending up being optimal, but these usually didn't last long before they were nerfed). The other problem was that with each expansion, 2 tiers were added to each talent tree, and the trees were starting to get massive. 

Cataclysm saw the first talent reform. Talent points were only earned once every other level, and many passive fluff talents (like ""increase damage done by X spell by 40%"") were removed and just added to the spec or the ability. Trees were cut back down from 51 points to 31 points, and there were a lot fewer talents to choose from. The idea was that with fewer choices, you'd spend most of your points in the ""mandatory"" talents and then you'd have a handful to place however you want.

Some players were already outraged. They wanted the freedom to put points wherever they wanted and were upset that they were ""losing choices"" when 99% of players used the same build anyway. The reform was good, but still flawed. It turned out that everyone had the same builds anyway, because the leftover talent points (after the mandatory talents) were basically meaningless, as the other, non-mandatory talents had little to no impact on gameplay. If they did, then they'd be mandatory.

Blizzard finally scrapped the entire tree system in Mists of Pandaria and developed an entirely new talent system. Now, there are 6 tiers of talents, with three talents each, and all three specs of a class use the same talents. Every 15 levels, you can choose one of the three talents in a tier, to the exclusion of the others. The talents are all roughly the same in utility/output, so there's no ""right"" choice, it's based on preference. All of the mandatory skills/passives that were available through talents became passively baked into your specialization and you gain them as you level.

The community exploded. Players rabidly argued that they went from 51 choices to 6 and that their creativity was being stifled and blah blah blah. In reality, there are hundreds of possible viable builds for each class now and talent builds are a lot more diverse. But most players just saw that they had less talent points to spend and assumed that they were being shafted, even though before, there were only 1 or 2 viable builds for their spec. We got more choice, but lost the illusion of choice.

I'm not sure why I wrote that whole thing, to be honest. It only marginally has to do with your point. But I spent long enough that I'm gonna post it anyway, dammit. ","1370045893"

humans are hackers by nature (not the computer kind) we find something, we observe it, use it,modify it, recreate it then enhance it.

cave men first observed fire in nature, then we used it to hunt and cook, then we modified it by burning different materials, soon we could recreate it and after inventing ovens that burn at high temperature we enhanced it. many things in life were done in this pattern.


we have observed the human brain with cat scans and eeg's now we use it with brain computer interfaces(neural interfaces) soon we will modify it with implants, which we kinda have already with digital eyes and such, then we will recreate it and then we will enhance it.

An Honest Yorkshireman by
Henry Carey (Died 1748)

I is i' truth a coontry youth,
Nean used to Lunnon fashions;
Yet vartue guides, an' still presides
Ower all my steps an' passions.
Nea coortly leer, bud all sincere,
Nea bribe shall iver blinnd me ;
If thoo can like a Yorkshire tike,
A rogue thoo'll niver finnd me.

Thof envy's tongue, so slimly hung,
Would lee aboot oor coonty,
Nea men o' t' earth boast greater worth,
Or mair extend their boonty.
Oor northern breeze wi' us agrees,
An' does for wark weel fit us ;
I' public cares, an' love affairs,
Wi' honour We acquit us.

Sea great a maand is ne'er confaand
'Tiv onny shire or nation,
They gie un meast praise whea weel displays
A larned eddication;
Whaal rancour rolls i' laatle souls,
By shallow views dissarnin',
They're nobbut wise at awlus prize
Good manners, sense, an' larnin'.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I think you straighten up and learn what the Actual Catholic Stance is on the issue and other science issues. I'm not going to get into science debate as it would be off topic except i will give a brief view - God designed the entire universe's physics, biology, chemistry, so Catholics see studying science as finding out how God programmed the world. and look up reasons why God doesn't perform divine intervention constantly.

&gt;but condemn it to save the lives of mothers.

As for the actual abortion issue Catholics permit [Indirect Abortions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_abortion). Simply put Human Life is sacred and equal. If it was a case where both the Fetus and Mother will die, or with surgery the mother can be saved but at the cost of the Fetus it is permissible. 

In math terms you have Mother (1) and Fetus(1) together they are 2 human lives (1+1=2).

Now that Mother(1)wants to abort that Fetus (1), 
2-1=1. The number of sacred lives have been decreased when they didn't have to be.

 in this scenario a normal pregnecy versus normal abortion 2&gt;1, no abortion should be issued.

The Fetus implanted itself in the woman's fallopian tubes and if not removed will kill itself and the mother. 2-1-1 =0. 
If surgery is performed saving the mother but the fetus is unable to be developed and dies, the resulting equation will be 2-1=1.

Now while both are lower than the optimal 2 there is still a difference in the amount of sacred lives afterwards. 1&gt;0 so therefore surgery methods that result in saving the mother at the cost of the fetus is preferable to both dieing. ","1370045897"

Fighting is a safe-guard against dirty play, a self-regulation against hits that can KILL someone.

Wayne Gretzky talks often about the need for fighting, it allowed him to be who he was while only fighting once himself.

His rookie year was pretty disastrous, but he has improved his shooting dramatically last year.  His defense and ball handling is still below average, but has also improved this past year (especially the ball handling).

I personally think the kings could use a shooter like Jimmer, but if the right trade presents itself, I would be okay shipping him away (probably with another player) if it means we bring in a serviceable SF.

Off topic:  However, I would personally not want to make trades this offseason.  We've dealt with some pretty atrocious coaches, front office decisions, etc.  I want to see how our new front office and coaching may affect the performance of our players.","1370045905"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Adoption issues often involve narcissism on the part of the a-mom. Infertility is a bear, and especially in the older generations you just weren't allowed to form an identity as a woman unless you were also a mother, so there's a huge amount of psychological stress involved. I live in Utah and if you don't have kids here, as a woman, you are less than nothing. I have seen infertile women literally lose their minds here. Narcissism is a protective reaction to that stress. So, that's an explanation of what's happening with your a-mom - but not an excuse for how she is treating you. Protect yourself and your unborn kid and get the hell away from her as soon as you can. Your baby can feel every bit of stress you experience, so when your a-mom makes you upset, she's literally hurting your child. Your job right now is to take care of you and the life you carry. Good luck. 

When you've got a chance, I would recommend putting a little effort into finding out more about your bio parents. It sounds like you don't know the real story of how you were relinquished, and it seems likely your a-mom is not a reliable source of info. Particularly as you're having a kid of your own, having some of this info might help you. I found my bio family last year and it has helped a lot. *I know who I am now.* All the weird mindfuckery my adoptive family put on me doesn't stick any more. I am way less anxious, way less angry, and I find it much easier not to put up with anyone's ridiculous shit any more. I don't fight it, I just route around it and it goes away. 

Weirdly, since I found my bio mom, my narcissistic a-mom has suddenly started treating me really well. It could be for a lot of different reasons - one, she now has competition! Also, she doesn't have to be ""the mother"" any more. She never really wanted to be a mother - she just *thought* she wanted to. She didn't know how to be a woman any other way, because of our ridiculous restrictive patriarchal culture. I am so glad to see that stupid old shit changing so hopefully fewer people will have to put up with crazy parents like this in the future.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I was going to respond to all the points in detail, but after reading ""C""  I decided just to skip to here:

&gt;and don't you DARE try claiming that your Entity is beyond logic.

Yup.  That is what I'm claiming.  We can only understand God in logical terms (because we can only understand *anything* in logical terms), but as the ultimate *root* of the logical ought, God must be beyond logic.  

Now, before you go off on how crazy I am, I ought to explain the picture of the *causal origin* of logic that I'm working with (it's a roughly Kantian picture, if that helps with the explanation at all).  We can only understand things in logical terms, and so everything we experience and can think about fits with the laws of logic.  However, our understanding of things is a result of how our cognitive capacities have evolved, and how we've been socialized.  Since these things *account* for the fact that we can only understand things in logical terms, there must be *some sense* in which the physical world which gives rise to our conceptual capacities is ""beyond logic.""  Still, we cant *conceive* of anything beyond logic, and so we have to understand the world (which gave rise to our logical understanding) in logical terms.

The same is the case with God.  Whereas evolution and socialization give a *causal* explanation of our logical understanding of things, God gives a *normative* explanation of it--that is, he explains why it is *correct.*  These are two fundamentally different sorts of explanations.

I'm dealing with difficult conceptual issues, but I'm really not playing a word game.  I'll happily clarify anything I've said.","1370045907"

"longboarding","t5_2qvgw","Okay, so, instead of having the convenience of slide pucks attached to your hands, you now have to carry around two large steel contraptions? 

&gt;Secondly the claws pucks are design with a bevelled edge so that they don't catch on Concrete. The only way they would catch is if you don't meet them flat to the pavement which is just as likely as top siding a 4 wheel slide.

When I fall, I tend to land on my hands. It seems like it'd be much more awkward to get these underneath yourself and placed correctly when you have next to no time to react. With gloves, as long as your hands are out, you should be alright. If I happen to get highsided going fast and don't properly line Claws up, my hands are going to be missing a lot of skin. 

&gt;Once you feel them out and understand them they actually create a more controllable safer experience while sliding. 

I can guarantee these aren't safer than gloves. With gloves, your entire hand is protected. With these, like QuitoPR said, if you somehow let go of the Claws, your bare skin is going to make contact with the road. You keep saying that these are safer, but you have yet to give any reasoning as to *why* they're safer, other than the fact that they give you ""less strain."" Obviously I can't speak for others, but when I fall, I'm going to be much more concerned with not getting road rash or ragdolling than I am straining my wrist, which has yet to happen in my five years of riding longboards and sliding.

&gt;How does it seem detrimental to you?

Let's see, instead of having leather covering my hand, my bare hands are now precariously placed on top of one of these Claws. If the Claw *does* happen to tip over, your bare skin is going to contact the pavement. I can put slide gloves on and not even have to think about them until I need to use them. With Claws, you have to always be consciously holding onto them.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","I'm the same as your BF, or was. I recognized the problem myself and made an effort to get past most of my hangups - sounds like he needs to as well. I would note this, though: if he's like me, sex is not a stress reliever, it's a stress causer. It's fun and feels good and all, but still - kinda gross, other people way to close to me, sounds and noises that make me crazy, and finally,  all the stuff we learned as kids, when we finally started to figure out social rules*, the stuff we were learning was ""don't let people touch your hoohoo"".

Really, you can't force him to do anything, but you can have a frank discussion about the consequences of not working with you or talking with you about this. If he does care about you, he will see that he needs to make some kind of effort whether he likes it or not. Relationships involve compromise, and if there isn't.... well, those relationships tend to fall apart. Not saying give him an ultimatum, but he needs to be made aware that this is a problem for you.

Tell him he doesn't have to talk about it, but you will - he only needs to listen. 

Also - therapy, a counselor who specializes in Asperger's and who is comfortable discussing sex issues would be a very good idea. 

Take charge. Be the dominant person, show him what you like by using him like a blow up doll. :) For me, anyway, it was so terrifying the first time or 700 that I could never figure out what to do. So show him, by manipulating his body in the ways you like. That will help take away the fear he may have about what to do.

Lastly, you've been patient, and will likely have to continue to be. But that doesn't mean that you can't set some expectations anyway, and hold him to them. Just be patient with how they manifest, and make it clear. Tell him you expect sex at least 1x a month (or whatever), take charge, show him what to do, and be patient while he learns and gets past his embarrassment and issues.

Hope that helps!

*at least, my understanding is that Aspies have learned some social cues, but that they're secondary, not innate, and thus in stressful situations, which sex can be, we tend to revert to the innate over the learned... hence... awkward. That's how it was for me at his age.","1370045916"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Shall we granting moral status based on function or on some other criteria? You chose function, I think; something that can't engage in behaviors that are standard for thinking beings have lesser or no moral status.

Shall we judge them based on their current level of function, past, or future? Maybe some combination? Presumably we should include their current level of function. If we don't include their future level, then I am free to kill someone once they have no brain activity, even if we have the technology to revive her. But does that constrain us to avoid killing bacteria on foreign planets because it might one day evolve into intelligent life?

My view is that something has no moral status before it has a certain function threshold. Once it passes that threshold, it keeps that status as long as it has that level of function or we have sufficient expectation that it will be able to function at or above that level in the future. So if a normal human gets frozen solid and vitrified and are being maintained at a temperature of, oh, 50 Kelvins, but we have the technology to thaw the person and revive her, she's still morally a person with a right to life.

One issue with my view is that moral personhood is in some ways bound to medical technology. If I were vitrified today, I have no idea whether we'll get technology sufficient to revive me. Does this mean I lose moral status? Or if between the time where that woman was vitrified and when she could be revived, technology levels dropped to near zero and humans then died out, does she lose moral status when all the humans die out?

I might instead say that it's based on what's in theory possible rather than what is practical. That leaves us in a position where we are horribly wronging people by burying them to rot when we could preserve their brains for later reanimation.

This isn't a popular set of moral judgments, but it is consistent and it matches my morality decently well.","1370045918"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Unfortunately yes. Business as usual for them was always to abandon their phones, but the Atrix was abandoned even faster than their other phones. This was right around the time of the transition and ICS was 90% completed and they decide to keep the phone on GB which is ridiculous since it was their 2011 flagship phone and should have gotten ICS in early 2012. This was the pinnacle of them being a shitty company since they just held off until it was late enough for them to say ""Oh well, it's an old phone now"". A dick move considering the Atrix was on the list to get ICS and that list was public for many months, and they decide at the last minute to take it off.

He was a Tyrell, and liked to travel between keeps to make sure the little lords were doing what they were supposed to be doing. As he arrives he was rather fond of throwing the lords out of their own bedchambers and take their bed for the night.

So he found himself in a [bed with a heavy canopy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_bed). Next to the bed was a sash, pulling it would normally summon a wench to warm him bed... and his loins as well.

Instead, however, the canopy opened and revealed dozens if not hundreds of scorpions and they crashed down on the Lord of Highgarden.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","First off, congrats! 7x is a helluva bump in pay. Keep living like you never got that pay increase, and you'll be rich. That's really all there is to that.

Now the hard news. This is California, everyone's in tech, and until those options vest they're worthless. 

Sorry.

No one hears about all the failed startups on the way to Facebook, Google, Apple, and so on. In recent memory, everybody loves Tesla, but Fisker's a footnote that nobody's heard of. Shit happens, and it is *entirely* possible for them to become worthless overnight. I'm sure that won't happen to you, but keep it in mind. They may theoretically be worth something, but shops don't take theoretical dollars.

That comes off harshly, but that's the /r/frugal way of looking at it (And I believe HN agrees with that).

But if you're making a six, possibly seven figure salary? Necessities should be covered and everything after that is gravy. Get retirement going, get some cash savings for emergencies, get some play money, and then invest the rest. Whether you invest it in real-estate, the stock-market, BitCoin, hide it under the bed, or magic beans is up to you.

Owning a house? Just another investment, just one you happen to be able to live in. There's a housing market, same as there's a stock market, with its own foibles.

You'll need to consider how much mortgage + property tax (this is California, property tax &amp; prop 13 kills you) will be compared to rent, and what you can afford *after* income tax, retirement, and savings are subtracted from what you make.

But getting a house? Save up 20% for a down-payment, go into debt for N years, move in, and N years later you fully own the house free and clear.

Best of luck to you.","1370045927"

That said...

It bugs the hell out of me when people do this - and I have seen too many photos of people doing things like this with real babies.

When a female dog has a bunch of puppies, she doesn't pick the newborn pups up by the scruff of the neck and bring them out and lay them at the feet of the pack for them to love on.

She snaps, snarls, and drives the other dogs away until the pups are old enough to meet the rest of the pack.

I took a similar approach with my babies when I brought them home - go away.  My baby.  You may not sniff, or approach me right now - I am holding a newborn.  I loved on them when I wasn't holding the newborn, but when I had the baby in my arms for changing or nursing or whatever they had to maintain a respectful distance.

The dogs seemed to inherently understand, and it reinforced the fact that they are NOT alpha in the house.  As the babies got older they were allowed to interact with them.

"golf","t5_2qhcs","I don't really ""swing"" my wedges. I see the ""100 yards-in game"" as a completely different animal and would not choose a wedge based on a full swing or anything like it.

If your set-matching pitching wedge is good for 110 yards and the sand wedge is good for 80, then you don't really need a gap wedge for a 90-yard shot. You need to hit your PW at 75%. It's a much higher percentage shot than pushing the limits of your sand wedge...and what about controlling spin? No chance with a full SW. 

When I learned how to punch the sand wedge 110, I was spinning my balls off the front of the green and replacing them every third hole. It sure is fun to watch it skip once, come to a stop and shoot back towards the front of the green, though. I actually holed one like that. It bounced about where the cup was, got to the back apron and shot like a magnet to the cup in the center of the green. It would have gone the full length of the green had it missed.

Worst case of this ever was when I met a girl through mutual friends (leading me to believe she was in my age range) and found out on our first date that she's not interested in ANYTHING, and that she's 19.  I felt like our conversation was a dead ox that I was dragging behind me.  (In my defense, I managed to keep things going pretty well.)  As we were parting ways she gave me a very unenthusiastic hug and practically ran for her train.  I write the whole thing off.

An hour later I get a text from her saying she really enjoyed herself and that she'd like to see me again.  I respond like you do - that it was nice to meet her - and figured she's just being polite.  Until three days later (I haven't contacted her since) when she texts me again asking when we can hang out again.","1370045931"

You don't need a big thickness of lead to work as a shield but it's very dense.  On the other hand something like polyethylene works well but its low density means that you need a much thicker layer to be effective.  Any choice of material is a tradeoff to try and minimise total mass.

Really, you don't want to carry anything 'extra' at all if you can help it.  Some of the proposals suggest storing the mission's water and other consumables around the outside of the craft to shield the astronauts within.  That way you're using something that you would be taking anyway so hopefully you're not adding mass to the craft.","1370045932"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Efforts  to expand production from the Alberta tar sands suffered a significant setback on Friday when the provincial government of British Columbia rejected a pipeline project because of environmental shortcomings.

&gt;In a strongly worded statement, the government of the province said it was not satisfied with the pipeline company's oil spill response plans.

&gt;The rejection of the pipeline – which was to have given Alberta an outlet to Pacific coast ports and markets in China – further raises the stakes on another controversial tar sands pipeline, Keystone XL.

&gt;Barack Obama is still weighing a decision on that pipeline, intended to pump tar sands crude to the Texas gulf coast.

&gt;British Columbia, in its official submission to a pipeline review panel, said the company had failed to demonstrate an adequate clean-up plan for the Enbridge Northern Gateway project. It set five new conditions for the project's approval.

&gt;""Northern Gateway has presented little evidence about how it will respond in the event of a spill,"" Christopher Jones, a lawyer representing the province, said in a statement to the federal government panel reviewing the project.

&gt;""It is not clear from the evidence that Northern Gateway will in fact be able to respond effectively to spills either from the pipeline itself, or from tankers transporting diluted bitumen,"" Jones added.

&gt;Jones said the pipeline would cross over remote and extremely difficult terrain, with pristine rivers that could be devastated in the event of a spill. He said those considerations compelled the province to hold the pipeline company to a higher standard. “Trust me is not good enough in this case.”

Unfair. BP’s “Trust me” was **certainly** adequate for the Mexican Gulf Coast. And is **certainly** adequate coming from the Keystone XL people and their servants, the Republican Party. Un*fair!*","1370045936"

For example, an arrogant and self-centered weapons specialist who on the other hand is brilliant at his post and consistently performs well in combat is affecting the morale of the other sailors. The crew outside of the department (don't know the technical term) aren't exactly affected by him/her but his fellow crew mates gain a slight drop in 'morale' when a battle is successful and our self-centered crew member does a slight animation, a fist pump or similar celebratory action, and his fellow sailors have a slight ""~sigh~"" bubble. As he/she continues this, the crew members may, a). Act more aggressive towards the crew member, eventually boiling over to a fight that may leave one or both in the medical center or in the brig, and it would be your job as captain to handle that situation. Or b). The 'morale' of the crew members in that department falls to the point where they'd want to show him/her up, decreasing performance and increasing mistakes, or may just give up a little because the crew-man'll probably just make everyone else feel bad.

This could tie into your idea of speech being used in a way that encourages the player to pay attention on their crew, making sure they are performing at top level, while remaining passive in nature that it'll take a trained eye to see the interactions and how to deal with them effectively (like a good ol' reprimanding)

I actually read things like the Economist, among other publications, just because they are actually balanced. They don't kiss Obama's ass, nor do the accuse him of being the antichrist. They merely describe the actual impacts of his policy decisions.

I'm not necessarily suggesting that it would make sense to pull *all* funding from government research and defense entities. But a dramatic restructuring is called for, in my opinion. Keep a few hundred million in closely watched, highly transparent research divisions like NASA and DARPA and make sure they keep innovating in areas that might not make sense for a typical companies (or have them do things that spur further development in the market, like landing on the moon). And cut the military proper so that we are still the most powerful nation in the world, but maybe not quite so powerful that we spend almost 40 cents out of every dollar spent on military worldwide.

Larger leg pads would also help.  Ideally you want to land in the center of the landing block every time.  If you are hanging over the top of the landing gear you are leaving your knee wide open to a direct shot.  The larger thigh rise could also help close your five-hole in the butterfly so pucks will have a tougher time finding their way in to your knees.

You could also look in to knee pads like [these](http://www.goaliemonkey.com/warrior-goalie-knee-protectors-ritual-pro.html).  Thigh boards like yours are fine when they cover everything properly but pucks always seem to find any gaps in protection.","1370045951"

I used to be Gold II, but dropped/decayed to Silver I due to not playing, and I found that I was giving my team AND the Plat/Diamonds the majority of advice.

They went really 'tryhard' though. They did a 2v1 on me top, which was fine since I knew that they would dive me from the tribush by 3-4 minutes which I was prepared for since that's the point of the 2v1, but there's only so much you can do alone. With a team full of silvers, we couldn't adjust our game as a whole or take advantage of the 2v1 bottom (one solid gank = free dragon).

It was fine when it was 1v1, despite the tower advantage they had, and lost because I was overaggressive when I predicted their jungler would head bot with our bot lane overextended to their second turret somehow (with the outer one still up).

Only thing I have to ask is that Plat/Diamond players give their part by giving out more concrete/sufficient advice. You get to smurf without smurfing for a game, don't just stomp us and then leave.","1370045959"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Suicide Singed strat requires 3 things:

1) Coordination with your team: If you tell your team in champ select what you plan on doing, they can pick a strong team around you that can handle 4 v 5's or can snowball their own lanes while the enemy teams jungle has to camp top as well as be ready to react and take advantage of the distraction you're being.  Most people in solo queue will chase the Singed for kills because they think stat padding their KDA is more important than the fact that two towers just went down.  This part of the strat is literally the most important.

2) Know how to play Singed properly.  The reason Druiddroid is so successful with this strat is because he knows how to play Singed.  Knowing how to properly kite a minion wave/what items to buy/runes/etc are all very vital to this strat.  Druid starts flask/ward/hp pot and then rushes a tear --&gt; boots --&gt; Rylai's ---&gt; Seraphs.  

3) Having an opposing lane opponent that you can actually do this against.  This one isn't necessary but can make the difference between two top laners perfect farming and outright denial of farm for the other top laner.  The prime example of this is when Dyrus played Shen against Druiddroid's Singed.  Shen is an awful pusher at the early levels and Druid was able to run him into the ground to the point where Dyrus said the game was over 15 minutes in because nobody could stop Singed from freefarming.

The reason its failing at lower levels is because of reasons mentioned.  If a team isn't coordinated or knowledgable enough about the game to realize they have a map pressure advantage when the jungler, top laner, and mid laner are chasing after the 0/7 Singed then yeah the strat will fail.  But at the same time if executed properly you can stomp the other team.  In an ideal scenario where the Singed's team is competent, Singed has 1 of 2 things happen:

1) He draws everybody to him and he feeds, isn't worth gold, gets top tower regardless, and his team has free reign over the map.

2) They ignore him and a free farm Singed becomes gigantic and just runs through the other team like a truck.

"GrandTheftAutoV","t5_2t0xk","I see so many different types of people with iPhones and other super advance smartphones that it's not even funny. In real life.

Yesterday I watched that Vice documentary on the Crips Vs The KKK and I saw I saw a few old redneck KKK members with iPhones. I think those barriers are broken down in culture, and that's the weird thing about now. You can find everyone from a elementary school kid to a grandmother with an super advance smartphone. 

I mean, would they really break down the consistency between the phone function just to fit the style of the characters? When GTA IV came out, we were still kinda stuck in the era between old flip phones, bars, and sidekicks which all had no internet access or bad internet access. So seeing Niko with a mid-tier decent bar, Johnny with an even less advance phone, and Luis with a touch screen that seemed like one of those early ones that would pale in comparison with recently released models, it wasn't really weird to have them have phones that matched their styles. Sure Luis was more of a high maintenance type of guy, a lot of women and into the club scene. Johnny was a grungy biker who seemed like he couldn't give a s*** about fancy phones. Niko was an immigrant who wanted nice things, and seemed like he would be interested in tech enough to want a good phone.

Since we know that the internet is going to play a part in this game, and now on the phones; I can't see rockstar breaking down gameplay consistency. Like, I can see Michael with an iPhone; I can see Franklin with an iPhone, and I get why people can't see Trevor with a fancy smartphone. The thing is though, it's not that far fetched and for the sake of consistency; Rockstar may find a funny way to fit it in to his character. 

Like I know guys who have smartphones but hate them, they can't work them but they always get around it. These are usually older guys, and just guys with no interest in tech. I can see it being a part of Tevor's humor to go on about how unnecessary the iFruit is or how he doesn't need to be connected 24/7.","1370045964"

I came in as comm. as a E-3 (low peon) when I got my first promotion 3 years after joining my supervisor instead of congratulating me told me he didn't want me promoted and tried to get me kicked out instead. It went on for years one telling the next who would tell me how much I was a waste of space. I had one tell me I'm not even cut out for mcdonalds. It hurt, I finally left that base and unit after 5 years of being there. Next unit treated me just as bad because of my past. No matter how much work I did and how little everyone else did they yelled at me and treated me like shit. They took my assignment away and sent me to the middle of north dakota instead. Every year they would give me low marks on my performance reports which would cause me to be passed up on promotion year after year despite scoring better then everyone else. I now have 30 days left before I'm finally out, because they're kicking me out for failure to promote. Failure to get a rank I've seen trained monkeys get. 

Thanks to the US military I have zero self confidence, zero self esteem, crippling self doubt and depression and I don't think I'll ever be able to hold a job without having a constant paranoid fear that my own supervision is singling me out and trying to get me. The trust issues are so bad I won't even go see a mental health worker. I don't trust they care, they'll say whatever and give me whatever pills to get me out the door.

Thanks for your prayers, and I pray God blesses you with all the more wisdom, that you may continue to be humble and show others the grace shown you. Remember God in everything you do and say. I pray that your heart continues to grow for your brothers and sisters in Christ, as well as the lost, who so need God and who don't always know it. All these things I pray in Jesus' name, Amen.

Sometimes, controlling behaviour is explained away as being ""protective,"" and I absolutely cannot tolerate that -- in my abusive ex-relationship, for instance, my ex used to absolutely freak at me if I went to a bar and walked home because it was too ""dangerous."" Well, I'm a grown-ass woman, not a child, and I don't need a man to give me lectures or rules on what I can and cannot do.

On the other hand, my current amazing and feminist-IDed boyfriend can be protective in ways that are tailored to who he knows that *I* am, which is really different. It's stuff like... if he sees something he knows will upset me (certain kinds of violence, certain comments on my articles), he'll gently warn me about it so that I can make an informed choice about whether or not I want to see it.

The latter, I appreciate because he's not in any way dictating what I can do with my life or my body, but rather showing empathy for and awareness of my feelings partner-to-partner.

This is pure speculation from here:

If we had done that, we probably wouldn't have had the Cold War. Now, would it have been a colonial relationship? Probably not. Russia would have needed an immense rebuilding effort and we weren't in any kind of position to provide them with the capital for it as our own war was being funded by war bonds.

It's going to be up to the Black Army to document this with pictures and videos so we can flood the crap out of every Mexican sports media personality on twitter with this.

This silenced them? They were unable to express these views because of this? These views will forever be subjugated because of the fire alarm? The lecturer is now unable to give lectures anywhere at any time because of this?

&gt; but when you forcibly make it impossible for them to speak, you have crossed a line.

So you are against libel and slander laws then? You are against hate speech laws? You think that if someone posts a sign saying falsely accusing you of being a child rapist... you think that tearing that sign down is a more violent act than the accusation?

&gt;Please provide evidence that either of those was being done at the lectures at U of T.

I understand the desire for statements to be backed up by facts. However, I have made no such claim that either of those was being done at the lectures at U of T.

You of course, are probably not a hypocrite. I'm sure when you heard that a fire alarm was pulled, and that it was feminist protesters who did it, you didn't just accept it as fact automatically. I'm sure you immediately sought out evidence.","1370045987"

I guess agree to disagree.

Also, I am not sure that China not going to war since 1979 is a good indicator of their desires. If the US was not there to balance out their ambitions, going by the way their government talks (e.g. with the way they handled that island group issue and how they address Taiwan), I am not so sure that they would be so peaceful.

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","I will accept criticism from you if you do it understanding what it is you are criticizing, but as long as you don't I won't take it as valid. As such, you can stop reading from now if you don't feel you want to continue, but just do so knowing that you have no idea what it is I'm talking about. I also beg you to read on regardless of if you take the time to reply because it took me a lot more time and effort to write this than it would take you to read it. If you don't think formulating an answer is worth the effort, don't do so. I would appreciate it if you told me you decided as such though, just as an acknowledgement of the time I spent doing this, I suppose.

&gt;ok ok ok.. ill read on but I really do want you to reflect on what that dismissal of what you deem non vital really means. I mean shit. You want to be an Architect, but there is no need for architects in the world you are proposing. All we need is one simple plan for the most efficient block apartment building and we are done. No Sidney Opera House, No Falling Waters. none of that. 

You are confusing what I said and attributing things to the ideology that would rather have to do with the lack of funds. If we lack the funds for everyone to have shoes unless everyone has the same shoes, a statist or an anarchist socialist, and even a democratic socialist society would mostly be willing to sacrifice the variety which would mean maybe only 10 people out of 50 have shoes, so that instead 50 out of 50 have shoes.

If the community values having variety in shoes more than, say, iPhones, they might make no iPhones and then everyone can have whatever shoes they want. This doesn't have to do with sacrificing the individual or variety, it has to do with working with limited resources, simple as that. You often cannot do everything, and as such *all* societies have to make sacrifices, including a capitalist one.

&gt;All we need is one simple plan for the most efficient block apartment building and we are done. No Sidney Opera House, No Falling Waters. 

I myself currently live in one of those European Social Democracies that you talk about. I'll come back to that later.

&gt;the same sized house, same car, same fancy food and lavish lifestyle

Alright man, let me bring back the same point again. Communism does *not* mean from each according to their ability, to each equally. It means, from each according to their ability to each according to their *need*.

If one of those potheads that you described does not contribute according to their ability, they are not entitled to get their needs filled. Further, if all they do is sit around and smoke all day, they don't need a big house and a big care or whatever it was you said, they need marijuana and a place to sit. They contribute to society giving everything they have? Well they are entitled to get some marijuana to smoke if that is what they want to dedicate themselves to. You have completely no understanding of what communism is. You have it completely fuzzed up with *dictatorship of the proletariat*. Marx and Engels called capitalism ""dictatorship of the bourgeois"", and they believed that in order to *transition* into true communism, a period of *dictatorship of the proletariat* would be necessary. This means that they acknowledged what anarchists believe, that both forms of dictatorship are oppressive, but they found that the *practical* way to get to communism was through dictatorship of the proletariat. What existed at some point in the past in ""communist"" countries such as the USSR as well as China was ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" (through ""righteous"" power that the Communist Party believed that they had) according to *them*. I would say that instead it was just oligarchy that existed, and state capitalism or a dictatorship of the communist party. Again, an Anarchist such as myself would say that a dictatorship of *any* sort is oppressive, and as such should be avoided, and do not believe in the *utilitarian* methods of the Marxists.

&gt;If you and I were heading to the beach and you worked for weeks to pay for the condo, pay for the beer, pay for the lawn chairs and all that stuff, and i kinda put a bit of effort in but had other priorities like hanging out with friends and getting high, i guarantee you that you would feel a sense of entitlement over the beach weekend.

Back to the same basic idea you lack an understanding of. If you do not provide according to your ability, you don't have the right for me to fill your needs for you. Not ""you laze around while I work and I pay for you"", instead ""We both work to the best of our efforts and if you have more need than I do, you get to take home a little more"". You can keep not understanding this and making arguments on something else, but in the arguments you give you lack an understanding for it and as such they are dismantled by it.

&gt;You are contradicting yourself. What is best for the community is centralization and uniformity.

I do not believe in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. I believe that in lack of food, basic human dignity should still be maintained. I believe there are *many* things more important than life itself, and as such I believe the pyramid to be cynical.

&gt;What is best for the community is centralization and uniformity.

I do not believe this, in the *slightest*.

&gt; There is no need for architects in the Marxist/Socialist world. The best and most efficient design for an apartment block has already been developed. 

Do you not realize you are arguing against centralization with an *anarchist*? It is *exactly against* centralization that I am. You can have that argument with a Marxist if you want, but your points are irrelevant to me.

&gt;No need for art, music, design, style, good food.. we should all just be robots dedicated to the community with no self identity and drive for success. 

It's fucking *depressing* how you are citing cold war propaganda, which is aimed against *utilitarian totalitarianism* that existed in the USSR during what *they* claimed to be ""War communism"", never ever claiming to have achieved communism at all, even themselves, even less me. 

&gt;dedicated to the community with no self identity and drive for success. 

On the contrary, again, anarchism values the *individual* above everything else, and believes that it is lost through centralization, through bureaucracy etc.

Also, you are confusing not acting purely in *self interest* with ""no drive for success"". On the contrary, I would be much more motivated to work for success if it was not for myself but for a community that included myself again. This is *exactly* the same mechanism which can drive a professional man to be more interested in having a successful career once he has a wife and a child to support. In my view, when you claim that not working in self interest contradicts basic human nature, you are claiming that a father working for the bright future of his child to be against ""basic human nature"". I see it as the opposite. I don't deny that it is ""human nature"" to act in self interest, I believe that everything that humans do is ""human nature"". Using that argument is in my opinion completely empty. Human nature is to kill 6 million jews. Human nature is to give a man who lost his legs in a war charity on the street. Human nature is expliting workers for self interest. Human nature is *everything that humans do*. Indeed, I respect capitalists because there is a part of me that they know better than I do myself, which involves exactly the self interest you speak about.

&gt; I can tell you from personal experience that some people pull their weight and some people do not. Some people contribute more than others to a shared space, and some people do not.

&gt;This is a basic fact of human existence and I would say a basic reality of evolution. Do you believe in evolution?

Yes, I believe in evolution, I also believe that there are many misconceptions of regarding evolution. I don't believe in Social Darwinism, however, which is what you are proposing and to me is repulsing. Regarding some people contributing less then others, lets go back to the *same* principle you are not touching again. Remember: from each according to their ability, to each according to their need.

Some people have things that prevent them from pulling their own weight, e.g. old age. They are still worthy of having their needs fulfilled, having their weight being ""pulled"" by them even if they are unable to pull it themselves. If they *do* everything withing their ability to pull their own weight (and more than that if they can), they are entitled to get their weight pulled for them. I do not believe that once they cannot pull their own weight anymore they should be left to die, which to me looks like the alternative to pulling their weight for them.

Like I said, I live in a European Social Democracy right now, and let me propose to you two examples of how centralization (a basic concept opposed by anarchism) leads to exactly some of the things you described as hating.

In doing this, the strain on the systems is pretty massive.

If this feature was never included in the design for BF3 then the current generation of Consoles would have easily been able to handle 64 players.

Last I checked, Battlefield 1942, from 2002, supported 64 players. So it has nothing to do with the tech, or the hardware being limited in some magical way.

Running a server AND the game at the same time is the reason why consoles can't handle 64 players, not because they don't have GPU horsepower.","1370046001"

I can only think of 4 solutions to this problem, please help me if there are more. 

1. Allow people to dump babies in dumpsters. (solves nothing)

2. Provide free abortions to individuals who cannot support a child. (morally questionable, does not solve root problem)

3. Offer to take custody of children that cannot be cared for. (Like the safe haven laws we are discussing. Still does not solve root problem)

4. Fix poverty. If everyone had the means to take care of a child, this would not be an issue. (requires miracle)

I am blown away that you suggest prosecuting these people. That is insane. Your solution is to unnecessarily expend government resources prosecuting poor people who can't take care of a baby instead of using that money to support them so that they can, or use it to actually take care of these babies. You would rather actively worsen the state of our society than work to rehabilitate the homeless, unemployed, or chronically unfortunate?

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","1. There is an old part of the town that is full of wooden houses that date thousands of years. Historically, this has been a working-class neighborhood, and factories were built close to it during industrialization. Today, this is *the* most expensive part of town to get a house in, the houses are obviously very old and are thus fashionable and with historical value. However, a few decades ago there was no appreciation for them, they were a proletarian neighborhood, like I said, and the houses were seen as old and un-modern. What the centralized SocDem government did was have some architects in the capital who had literally never been to the town draw apartment buildings that they replaced a huge part of the neighborhood with. Needless to day, the design of the buildings is completely god awful and has nothing to do with the area around them. There is a complete clash between the styles, and frankly *ugly* generic apartment blocks replaced those beautiful thousand-year-old small houses. Any one of those houses in today's prices would be worth many-fold one of those apartment blocks. Further more, my father lived in the area at the time, and new an 80-year-old widowed mother that lived with her two 50 year old unmarried sons in one of the houses that was on the land on which they wanted to construct these apartment blocks. They were forcibly moved from the house in which the 80-year-old mother had been born and given birth two the two children she lived with, and given a replacement apartment in the outskirts of town. The mother died two months after having been forced out of her apartment, my father claims she died of ""sadness"", and her two children became alcoholic and lost social functionality. This is one centralization is synonymous with in my ears.

2. A few years ago, the central government decided that they would introduce ""trams"" into the city, and that the most useful way for the rails to go would be to cross a local square. The square serves as a the only local park, and is beautifully filled with trees as well as a large fountain in the middle where on sunny days you see mothers with their carriages as well as children running around and playing. The government saw it as the most practical solution for the tram to go right through the middle of this, rather than going around it, it would be cheaper and make the ride about 15 seconds faster than going around the square, but they saw basically destroying all integrity that it had as the most viable solution, due to practicality and because it would be cheaper for them. A signature recollection was made, and the tram was forced to go around the square instead, luckily. But this was the work of those self-proclaimed to be Social Democrats in both of the cases, and the centralization that they advocate. These are both reasons for which I myself call for anarchism and for non-centralized forms of government. You seem to be against these, but at the same time you said you were a Social Democrat.

Anyway, you sound like a genuine swell guy/girl and I hope I may have helped you understand the point of view of an anarchist with what I have said. I can continue this if you want to discuss more, but I know that you recently expressed that you did not. I don't frankly have the time to keep the responses at the same frequency and length that we have up until now, but if you feel you want to continue discussing then I'd be gladly to keep on going. Like I said, for now I'm just clearing up misconceptions and misundertandings that I think you have with regard to anarchism. Anyway, I've spent about an hour and a half typing, now, I really need to get to sleep. Whatever you decide, I would very much appreciate confirmation that you at least read this, regardless of if you want to continue discussing or if you aren't interested, just to know that I didn't completely waste the time I spent typing this.

My goal is not to convert you to anarchism, it's just to hopefully help you understand what it is that anarchism is, so that you can truly say that you are *not* an anarchist.","1370046001"

They all have much more REM sleep and usually enter REM immediately. (Where you're paralyzed and that's why they lose muscle tone) 

Apnea on the other hand very commonly develops as we age. Most older people snore, almost all men, and to a degree that's apnea. An apnea can be almost any change in volume of breath, usually a 30% reduction is standard for the more mild apnea called a hypopnea. But lesser breathing fluctuations can result in a similar affect to quality of sleep. It is a very serious disorder and can affect many aspect of your health and the aging process.

but people who aren't super close friends to me, it's downright rude &amp; at best awkward to tell them ""hey, you're great, but you're not such a great person that I can be your close friend. I don't think we're a good fit"" ... what? this isn't because date 4 didn't go well, this is because I've known you for a year and gotten drunk with you, but we don't connect on anything. we just know the same people and like the same bands.

you see what I'm getting it? you're right - everyone has a priority ranking of friends. that's fine by me, I understand why we do that.

why can't the person who is getting rejected just take a simple hint? unless someone is autistic, they should be able to quickly understand that 3-4 times in a row someone saying ""sorry, I can't hang out"" or them flaking on your 4-5 times in a row is a sign that no, you're not a high priority for them.

it's so so awkward and rude for them to tell you explicitly: ""you are not as close a friend as you think you are""

that's why they make their decision/intention clear with their actions! they don't dislike you, mind you. they like you. they think you're fun. but they may not want to hang out as much as you want to hang out. that's pretty tough to say and not sound like a mega douche.

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","Dependent? Sure. Its inevitable. Even if I shared a boat with a tiger, we still would both need the boat to survive whether or not we agreed with each other's values. 

Immature in the sense, that at a slightly different angle.. you could recognize that the world has an overabundance of food, and the basic needs to life readily available. The very nature of this overabundance comes at the cost of a hierarchy, whereby the likes of globalization, we can creep across the planet colonializing indiginous land, imposing our very unique cultural means of law upon it, even going so far as arresting homeless people, and people of non yet ""westernized"" races that are from the borderline of that capitalist enterprise. --
  -- So that at this very moment. Knowing there's that overabundance, yet seeing people getting arrested for being homeless, and watching people go hungry, I think its ""immature"" to not use your most critical mindset to judge what is of more value to your sense of morality?  The devotion to a system that inevitably imperfect? Or to your fellow human. Your neighbor? I would go so far as to even look at trees and offer them the same respect. After all, we share, as I mentioned, that same boat. 

Anarchism is in the interests of those who want to make their own choices for their own lives. And not be guided by the inertia of life be it the law, your boss, your job, your clothes, or even your identity. Its for those interested in a orthodox sense of freedom. For me, its coupled with the belief in original purity as seen in minimalist indigenous tribes like the Mbuti people. Or even on the sidelines of capitalist enterprise like the Abahlali baseMjondolo.

But without specifics, you can even peer into your own life and find subtle anarchist tendencies you've already adopted. Perhaps you're interested in being self-employed? Taking over your business? Making your own decisions about how you influence the world around you? All of these are steps towards your mental and physical freedom on Earth. 

People are hungry? Fuck yah, I'll feed them. And I'll do what I can to explain it to society so we can make this a little easier for everyone.

Since everyone I trusted told me the same thing about religious topics, I accepted it. It was all I knew. Each time I asked a difficult question, my family answered it from the perspective of their religion. So atheism wasn't the default for me.

When I grew older, I learned more, thought more, and experienced more. I was more skeptical and independent. Slowly my family's religion stopped being sensible to me. In many ways, it grew unreal and unbelievable. I rejected more and more of it, until finally I recognized that there wasn't any acceptable reason to assume the existence of anything supernatural. My atheism surprised me; around 5 years before now, I never would have guessed that I'd end up ""changing sides"".

My family continues to believe that their religion is true. They fully believe that teaching it to me was their sacred duty. I'm not angry at them.","1370046008"

I think the hand gesture for hitchhiking is different in that part of Europe, hand flat with palm down...or it might be pointing your index finger or something like that.  I've never hitched in Europe I just know that there are various signals in different parts of the world.

And it's pretty clear that Ed didn't test WotL much at all when it was in-dev. Enemies have staggeringly-high health values, there are numerous rooms where it's impossible to avoid taking damage unless you can make yourself invincible or you can fly, bosses are cheap as hell and have no telegraphing of their attacks or just move so erratically that it's impossible to hit without getting lucky or having certain items.

A lot of the current BoI is pretty poorly designed, and it's very evident once you've plugged lots of hours into the game. But at the same time, it's an addictive type of game. Which is probably the greatest asset that's been a part of the design: randomization in games is addictive by nature; every game is a new experience. The same applies to PvP multiplayer; every different player is a new experience to play against with new strategies and skill levels. Even with the same people, strategies change as they learn and hone their skill; it's why PvP is such a thriving genre -- people typically have a reason to keep coming back for more.","1370046012"

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","Is it really? That's interesting. I have other ideas, such as in the event of an election not having a winner with say 60% or more of the vote, that instead of a regular administration, a caretaker administration froms, and a caretaker administration has only certain powers, they cant change the tax code, institute more spending measures etc. All pretty unchiselled ideas albeit.

Edit: Ideally I am a an anarchist, I agree government is inherently oppressive. However, I don't believe that without centralised government a society is able to effectively protect itself from violent incursion from other governments. There are examples of it occurring historically, like vietnam, but there are conflating factors there such as the US army being all conscripts, and the jungles being a huge advantage to the vietnamese etc. I think it's better to have an army, and a minarchy, and just not have a war to defend the country in the first place.","1370046015"

No, it's more like ""I'm not going to piss away my money for nothing"".One of my clients is reasonably large, and gets infected quite regularly with stuff that Symantec doesn't even catch, and in fact, isn't caught by the ""upload your file and we'll check it against everything"" sites.

There are better, more secure ways of doing business than running an inherently infectable ecosystem, then trying to buy software to wrap it up in a fuzzy blanket.

What's needed is a gatekeeper, not magnifying glass and first-aid book from the 70's.

What keeps places safe, are policy decisions that block the entry vectors and an IDS that yells when something gets in anyway.

You need to take a look at the dockets of the Government Accountability Office's bid protest forum as well as the cases litigated at the Court of Federal Claims. The only ancillary connection individual congressman have to the federal acquisition system is through the legislative process, in particular, the annual appropriations process and the laws affecting the contract award process. However, the annual authorization and appropriation acts are program and agency specific, and make no mention of private industry. Congress plays no part in the evaluation of offers, and if they did try and steer work to a particular firm contrary to the Competition in Contracting Act, they would be investigated and likely prosecuted by the Department of Justice. Congress may question an agency's award of a contract, especially after it is petitioned by a specific private entity to do so, but that really has no bearing on an agency's award decision. But, for sole source contract awards where there is only one company that can do the work (usually because the technology or item the government needs in proprietary) individual congress persons will try and continue the life of the specific program, especially if the bulk of the contract is being performed in their district.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's not just budget.  It's power and heat concerns combined with supply line guarantees.  

The CPU/GPU have to fit in a small box that runs off an external low wattage power adapter.  This fact alone increases the cost to performance ratio.

This is why they went with AMD's APU system.  It's an all in one low power and low heat CPU/GPU.  In order to do this it makes sacrifices.  The Jaguar CPU tops out at 2Ghz and the APU tops out at 800Mhz.  

AMD's CPU's aren't known for their speed (2Ghz Intel easily wins over a 2Ghz AMD CPU), by any stretch of the imagination, but they are cheap.  The chips in either the PS4 and the XBone will not be able to run pretty much any game out today on Max Settings.   In fact, you'd have to go back 3+ years to guarantee max settings for all released games (I'm not sure if Crysis 2 will run maxed on a PS4, but it won't on a XBone), which is when DX11 was starting to be used. 

The XBone is REALLY under powered.  It's kinda sad they consider that ""Next Gen"".  It shouldn't be able to support full DX11 Lighting and Shadows at 1080P on games CURRENTLY ported from console (meaning the game will run on 7 year old hardware, so textures and models aren't that great).  The PS4 will be able to do Lighting/Shadows with some thrown goodness like Tessellation.

Anyhow, the whole ""Console"" concept requires sacrifices in the hardware.  The budget constricts it, but they didn't have may choices to start with.  They could have gone with an Intel Haswell with a custom NVIDIA core.  Thing is, you're dealing with TWO suppliers on TWO discrete chips that need independent cooling.  It's less trouble to go with one supplier with a full integrated solution on a single chip and it helps that they are cheap.","1370046024"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Give your characters weaknesses that they have to deal with.

Super-obvious example: one character has a bad knee. He encounters his old enemy... stairs.

Not sure how this leads to conflict. Wrong kind of weakness. Moving on.

Overly simple example: Character has a temper or is too impulsive. At the first minor obstacle, he blows up or screws up getting around the obstacle in a less than entirely thought-out way.

General character flaw. This works for creating conflict, but it's bad character design; this is something inexperienced writers do - picking an item from a list of available weaknesses that can also be strengths. Sure, that could be a nice character development thing, but these particular ones are overused atm.

My kind of example: Character thinks a particular group of people are dishonest, and they don't really appreciate this. Or he can't trust others to do a good job, and anyone who's been micromanaged should know this causes frustration among the micromanaged. Or he turns his charm on a little too strong around the ladies, who might just have their man around. Or he's both a chauvinist and a naïve moron who'll blindly chase tail without considering that the apparently available vixen might just have an ulterior motive.

All of these feed into a story or even into a world. In one form or another, they're selfishness and only really differ in how they're selfish. I'm pretty sure most forms of conflict come from one or another person's selfishness. Protecting their own family's well being over that of another, protecting their reputation, protecting their business, protecting your honor, protecting your idea of the world; protecting just about anything from any perceived threat, and holding one thing more dear than another.

When you value your libido over other other people's relationships, or your nation's reputation over human rights, or your idea to take a left turn over someone else's idea to take a right turn; you have the scene set for conflict.

So to have conflict, you first need something the character isn't willing to give up. Or as a fellow poster, -harry-, said: **From desire come conflict**.","1370046024"

On a different note, I do want to commend you for maintaining your composure in your posts. There are lots of people in here who are telling you the opposite of what you were hoping to hear, and I know I would freakin' lose it if I was in your shoes. 
That said, I hope you don't completely discount the advice they're giving you, even though I'm sure it must be hard to receive. I can't speak from your position, but I have had friends put a lot of faith in gestures they thought would be grandly romantic, and every one of them ended up crushed. For them, the stakes were never as high as marriage and a life of happiness, so they're all fine, but I think if this thing doesn't go exactly the way you fantasize it going, you might not come out of it okay. 

I would encourage you to sit and think frankly and honestly your expectations, preparations, and future, and how you and your wife will deal if and when things don't go according to plan. Because while it's great to be romantic, it's better to be romantic AND prepared.  

EDIT: And I am really, really, not accusing you of being a gold-digger. That's a steep and vilifying claim and I sincerely do not mean to suppose something that drastic of a stranger on the internet. I meant only to suggest that marriage and money are regarded with suspicion in the court of public opinion, and that women can get just as much of that suspicion, if not more, as men.  ","1370046030"

If you want to recreate the look 100% spice up the taupe a bit but do use a really dark grey as the darker eyeshadow color.

The bottom row from the Smashbox Pro Palette would be perfect to create a darker smokey eye if you don't want to imitate the photo completely. The dark brown on its own is a hint too dark but if you mix it with the middle shade it'd be perfect. 

Or mix in something shimmery, like Hustle, Toasted or Smog from Naked 1, or  Snakebite from Naked 2, or something colorful from the UD Deluxe Palette (but don't go over the top with the shimmer, you don't want it to overpower the dark and smoky). The eyeshadow on the top eyelid on the photo has a slight purple undertone and below the lashline a bit of golden brown going on so if you want to recreate it 100% take those as cues.

The one thing you don't have is a nice matte highlight color for the browbone - you could go and get a ELF loose matte white eyeshadow or something.

Oh, and you definitely need a smudgeable black eye pencil or liner.","1370046036"

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","Actually you've got the first part right, but the second part is the opposite of what is happening.   

Dither adds noise to a signal so the quantization error is random at low level signals.  That's useful because as a signal gets quieter and quieter, the number of available bits to represent that signal gets smaller and smaller.  Quiet sounds (like reverb tails) might only be loud enough to be represented by 8 or 10 bits - that means that the reverb tail starts to sound like an 8 bit file as it dies off.  What was initially a reverb tail turns into a square wave, like chiptunes or NES audio.  The audio is quantized at one level for a long time, and then it suddenly is bumped down to another level, and then back up, down, just like a square wave!  *bzzzzzzz*.

So since dither is noise, it's amplitude is random! And when you add it to those low level signals, you make it hard (very hard) for square waves to form.  The computer can't force it to the same level for long enough! 

That's why you use dither - to randomize the quantization error in low level signals.

(Edit: I should add though, that dither effects the *entire* signal.  Even at medium or loud signals, the noise that dither adds prevents artifacts due to any ""periodic"" quantization error.)

For OP: the different dither options, and the different ""noise shaping"" settings in the L2, well those are options for different noise *types* for dither. Pink noise? White noise? Brown noise? Triangle? Chocolate noise? It's whatever.  

I personally think those settings are the least important.  I genuinely can't hear the difference, and I question those who say they can :/ dither is so deep into the noise floor - like, it's quieter than the noise you might get in an SM57. So, whatever.

"MaddenEvolutionCC","t5_2wf4b","I log in every night, and had a chance to see Week 1, Week 4, and Week 7 of the offseason. I didn't see any communication about the draft until someone pointed out that it had been scheduled and put in the sidebar. 

As much as I appreciate him reconsidering the scheduling, this has all kind of been backwards. The right way to do this - for next season - is to post a concrete timeline ahead of time, allowing 1 day between each offseason advance, and then voting on the playoffs. And not a vote of ""Which one would you prefer?"" or ""I want this one, what do you guys think?"" 

No, the vote should be: ""Who can be here at A time? B time? C time? D time?"" And you take the one that the most people can attend. I brought that up here and got shouted down. 

**Now I understand why - I'm rabble-rousing and he's been responsive, and I make everything he does sound wrong.**

**I respect that. SD44, I like you, and I think you do good work. And I want you to have fun on your camping trip.** 

But I also want to draft. And if the question asked was, ""When can you be there?"" I suspect that we'd have a lot more B's. There are at least 4 of us who *cannot* be there at the set time. B is not merely our preference, it's our only option. And, because of how the question was phrased, we'll never know how many of those A's just would kind of like for it to be earlier, but could definitely make it at B-time too. 

Those people - the ones with a preference but who can be there at both times - should have their voice. But I think the goal should be to maximize attendance by finding times that *can* work for everyone, not letting a majority set a time that just simply does not work for a significant minority without investigating plausible alternatives. 

I get that that's what this thread was about. But it's still an issue for me because it was phrased, ""vote for which one you want,"" not ""which times could you be there?""","1370046044"

After that season they traded Moses Malone and two first round draft picks for Jeff Ruland and Cliff Robinson. Moses Malone ended up playing four more great years and two more very good years. Ruland and Robinson sucked. Oh, and the Sixers also traded the number one pick of the 1986 draft for... Roy Hinson.

In 88, they kind of made up for it by trading for Hersey Hawkins, but a few years later they traded him for three role players and the 6th overall pick in the 1994 draft (Sharone Wright!).

"beer","t5_2qhg1","I don't know about LITE beer, but my 5.7% session IPA, (if you want to call it that), is Carolina Brewery Flagship IPA in 12 oz cans. I wouldn't want to be out in the hot sun drinking it, but I like it enough to travel with it, and find that a couple of them at lunch on vacations, holidays, weekends does not become problematic.

 The folks at Beer Advocate were not kind to this one, but I wonder if they were looking for something that this was never meant to be. It's not by any stretch of the imagination the hoppiest, nor the highest gravity, nor the headiest, but it is just a good, summer IPA that is all the better now that it is available in convenient cans, not just growlers. I've been a fan of this since back in the days when you had to go to the pub to get it on draft. For after the beach, when you are ready to sit down with a bomber, try Foothills IPA and Olde Hickory Black Raven IPA.

In terms of a true beach session beer, I still like a Box O' Bocks, (Shiner, that is), back from my TX days. But, it's easy to get fat, full and flatulent that way while going nowhere.

In absolute dollars, China spends $166 billion, which exceeds 102 billion. And in dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity (the only really relevant figure for assessing comparative spending levels), China spends $249 billion, which is more than twice what America would spend.

Screw you, I dominate you at anything I play and it's cool that you have an interest and a hobby but the fact that it's the only thing you talk about and then feel superior to anyone is pushing everyone away.

And on a more serious note why the fuck do you you think it's okay to try and prove that you are better than me EVERY time we hang out? The fact that you would put me down because of my parents decisions to raise me or things that I never chose is awful. I mean come on, for like three weeks you would berate me with insults like ""halfie"" and you have the nerve to say that my genes are shit and that you're better? Come on, you're obese, 6+ feet tall, very physically unfit, you smell like shit, and your social skills are very 1-dimensional. I also told you I wouldn't tolerate any of these garbage insults and you continue to throw them out. 

I'm not sure why you're like this or why you treat someone that is extremely modest and doesn't start trouble with anyone like such trash but it's gotten to the point where I don't want to see you again. Seriously get your ego under control and this is getting ridiculous.

&gt; A young American dancer travels to Europe to join a famous ballet school. As she arrives, the camera turns to another young woman, who appears to be fleeing from the school. She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature. Meanwhile, the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school, but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences. She eventually discovers that the school is merely a front for a much more sinister organization.

Consider an empty bloom-prime filter, and add one N-bit string to it. Now test if that element is present. If the bloom-prime filter reports ""maybe"" after just one object, then it's technically correct but totally useless, so assume it reports ""yes.""

Now test all other N-bit strings. The bloom-prime filter must report ""maybe"" for all of them (no false positives!). Since a non-useless bloom-prime filter can uniquely identify at least one N-bit string, the bloom-prime filter requires at least N-bits of storage.

This is qualitatively different from a regular bloom filter, because the size of a bloom filter can be chosen without dependence on the length of the keys. This suggests to me that a bloom-prime filter with the same spatial characteristics of a bloom filter is just not possible.","1370046075"

Caitlyn blitz would be safer on purple though. Leona is all about that early level 2 and if shes purple thats kind of hard to do unless you push so hard that you get 2 before the blue side golems.. and even then that means you will push onto their turret and you can't dive on turret early, that's stupid.

Having alone times at nice restaurants is mostly out of the window and being exhausted/knowing there's a kid at home with a stranger generally ruins the vibe. You only get to live your 20's once,and a kid is forever so it won't hurt anyone to wait until your 30ish to conceive. You'll be more mature, stable in your job, and be able to provide a better life for your child. 

I see no drawback with waiting until your early 30's except having your friends/family ask why you aren't having a kid yet. And if you're insecure enough to let that bother you, you shouldn't be having kids in the first place.

"triangle","t5_2qht2","If your looking in the Cary area it will probably be the most expensive area here to live, though compared to Cali it will be cheap. Garner is going to be closer to your work and cheaper so you may get more bang for your buck there. Maybe look into Knightdale as well. 

As far as commuting we live by the car here. While it can get bad its nothing like what I saw in LA and in Austin when I visited those areas. On the worst of days it may take you an hour to go 15 miles but typically it would be closer to 30-40 minutes. 

My understanding of the local housing market is things here have been relatively stable thanks to the ever increasing population of people migrating here. This is just a general feel though, I am not sure.

"NetflixBestOf","t5_2ro0h","**Cosmos**

If you like science documentories and haven't seen this yet. You are a fucking heretic. You might have avoided it because its really old, and not HD and has shitty ass graphics. But for the love of science watch it, because that's what it's about. It's probably one of the most popular series ever made and its by Carl Fucking Sagan. If you haven't seen him before you'll probably laugh at his voice and the way he talks, and the silly graphics and his ""imagination ship"". But seriously watch it!!! No series has ever come close to being such a complete overview of the universe and life and everything science.

**The Botany of Desire**

Probably one of my favorite documentories ever. Its a science and nature doc that looks at 4 common plants from the plants perspective, and how they have targeted us as their care takers by evolving traits we love. 

Apples (sweetness), tulips (beauty), potatoes (control/calories), cannabis (changed state of consciousness)

**NOVA ScienceNow Volume 6**

This is actually six documentoies all narrated by and starring Neil DeGrasse Tyson asking 6 very different but very big questions. The editing and style seems to target a more ADHD younger audience, but they are some of my favorite docs on netflix. Their titles are all different but they're all under the nova ScienceNow label.

**Guns, Germs, and Steel**

This is a history/science documentary that looks at how civilization evolved and what made one civilization flourish and another lag behind. 3 episodes. It's really good. Hard to explain why it's so good, it just gives such a broad and clear scope of human civilization that for a moment you will feel you fully understand human history, if that's even possible.

**Prehistoric Disasters**

I know this one sounds cheesy, but its really amazing. You will never truly understand the scope and scale of earth and its history till you watch these. The disasters in this show make the ones from religion/myth seem like child's play. And these actually happened! After watchig these, youll be amazed that life has even survived on this planet. 4 episodes.

There are so many good documentories on netflix its amazing. Anything that was made past the year 2010 and is by Nova or PBS is almost guaranteed to be superb. ","1370046089"

1. I said I have never had sex before. I was embarrassed that it wasnt optional so I pretended it was religious and I had a change of heart. I dont think most people would find that strange. 

2. Being in medical school helps a lot in your own confidence and how you see yourself. I dont know that it helps so much in attracting people by itself but if it makes you more confident and comfortable with yourself then it can help in that way. I would suggest against flaunting the fact that you are in med school to get girls because if anything it shows insecurity. 

3. I think I was able to become a medical student because I was confident and being in med school helps more because its so immersive it really gives you a sense of purpose and forces you to reorganize your life so that your minutes are valuable and shapes you into a driven organized person.","1370046097"

My gripe is in the 2nd picture, you can see the edge of the tint rising up where it meets the vinyl.  I also think the gap around the defroster lines is way too much.  If it was like the gap on the top line, I'd be ok with that.  It varies a lot though.  It also looks weird along the outer edges of the tint.. it's just not smooth at all.

That's one of the best I have been privy to, that and a wonderful book by Andrew Britton called 'Masculinity and Power' which again, touches briefly upon the subject.

I think Mr. Darcy is rather dated and it has been proven that it is more men who seek this form of solace rather than women and the availability is all too real and what pained me was the access that the younger generations may have to some of this completely unsuitable material. Past societies have seldom relied upon some of the more extreme forms of pornography I am referring to and it will therefore affect sexual development.

And I was not in any alluding to a ban an all forms of pornography, I was stating that this availability and lack of regulation can cause over indulgence. And it is this kind of over indulgence that causes a problem.

I agree with you that there are sensible actions to be taken and they should be addressed seen as we live at a time where there is no difficulty in viewing this kind of material.

All of that said it is a perfectly healthy function, I am entirely for it aside from (probably due to my man X) those who live a life through, and cannot function without internet pornography. I did address the fact that this may be a minority however there should be, like you say more information available within an analysis of the self.","1370046102"

"politics","t5_2cneq","1. ""Necessary"" implies that it's either a burden, or a luxury of sort. The other wording suggests more of a conscious decision toward the direction that our society takes.
2. It would be nice, but is it necessary? One's a question of morality, and the other a question of satisfaction of needs. In this case, it's the burden of survival that's at question. I think everyone agrees that not everyone around today is needed for the satisfaction of everyone's needs, but there remains a difference of opinion as to what to do about them. The two extremes are more ""palliative care"" - a cradle-to-grave social safety net to keep them from impacting the rest of society negatively, and ""social darwinism"" - leaving them to starve and die outside of society's good graces.
3. The political is always a reflection of the social. There is no revolution currently because the social does not allow for it. Never underestimate the fundamental conservatism of the English-speaking peoples - even when they kill their kings, it's always in the name of the law. ","1370046108"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;Why aren't you comparing third world countries to third world countries?

[Here is a comparison of civilian gun ownership](http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/compare/26/rate_of_civilian_firearm_possession/7,39,41,195,199) among Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay ([image](http://i.imgur.com/EWQTFpL.png)).

For some reason, that site doesn't let us compare the rate of gun homicides per 100 people (only absolute numbers). Here are the data it provides, though  (2009):

AM / GR (AM= any method; GR = gun related)

* Argentina: 5.5 / 3.0 (2008)
* **Brazil: 22.7 / 18.1**
* Chile: 3.71 / 2.2 (2002)
* Colombia: 34.6 / 28.1
* Venezuela: 48.93 / 39.0
* Uruguay: 6.1 / 3.43

All these countries have restrictive laws and the difference of civilian ownership rates is slight among them, but countries with highest crime rates are still the ones where civilians possess less firearms*. I still don't see how banning guns is helping and why we can't have them.

Edit: *except for Venezuela.","1370046110"

Do you really want to spend 2 stock to have a 8.5k card on opponent's turn (at most 9.5k) that will most likely be easily picked off next turn? You could pay the same amount for the 2/1 Yuri changer into a 3/2 10k attacker with a heal on play ability for the same cost, plus you thin your deck out a little as the game goes on.  ","1370046112"

"politics","t5_2cneq","""Education only works if ignorance isn't celebrated."" I don't know what that means or how that is relevant to the discussion. My point is, educate don't punish. Especially don't punish the parent of a dead child, that's the type of sick, inhuman behaviour you would find in some twisted dystopian science fiction novel.

Parents who think education is bad for their children, so they don't let them learn? Again, what are you talking about here? How did you go from shooting a child in the head being the same as not vaccinating to being the same as not allowing your child to be educated which is illegal anyway as all children must attend school. 

Should we just allow them to do that? Do what? Let me see if I am understanding you correctly. So if a parent tries to teach their child something you don't agree with someone from outside should take away their child? Just curious what country you come from? Besides - who said anything about the parent teaching their child about vaccines? The child is too young to make that choice on their own, we are talking about educating the parent, not the child. Unless of course you are trying to find some round about way to slam religious beliefs, I can tell you now I am not interested in that dull can of worms. 

Finally, your lack of ability to distinguish between forced education and forced medical procedures proves to me just how fundamentally different we are. As I said before in reply to someone else - if we discovered a way to stop anger from forming in the brain, or to curb irresponsible impulses via a drug or vaccine, should that procedure be forced on everyone?

Free will, independence, sovereignty, and civil liberty are fundamental rights the enlightened world supposedly upholds. These are principles that transcend any physical risk, and rightly so.

"grammar","t5_2qhwy","Well, since it seems you've decided to descend into a condescending tone, I shall return it in kind.

It's not my fault if you don't understand basic sentence structure and what a sentence means based on its components and not what the author intends it to mean.

Returning to the original argument, [this](http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/g43.html) page on dictionary.com backs ""and's"" inappropriateness with a citation from Fowler's Modern English Usage guide.

&gt;Replace try and (I will try and fix it) with try to (I will try to fix it). Some grammarians label try and as incorrect when really it is just very informal and best used in conversation. Try to is standard usage and appropriate for all levels of formality in both speech and writing. Other colloquial constructions are synonymous, or nearly so, with try to, such as be sure to and go and. Often try and is interchangeable with try to, but there are some contexts in which try and implies success, e.g., ""Do try and behave,"" and others where try and is ironic and implies failure, e.g., ""Try and make me move.""

&gt;Fowler's Modern English Usage (Burchfield, R.W., ed. New York: Oxford University Press [3 ed.], 1996) says, ""It is an idiom that should not be discountenanced, but used when it comes natural""; but Fowler also wrote that it is ""almost confined to exhortations and promises,"" and these are more common in informal than in formal contexts. As far as would of (and woulda), it is an irregular spelling of would have or would've (same with coulda, could of, shoulda, should of). These forms came to be because they reflect actual pronunciation and using would of in writing often occurs when one is writing in a hurry. The spellings woulda and would of are often referred to as eye dialect, which means 'an unusual spelling intended to represent colloquial or dialectal idiosyncrasies of pronunciation.'

I never claimed its inappropriateness as a colloquialism. Colloquialisms are dialogue. Colloquialisms aren't held to the standards of formal writing; they're used to shape a character's personality and traits through dialogue. It's appropriate for a character to say ""I am going to try and clean my car later."" It's incorrect to narrate it as the author with ""He went to try and clean his car later.""

Do a Google search for ""'try and' grammar"" and look at the search results. Almost all of them, both professional and amateur, agree that it's wrong and at most, it's only appropriate in informal writing. It's inappropriate in formal writing because **it doesn't make sense.**","1370046124"

"Themepark","t5_2r2w2","At MK, get a fast-pass for Splash Mountain. When you can get a new one, fast-pass for Space Mountian and/or Thunder Mountain. At Epcot, go behind the fountians at the front and you'll find a hidden Epcot gem. There is a whole place where you can taste different types of soda from around the world. Best part is that it comes with Epcot admission. At Epcot, FP for Soarin. Don't FP or take single riders line for Test Track or you will miss the car design studio, which adds to whole fun of the new test track. Mission Space usually has a shorter wait (30 minutes), but make sure you ride the Orange ride and not the green (unless you easily get motion sickness.) At HWS, get at the park early and FP Toy Story Mania. The line is very long and the cue is boring, but the ride is amazing. The lines for Rockin Roller Coaster and Tower of terror move fast, but tower of terror has a more enjoyable que. The Backlot tour isnt good unless you have extra time. The car stunt show is amazing, and Indiana Jones stunt show is great, but not amazing. The sound studio movie attraction sucks. Muppets is bad unless you like the muppets A LOT. Star Wars is cool, especially if your a fan of SW. At AK, get a FP for the Dinosaur ride. After Dinosaur, you can get a FP for Everest, but Everest NEVER has too long of a wait. Its usually 15 to 20 minutes. with 45 minutes being very rare because Everest has a great rider capacity. The safari, Dinosaur and Everest are the must dos, and bugs life is neat. 

Take off 1 day at Universal, there are only 2 parks. Islands of Adventure is the best park in Orlando, with Seaworld a close second. The Forbidden Journey, Amazing Adventures of Spiderman, Dragon Challenge, The popeye river rapids ride are all amazing. At HP, Get both frozen and unfrozen butterbeer, they are both fantastic, except for the long wait required to get them. Go into the Forbidden Journey gift shop to slip into the line at the lockers to the side of the shop. (the design is horrible because Universal wasn't expecting Harry Potter to be such a COLOSSAL hit.) At Universal Studios, The Mummy ride is amazing. It's 100xs better then the Hollywood version. Ride Hollywood Rip-Ride- Rockit, that is amazing as well. Everyone seems to LOVE the simpsons ride. I think its OK, the themeing is great but all the ride is just a fancy moving seat theater. MIB is very good, but not worth a hour long wait. Including of waits...Buy a Quick cue, its the beat theme park investment possible. Universal has Painfully long waits, unless you cheat and buy a Quick Cue! I personally stayed on property at Universal, and you get to go to HP 1 hour early (which is good because Quick Cue doesn't cover Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit or The Forbidden Journey.), and each room comes with a fastpass for all of the guests staying in the room. Also, the hotels are fantastic.

 Spend a full day at Seaworld and Then cross over to Aquatica, its the best Seaworld, and the water park is unique. 

Then with the extra day saved by not going to universal for 3 days, go to Busch Gardens Tampa. Its only about an hour away. The park is HUGE, get there at opening. Once again, buy a fast pass if you want to do the whole park, The simple version does fine. Cheetah Hunt is one of the greatest Coasters I've ever rode, and Montu is my favorite Inverted Coaster ever. SheiKra is fun, but VERY short. The line can be long as well. Rhino Rally is dumb if you just went to AK, its short and you don't see many animals. Lastly, of you have ANY more money, buy the $30 safari ride. You get to see the animals better and it takes about an hour long. You also get to feed Giraffes! You should skip the Gwazi coasters if you hate painful wood coasters. The track's not that good anyway. Explore Busch as mich as you can, its large and there are attractions and animals everywhere!

"rage","t5_2qil2","Alright. this will be my last message to you...

&gt; We can deduce that anyone who is religious is prejudiced to their own relgion. so according to your logic, that automatically makes all jews, hindus, muslims and christians bigots.

No. Unless they are prejudiced **against** another group. For example, I prefer my wife to other women, just like I prefer practising my religion to other religions. But that doesn't mean I have anything against other women, or other religions. Does that make sense to you?

&gt; That leaves atheists and they are usually prejudiced against all religions, Christianity in particular.
Therefore according to what you said, everyone is a bigot because no one is unprejudiced against every single religion in the world.

See, none of that actually follows. Some Atheists are bigoted towards religion, yes. But not all. Most Atheists I've known have no issue with my religion or any other. See, the thing is, most people say I believe X, but I hold no ill will towards W, Y, Z, A, etc. A bigot says ""I believe X, and I have something against W, Y, Z, A, etc.."" Does that make sense?

&gt; If everyone is a bigot, then the word bigot is meaningless and thus an anti-concept. It is a concept that serves to confuse rather than to clarify. 

And not everyone is a bigot. Also... I noticed in this thread you said;

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","I know how that feels. My best friend in the world was introduced to a guy by a mutual friend. This mutual friend's crush is the guy's best friend so they would all go on double dates together. I felt really left out and alone because my best friend was out having so much fun and would come back and tell me about everything they were doing. And I'd get really irritated. She even ditched on a lot of our plans to go hang with him spontaneously. Plans we had for several weeks! And he treated her like dirt too. I don't know why she even liked him. Fast forward through three weeks of this and she and the mutual friend come crying to me about how the boys are such total jerks and they regret liking them so much. The guys agreed to hang with my friends, then got really drunk and drove my friends around. Without telling my friends they were drunk, thus putting them in a lot of danger. Then the guys took them to a river and they were just supposed to go on a hike but one of them threw my best friend in the river so she'd have to take her clothes off and wear nothing but a t-shirt. She was pissed so she left. Then the guy who threw her left and it was just the mutual friend and her guy toy and he pretty much asked her to give him head and got really angry when she said no. She left too, having to walk home because she was so sick of him. Then the following day the guys said all this nasty stuff about them on twitter and fb and shit like that. They apologized for leaving me out and said they didn't even realize that I felt left out until I told them. It was one of those moments when you realize that highschool relationships with guys and stuff don't last forever, you might break up and there will be tears and heartbreak and crap. But wouldn't it feel so much better if you had a great gal pal to lean on if things went south? I don't think girls should ever start treating their best friends differently because of some guy.

For a comparison, see [Errant Signal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59PzmOLSf00) (and also on [DXHR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X43i8NQ--_s)).

In many ways HR is actually a better ~~sequel~~ Deus Ex than IW, though I'm not much of a fan of making it a prequel and the combat is markedly different, but the first one is probably the best of them.

That's not to say it's perfect - the voice acting is bad, the graphics were outdated even then etc, etc.

But it does freedom the best of the three - even though it's not really sandboxey, it balances the different solutions best (HR really fucked that up - hacking is overpowered because of how much stuff you get and stealth is broken because of the boss fights) and IMHO has the most interesting story.

As for a linux version - Loki was developing one before they went under, but [appdb says](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=186) gold to platinum on recent wine versions, so it should run.

"KingstonOntario","t5_2s8kp","A few other options: 

If you are not a student of Queen's/St. Lawrence there is K3C (http://k3c.org/). They are great and affordable, too.

If you have a family Doctor, you can have them refer to you a psychiatrist at HDH Adult Mental Health. It will likely be a bit of a wait, but it is covered by OHIP and many of the psychiatrists there are actually pretty good in terms of using psychotherapy (as opposed to just throwing drugs at the problem). There is also a psychologist on the team who you can be referred to (she's AMAZING). 

Finally, there are a number of crisis lines in the Kingston area who may not have formal clinicians working for them, but can be helpful when you are in need.

Where ever you end up going, ask if the person you're seeing does CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). This has been shown to be among the most effective treatments for depression. If you are suffering from severe depression, CBT and pharmacological interventions combined are the best method of treatment.

Lastly, if you are experiencing thoughts about suicide, call for help! Either the ER or a crisis line (613-544-1771).

There are such things as automatic antenna tuners.  That's basically how they work -- they switch in different size components and adjust others.  I think they use either variable capacitors or tuned cavities.  The voltages and currents on a transmitter output can be extremely high; a broadcast FM station can put 100 kW into the antenna, and even ham radio enthusiasts often use 1.5 kW transmitters.  So maybe look at how they do antenna matching.

I am not much of an expert on this kind of thing, so I can't say too much more.

Very little air will make its way into the stomach during eating, and in the case of the fish, if there were any water in the pelican's stomach, it would be EXTREMELY acidic and the fish would die very quickly. 

Generally, stomachs are very stretchy and coated in slippery mucus, and if the predator was large enough to swallow the animal whole, then it would be very unlikely that the animal could thrash around enough to do much, if any damage. 

A noticeable exception would be a snake, that can occasionally swallow things that were too big, but... they are always already dead. ","1370046147"

"lonelyrunners","t5_2xdyg","I don't understand. Could we please start again? I am actually confused about what we are specifically arguing on. Just so we are both on the right page.

Here's my argument:

We have a set of k runners. We pick the slowest runner (really, we could pick any arbitrary runner, it wouldn't matter). We prove that there is no set of velocities for the other runners that could prevent the picked runner from being lonely.

So, for all sets of velocities, that runner will always be lonely.

---

We good so far?

Now, if we picked any other arbitrary runner, the proof for that runner's loneliness is basically equivalent to the proof we just did. So, basically, if you can absolutely prove the loneliness of one runner, you've proven the loneliness of the others - because they are arbitrary choices anyway.

Setting a random runner to zero velocity and setting the highest relative velocity to 1 so that all other velocities are either in (0,1) or (-1,0). And proving the stationary runner's loneliness, is equivalent to proving the loneliness of an arbitrary runner. And so, you prove the conjecture for all other runners.

---

So, you disagree with that? Why?","1370046148"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","I think there are two possible variations of why this might be considered negative:

A)  They are getting attention because they are going out of their way to get attention, making them ""desperate"" which indicates low self-esteem or the need to validate one's self worth through other's approval.  A trait which is frowned upon.

B)  They MUST be getting attention only because they are females and that's somehow cheating.  That they are given preferential treatment because guy redditors are hopeful that giving them preferential treatment will help them get in their pants.  (Or maybe they're mad that because they only exist on the internet, they can't get in their pants.)  Either the female is knowingly taking advantage of this.  Or if the female isn't instigating it, it's this passive ability they have that ""isn't fair"".

I think it's more likely to happen with conventionally attractive women.  Even though I'm equally annoyed with men bitching about it, I'm certainly conscious that I've been given preferential treatment as a reasonably pretty girl when buying cars off of craigslist, even if it kind of starts to approach creepy when they're flirting and it isn't necessarily desired.  (Because I beat out the other buyer and haggled down, I ""cheated"" because girl charm had something to do with it.)  And I've definitely been conscious of feelings of resentment towards women much more conventionally attractive than me when they get preferential treatment because someone is obviously enamored of them.  Now I *know* that this isn't necessarily their fault, just like I wasn't trying to use my looks to beat other buyers to a used car.  But it's this passive (and occasionally abused) trait that is often resented.","1370046151"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","1. Seriously, I know it's hard when you like someone and you're in a relationship, BUT YOU BARELY KNOW THIS GUY. He's already spread around that you're a psycho (and you have definitely been acting like one), and shown everyone what you've been texting him, and if that's not an exact reason not to like him, then I don't know what is. Everyone is laughing at you and you just need to stop and go back to your boyfriend of 2 years that you claim you are still in love with and so happy with instead of mooning over a guy who couldn't give a shit. I've already told you most of this already but it's just not sinking in.

2. Stop alienating people. I've not been around not because you've done anything massive, but because over the past 2 years you have treated everyone like shit including me and it's gotten to a point where I'm just sick of it. I feel guilty for basically living at my boyfriends but you make so many sarcastic comments and so many little horrible things that I just decide its easier to be at his that at home with you. Earlier this year I decided to stop relying on you to go out with and just got in contact with people who had slowly phased us out and guess why they had? Because they didn't like you. And everyone who I've hung out with from hanging out with these people have said they don't like you. Like it's ridiculous how many people hate you and yet I will generally try and stick up for you. Oh and also you are getting a massive reputation for being a slut. I literally only need to mention your name around a group of guys and I get 'oh HER' 'she was like a game of pass the parcel' 'she's given me a hand job' 'oh yeah I've slept with her' 

3. Ok I get you have a girlfriend and I'm sorry if I've caused arguments (even though all of our conversations have been completely innocent) and yeah there's quite a lot of sexual tension between us but that's no reason to just stop talking to me :(

"mildlyinteresting","t5_2ti4h","Congrats!  I wish someone in my family thought to do something like this.  I had some silver coins but they were only worth around $1000 for the silver when the spot price was around $40 per troy ounce (a troy once is how precious metals are measured.  There are 31.1 grams in a troy ounce and 28.3 in a US ounce).  Canadian coins are are easier to sort cause the non silver ones are magnetic.  Sadly, for American coins the only trick is looking at the sides, as others have already pointed out.  I used to buy and sell silver coins a lot a couple years ago, and there are a few of things worth keeping in mind in my experience:

1) Check out the ""The Official Blue Book: A Handbook of US Coins"" to see if you have any rare/key dates.

2) If you don't have any key dates, then cleaning doesn't really make a difference because the value is just in the silver--the prices given in the Blue Book for non rare coins are based on silver price.

3) When/if you do sell, do shop around.  Personally, I wouldn't sell to anyone who won't give me a price per coin over the phone when the coins aren't present.  In today's market with silver spot in the $23-24 range per ounce, I wouldn't take less than 15x, maybe 14x, for silver US quarters, dimes, or half dollars (when silver was around $40 per ounce, you'd be looking at approx 25x face value).  Assuming all $640 in quarters is silver, that would be $8900-$9600!
Here's a link to a place (albeit, in Canada) that I've dealt with in the past with excellent results:
http://www.gatewestcoin.com/bullionBuy.html
At the very least, it's a good example of what sort of information a company should give you before selling to them.

4) If you do find a rare/key date, consider having it graded.  One of the better known places for that is www.pcgs.com (they've been mentioned a couple of times on Pawn Stars).

Good luck!  If you have any questions, feel free to message me.  I wouldn't consider myself a ""professional"" coin collector or anything like that, but I've had a good deal of experience selling/buying scrap precious metals, and have been burned a couple of times.  I'm happy to help anyone avoid the mistakes I made.","1370046154"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've only ever paid cash. Once it's been imported the title is meaningless- registering it in my name is considered proof of ownership in Saskatchewan. Part of the importation process is proving there are no liens on the car, ensuring there are no outstanding recalls, and passing a safety inspection (which usually includes activating DRL's). 

Once, though, a family member bought a year old Acura from a dealer (found it online, put down a deposit and paid the rest when she got there). Somehow the dealership neglected to address the fact that the previous owner had written a series of fraudulent cheques to purchase the car and it was reported stolen. When it was recovered that crucial detail was not forwarded to authorities, which eventually ended in my aunt trying to cross the border in a stolen vehicle that she had proof of purchasing from a dealership.

Fun little trip to the border that was.","1370046161"

After my twin brother and I got into the venue, we went to take a much needed piss. Once I finished, I turned around to wash my hands, and lo and behold Chad Gray (singer of Mudvayne, the band I went to go see) was right behind us. He looked at our t-shirts and noticed we were there to see them. I was shocked. I just kinda stood there. He looked at us and said ""how bout this as your rock star moment...you guys ready to rock the fuck out?"" We told him yes. Then he said,""awesome. I'll see you guys out there."" Then he walked out with his bodyguard. Another fan asked us why I didn't shake his hand or take a pic. I told him I hadn't washed my hands and I didn't think bout taking out my phone.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","You are approaching this wrong, where ADHD can be suppressed (although I must say from experience that it is better to learn how to control one's impulses and turn to other aspects to one's advantage) ASD cannot be. An official diagnosis would be a good idea but you must keep in mind that this is a part of you, one that is neither good nor bad but simply there. There are no medications that will ""help"" but far too many that will cause you harm, there is nothing wrong with you, there is nothing wrong with being different. You say that you have difficulty looking others in the eye, do you know why? Do you know why you seem so unreadable to others and they so strange to you, why you seem to do as others ask without a second thought or to say things in a way you don't intend? The answer is very simple, your brain (and those of many on this sub) is wired differently. Parts of our brain are more primal (why many of us have difficulty with eye contact and some have nearly impossible instincts) than those of NTs, though that does not mean that we are more violent (in fact we are considerably less so). Have you ever noticed that, even if you can't place them, the emotions of those around you affect you far more than others and that your emotions seem more powerful than others, that's because we are almost universally hyper-empathic and emotional (the combination of the two can often result in it being difficult to parse out just what one is feeling). We also naturally express things differently, that makes it difficult for NTs to read us (and almost none ever make the effort to learn how) and vice versa (had you been diagnosed as a child you likely would have been taught how to ""pass"" but you can still learn if you make the effort) but it also makes it difficult to communicate at times. Honestly you just need to accept who you are and work to understand why certain things are the way they are, that will let you change some behaviors (eventually the new behavior will stop being a conscious act and become more of a routine that you can toggle on and off, although it will never stop being a drain so look for people that you can be more yourself around). Also there aren't really many questions we can ask beyond figuring out your behavior and you did a good job with that.","1370046163"

But I've never seen anything he's written and been blown away by the writing. As far as I can tell, the stuff he writes usually ranges from terrible to passable. It's just... well, it's the plot holes. They are so numerous, and so distracting.

Which is unfortunate, because writing is definitely the most important thing for me. Orci's writing is... adequate, but doesn't even come close to the greats of *Trek* such as D.C. Fontana, Gene Coon, Michael Piller, and Ron D. Moore.

In short, I don't question Orci's devotion, but his skill. There are a lot of things I like about JJTrek, but I like those things *in spite* of the weak writing, not because of it.

And here's the *really* scary thought: Orci is probably the best of the three involved with NuTrek. Kurtzman and Orci collaborate so much I don't know where one ends and the other begins, and my thoughts on Lindelof are... shall we say, inappropriate... to share in this venue.","1370046166"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","gloops and Mobage have been working with each other for a while, and that relationship started in Japan. It only made sense to work with Mobage here in the States as well. However, Apoc Wars is our IP. The design and development of the game is primarily through us.

The real source of external influence on our design and development process is feedback from players! We get that through Facebook, Twitter, forums, and our support site. While we might not be able to implement every suggestion players throw at us, we definitely do our best to take their feedback into account when we make design decisions.

Once you hit higher levels, you'll be able to unlock more buildings, upgrades, and combat units. You'll need more XP to get from one level to the next, but with those upgrades you unlock, you'll have higher attack capability and you'll be able to provide a more challenging defense to attackers.","1370046171"

 The test is what really matters not the pieces of paper that stack up year after year.   You can pull these from a database that states whether or not someone has received it for the year or who's even due within 3 months. 


During an audit you'll get dinged if this piece of paper isn't there in 3000+ peoples records... Even though a simple query would do a better job of telling you who has had it done... ON TOP OF THIS!!! if someone is positive they then dont allow you to put in said piece of paper in said record... Or mark the record for HIV positive.

This doesn't even begin to get into facts that you really don't need records anymore, saving data can be done offsite and on CAC cards.

"Baking","t5_2qx1h","Here's a recipe for an Italian Meringue Buttercream:

150g egg whites

300g granulated sugar

150mL water

75g granulated sugar

450g butter

1. Combine the 300g of sugar and water in a saucepan; it should be the consistency of wet sand.

2. Clean all the sugar from the sides of the pot before  it. This will prevent the sugar from crystallizing.

3. Cook the sugar to the soft-ball stage (between 240-250 degrees Fahrenheit). Never stir the sugar while it cooks or it may crystallize.

4. When the sugar comes to a boil, start a French Meringue in your mixer fitted with a whisk attachment with the egg whites and the 75g of sugar.

5. When the sugar has reached the soft ball stage, pout it down the edge of the bowl containing the whipping meringue with the speed at full power. Do not pour onto the whisk or it may splatter.

6. Change to the paddle attachment before adding the butter. The butter may be too firm and can break or bend the whisk attachment.

7. Add the butter to the meringue.

Tips: Don't add the butter when the meringue is too warm, it will melt; if this happens, refrigerate. If you add the butter when the meringue is too cold you'll have to warm it a little.

If you want to add food coloring, add once the buttercream is finished.","1370046174"

"cringe","t5_2r6rj","To the people saying that ""the audience must be paid off"" or ""there's no way a real audience can laugh that hard at the jokes in BBT"", it's quite a simple explanation. 

Laughing is amongst other things a social interaction that shows people around you that you find something humorous. Even though you might not laugh at jokes, shows and comics in front of your computer and TV-screen, you probably would have if 3 of your friends got together and watched the same thing. The jokes don't even have to be very funny, as long as the mood around you is cheerful, and most people can laugh at most things, and they can even laugh when they didn't hear the joke, but hear others laughing.

That compared with the preconception that you are about to be entertained makes it easier to respond the way they do. There's nothing illogical about the audience laughing at jokes.

You can find a similar effect when it comes to standup. One person might tell a joke that nobody finds funny, and he gets booed off stage. Another comedian might say the exact same thing, and he gets a good laugh.

Laughter is subconsciously all about social interaction and acceptance, and the absence of laughter just as much so.

edit: This is also the idea behind actually having a laugh track in sitcoms. It makes it easier to trigger the social response, even when there are no people around.

**tl;dr: It's much easier to grump at home over how unfunny BBT is than it is to do the same as a live audience.**","1370046177"

i mean, you may prefer a certain style or period but that's my view. i am not of the opinion that something has to be painted in order to be beautiful or daring. there's nothing wrong with photography, and even the most simple of photographic images you see in a poster is composed of a dozen or more other images that were carefully crafted into the whole.","1370046177"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Some organs are suspended to their location due to their embryologic origins. For instance, the [falciform ligament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falciform_ligament) attaches the liver to the body wall, helping to keep it where it lives in the right upper abdominal quadrant, and it's derived from part of the fetal circulation. Other structures are held in place by being adherent to the [retroperitoneum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroperitoneal_space), such as the kidneys or certain portions of the gut. 

However, what others have said in this thread already regarding most of the small intestine and the mesentery are exactly correct - surgeons will just kinda place things back into the belly and let everything settle as it will. The abdominal cavity, especially, is not ""vacuum packed"" by any stretch, and there will be free air in the belly after a surgery that (usually) resolves after closure.","1370046179"

"Braveryjerk","t5_2tl1h","The jungle game they call it. Not many dare to come here, the host, porcupine is known to have... a temper, but if you're looking for a high stakes no limit table, this is the only place in town.

I've often seen these people, these squares at the table, short stack and long odds against them. All their outs gone. One last card in the deck that can help them. I used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape, and how the hell they thought they could turn it around. Now that's me, down to my last chips, the bear, the snake and the porcupine all leering at me from their sides of the table, eager to take my pot, but I couldn't back down. I owed money and this was my only shot, my only way out.

""Uhm... I ch-, no wait, I bet!"" The bear says, tilting his head while peering down at his cards. I peek at my own cards, a jack of clubs and eight of hearts, not something I would play if I had a roll to fall back on, but at this rate the blinds are going to eat up the last of my stack.

""Raise."" I throw a considerable portion of my last chips in to the pot. The snake lifts his cards ever so slightly off the table with his tail, peeks underneath and gives an angry hiss.

""Fold."" Opposite me is the porcupine, staring at me and smiling.

""You got nothing. Call."" He throws a few of chips from his own, considerably larger, stack into the pot and flips three cards of the top of the deck, placing them in the middle. Eight of diamonds, nine of clubs and ten of hearts. I see a flicker of doubt playing across Porcupines face, but it is more than enough, I know I have him now. Snakes head is wiping back and forth between me and Porcupine, as if he was trying to follow an intense game of tennis, while Bear is still trying to figure out which way to hold his cards.

""Fold."" Bear says, scratching his head with a paw. I only need a seven or a queen to get my straight, of course Porcupine doesn't know that.

""Raise."" I throw most of my remaining chips in the pot, staring Porcupine in the eye all the while, trying to give him the impression that I've already got my straight set.

""Call."" Porcupine must think I'm bluffing to call that raise, but he's only half-right, I still have two cards to make my straight. He takes the deck, slowly turning over the top card.

""Two of spades."" Porcupine says, a malicious grin spreading across his face. ""That could not have helped you. Not at all."" I can feel the sweat running down my brow, plastering my hair to my face, but I'm in to deep now, all I can do is bet high and hope he folds or that I hit a queen or seven on the river.

""I'm all-in."" I shove the last chips in to the middle, trying to keep a mask of confidence, but it's melting off, dripping down with the sweat.

""I thought you knew better than to try and bluff me by now."" Porcupine pushes his own chips in to the middle.

""Call."" His hands slowly plays over the top card of the deck, playfully stroking it before he turns it over. I feel like a great weight lifts of my chest, up, up, up, lifting me away.

""Yes!"" I reach out to scoop in the pot. A seven of spades, the perfect card. I complete my straight and there's no chance of him having full house or a flush, infact the only thing...

""Just... one... second..."" Icy cold spread from my chest, through my legs and arms, filling every inch of my body. He flips over his own two cards, but I already know what they are. A jack and a queen, making his straight better than mine. I'm frozen, stunned in disbelief as Porcupine reaches over taking everything I have.

""Now... you owe me some money, don't you?"" Porcupine says with a wicked grin, Bear twisting uncomfortably in his seat.

""I... I'll start working for you! We can start a payment plan! Anything! I don't have anything. I, I got nothing."" I stammer.

""No need to get upset now..."" The bear says weakly.

""Shank his bitch assssss."" Snake hisses. Porcupine slowly rounds the table until he's right next to me, still with a smile on his face.

""If you can't pay, you really shouldn't play."" He grabs the back of my head slamming it as hard as he can into the table, blood spurting across the green felt as my nose breaks with a crunch.

""Where's my money?!"" My head slams against the table again. I try to struggle free from his iron grip on my hair, but blood blurs my vision and my feeble kicks hit nothing but air. Suddenly, I feel a sharp edge at my throat, one of Porcupines broken of spines.

""Where's my money?!"" He slams the makeshift shank in my back. I try to scream in pain, but only blood splutters from my mouth. I can see him raise the weapon again, glistening with blood, but I can't feel it when the second or the third stab lands.

""What've got?"" Inspector Jones asked, inspecting the corpse closely.

""Open and shut case."" Superintendent Barnes replied, scribbling something in his notebook. ""Apparently, it was a bear."" Jones frowns, looking back at the corpse.

""But sir, these wounds... there's no way a bear could have done this, you must be mistaken!"" Jones points at the deep stab wounds in the victim.

""We have a bear who can be placed at the scene of the murder who has confessed to the crime, what more do you need?""

""There's something else going on here, sir. There is no way that bear is guilty!"" Barnes steps forward, towering over the young inspector, staring down at him.

""Like I said, apparently, it was a bear.""

There's often several ways to understand and process an argument you know, no need to jump the gun and proclaim that a subjective statement of some sort of metaphysical nature doesn't make sense. Besides, your whole argumet relies on a definition of consciousness that is very reductive and simplistic. Could you really put the thigs in the universe into two well defined groups of ""conscious"" and ""nonconscious""? Not really? Thought so. That's because consciousness is an ambiguous, emergent property of the universe and it makes much more sense to see it as a whole than separate entities that evolve independently of each other.","1370046186"

While I agree no dog is 100% safe with a child, we had a pit when my oldest daughter was little. That dog worshiped my daughter. He would follow her everywhere, and just admire her. Truly was amazing to watch.

One day she was outside in the sandbox and he was laying there like usual. I looked over and she was trying to pull his balls off. Full force yanking them. He just looked over at me like mom... can you please ask her to stop. LOL 

If ever he was going to be aggressive that was the time. He never showed anything but love for a child.  He was with her for a very long time. Finally passed away when she was 11, old age. My husband had him before he met me.

"hiking","t5_2r9om","While there are some aspects of hiking that vary depending on your geographic location (I live in the desert for example and never carry a rain coat), here are some of my general tips:

**GEAR**

1. WATER! - I know I may be biased because of my location, but it really is one of the most important things to have out on the trail. ""You can survive a month without food, but only a few days without water"", etc.  A rule of thumb is dry climates is to plan on a liter of water for every hour that you will be out.  While you may end up with more than you need, I've learned from hard experience that it's better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it.  I have a 3 liter camelbak and I love it.  I also carry two 1 liter nalgenes in my pack's side pockets (I usually fill one with gatorade for a little boost since it can suck to clean the residue out of a camelbak).  Bottom line: I would recommend at least getting a 3 liter camelbak.

2. Shoes - If you really start to get into hiking, it is definitely best to invest in a good pair of shoes.  Again, your location may help provide you with some requirements (I don't care about them being waterproof, but if you're in a wet climate you will quickly find out that soggy socks are miserable to hike in), but you will probably just want a decent pair of hiking shoes (not boots).  The high top boots with the stiff soles and deep lugs (the bumps on the bottom) are typically used when you're going to be carrying a lot of weight (like when backpacking) because they provide a lot of support.  Hiking shoes, on the other hand, tend to be lower, thinner, and lighter, while still providing a good sole and traction.  If you get into longer hikes, you will learn why they say ""a pound on the feet is worth 10 in the pack"" and a lot of long distance hikers end up opting for the even lighter, thinner trail running shoes. When you have to pick your foot up and move it that many times, every ounce starts to matter at mile 15.  Bottom line: I would recommend getting a good pair of hiking shoes (I've had good experiences with Merrel, but there are plenty of good brands).

3. Clothing - I have seen all types on the trail. Everyone from the way over prepared, to the purple haired goth in 40'' black Jincos with chains.  Attire is definitely a matter of preference, but I'd say that there is a reason why outdoor shops sell the lightweight, moisture wicking, breathable clothes that they do, they are very comfortable on the trail. I really don't think you need to go out and get a new wardrobe at this point though.  I would probably just stay away from clothes that are the opposite of those characteristics, like jeans.  Also, you should always check the weather reports and be prepared with the appropriate layers.  Again, it's better to have that extra jacket in the pack and not need it than to get caught out in the cold in just a tank top. Bottom line: be prepared for changes in weather, but until you start really getting into hiking, gym shorts and a t-shirt should be fine.

4. Backpack - While the old Jansport will probably be just fine for a 2-3 hour hike, there are a lot of things to like about modern daypacks such as a place to keep your camelbak with a hole for the tube, hip and chest straps that (if used correctly) can save your shoulders from a world of pain, easy access hip pockets, and a ton of other stuff.  Bottom line: If you plan on doing a lot of hiking, a decent 35 liter pack (I've had good luck with Osprey) would be a good investment.

5. Sun Protection - Whether it's cloudy or sunny, it's always a good idea to have sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses.

6. Snack - Being out on the trail can work up an appetite, so remember to pack something to eat.  If you opt for the ever appropriate trail mix, for goodness sake man, make sure it has M&amp;M's!


**Extras**
I do a lot of longer (12+ miles) hikes and these are a few things that I take with me, but aren't really necessary for shorter hikes: 

1. Hiking poles - Some people claim that they can transfer as much as 10% of the workload to your upper body.  I don't know about that, but I do know that I notice a difference at the end of a long hike with them VS without. Also, they are a help on unstable terrain, they can be used to move brush out of the way, and they keep you from getting sausage fingers at the end of the hike.

2. Good socks - If you're going to be relying on your feet to take you out into the wilderness and get you back, you had better take care of them.  For me, that means keeping them cushioned and dry.

4. Radio - I never go hiking alone, but sometimes we may get separated for a bit and I like to be able to stay in touch. Also, they can be helpful in an emergency.

5. First aid kit - If you're using well traveled trails and not doing anything stupid, you will probably never need a kit, but the further you get away from help, the better idea it becomes to be able to handle bad things happening.

6. Basic survival items (mirror, knife, etc.) - Same reason as the first aid kit.

7. Knowledge of the area - If you stay on popular trails that are well traveled, you can usually just ask for directions, but it's probably a good idea to know the area (via maps, signs, gps, etc.) for yourself.


**The Bottom Line**
One of the great things about hiking is that it doesn't require a lot of money to do it.  If you've got a backpack, some water bottles, a comfortable outfit, and a popular trail nearby, you're probably good to go.  However, the more you get into it and the farther you start hiking, the more the gear you see at REI will begin to make sense and be worth it.  

Remember that it is possible to overdo the preparation and end up like [these people](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=R3SFqV0hMyo), so get out there and start learning for yourself.

If there's a place where the restrooms are one person to the entire room, then I think you have a reasonable defence if anyone gets their panties in a wad, as it were, but otherwise it depends on the state.

Let's presume that's true, homicide is still against the law in Texas, but (anecdotally) here is a case where the real law is not what is written but is what people do.

Maybe the story isn't true, but the principle is, in my opinion.  If everyone agrees with it, it is de facto legal, and vice versa.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","The U.S. was settled by people frequently at war with each other. The settlers were constantly at war with indigenous tribes. The U.S. was born in war, and in its short lifespan has been almost constantly at war. We are *less* warlike than most of Europe was for a *longer period of time than we have existed*. When your whole existence has been tempered in the flames of war, its really hard to see yourself any other way.

It isn't even like we've been terribly imperialistic. After WWII we relinquished control of several nations and signed treaties recognizing their sovereignty, and signed defense treaties with them that had our military working with theirs to ensure their sovereignty against the forces that threatened them before.

Our really issue hasn't been the size of our military, but how we use it, and the voice of our government threatening to use it. If used differently, the U.S. military could be a force of much greater good, but even then, the strong-arm policies and tactics required would be frowned upon by much of the rest of the world.

Much of Africa could benefit from having U.S. forces come in and draw lines in the sand against dictators and letting new borders and nations form, but the money and manpower to make that happen has to come from somewhere... Then you have issues of people saying, ""we don't want our money and our children being thrown away on some foreign country!"" It's sad really.","1370046196"

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","Mechanical engineering is a very broad field, for this reason I would suggest doing ME. EE has it's amount of fields but they hardly overlap with any other engineering areas. 
For example, ME's learn about mechanical properties of materials which is a category of Materials Engineering. They also learn Thermodynamics, a big category of Chemical Engineering. Fluid dynamics which is a big category of Aerospace. And if you end up doing control systems, that is a big category of Electrical engineering. 
 Electrical engineers get none of that. All you'll basically learn is circuits and nothing else. And if you decided you're up for the challenge of applied electromagnetics (Radio, Antenna, semiconductors) then you might find it interesting. Radio Frequency and Antenna engineernig is a big part of the aerospace industry and NASA. 
However, 90% of EE is programming, Embedded Systems, and microelectronics. If you like that stuff then I suggest EE.  
Also, if you want to do research I highly suggest ME because of it's broad categories. If you do research, you'll probably end up learning more physics than what is required in college, and since you'll have experience with advanced mechanics, fluid mechanics, and thermodynamcis, all you'll need is electricity and magnetism. On the other hand if you do EE, you'll have to catch up on everything especially if you just ended up doing circuits and no applied E&amp;M. ","1370046198"

"canada","t5_2qh68","That's correct - responding seriously to people who won't change their minds anyways is boring and slightly aggravating. Being sarcastic is much more fun. Also, if you read through the sarcasm, there are arguments there. Let me translate for you:

&gt; Because that's the term. The woman's suffrage movement was feminist yet the outcome was equal voting for both sexes. You seem to think because the word has ""fem"" in it that it means it's all about women getting privilege over men.

Not sarcastic: I actually do believe you think this.

&gt; If you think Marxianist(sic) philosophy

It's Marxist philosophy. Marxian isn't a word. 

&gt; ... is still taught and lauded for its creativity because of its accuracy rather than its ingenuity, then I'd like to ask you what time everyone is meeting to overthrow our capitalist pig government so I can bring some Tim Horton's for everyone.

I'm telling you that comparing feminist movements to Marxist theory is weak because Marxist theory itself is weak. Marx was a great mind and his books are interesting for his deep thought into social structure. They are not accurate. If you think feminist movements are trying to ""control"" people with Marxist values, then I say they either are not, or:

&gt; Not to mention they're doing a horrible job of ""permanent revolution"" if they are alienating so many people.

#

&gt; Yeah, it's a shame after the woman's suffrage movement that we all lost our right to vote.

Do I have to explain how that is an example of feminism not being a zero sum game?

&gt; Literally Hitler.

Did you really expect me to answer your hyperbole seriously?

And now your next reply plays the ""poor me!"" card because you're upset someone has something to against your ""fairly good bit damning feminism"". If you want actual replies, give actual arguments. Your bit on Marxism is actually a pretty good argument, writing wise... but it's premise is weak because you base it on, well, Marxism. The rest of what you said was:

a) a sweeping generalization:
&gt; Every reasonable definition I've heard sets up Feminism as the pursuit of improvement of the situation of women.

which in my opinion isn't even true of most non-radical feminist movements... but that's just my opinion.

edit: actually that's not a sweeping generalization because at least you admitted it's just the definitions that you've heard. I'll chalk it up to ignorance instead.

b) hyperbole:
&gt; There can be no such thing as a victory for women without it also being a defeat for men.

c) another generalization met with a good ole ad hominem:
&gt; Feminism is corrupt and those who practice it are at best misguided or ignorant and at worst actually evil.","1370046201"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Maybe not a friend, but someone who was.

I never really cared that you two got together. It never bothered me, and never has. I wanted you to be happy, and thought you and I could be happy together. 

What bothered me was the weeks of being treated like shit. The constant undermining of our friendship. What broke us was your deceit; leading me on for months, lying to my face, and in the end - finding out from a mutual friend instead of you. 

Here's a thing: Everybody has damage. Nobody gets to be 30 scott-free and clean of some sort of abuse. After our mutual friend told me your childhood trauma, I wasn't stunned - I was disappointed. ""Was that all?"" I said. Look, I will never claim that anything that has ever happened to me has been as potentially horrific as getting raped, much less twice in your adult life, but you chose not to seek help. You chose to close in on yourself and compact your neurosis until it manifested in the worst ways possible. 

I tried to help. I spent hours and hours fretting about you, because I loved you. Because I'm prone to going monstrously out of my way for those I care about - that's a result of my damage. I made so many suggestions about how to help deal with what happened, tried my best to be both a friend and someone who knew you didn't want to love at the time (perhaps you never did). 

I'm better off out of our relationship, whatever relationship was left the last few months before we stopped talking. I'm happier. I'm more confident. I feel valuable again. 

Nobody stopped you from being *my* friend - you chose not to be there for me, to criticize me, to blame me when I rebelled against the unknown cause of abuse I was being subjected to. 

I still think about you daily. Instead of making excuses for your actions, though, I've been talking about how I can't see a way forward. How I can't be close to people who so readily took advantage of me. Part of me still loves you, but it's hiding in a corner. I'm not letting it out unless I can trust you again, unless I'm 100% positive you reciprocate, and I doubt those will happen anytime soon.

Time isn't going to dull these things. I will remember, and know the only thing I got out of this was a lesson that I sorely needed - to be able to tell who really gives a shit about me, and who will throw a fit the moment I stop playing the docile giant they're happy taking advantage of. 

I want to wish you all the best, but a relationship forged in desperation and damaged lives will never last. I don't want anything bad to happen to you, but he's not as strong as I am - not when it comes to what counts in a relationship. It will get to him, you will realize you don't love him and that you were flailing wildly - looking for anybody to make contact with, and at some point the cumulative baggage carried by both of you will make it break. It could be in the next few months, it could be in a few years, and maybe it'll be in the next decade.

It will happen, though. You don't know *how* to have a stable relationship, and he's not lenient enough to teach you. I don't want to be there to pick up the ashes. I'm not going to be that man, just as I didn't want to be The Other Guy you forced me to be. I'm only taking you back if you change, and if you make the choice to be with me instead of fulfilling a need.

I don't know if that will ever happen. You seem like the type of person who will easily forget people, but not all the bad things they did to you. At some point I'll simply stop caring. The next girl will do that; and that's what has made my anger and tears into pity. 

The next girl will make me forget you. You never let me know you well enough to prevent that. It'll be a long time before another friend like me comes along, though. It always is.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Honestly after 6 months? Yeah. Especially because every night that you fuck your new dude, you go home to the place you share with your ex. Call it a roommate situation, call it whatever you want but seriously. It shouldn't take too much empathy to see this from his perspective. :(

Honestly, if I were dating someone who did that, I would assume that they were emotionally unavailable and still in love with their ex. I realize you consider the everyday things you do with your ex to be ""mundane"", but honey, they're what make a relationship. They're intimate mundane everyday life-sharing things that you don't do with anyone else. You haven't even TRIED to live a life without your ex that DOESN'T involve cooking, meals, grocery store runs - most roommates don't do that shit together. 

And Mr. Coolguy hasn't had a prayer from the start. Because you haven't had to actually change anything about your life except for who puts his dick in you. I realize that sounds harsh, but the only thing you've managed to change in your life is who owns the dick. You aren't giving Coolguy a real chance. Maybe he doesn't deserve one, maybe he is a manchild, but it is pretty hypocritical of you to be so up in arms that he won't do things to improve his life and walk away from the security blanket of his parents when you won't do anything to walk away from the security blanket of your ex.","1370046204"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Huge advertisement and infrastructure improvements. The province, the main contributor, spent 3 Billion over 7 years in a time the provincial budget 40 billion a year, so 3 billion out of 210 billion (or a bit less because infaltion, maybe 180 or something). Not very much to have a great promotion, and last time I checked the BC economy is pretty good compared to US and Europe, so the effect was either negligable, slightly positive, or slightly negative. 

No doubt we will bring in more investment and events to BC, I dunno how much exactly but it cannot be written off. To assume already knew Vancouver was a destination beforehand is foolhardy. They might know OF Vancouver, but now they know it in and out. Not to mention the city got an injection of a huge amount of funds from visitors.

It also promotes pride in Canada, after all, we are trying to have a society here.

Clothes, animals, card games, etc. Doesn't matter, if you go off on a passionate tangent about it it can scare people off. But you don't have to tiptoe around the subject, and I think it's very important for you to casually say SOMETHING about it, if it's something that's really important to you. Personally, I love me a nerd, I think they're adorable, but if I had a guy come up to me and shove his DS in my face I'm gonna get creeped out. Second date, after you've kinda figured out the person in general, then be yourself. Be the person you would be if the two of you were in a relationship. Also, I hate how you said, ""my girlfriend was supportive"". It's not a handicap, it's one of your passions, you don't need someone that will love you IN SPITE of what helps define you.

2. She was kind of a big girl and since I was really fucked up plus not very strong, I couldn't really fight her back. Basically all I could do was turn my head to the side when she tried to kiss me. 
3. I only told one person. We were on a school trip to DC where me and the girl who raped me had decided to bunk in the same room.

&gt; A few years ago my dad was punched in the back of the head for supposedly cutting in front of an incredibly intoxicated woman at the bar. He grabbed her arm so she wouldn't run away while my step mom called the police. When the police arrived they saw no signs of injury on my dad, while the woman had bruises on her arm from struggling. My dad was arrested and charged with assault. I bailed my dad out of jail and jokingly asked ""What did we learn?"" as he always asked me when I got in trouble as a kid. He responded with ""If I knew I was going to go to jail anyway I woulda knocked her head clean off.""

The Bible was not written in one go. It was collected, verified, and reflected by the leaders of the early Church. It wasn't until centuries after Christ that ""The Bible"" existed and began to be used to beat people about the head and shoulders.

You are right that many who profess Christianity do not live up to it. This has been true from the beginning. See Ananias in Acts 5.

Let's not get started on gay marriage or being gay. It's a shadow of an afterthought compared to the truth of the Gospel.

I have no real apology for the denominations. Schism is the entropy of the fallen world acting on the body of Christ. All you can do is pray for strength in God and trust that he will lead you where He needs you to be. We are one body.

1 Corinthians 12:12-14.

12 Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body—whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 14 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many.

&gt;what if we are wrong. what if our religion is not THE one?

This is a serious question. Maybe more serious is, how could we even know? Ask.

Those memory cells are not something you share with others, unless you are a mother nursing a newborn.

1. The Nikkei may have topped, and the chart [doesn't look good](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/NKY:IND/chart), especially considering the BOJ is printing yen to the moon. The USD/JPY is highly correlated to the Nikkei, so if the index does indeed continue falling, so will the USD/JPY. 

2. The way US equity markets closed today is worrisome, and is possibly a sign that they also have topped, at least for the near future. If equities start falling and investors go risk-off, this will also lead to a decline in the USD/JPY. The yen technically shouldn't be a safe-haven currency play anymore, considering how much of it the BOJ is printing, but investors are still treating it as one.

In any case, MJ's statline speaks for itself as a rebuttal of your point. Pau was indeed great at passing. Kobe did average more assists, usage or not, averaged a few rebounds fewer, and *a lot* more points while being marginally less efficient. If you don't think that's not Finals MVP-worthy, well okay.

So, because most people won't need it, and it's not meant to be played until after the first playthrough, they decided to make this the DLC. This is fairly simple, so they could spend the most amount of development time on things everyone who buys the game at all would get. Some skins or a gun or something would be simpler though, and they are kinda alienating their hardcore base a bit. However, one, we don't know what negotiations looked like, and two, the hardcore base are the ones most likely to pre-order anyway, especially if they know they're getting ranger mode (which was a DLC to the first one too).

You now appear to be agreeing that it's used around the country by the upper and upper middle class, though apparently you think there's a necessary causal link between going to public school and having the accent. I disagree. For example, take the Duke of Argyll (link posted above). When he was 4 years old, before he'd gone to any kind of school, do you think he had a regional Scottish accent? Or do you think it's more likely he spoke like his parents? Bear in mind that we're having this conversation in a thread in which OP has provided us with a really good example of how early in life accents are formed. I would say parents are the primary influence in accent formation. And that's why it's a class thing, in the traditional (hereditary) sense.

And in the South, people only speak naturally like that if their parents did, and they're middle class. It's exactly the same thing. You don't hear a lot of RP in London on council estates.

As for your own link:

""Received Pronunciation (RP) is the standard accent of Standard English in England, *with a relationship to regional accents similar to the relationship in other European languages between their standard varieties and their regional forms*""

""RP is often believed to be based on the Southern accents of England, *but it actually has most in common with the Early Modern English dialects of the East Midlands.* This was the most populated and most prosperous area of England during the 14th and 15th centuries. By the end of the 15th century, ""Standard English"" was established in the City of London. *A mixture of London speech with elements from East Midlands, Middlesex and Essex, became known as Received Pronunciation*"".","1370046221"

It has been bothering me to no end that the 'mother protecting her kids against burglars' anecdote seems to be frequently brought up by those against reforming gun control: ""A mother is reading Goodnight Moon to her kids upstairs when, suddenly, she hears glass shatter—hushed voices and footsteps echo through the halls as three masked intruders approach the staircase. Momma whips out an AK-47 from under her bed and gets to the top of the stairs just as the three armed criminals begin to go up—one pull of the trigger and she fucking blows them away, protecting herself, her property, and her children. God bless America.""

I have no idea if this sort of thing actually happens in real life with any frequency. But—nobody ever backs up and says 'Hey, this is an absolutely batshit ridiculous scenario in a civil society, never mind the wealthiest country in the world,' hits rewind, and attempts to figure out how it is that this ludicrous scene ever came to be.

Put aside the immaturity about cleaning his room and doing his laundry, because I think those are valid reasons to complain about.

He has this girlfriend, who still lives with her ex and doesn't seem to be making plans to move any time soon. She explicitly keeps telling him that she doesn't want anything serious, even though she is in an exclusive relationship. She keeps telling him there is nothing going on with her ex, but spends a lot of time with him, platonic or not. (Sidenote you said above that you essentially sacrificed a good relationship for him...doesn't sound so platonic tbh, doesn't sound like you did it by your own choice, but rather, for him, and like you have regrets about it).

 He asks her to spend the night, she says no. Does not give a reason, does not invite him over. 

---

Honestly, your boyfriend's reaction towards your relationship is pretty fucking reasonable.

You're the one being unreasonable. 

And honestly, you don't get to bitch about his living situation. You don't like that he lives at home because it's not conducive to your relationship? Guess what, he doesn't like where you live and your living arrangement isn't conducive to the relationship either.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The term agnostic has been misappropriated by those who think because we cannot claim absolute certainty, the probability of there being a god and there not being a god is around the same. Certainly, there are atheists who say that they are 100% certain that there is no god, but this is usually because they are not fully aware of the official position of the rational skeptic or because they do not want the religious or semi-religious to jump on the opportunity to criticize the agnostic for saying that there COULD be a god. Anyone with even an small grasp of statistics and probability must admit that the probability of there being a specific god of the Old Testament, for example, is so infinitesimally small that it approaches zero (probability of miracle 1 x probability of miracle 2  x ... probability of miracle n x the individual probabilities that historians and scientists either lied or were incompetent enough to find contradicting evidence for all of these religious claims). The common definition of the atheist position is that the atheist does not outright reject the possibility of a god's existence, but that there has never been any evidence provided to make that kind of argument plausible or believable. There exist an infinite amount of things that we cannot prove do not exist, but we would be silly to take those things seriously (like leprechauns or fairies or even Bertrand Russel's famous teapot that you should look up). 

If we must be intellectually honest, everyone SHOULD be an agnostic regarding almost everything. But functionally, the term agnostic is fairly meaningless except as a PR tool to make certain individuals just look more open.","1370046229"

Your body can quickly increase or decrease its temperature by shivering (generates heat) and sweating (loses heat).

You can prevent that entire response by taking some drugs that prevent prostaglandin release, like aspirin. Generally though, the hypothalamus is hardwired to keep the temperature at 37C.","1370046231"

A major part of a gay man's ""coming out"" is questioning the traditional sense of what it means to be a man since that traditional sense (which involves marrying a woman, siring children, and providing for them) is largely incompatible with homosexuality.  Many men put off by flamboyance have never had to, or haven't yet, question gender norms from a very personal perspective.  To resent flamboyance because it might break traditional gender roles is to fundamentally be at odds with homosexuality as it exists in today's society (this argument, as you might see, is easily expanded to incorporate trans* rights, which is why it's not just gays/lesbians, but rather the whole gamut of LGBT in gender and sexual minorities [GSM]).

I myself would not say I'm annoyed by flamboyance, but rather by loud personalities which cannot volume control appropriately with respect to certain environments.","1370046237"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","that's fine by me. what do you want me to say though? that everyone in the world is my best friend?

I make friends with a ton of people. I love people. I'm going to make new friends later today, at a buddys party (bunch of people I don't know). I'm going to meet some awesome people tomorrow at brunch (hanging out with some friends who are in a band and thus meet very interesting folks all the time).

but because of my upbringing, because of who I am, it takes me ages to actually trust people. those people I trust mean a lot to me. everything I do in my life is to make sure I can be there for them: my dad, my mom, and about 5-6 of my closest friends.

it's not that others don't matter, but these folks take priority. I've said in a previous post -- I have helped tons of my friends move, I've helped peoplewith money, whatever. but there are times when I pick one person over another.

why call me a dickwad for having priorities? it's not like I expect anything from acquaintances. I don't mislead them or anything. it's just that ... just because we've hung out a few times and like to go to the same bars doesn't mean I'm looking to hang out all the time. I'm down to chill sometimes and kick it, but that's how I feel. I'm not going to be a dick about it, I'm not going to be rude. I'm going to just politely excuse myself the times I can't chill.

what's the problem? I don't expect everyone to want to see me all the time either, for fucks sake.

and hypocritical? I don't think you get at all what that word means... I follow what I say to a T. I'm telling him what I do, and how I follow what I do. I feel hurt, sure, when someone doesn't want to hang out. but as an adult, you need to recognize that some people won't like you or some people feel like they've grown apart from you.

happens in friendships, romance, hell for some unfortunate folks even their parents. it's part of life. get over it. meet new people.","1370046248"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","In my opinion, an armed revolt was the only ethical solution to Irish potato famine. I would actually be justified in this opinion through Rothbardian ethics. 

Historically, most Irish land was seized by force by the English crown and sold off to a relatively small prodestant aristocratic ascendancy. This process began in the 16th century. Catholics (and people of other disestablised faiths), who comprised most of the population of the island, were not allowed to own land according to the Penal Laws. The rightful owners of the land had their lands taken from them by force and given to this new aristocracy. These laws subsided at the end of the 18th century and early 19th century, but their legacy was still very much apparent.

Thus, most of the landlords in 19th century Ireland had inherited stolen land from their forefathers. The only rightful owners of the land were the descendants of those who had the land taken from them by force under false unethical pretenses.

Take the following exert from Rothbard's *Ethics of Liberty* where he talks about a scenario involving an inherited stolen watch: 

&gt; Suppose, for example, that Jones possesses a watch, and that we can clearly show that Jones’s title is originally criminal, either because (1) his ancestor stole it, or (2) because he or his ancestor purchased it from a thief (whether wittingly or unwittingly is immaterial here). Now, if we can identify and find the victim or his heir, then it is clear that Jones’s title to the watch is totally invalid, and that it must promptly revert to its true and legitimate owner. Thus, if Jones inherited or purchased the watch from a man who stole it from Smith, and if Smith or the heir to his estate can be found, then the title to the watch properly reverts immediately back to Smith or his descendants, without compensation to the existing possessor of the criminally derived “title.” Thus, if a current title to property is criminal in origin, and the victim or his heir can be found, then the title should immediately revert to the latter.

http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/nine.asp

During the potato famine, many landlords in Ireland did not reside in Ireland at all, and only used the lands for their economic benefit, namely agriculture. While most of the country was starving, agricultural products were carried under armed guard to Irish ports for export to mainland Britain. Ireland was one of the breadbaskets of the UK during the time. 

Most landlords only allowed their tenants to grow potatoes because they you could produce a relatively high yield of food in a relatively small land area. This insured that the landlords could allot the bare minimum land to their tenants, without having to sacrifice any other land used for other agricultural produce which would've been sold or exported. In other words, the landlords were trying to yield the maximum agricultural produce at the most minimum cost to sustain the tenants who worked the land. Any tenants caught growing crops other than potatoes was evicted. 

Under such conditions where the rightful owners of the land were being denied their inherited property rights on such a massive scale and had no choice other than death or immigration, and faced with a government which sided with the landed nobility, armed revolution was the only course of action. 

But even such a revolution was almost doomed to failure because the revolutaries would've had (a) little supply of weapons to fight with and (b) wouldn't have had the necessary foodstuffs to sustain an army in a famine ravaged country.
