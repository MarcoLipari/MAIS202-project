I am wondering if you ever pursued any sort of diagnosis? I‚Äôve read a few of your comments where you‚Äôve talked about finding it hard to work sometimes because there‚Äôs ‚Äòall the other‚Äô things on top of the black and white job tasks you‚Äôre expected to do. Do you find that the ‚Äòunwritten‚Äô rules trip you up in work and social settings? I‚Äôm asking because it sounds like a common difficulty encountered by autistic people. 

I am autistic and I have spent years working with pupils with additional support needs. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say that socialising or work itself is much easier with a diagnosis, but I would say that it can sometimes provide a useful framework through which to start figuring out how to get what you need: friends that support you, a job that you feel secure and competent in. Life becomes less about trying to force yourself to fit and more about finding a place in the world that fits you. The latter is so much easier because there *are* people with similar needs and communication styles to you, and finding them is always easier than attempting to learn the many and unwritten rules of masking. 

By and large, people give a lot of grace to others‚Äîbut people who do not have the same experience as you won‚Äôt think of your experience first. What I mean here is that if you *are* acting in a way that breaks an unwritten rule, but you don‚Äôt know it, the first thing people usually think is that you are being rude on purpose or because you don‚Äôt care about others. I know that‚Äôs not true, because I have seen your posts where you talk about thinking you‚Äôre a bad person. That you worry about your effect on others shows me you do care. If you are up front about your difficulty with unwritten rules, I think people would generally pause before they assume you‚Äôre being rude, and give you a little grace/talk to you about what‚Äôs bothering them. 

Sorry that this comment is so long. I hope you‚Äôre not offended by my suggestion",1714521600.0

"BlueLock","t5_mm79h","nope, the reason I didn't include volume 28 is because that volume doesn't cover the pxg match, that's just the break for bastard. That volume goes from the bids post ubers match until the announcement for the pxg match kick off so that doesn't count as part of the pxg match. Another thing, the Neru thing, that's just a long shot thing but not entirely impossible, so in other words it's just extremely unlikely. I believe this match will go on longer than the others but since volume 29 is entirely focused on the match unlike volumes 20 and 24 being the start of the manshine and ubers match respectively and also include that short break between matches, the pxg match might just end up having 4 volumes like always. 

What I was trying to say with Neru is that IF the match goes on for 5 volumes, which is not certain, he is going to have a volume cover for the simple reason that there is literally no other charachter left but him since any other relevant charachter will have gotten theirs by that time unless they don't introduce another more relevant like Endoji for example.",1714521600.0

The problem is everything is not otherwise right with the world and articles like this one here are constantly used to help validate bad things. Yes, genetics causes vast discrepancy in intelligence, not just physical attributes, but no, it's not ok to remain willfully ignorant of the world around you. Everyone, no matter what their intelligence-potential, should be striving everyday to be as intelligent as possible....or well educated. Nuance isn't that easy online. Anyway, obviously intelligence/education will vary, but ""because Billy Bob told me"" isn't good enough.....ever. That's what I feel the article is trying to validate, like so many others. ""My ignorant opinion is equal to your fact-based reasoning.""

It's like the writings about body positivity in the last number of years. No, I don't think it's right to make fun of and laugh at obese people, just like I don't think it's right to make fun of and laugh at people who are not very intelligent, but it's not ok to be obese. You will necessarily cut your life short and thereby cut short the time your loved ones will get to spend with you. There are no advantages to obesity and countless detriments. But there's too much of this type of thing going on today. No, it's not ok to remain willfully ignorant (and many who read the article likely won't know the differences between IQ and intelligence and education), and no it's not ok to elect idiots to office just because they make your tummy feel good.

- In the the Last light in there's a semi conscious dude singing to himself in a bed.  If you go talk to him and the flaming fist next to him, you'll figure out he's been in the shadowfell for the last 100 years.

- Next go tell Halsin about him and Halsin will meet you at the Inn

- Talk to Halsin at the Inn and tell him that you'll look into it.

- Go to House of Healing and kill Malus Thorm, he has a lute on him

- Go back to the Last Light Inn and play the lute for Art (semi conscious guy), he'll wake up and Halsin will ask him about Thaniel

- Speak to Halsin, he'll tell you he needs your help to bring Thaniel out of the Shadowfell. Follow him to the side of the inn and do the fight there.

- Once Halsin saves Thaniel then back at camp tell Halsin about Oliver

- Go talk to Oliver.",1714521601.0

He also feels inspired by Hamilton to act out and run for president but Hamilton crushes his dreams so he lashes out in rage.

I love the cube idea!  Good luck in the competition! 

A few weeks ago someone posted a YouTube link to someone that has a long tutorial on painting nails., sorry I can't remember the site.  Look through the sub, maybe you'll find it.

My Take away on what you want to do from her video is, she uses some kind of base coat that peels off.  She uses it because she says she changes colors so often for the channel.  It's not a stain blocker though.

So I'd recommend the Seche base coat for stain resistance,  then the peel off on top of that, then the colors and Seche  topcoat from the ""kit"".

The Seche base coat is unnoticeable, so if you do it this way, you can just peel off everything, and be back to ""normal"" very easily.  Or pure Acetone and cotton balls, got mine at target in the nail polish area, and it comes off with a little effort.

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","All of your statements are independently true, but your underlying insinuation that this is all a result of greed and rate cuts/hikes won‚Äôt change that is but a fraction of the bigger picture. In other words, yes. Greed definitely plays a role. The pursuit of profit has perhaps gone a bit too far (it reminds me of how folks gouged the natives in Killers of the Flower Moon). BUT inflation is still a result of several factors, on both the supply and demand side, as well as productivity. It‚Äôs not all greed. And we know that adjusting interest rates does have a significant impact on inflation. We also now know that there isn‚Äôt necessarily a lag today, given the free flow of information (so Milton freedman may have been wrong, or is at least irrelevant today). We can immediately impact markets and inflation by adjusting the fed funds rate. By increasing the cost of borrowing and tightening the supply of money, businesses have less access to capital, consumers have less money to spend, the economy slows. Businesses drop prices. And so the cycle perpetuates. There will also come a breaking point where consumers simply aren‚Äôt willing to pay the price for a product anymore. I don‚Äôt use Uber anymore because it‚Äôs cheaper to call a black car and the service is 10x better. I don‚Äôt eat at my local diner anymore because it costs just slightly less than the nice restaurants by my house and the food is significantly worse (same With fast food ‚Äî it‚Äôs insanely expensive now).

Does it enter into your consideration that Israel is also intentionally blocking humanitarian aid supplies? Or that Israel is intentionally starving Palestinians en masse?

They cover the whole smorgasbord for me with two different sets working together. One does the tangible and long term things like market accounts, 401K, development deals. That group is set at a certain percentage of the total money in that they can mess with. The other has a smaller percentage to work with and we leverage crypto, penny stocks, short sells, quick money stuff with a lot more volatility. The both answer my questions to the fullest and we are all in the know that I want to be active with my decisions but I want to be far enough away that the day to days don‚Äôt cause me too much stress. I also had a good deal of luck so far and tend to live a decently frugal life with sacrificing too much.",1714521604.0

"poledancing","t5_2s7x0","It is EXTREMELY important to install a tension pole against a ceiling joist! Not only will the joist prevent your ceiling from crashing down and costing a lot to repair, it also prevents you from getting seriously injured should the pole fall down while you are on it, or if the pole falls on you or on someone/something when you are next to it. 

I have a friend who didn't install her pole against a joist and ended up landing on her shoulder when her pole fell. She had to stop dancing for a while and is currently going to therapy to regain use of her shoulder. She was charged a hefty bill to repair her ceiling as well. 

The presence of cracks on your ceiling already indicates that it is not strong enough for normal wear and tear (structural changes due to weather as temperature changes) without having a pole against it, so having a pole installed on an area that doesn't have a joist will definitely increase the likelihood of an accident. 

The X-Pole website highlights the importance of installing a tension pole against a joist for safety as well as video for how to find a ceiling joist using a stud finder (you may need to scroll through a couple of links).

Because the real antagonist of Paul's story is his terrible purpose, this Holy War which has haunted him since Part One and with which Part Two ends. The film therefore ends on a very dark note and what is in fact a defeat of the protagonist.

While Dune Messiah ends with a bittersweet triumph for the protagonist, obviously very tragic and sad, but still a triumph: not only does Paul defeat the plots of all his enemies (be it the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Qizarate and the Bene Tleilax) but he finally puts an end to his terrible purpose and his theocratic power.

Obviously the cost of this triumph is enormous and tragic since Paul must sacrifice himself by walking in the desert after witnessing the death of the one he loves. But for me Dune Messiah nonetheless ends with the bittersweet victory of the protagonist and on a note, certainly very tragic, but also very powerful and satisfying.",1714521604.0

The error message seems to point to line 30 of your AbilityHolder script, so you should start there.  Most likely, something you're trying to access on that line has no reference to anything in your scene (thus ""null"" reference; it references nothing).

This could be because:

* You forgot to drag-and-drop the reference in the Inspector
* You forgot to acquire the reference via code
* You attempted to acquire the reference (via code) from the wrong object (ex: you used GetComponent on the parent object, but the script/component you need to reference actually exists on one of its children)

Or any other number of things.

The bottom line though, is that you need to determine *what* is null and *why* it is null, and then take the necessary action(s) to ensure that when that line is executed the reference is no longer null.",1714521605.0
"anime","t5_2qh22","End of month rankings! Gonna also include the seasonal shows I completed last month since my planned seasonal writeups never materialized ;-;

Anime | Score | Thoughts
:-- | :--: | :--
Revue Starlight: The Movie | 10/10 | I didn't think it was possible to make an anime more theatrical and gay than Symphogear, but here we are [](#doggo)
Revue Starlight | 9.5/10 | This series is officially my personality until the next hyperfixation comes along. Sorry not sorry to anyone who knows me and isn't a RevStar fan yet
Bang Brave Bang Bravern! | 9/10 | [BRAVERN!!!!!!!!!](#GRANDHYPE)
Undead Unluck | 8.5/10 | The manga is already one of the best modern shonens, and the anime's insane stylization just elevates it even more. So desperately praying for a Season 2
K-On! Season 1 | 8/10 | Cute
Metallic Rouge | 7.5/10 | A series which asks one of the most meaningful philosophical questions of our time: What if Lycoris Recoil... but good?
Frieren: Beyond Journey's End | 7/10 | My feelings on this show are really complicated since it's so amazing when it's actually committing to its core appeal, yet it's also so consistently committed to being the worst version of itself by wasting time on lame action arcs. Undoubtedly one of the more incosistent shows I watched recently.
SPY x FAMILY CODE: White | 7/10 | The scene of [CODE: White]>!Anya fantasizing about how much she needs to take a shit!< still lives rent free in my head
The Cat Returns | 7/10 | Cute
The Wind Rises | 4.5/10 | Miyazaki's ability to craft a masterful, tightly controlled, thematically nuanced picture of a subject I couldn't give less of a shit about is truly commendable

And now for the non-anime stuff I completed or got caught up on this month

Thing | Score | Thoughts
:-- | :--: | :--
The LEGO Movie (Rewatch) | 10/10 | Still my favorite western animated movie ever made
Tangled (Rewatch) | 10/10 | My favorite Disney movie [](#anko)
Undead Unluck (Manga) | 10/10 | This show's journey from a clunkily written romp with uncomfortable sexual assault elements to one of the most emotionally powerful, thematically moving, and wildly creative Shonen manga is a sight to behold
Delicious in Dungeon (Manga) | 10/10 | This might just be one of the most tightly-written manga I've ever read
The Addams Family | 9/10 | Hilarious, creative, and wholesome all at once. Can't believe it took me this long to watch it
Addams Family Values | 9/10 | Can't decide whether I like this film or the first one more [](#hardthink)
Hilda Season 1 | 8.5/10 | [When I'm in a best main characters competition and my next opponent is Hilda:](https://imgur.com/a/84YImSN)
Sleeping Beauty | 8.5/10 | It's a classic for a reason. Very archetypal and straightforward in a way that makes it feel timeless and charming rather than dated or cliche. Not to mention being visually stunning even decades later
Ms. Marvel (2014) | 8/10 | Some clunky dialogue and generally on-the-nose writing can't hold back the poignant emotion of this deeply charming superhero tale
The Executioner and Her Way of Life Vol 2: Whiteout | 8/10 | About as solid as I remember the equivalent anime material being
Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla | 8/10 | Nani? A Godzilla movie with good human characters?! [](#BOCCHITHESHOCK)
The Executioner and Her Way of Life Vol 3: The Cage of Iron Sand | 7.5/10 | Has some of the highest highs of the series so far, but they're also paired with some of its lowest lows.
Return of Godzilla | 4/10 | I'm starting to realize I just find Godzilla boring [](#lifeishard)
Rebel Moon Part 1 | 2/10 | This is the cinematic equivalent of what everyone claims Metallic Rouge is, just soulless regurgitation of the tropes & concepts from much better Sci-Fi films dragged down further by clunky dialogue and boring characters. That's not even mentioning the awful cinematography and nightmarish pacing
Rebel Moon Part 2 | 1.5/10 | Now that I've dropped Jujutsu Kaisen, this franchise seems to want to take its place as my new nemesis [Snyder WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY](#everythingisfine)",1714521605.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Stores making it way too complicated to receive advertised discounts and posted sale prices

For example: my mom and I were at Kohls and there was a sign in the store that said ""20% off"" and in smaller text below, that the discount only applies to items on this rack between $28 - $32.  

So I grabbed one item from the rack that was $32 and took it to the checkout and the cashier said we had to have the 20% off coupon for that to apply and that it should be in your email but only if you're a rewards member. 

My mom opens the email (she is a rewards member) and shows the cashier the coupon which clearly in bright red text says ""20% OFF select items in store for rewards members""

The cashier says ""okay so now you have to download the app and sign in to your account and it will give a scannable barcode""

So my mom gets the app and attempts to sign in but it says no account is associated with that email. 
Even though she has a Kohls credit card and clearly had the coupon in her email, and she input the same email address to the app that she had used to receive the coupon, the cashier still had to get her supervisor to give permission to apply the 20% off...

Another example: in Pick n Save/some Kroger branded stores, you have to scan the QR codes on the shelf tag which lead to a login screen in order to get the posted sale prices. You have to have the same rewards account tied to your email and phone number, apply the coupons in the app or on the mobile site, and then enter the associated phone number at checkout along with a 4 digit pin.

Yet another example: when Target came out with the Cartwheel app, and then Circle.

Does anyone else remember when rewards members just...got the posted discounts? Let alone when sale items were just ON SALE without needing to be a rewards member?",1714521605.0

> Malfoy leaned back in his chair and flipped through the files. A lock of hair worked loose from the tail he‚Äôd tied it back in and fell into his face, and he tucked it behind one ear. ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôve got Mr. Wright, whose window was broken earlier this morning by, and I quote, ‚Äòthat bloody band of hooligans that always hangs out around here, howling like a mob of savage Muggles.‚Äô‚Äù He paused and glanced up at Harry. ‚ÄúHave you ever encountered Mr. Wright?‚Äù
>
> Harry shook his head.
>
> ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre in for a treat,‚Äù Malfoy said with a sly grin that made Harry a little uneasy. ‚ÄúAnyway, he wants the lot of them rounded up and arrested. Let‚Äôs see what else we‚Äôve got for today. Oh, Mrs. Dodson‚Äôs shop has been broken into again, the poor dear, and she‚Äôd like someone to come round and take a report on what‚Äôs been stolen. And Mrs. Levy‚Äôs cat has been kidnapped. I suggest we start with that one.‚Äù Malfoy rolled his eyes as he gasped dramatically, ‚ÄúA kidnapping, imagine! It sounds urgent, wouldn‚Äôt you say? I wonder if they‚Äôve left a ransom note.‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Harry said helplessly, his brain still trying to catch up. ‚ÄúHer cat has been kidnapped?‚Äù
>
> ‚ÄúI told you to forget about the big exciting cases you‚Äôre used to getting,‚Äù Malfoy said, then paused to drain the last of his tea. He cast a quick cleaning charm on the cup and set it aside. ‚ÄúAlthough this isn‚Äôt so bad. Three cases in one day is rather busy, isn‚Äôt it? Partnering with the Boy Who Lived does seem to have some advantage after all.‚Äù He stood. ‚ÄúCome along, Potter. We‚Äôd best get started.‚Äù

----

> As the door shut behind him and they made their way back down the front path, Draco tapped his wand to his notepad and reduced the top page to ashes with a quick Incendio. Potter was shaking his head slowly.
>
> ‚ÄúWell, Potter?‚Äù he asked as they turned onto the sidewalk. He brushed the last bits of ash from his notebook and flipped it closed.
>
> ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ He called me a potato.‚Äù Potter‚Äôs mouth pursed into a small and slightly-baffled frown. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been called a potato before.‚Äù
>
> He sounded so bewildered that Draco could only grin. ‚ÄúYou got off easy. My first time, I was, and I quote, ‚Äòa pretentious, useless son of a popinjay, and likely a miscreant to boot. Got the devil in his eyebrows, that one does.‚Äô To be honest, I still don‚Äôt quite know what that means.‚Äù

----

> ‚ÄúI see you haven‚Äôt arrested them,‚Äù Mr. Wright grumbled as they walked up to his house.
>
> ‚ÄúYes, well, the Ministry does tend to frown on their Aurors arresting six-year-olds,‚Äù Draco replied.
>
> ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs wrong with it,‚Äù Mr. Wright said and segued neatly into another round of ‚ÄòWhen I Was a Lad‚Äô while Draco stood on the porch and wondered what he‚Äôd done in a past life to deserve this, and Potter, the Great Savior of the Wizarding World, cowered behind him, well out of cane-range. ‚ÄúAnd what will be done about my window?‚Äù he finished.
>
> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in luck, Sir,‚Äù Draco said brightly and hauled Potter up beside him. ‚ÄúIn addition to vanquishing Dark Wizards, the great Harry Potter is also England‚Äôs foremost expert in window repair.‚Äù",1714521605.0

‚ÄúYou want to know what this [war on drugs] was really all about? The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I‚Äôm saying?

We knew we couldn‚Äôt make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities.

I am going to assume Chad makes this comment based on the fact that, had it been built correctly, it could be a straight wall but the shelf would have been built in.  Given it has not been built in and I have to retrofit it, I assume the best path is now to build a slanted wall so that there is room to have the smoke shelf?

Since the original post, I have ensured there are no ""internals"" that are not smooth.  It is all smooth and then flows up at an angle from the front and a straight line vertically on the back wall.

I am struggling to find a mason who has the background in building a fireplace locally, but let's say I find the right person.  I am wondering what your opinions are about building that slanted wall and smoke shelf, given what I have to work with at this point.",1714521605.0

LetsEncrypt is indeed the answer, and it sounds like NPM has LE support built in.

If you want step by step instructions for common issues like these, it‚Äôs actually not a bad idea to ask your friendly neighbourhood LLM. Quote:

No problem! To enable TLS within Nginx Proxy Manager and obtain a certificate using Let's Encrypt, here's what you can do:

1. Install Nginx Proxy Manager if you haven't already.

2. Configure your domain in Nginx Proxy Manager:
   - Add your domain in Nginx Proxy Manager's dashboard.
   - Make sure you have a DNS record pointing to your server's IP address.

3. Obtain a certificate:
   - In Nginx Proxy Manager, enable SSL for your domain.
   - Choose ""Let's Encrypt"" as the SSL provider.
   - Follow the prompts to obtain and install the certificate.

4. Verify the certificate:
   - Ensure that the SSL certificate is successfully obtained and installed by visiting your domain over HTTPS in a web browser.

5. Update NPM settings:
   - Once SSL is configured in Nginx Proxy Manager, there's typically no need to configure anything within NPM itself.
   - Just make sure any applications or services you're proxying through Nginx Proxy Manager are configured to use HTTPS.

6. Test your setup:
   - Verify that your applications are accessible over HTTPS via Nginx Proxy Manager.

By following these steps, you should be able to enable TLS within Nginx Proxy Manager and obtain a certificate using Let's Encrypt for your domain.",1714521606.0

"tragedeigh","t5_4y7u0c","Reminder to stick to posting original content. Memes are okay every once in a while, but many get posted here way too often and quickly become stale. Some examples of these are Ptoughneigh, Klansmyn, Reighfyl & KVIIIlyn. These memes have been around for years and we don't want to see them anymore. If you do decide to post a meme, make sure to add the correct flair. Posting a random meme you found does **not** mean you found it ""in the wild"".

The same goes with lists of baby names, celebrity baby names, and screenshots of TikToks. If the original post already had a substantial amount of views, there is a 99% chance it has already been posted here. Try and stick to OC to keep our sub from being flooded with unoriginal content.

That is one example why reddit is not place for healthy and fair conversation. Where are the mature arguments ?

tell me who did gather the 115 (and it took them long time and effort) and presented to the court? it is the epl

They are the entity that is actively suing city and brought these matters to the surface and disrupt city. and you are saying that they are covering city ass. if they wanted that why the hell they are suing city ? you know that they could simply not go to the court and keep things as they were

Also tell me, why does newcastle acting very timidly financial-wise. They have so much loads of money (the biggest investment entity in the world owns them) and they wants sooooooo bad to spent money but who is resitricting them? The EPL after city initially cooked the book and epl filled the holes so no one else re do it. if epl is blatantly corrupted why are they stomping on newcastle owners ?

Yeah in the regular season when Nuggets trapped Ant, itsuccessfully took him out of the game. Suns doubled and blitzed him too and that's why he struggled. Surprisingly in the playoffs, he's already figured out how to punish doubles with quicker reads and passes. I didn't expect him to improve his decision making and playmaking in just 1 week because he struggled with doubles all season. So I'm fascinated to see if the same technique Nuggets used, will work now. 

Going to be such a riveting series! Like you, I cannot wait to see the chess match. Thanks for the discussion :) I've always wanted to hear the x&o perspective from a Denver fan.

Wut.

Legal repercussions for violent men are more severe than that of women. Just look at sentencing statistics.

Societally women get more leeway for assaulting men anyways. Ever heard of ""never hit a girl, even if she hits you first"" or ""be a gentleman"" that young boys are taught all the time?

I‚Äôm trying to mentally prepare for that moment, but honestly, I think there‚Äôs a good chance, I‚Äôm just going to have a fuckin breakdown right there in the vet office lobby.  With my luck, there will be a shit ton of people and their pets in there, so I can really look like a lunatic.  I seriously don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ever going to be okay.  I can‚Äôt seem to feel any love from anyone around me since he passed away.  Like all the love in my life died with him.  At times throughout the day I‚Äôm still inconsolable.   He was constantly by my side, it feels like I‚Äôm missing a limb or something.

I think the last really great FF game was 9, so it's been a while for me. Remake was also amazing and a huge surprise, but being midgar only made it obviously more linear type game and not a full scale FF experience, so i still had my doubts about the open world and towns and side content and all that, i wasn't sure square can do it 100%, but they fucking nailed it. A month after i finished the game and still can't stop thinking about it.

Make sure the area is always completely dry . Positioning also has alot to do with how well it holds . Or I will place 2 on one .. lower (below the connection) for the drive line to the control pack.  And one above that connection. I Have actually found that method to be even more comfortable because I don't feel a pull if I do happen to get my drive line. Caught on something or drop my bag with my batteries and pack in . I do not use any of the belts I have extremely sensitive skin . So I use a mini bookbag which has proven to be much much more comfortable and easier on my neck and back (I have a major back injury) also it allows for the position of the drive line to sit in a upward direction given more strength to the anchors .

Street name you are a ""beneficiary"" owner of the security interest only. You are entitled to the right of the security interest. Hence it's called a security entitlement. If the share is owned in street name, you can vote the share by proxy, but if DTC or DTC participant also votes the share because it is still kept in their share pool, they will trim the extra votes sent in by brokerages. 

I believe it's written in the documentation regarding pooled securities. The share is in a pool, they cannot match owner vote to share because they aren't serialized. If a share is voted multiple times they can't discern so they go by whatever the DTC decides as the final vote count after trimming to 100% of the vote.",1714521609.0

No I see that. She‚Äôs arguing the Sixth Amendment, it still seems dicy af in regard to the information.

It‚Äôs possible this team can run it back, but Portland‚Äôs series against the Warriors in 2019 comes to mind where they were up I think at least 17 at the end of each first half and got swept. They told themselves they could run it back and never got anywhere in future years until finally blowing it up and trading Dame. 

Lakers won‚Äôt have the same luxury of time they did either. LeBron is a free agent and almost certainly is going to demand a no-trade clause if he comes back. AD is fragile and every year will get more so. The Nuggets are young, the Thunder are young, the Mavs are youngish, the Kings (who killed the Lakers in the regular season a few times) are young. 

Also this roster lacks cohesion. It has depth in theory but the pieces don‚Äôt line up well with where the depth was actually needed (poor wing depth and literally no center depth so your oldest and most injury prone players had to go big minutes all year). 

Idk if blowing it up is the right decision either. Feels like a few injuries and poor stretches could have changed a lot and the Lakers could easily be the team taking on an injured Clippers team instead of the defending champions. 

My only point is: I don‚Äôt think the answer is obvious in either direction.",1714521609.0

Firstly you could be having too much salt, with your body wanting water to help get rid of it.  So try the opposite advice that's normally given and use less, many people find they don't need to add much electrolytes after being on the diet anyway.

A hack for me is to drink sparkling water only, I don't quite enjoy it as much, but unless I am really thirsty I can't just hammer it down like I can with liters of regular water, and I don't feel thirsty all the time like usual.",1714521610.0

So much so that the Moroccan government had to close the border because people were abusing the fact that we border the EU, which ultimately makes us lose trade which economically effects port cities like Nador and Tangiers. Also Sbta and Melillia are like narco havens because hashish gets produced in Northern Morocco and just thrown over the border like it's nothing. And illegal immigration creates for a huge amount of sub-saharan migrants to come to our cities and waiting for the chance to jump the fence which in many cases leads to hundreds of deaths each year.

I also remember visiting Bani Ensar and that city is a pain in the ass to drive through because Melillia is literally a neighborhood  block away so you have to drive around with military everywhere. Let alone visiting it.",1714521611.0

My local record store owner would always sell me albums as soon as they came in so I had the record for two weeks before official release. I liked the album a lot, but it definitely grew on me as time went on. There were some songs I loved from the start, (To Sheila, Perfect, Shame, Blank Page), but having been a fan of the band since the beginning (liked them during Gish, fell in love during SD), it was a very radical departure from MCIS. Also, it didn't have Jimmy on it, so the whole vibe around the band in general was different. In hindsight, the songs I gravitated most from the start were the more traditional MCIS-esque songs. (I've never been a fan of Ava Adore, even to this day.)

I think when people listen to it now and know that SP is a band that likes to reinvent their sounds album-to-album, they listen to it with different ears. Also, SP was literally on top of the world at the time, and to see bands come out with such a departure following a massive album was unheard of. You then had Radiohead do it with Kid A so they can thank SP for preceding them there! üòâ 

Many die hard SP fans didn't hate the album‚Äîit was more disliked by casual fans. But those of us in Pumpkinland that knew the album was written during one of the most difficult times of Billy's life with Jimmy being kicked out and his mother dying, were able to appreciate the songwriting and beauty which has aged very well over the years.",1714521612.0

Along this journey you will have many questions on how to do certain things and tutorials will help you ask the community the right questions. 

There are lots of routes and methods to learn BE with flutterflow, but starting and finishing a project is the most important for most people's development.

"Bowling","t5_2r3ex","I recently started bowling two handed and I also switched to a four step approach so my game looked fairly similar to yours a few months ago. To help stay under the ball I would suggest you create at least a small amount of elbow bend. I try to feel like I'm creating a basket under the ball and then pulling it up towards my armpit in my backswing. If you're really having trouble staying under the ball then you could try resting the ball on top of your forearm before you begin your approach. You also might try placing the fingertips on your right hand a lot closer to the fingertips on your left hand. Most people don't think that hand is used for anything other than keeping the ball from falling off your bowling hand, but if you experiment with moving that hand around you will see it can change your release. Other than that I would suggest you try foul line drills and only think about staying under the ball. It looks like your left hand is doing good things and the release looks good, but the ball is getting away from you. To fix that I would again suggest foul line drills and just focus on keeping the ball close to your body and your elbow tucked in. You will also probably need to change where you're looking with your eyes and maybe where you're standing as well. If you're looking too far left then you will subconsciously try to release the ball away from your body to throw the ball at an angle that won't go straight into the gutter. If you're standing too far in a certain direction your entire body might drift once you start walking without you even realizing it. Just make sure you're not lining up for or drifting to an impossible angle, and try to make a habit of looking down at the foul line before walking away to see if you're drifting more than usual. I had trouble sliding when I switched to two handed so I planted until my knee forced me to learn. The same thing happened when I originally began bowling one handed. Both times I learned to slide I started by taking the ball out of my hands. I just walked to the line at half the speed I usually bowl at and slid a few times. Then I did the same thing, but swung my arms and tried to simulate my approach without a ball while still not going full speed. After doing that a few times I started speeding my walk and swing up until I got to my regular bowling speed. Then I put a ball in my hands and went back to half speed, before working my way back up to a full speed slide. Make sure you can't just slide, but post up at the foul line as well. When I post a shot I know it's going to be a good one and it's much easier to see what my ball is doing and what board I'm sliding on. I can't give you any advice for a push away because that's the part of my game I'm least satisfied with and I'm currently working on it. I've changed it a few times in the past couple months and haven't found a solution that I'm completely happy with yet. Sorry for the essay length comment but I hope something in there helps.",1714521613.0

As far as bars, just gotta be in a people watching mood. It's interesting to watch people but also incredibly helpful as to why I no longer partake as far as the alcohol aspect.  I did go to a concert a week fresh out of rehab and had to leave before my artist even came on bc I hadn't anticipated 1. Going to treatment 2. Actually staying sober.

"mildlyterrifying","t5_2v7ae","On November 5th, 1983, the Byford Dolphin decompression incident would become one of the most horrific and gruesome accidents to ever take place in saturation diving history.  
That day 5 divers tragically lost their lives when the pressurized chamber they were inside suddenly decompressed from 9 atmospheres to 1 atmosphere.  
This disturbing catastrophe would highlight safety shortcomings in the industries and would ultimately change saturation diving for a better and safer future.

"Money","t5_2qjmw","First, you need to pull your monthly statements, at the start and end of a month or every paycheck or every two pay checks. Sit down, look at what came in, and what went out.

Try to not go out to eat, dont smoke, vape, drugs, gamble, buy little phone gems etc. start with your spending habits, separate wants vs needs, you dont need that gas station energy drink or Starbucks coffee. This includes subscriptions, netflix, hulu, spotify, etc. cancel them until your debt is cleared.

Next, we dont want you out on the streets, food, shelter, electricity/heat, make sure basics are covered, save up your money so you have a minimum of 1 months of expenses covered should something bad happen. This is your emergency fund, touch it only in an emergency, car breaks, lost your job, medical situation.

Then, if you have a 401k, still do the match, but dont go over the match, focus on your debt first.

Buy groceries, and meal prep to save money.

Once your debt is gone, create 6 month emergency fund, then save, invest, add to retirements, and enjoy life.

Also sell stuff you dont need to earn extra profit, old clothes or anything you can, if you can work OT, work it to clear debts faster, if you arent already.

The DCS I brought in this case was a mistake.  If I intended to use a DCS against bugs, it would be for the express purpose of picking off long-range targets and thinning out close range high-threat targets like hunters and, maybe, even stalkers in an area where an arc thrower really struggles (as an example.)  But for such a loadout, I'd want things like an autocannon or flamethrower or grenade launcher as my support weapon.  Something that can rapidly deal with a horde, which the DCS can do at a long range, but not perfectly unless you have pro quake aim.  It proved more valuable at aiding allies at range than at killing enemies right on me.

So in that regard, enemies would swarm me pretty easily with the DCS *exclusively* as well, but I try to bring weapons that back up each other's strengths and weaknesses so that I can deal with most situations decently well.  My builds are optimized for even 4 man play where I'm running off by myself solo, so I tend to not need, E.G., a ton of charger clearing all at once.  Just the ability to deal with a patrol fast enough to not call in reinforcements.  I digress.",1714521615.0

That said, we can make the streets safer. Not all that long ago, people usually stopped at red lights, rather than going right through. Because there was a real likelihood of being caught. So we're going to put in red light cameras, speed cameras, and the police are writing more tickets.

From your shape description, it sounds like you have a decent amount of immediate projection, which combined with short and narrow does indicate Polish brands might work better than UK brands. If you want to try a couple of narrower, projected British bras, you could try Freya Fancies plunge and Cleo Blossom. I suspect Blossom might be too tall, but it is good for FOT and the wires are pretty narrow. Fancies plunge is also pretty narrow. If both of those are too wide and tall, then Polish is probably the way to go.

Think about it like this.

"AntiTaff","t5_4niu99","En parlant d'ali√©nation... un petit pav√© mon ami :)

Le ch√¥mage c'est pas du salaire d√©cal√©... c'est un syst√®me d'assurance dans lequel on accepte de payer une prime (les cotisations) pour se prot√©ger du risque de perte d'emploi. Au passage c'est un syst√®me pour lequel des g√©n√©rations de travailleurs se sont battus.

Comme on est encore dans un pays √† peu pr√®s correct sur le plan social, ce co√ªt est aussi port√© par les employeurs (hors fonctionnaires) via les cotisations patronales qui sont superieures aux n√¥tres. Et c'est pas parce qu'une partie du pot commun est pay√©e par le capital qu'il est moins commun ou qu'on en a moins besoin. Les chiffres de l'emploi sont √©loquents.

On reprend : non tu n'as pas ""boss√© pour √ßa"", ce qui justifierait selon toi de ""profiter"" d'un revenu diff√©r√©. 
Et pour √™tre plus clair : ce n'est pas une question math√©matique mais politique.

M√™me si tu avais math√©matiquement cotis√© le montant exact que tu touches en ch√¥mage entre tes ""p√©riodes de soumission au capital"", cela signifierait juste que tu es neutre en termes de solidarit√© nationale, ni contributeur ni b√©n√©ficiaire.

Perso je ne tirerais pas de fiert√© √† faire financer mes pauses par mes voisins. On parle d'assurance ch√¥mage, pas de taxation du capital.Tu l√®ses Brigitte de l'accueil ou Momo de la compta, pas Bernard Arnault. 

De m√™me, si demain des coups durs font que je passe de contributeur √† b√©n√©ficiaire net (et j'√©largis emploi √† sant√© et retraite car le principe est identique), je n'en tirerais aucune honte : c'est le principe de la r√©partition.


En conclusion :
- tu prends une part de la tirelire collective dont d'autres ont potentiellement besoin (et vu la gueule des finances publiques et des comptes sociaux...)
- tu as un discours/comportement qui cr√©dibilise le MEDEF et les chouineurs sur les assist√©s
- √† terme, tu renforces ainsi le soutien politique pour des mesures antisociales, tout en affaiblissant la position financi√®re de la puissance publique.

A ta petite √©chelle, tu sers donc √† merveille le capitalisme que tu d√©cries. Je suis s√ªr qu'il doit rester un pin's pour toi dans les cartons du Medef.",1714521617.0

I hear Google Sheets has a nice built-in wedding planning template too.

The timeline/task lists should help with determining the order of things, but generally, budget, wedding planner (including the decision to have one or not, or in what capacity), venue, date, location, and guest list/size are the first decision points. 

Followed by high-demand, specialized/specific, and/or important vendors to the couple. For example, photographers tend to be in high demand. If the couple would like floral installations as a wow-factor, perhaps specific florists who specialize in those installations (think flower ceilings, cascading flower walls/table runners, indoor meadows, etc.) would be high up on their list. If the couple would have someone special in mind to officiate (like a childhood minister or something), then asking that person would be higher on their list as well.

There is plenty of drama and complex feelings related to weddings that I'm sure you can pick up just browsing these subreddits (including the weddingdrama and weddingshaming ones).

"MushroomGrowers","t5_37713","I am the r/MushroomGrowers AutoModerator. I'm a little like [Heimdallr, the gate-keeper](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3640969.jpg) for this community. Your recent submission was bounced back by my filter for one of the following reasons:

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

Oh a lot of people supported that huh? Because you saw some high profile cases of it? Even if that's true it's not the kind of people protesting the mass death happening in Gaza. All anti-Israel subs I participate in immediately crack down on actual anti-semitism and have no tolerance for that shit.

>You‚Äôre condemning Destiny and the entirety of DGG from the 1% of what you know about them. So by your logic, since 100% of people haven‚Äôt condemned Hamas, then the entire movement is evil, gross, monsters.

What is this nonsense attempt at quantifying random things? What are these numbers supposed to represent? I've been exposed to you awful people for years, where do you get me ""knowing 1%"" from?

And no, that ""logic"" doesn't even close to follow from what I've said. You people go out of your way to support and parrot an absolute piece of shit human being. That's not the same as some random person NOT going out of their way to condemn every asshole on the planet.

>Instead, you should condemn the statements themselves, not the movement or individuals.

According to who? Why should I or anyone else separate what you people do and say from your character? Seems like you just want to be able to spew hatred and still be seen as the good guys.

>Especially on the internet where all language is hyperbolic and inflammatory.

Oh ALL language is huh? What an absurd statement to so confidently say as if it's a well known and accepted fact.

>Most of DGG fans don‚Äôt claim twitter Destiny anyway.

The way you think the medium of communication exonerates someone from responsibility is peak ""DGG."" You all use this line too. Him saying the N word is apparently fine with you. Him telling everyone to kill themselves is apparently fine with you. Him complaining about slurs and having a community full of people calling everyone ""regarded"" is apparently fine with you.",1714521618.0

I‚Äôm a part of the sign industry. Started in production after going to design school, and after cross training myself over the years, I can take a project from start to finish on my own, which is a pretty rare skill set in the industry even as a business owner.

It might be worth my time, however, to look at what unions over on the East coast are paying people like me, and see if it might be a good move financially. I think the best translation for my skill set would be as an operations manager.

I understand the concept of finding someone earlier, and logistically what you‚Äôre saying makes a lot of sense. In all honesty though, the type of person I could see myself with is hard to find, and people who are willing and able to support themselves alongside you are even harder to pick out. A lot of them talk as though that‚Äôs what they want to do, and then they quit their jobs and leave you to struggle with what was supposed to be a dual income rent situation.

I also want to reach my plateau before I add on the struggle of maintaining a relationship. My logic is that once I‚Äôve spent some time as an independent contractor and get some experience under my belt on the administrative and social portions of it, I‚Äôll have a lot more bandwidth that I can allocate to being close with someone.

"PhotoshopRequest","t5_2u2ui","Hello u/AskAbi, thanks for posting on /r/PhotoshopRequest! Please note:

- Do not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Do you have permanent resident status, that is are you and your parents ""green card holders""?  Have they naturalized as US citizens?  You cannot obtain permanent resident status as a minor unless at least one of your parents has it *and* they petition for you to receive it because you are their child.  You cannot gain citizenship as a minor unless at least one of your parents has been naturalized.  

If you're not a green card holder or a naturalized citizen, you will need to find out what's needed for you to stay in the US when your parents move back to Greece.  Will you need a student visa?  Will you be able to have a work visa/permit?  

Honestly, you need to start working through what you will need to stay in the US.  It's a wonderful idea, but it isn't just, ""I don't want to move to Greece, so I'll stay in the US."" 

If you are a green card holder or naturalized citizen, you won't have a problem with legal status, but you will obviously need to support yourself.  If you're going to college (I assume that's your plan), you need to start applying for every bit of financial aid, scholarships, and grants for which you might qualify.  You need to make your applications to universities where you have a good chance of both being accepted and receiving financial aid.  If your parents do not intend to pay for college in the US, you need to go through the process of being declared an ""independent"" student under the FAFSA requirements.  There's more, but I hope this helps you see things in black and white, so to speak.

If you are not a permanent resident or naturalized citizen, you must be employed and show you can support yourself.  If you need a student visa, you'll need to start that process now.  You'll may need an immigration advisor or lawyer to help you through the process.

I'm not trying to discourage you at all, but trying to make sure you know that it's more than, ""I'll get a job this summer.""  Start planning now so that you have no unpleasant surprises later and so that the transition to adulthood is as smooth as it can be.  Best of luck and NTA for not wanting to move to Greece.",1714521619.0

I also like like some of the older Blackmagic devices that do analog capture and output. I think the cheap analog capture devices are pretty crap but they might be good enough depending on exactly what you're trying to to do. 

But most people these days will use an analog to HDMI converter and whatever HDMI capture device (unlike the analog capture devices, the quality of them is all basically the same).  The converters are again all over the place in terms of quality.

"nikiandgabidemartino","t5_68y8w2","The way she desperately dragged out the answer to ‚Äúdo you and Ariana still talk?‚Äù Spoiler alert. They don‚Äôt and they haven‚Äôt since the TUN era. FIVE YEARS AGO. 

And to insinuate that they ever seriously ‚Äútalked‚Äù is a gross misinterpretation of events and another lie to add to Gabi‚Äôs never ending tally. 

Ariana reached out to Gabi for the sole purpose of putting her in the TUN video. You know, the one where she made fun of Gabi‚Äôs psycho antics in front of nearly a billion people? And when Gabi managed to somehow weasel her way backstage at the TUN tour, Ariana hadn‚Äôt so much as looked at the Burberry coat Gabi bought her before she had regifted it LOL. 

Gabi has always been a shit person, but I realized she was utterly pathological after the ‚Äúmy greatest fear is Ariana catching wind of [the CP scandal]‚Äù

To believe that Ariana has any type of investment in you and what you do Gabi, is laughably pathetic. She may have been polite to you on the 3 occasions you‚Äôve talked, but her actions clearly show she doesn‚Äôt like you. And even that‚Äôs stretching it, because saying she doesn‚Äôt like you, insinuates she cares enough to have spent time thinking about you. Everything that Ariana Grande has learned about Gabiana has been against her will lol",1714521620.0

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","This is crazy but I‚Äôll give it one last try. Sickle cell anemia, which is terrible, I‚Äôm truly sorry is not a mutation, it is a single nucleotide replacement which is why gene therapy can fix it. I wasn‚Äôt saying gene therapy is a reason to disregard genetic traits, especially the recessive variety we are referring to. But those traits are present in the general public. Lots of people not related to you have SCA, you could fuck a total stranger and end up with SCA. Yes it‚Äôs true that your family reproducing together yields higher probability for SCA to be present in their offspring, but to triple make my point, that‚Äôs true of anybody that reproduces with recessive SCA gene. 

What the speaker is commenting on is the largely held belief that siblings reproducing will lead to three arms, or one eye, or the blue mountain people that have tangibly blue skin because of hypoxia present in their family lineage. But that‚Äôs the key, it has to be a mutation that occurs somewhere in a families gene timeline and then the breeding population has to be reduced down dramatically as is common in communities that have inbreeding. Then you would see progressively more of the mutated gene show up as time went by because everyone breeding has it‚Ä¶but only them, not the rest of the world. And I mean that quite literally. For the Jewish population that I pointed out the genetic abnormalities got to a point that there was a log established of who was in the affected population so they wouldn‚Äôt breed together. 

This is all true in any kind of population you want to model. Mammals, reptiles, sea creatures, mold. It‚Äôs all the same.

"nvidia","t5_2rlgy","Fair enough. This was my first PC as well. It ultimately depends on how you are wanting to play. You have a pretty powerful processor so you should be able to play at 2K or 4K with ease. The 4070 Super excels at 2K and even entry level 4K gaming and is widely considered the best bang for your buck card of the generation, and the 4090 is a flagship Graphics card that excels in 4K at max settings. The only downside is that the 4090 is three times more expensive and only about %70 faster. I‚Äôd honestly look and see if you can pick up a used 4080 if you are really wanting to game at 4K and save a bit of money. My prebuilt came with a 4060TI, which I then upgraded to a 4070 Super. However, I found a used 4080 on marketplace a few months ago for $850 and jumped on it immediately. The card retails for about $1250. However, whatever card you end up getting will still be viable for a while, and the performance jump between the 40 series to the 50 series isn‚Äôt yet known. The general rule of thumb is to wait 2 generations before getting a new GPU. It also depends on how much you value ray tracing. Both of them are good at it, but the 4090 excels in this department. If you got a 4070 Super you would probably be able to sell it for around $400-450 once the 50 series comes out, and could probably get around $12-1400 for a 4090. Ultimately, if you want 4K gaming, go for the 4090, but I‚Äôd strongly consider skipping the next generation of cards or at least wait for the prices to go down. If you want to game at 2K and have more money to throw towards a 5090 in the future, get the 4070 Super.",1714521621.0

I've been trying to do this for a while now, just cooking more and ordering trash takeout less. I honestly thought it would save me more money than it has, but it's still worth it to work on my cooking skills and just being a useful adult skills. I have made this change a time where the cost of food is just climbing and climbing, so I think if I was still ordering takeout twice a week (I know, it was a lot of takeout), my cost of living would have gone up a lot, and I'm comparing it to what it would have cost a year earlier.",1714521621.0

Yep, they said that he was really intimidating.

He'd also steal stuff from the set. Jason Alexander or Jerry was telling a story about how he took a kitchen knife from the set. And could see him doing it; he'd be trying to conceal it, with the blade up his sleeve and the handle in his hand. When Jerry called him out on it, he apparently drew it on him.

My husband is an electrician and says he's going to run power out there in the meantime I've been looking into heater and ac units, wish I knew more, think I found one that would do what I need. 

I built staging benches in there that collapse. So when the tomatoes get tall I can take out the bottom shelf and fold it up then put the tomatoes and/or other tall plants back on. I live in zone 6b in the mountains my last frost date is June 26th and first frost date is September 1st so not much is going just yet. I have 5 trays of seeds and seedlings right now. I'm still bringing them inside at night until we can get some sort of heating out there. I was going to do an extension cord but the longest I have is about 5' too short. 

For the base of the greenhouse we did 4 foot deep holes, filled with concrete and 12"" j hook/bolt anchors so unfortunately i wouldn't be able to get bricks under it but I think I need to get more dirt around the outside, it settled a bit, then maybe rocks or bricks? Again its my first year having a greenhouse, we put it up in October right before the snow so now I've been ""setting it up""",1714521621.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8",">So based off that, again, I don‚Äôt see why all of a sudden we‚Äôre nitpicking Israel‚Äôs acts of genocide

I think what I said completely didn't connect because of either how I said it or a misunderstanding. I'm saying that 7 people dying, isn't a genocide. Its a horrible metric set. If that's genocide then America is commiting genocide on itself every day to every minority and even non minorities. 

>And therein lies the crux of my wider point: in the pursuit of shielding and defending Israel from genocide claims, the West‚Äôs (EU/USA) credibility is irreparably harmed. We are now *redefining* what was previously classified as genocide in order to shield and defend Israel. We‚Äôre denigrating the word and muddying the water around the act, devaluing it, to defend and shield Israel. 

And I'm not disagreeing that the west's is not credible. From you telling me the west defined the death of 7 people genocide I can tell you the west isn't credible. So we agree the west isn't credible. Can we debate the substance of the issue instead of what the US and UK believes? I day this because I'm not sure where you live, but I disagree with my country on a whole lot of what they do, so citing them making a bad conclusion isn't really debating the substance of the issue that matters.",1714521622.0

No, you are wrong. I believe the Bible because it is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses. They report to us supernatural and specific events that took place in fulfillment of specific prophecies and claimed that their writings are divine rather than human origin.

*‚ÄùFor we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father honor and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: ‚ÄúThis is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.‚Äù And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain. And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit.‚Äú 
2 Peter 1:16-21*

To think that those who wrote the words into the Bible, the prophets, two kings, Moses, martyrs/apostles, one queen, a physician, a tax collector, and many more... were illiterate...? ...when they simultaneously ""wrote""... the Bible. Do you read the things that you say before you say them?

But you believe the Gallic Wars happened which was written about 900 years after it happened, and Aristotle which was written over 1400 years after it happened (oh, and these, *so* educated when he believed in a geocentric solar system... but when it comes to the Bible which has oldest manuscripts within decades of the event (all written before 70 AD when the temple was destroyed)... ü§î Something isn't adding up...

Again, you *think* that you are describing me, but you fail to even describe your points, and you cannot even articulate your contentions well because you hate theology, but you also don't know theology. It's like saying that you do not like banans, but you've never eaten one.

To be your own god is exactly what it says. It means that you worship yourself. That's why you are getting so angry when your worldview is being challenged. Again, house of cards. It just takes a little wind üí®to knock it over... a little spark üî• to burn it down.",1714521622.0

"space","t5_2qh87","Astronomer here!  Neat result!

So to be clear- this type of object and technique are not new.  Specifically, a [rogue planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_planet) is one that is not orbiting a star, and was presumably ejected from the system in some cases, though some could possibly form without a star present.  As you can imagine, we expect a lot of those out there- some suggest as many as planets that orbit normal stars!- but they're darn hard to detect due to the fact that planets only reflect light over shining like stars.  They also don't have a huge amount of gravitational pull on their surroundings.

Enter [gravitational microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing)!  Similar to its more famous cousin, gravitational lensing, microlensing relies on the fact that light bends a tiny amount in the presence of a gravitational field (this is, in fact, how Einstein's relativity was tested- by looking at the tiny shift in the locations of stars around the sun during a total solar eclipse due to the sun's gravitational well).  I think it's a very powerful way to learn a lot you wouldn't, but the technique has limitations- first of all, it's really pretty hard to do, and second, it relies upon the precise alignment of a foreground object (like a rogue planet) and a background object (like a star) to work.

Enter this discovery!  [TESS](https://tess.mit.edu/) is a planet-finding mission in space, which to date has found many hundreds of confirmed exoplanets (and thousands more candidate signals).  This rogue planet would be a couple times the size of Earth, 6,500 light years away.  Unfortunately, that's about all we're ever gonna know about this world- in practice the precise alignment required for microlensing to work also means you can then never actually follow-up on the object you observed.  Think of it this way- a rogue planet happens to produce a microlensing signal to the correct alignment with a background object's light, the rogue planet will keep wandering its merry way and you'll never see it again.  

While that's a little disappointing, it doesn't stop TESS from hopefully telling us more about the *population* of rogue planets out there, and hopefully even getting a rough estimate on the number of them out there (where frankly we don't have a good range yet).  So that'll be a great result to have- stay tuned!",1714521622.0

"PhotoshopRequest","t5_2u2ui","Hello u/bracie44, thanks for posting on /r/PhotoshopRequest! Please note:

- Do not work with anyone who did not comment publicly on your request. If anyone contacts you privately about your request, simply ignore them. If you have a request for which you do not want to post the image(s) to be edited publicly, please provide as much detail as possible about the request and ask that interested editors reply to your post. From there, you can vet the editors who reply by viewing their comment histories and reach out privately to whomever you'd like to work with. Again, **do not respond to any direct private messages about your request.**

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

There‚Äôs sports media avenues out there but they have their biases towards or against certain teams (smaller markets get less coverage as is the case in men‚Äôs sport) and have their own issues, eg JWS. 

A good storyline to watch this season is the return of Christen Press. She tore her ACL in June 2022 and has been out injured since then due to a longer recovery however she‚Äôs back with the team full time and they just made roster space for her so fingers crossed her return to the pitch will be soon. She was our best player so losing a player of that importance to our team was a huge loss, getting her back will be an amazing feel good story.",1714521623.0

She lives with me, I work remotely, and I don't have children or a partner, so my situation is different.  I hired a caregiver for 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday. During this time, I leave my department. I try to work in a coffeeshop, handle her administrative stuff, and go to the supermarket.   
  
However, I don't think this is the right scheme (and it wouldn't be for you as you have a spouse and baby on the way). In the next few months, I will probably hire caregivers 12 or 24 hours per day so I can have more freedom. In my country, this is cheaper than AL or NH - I do think the USA has more resources, and probably someone in this sub can guide you better.

‚Äú70 percent of respondents said Israel should move forward with the operation in Rafah, including 57 percent of those 18 to 24 and increasing percentages with each older age group. ‚Äú

‚ÄúThe poll found 61 percent of respondents support a cease-fire only after the hostages are released and Hamas is out of power, while 39 percent support an unconditional cease-fire.‚Äù

No sign at all that this is supported by the majority of the base.

"verizon","t5_2raz5","Lets break it down for you.

Early Upgrade and Trade-in are two different programs

With the iPhone Early Upgrade program, you have to first make 50% of device payments, or reach 18 months.  Once you do this, you go online and request to do an Early Upgrade.  You'll go through the check out process, and agree to a new DPP for a new phone.  You also won't be eligible for any new promotions(unless you have a VerizonUP offer.). You also forfiet your previous monthly credits, if applicable.

You then send the previous phone back to Verizon, after inspection, they cancel the previous DPP, and you go on your merry way with your new DPP.  According to Verizon the Phone has to be in Good Working Condition(in their opinion.). And you only have 30 days to send it back.

The device payments can either be via Verizon monthly credits, you making the payments, OR making a bigger payment to get the 50% quicker.

Terms here: [https://www.verizon.com/support/upgrade-program-legal/](https://www.verizon.com/support/upgrade-program-legal/)

Trade-IN is a different beast.  You have to pay off the full amount of the device, and it can be used with any trade-in promotions going on.",1714521624.0

People get stuck before that point though, they refuse to entertain anything other than the official story, stick their fingers in their ears and sing lalalalala.

I mean there is a _wealth_ of information on 9/11 that makes it obvious _something_ other than the official narrative happened, but people won't even begin to listen.

While the car is off, you should be able to spin that clutch wheel quite easily, if you can't, compressor is seized and needs to be replaced.

While car is on and the AC on, you should see that clutch engage and spin with the pulley, if it's not seized and doesn't spin you can try adding more freon with dye in it to check if it's just low or if you have a hole in the system (you'll see bubbling and the colored freon hissing out somewhere).

If all that checks out, then it's probably the magnet in the compressor which can be changed out without taking the compressor out usually, maybe not in this tight an engine bay, but if you can, then you don't need to replace freon, but easier to just replace the compressor if that's the case but it's more expensive + you need freon.",1714521626.0

"theydidthemath","t5_2x23b","A 60¬∞ slice is 1/6 of a circle. A 45¬∞ slice is 1/8 of a circle.

Area of circle is pi*r^2.

Slice 1 therefore has an area of (36*pi)/6, 6 pi.

Slice 2 by the same token has an area of (49*pi)/8, which is 6.125 pi (say: six and one-eighths pi)

The pi cancels out, so the ratio of the size of the second slice to the first is 6.125/6, which is 1.020833333 (say: one and one forty-eighth. 6 and one eighth divided by six are 1 and 1/48. The 6s cancel and the 1/8 gets divided by 6 to make 1/48.) In other words, the second slice is 1/48th bigger than the first slice, or roughly 2%.(very slightly more than 2%)

The ratio of the price of the second slice to the first is 1.70 / 1.5 is 1.133(repeating 3). In other words, the second slice is slightly more than 13.3% more expensive than the first. (The verbal fraction for the ratio is left as an exercise for the reader)

"NASCAR","t5_2qs08","This isn't just an embarrassment for Trackhouse and Kaulig, this is an embarrassment for the whole NASCAR industry as well. An actual race winner, locked into the main event, just needs a car and can't find one? 

And it isn't like Shane has been one and done. The plan is to have him running in Cup in the next year or two. This guy is going to be full time. 

I dunno, I just feel like between NASCAR, Trackhouse and Kaulig someone could make a phone call to a Brendan Gaughan to get South Point on the hood and to Beard or BJ to put a car on track.

"fragranceclones","t5_28jabm","I have all 3 and bought them blindly from YouTube recommendations. 

For me, 9PM and Maahir Legacy are both great purchases. Vintage Radio was just not my thing.

9PM is sweet and just smooth as hell. If you have ever smelled Ultra Male by JPG, it's just as good, some say 9PM is better. Either way, it's sweet and I just want to keep smelling it. Maahir Legacy smells exactly how you might expect from the note breakdown, minty and bright lime citrus with a little pepper. It's a clone of Sedley by PDM, though I've never smelled that. It's just super fresh and uplifting but still has a manly vibe. Vintage Radio for me smells almost like I'd like it but it has this buttery or powdery note to it that is off-putting to me. Still, it smells sweet with that plum and has many good qualities. I could see why many others hype it up (they likely enjoy that ""buttery"" quality) Wish I did too, but I don't at the moment.",1714521626.0

Humans, as a whole, have an innate need to belong; we are social animals and it's a rare one who could live in total isolation or ostracization from society.  That doesn't mean humans can't think for themselves.  Anyone can fall prey to cult thinking, and in any cult or religion intelligent members will be found.  That these people grew up in a culture and religion that didn't promote critical thinking made them more susceptible to accepting these ideas is true - from what I've seen, their beliefs weren't a huge step from mainstream LDS thinking - but the same isn't true of anyone who falls in with a cult or follows a religion.",1714521626.0

That‚Äôs the only reason I don‚Äôt work full time. So I‚Äôm still working while he is working, my hours are just unpaid. And, yes that is work- getting them ready and out the door in the morning and getting them to school, picking them up from school, managing homework and school responsibilities, prepping dinner, getting them ready and out the door for sports, etc. So if we‚Äôre using the same breakdown of responsibilities, husband should do 37.5% of the    domestic responsibilities, while I do 67.5%. I do at least 90%. I‚Äôm still cooking, cleaning, and doing laundry while he‚Äôs home watching TV or playing on his computer. His day ends when he walks in the door at 5pm. My day keeps going. On the weekends I‚Äôm folding laundry and cleaning the house while he‚Äôs working on hobbies in the basement. Again, I‚Äôm not asking if I‚Äôm overreacting about the difference in domestic labor.

"FIRE_Ind","t5_a4z2h7","Congrats on staying so early. I wish I'd started at your age. First off, you're doing well... You will make mistakes, but don't worry. Correct then and keep going. 

Learn more about investing. Freefincal is a great YouTube channel and website to get a basic understanding and grinding in how to proceed. 

First, get the basics done. 
1. Have health insurance not having it can make you lose your savings and investments. 
2. Have term insurance if you have dependants (not needed if no dependents). 
3. Probably the most important - set up an emergency fund that equals at least 6 months of your total monthly expenses (take annual expenses including EMIs, insurance, all subscriptions, fees etc., and divide by 12). Keep this in a separate account, and not in your regular use account. 

Next:
1. Invest in an index fund and a debt fund for now. 
2. Learn about asset allocation, and rebalancing 
3. Figure out your ideal retirement corpus goal 
4. Figure out how to increase your income, and investments. 
5. Figure out how to live with minimal expense, not taking loans or using credit. Don't let this mean that you lose out on life experiences... Enjoy yourself, but do it based on your income and budget savings intended for planned stuff, like monthly fun things, annual trips etc ie: live within your means, ensuring that your payment towards your investments and emergency fund comes first (you may not be able to do this initially). 


Broadly, every month of expenses you put aside now, pays for one month of expenses in retired life. The investment growth will help you to defeat inflation, and grow a little, but remember this as a broad guideline. If you spend 20k a month and invest 10k a month, you're paying for half a month of expenses at your current expense rate. 

I know that this is a large dump in a small space, so don't worry if some of it doesn't apply right now. Keep learning, and all the best.",1714521627.0

1. Never share your [Secret Recovery Phrase](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060826432-What-is-a-Secret-Recovery-Phrase-and-how-to-keep-your-crypto-wallet-secure) with any site or a person. MetaMask does not use Gmail or web forms. Do not enter your Secret Recover Phrase into a pop-up window, even if it looks like  MetaMask. Verify links are legitimate. Scammers often use these tactics.

2. Beware of fake websites. The official website for MetaMask is https://metamask.io/ 

3. MetaMask Support will never DM you. This is a common tactic scammers use to try and get access to your wallet.

4. If you need to reach Support: open MetaMask, then menu > Support. The ‚ÄòStart a Conversation‚Äô button will start a chat, the bot asks a few questions to help route you to the correct team. You can also visit the Support site from the web:   https://Support.MetaMask.io 

5. Do not click on suspicious links or files. This can lead to your device security being compromised. 

6. Do not ‚Äúsync‚Äù or ‚Äúvalidate‚Äù your wallet with any websites or forms. This is a scam. Never sync and share: QR Codes, Secret Recovery Phrase, private key, etc.  

7. Never call phone numbers, text Whatsapp numbers, DM on Discord, use WeChat or do video chat with people on this subreddit. MetaMask does not offer customer support in this manner. There is NO exclusive MetaMask Discord.

8. We don‚Äôt ask for an email address to create a wallet. We can‚Äôt email you. We will never ask you to verify or upgrade/merge your wallet.  https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6286050620955-Will-MetaMask-ever-ask-me-to-verify-my-account-

9. .MetaMask currently has no plans for an airdrop, regardless of any information you may have seen elsewhere. If you encounter anyone explaining the best method to maximize the size of a MetaMask-related ‚Äòairdrop‚Äô you might receive, they‚Äôre lying. In particular, be wary of scams (aimed at getting your Secret Recovery Phrase) that weaponize this topic.

"libraryofruina","t5_v25s4","well, every floor has some cheese strategy of different absurd levels, by applying this in accordance to the meccanics of the fight you will have a much easier time

MALKUTH: happy memories is the goat of this floor, on yujin with 3x fervent emotions, 3x clone, and page draw. also xiao is good since burn. display of affection, gluttony, vines if you have a pierce character, and either loyalty or barrier of thorns

YESOD: strongest floor in the game. you start with repetitive pattern recognition and 1 out of metal ringing and request, clean, chained wrath and dark flames on anyohe with lot's of blunt dice, the strongest and myo's prowesse will MELT EVERYTHING and give you unlimited light and it's just desgusting. purple tear expecially so

HOD: look of the day is a free +2 if you are carefull, then just spam bleed with obsession, debuffs with cocoon (using dice with lower result ranges like frontal assoult's 1-2 dice will have higher chance to trigger, also funny prank helps), allertness, and goey waste make shure that the enemies are to debuffed to do anything as they die of blead out

NETZACH: approach this floor as a game of endurance. laughing powder and flower petals help your sustain a lot and once you get to spring genesis, you litterally insta win, as long as you have resources to hit 4 times in 1 turn and to recover the stagger. once you get spring genesis just focus down the guy with the petals and stop caring about your other 4 nuggets

TIPHRET: you can go for the NIX endgame, but it's frustrating AF, you get udjats and rynos with subpar block pages and maybe even ""opportunity spotted"" and just play the waiting game, you should make shure that the turn after you get greed your main guy is at emotion 4 or 5 and that EVERYONE dies that turn, that way you get wrath and nix same turn and don't have to deal with wrath's side effect (use blind rage)  
otherwise you just kinda go for the strongest stuff you can, block stance purple tear can emulate blockma strategy

GEBURA: there are 3 things you can do with her, go ""solo"" with mountain of corpses, rememberance, lone fixer and stuff (use myo's prowesse on her) and abuse the extra counter dice power and mad healing/stagger damage immunity (if you feel crazy goodbye makes both greater splits into nukes) and power stacking when taking damage with vengence and rusted welts   
go just for strong pages on a full comp  
or, equip purple tear piercing stance on gebura, get heath hauler (when you will get it, you don't have it yet) bloodfiend and after getting claws of savagery use every turn 1 copy of ""now die"" which will trigger claws of savagery and make you invincible if you can keep up with the light/health regen

CHESED: get a guy with one limbilion page draw, (the thumb and liu page draw with a counter dice are very good for this), and give him timber, a warm heart, gleaning/cardiae/rake/torn off wisdom, POWER OF THE PAST and magic trick. you get +6-8 on every dice and every card is free  
otherwise go for the power of friendship strats with courage, false present etc..

BINAH: go for the beast combo +1 card of your choosing, binah herself is pretty weak but giving her this makes her strong enough, otherwise having a good clasher with this will make them monstruous (expecially with punishing beak if you can avoid damage)   
you tecnically could go for 1 page each and guardians of the forest, or intruder when there is a single boss, but it doesn't mean that you should

HOKMA: walter is actually one of the best for this floor (defence purple tear is the best ofc), which is funny af. just stack ALL of the defensive power on one guy and then bloody wing+attention and focus and the rest kinda up to you. you could give just 1 guy the blockma strats, but noone seems to do so and giving everyone combat preparation makes this very funny

KETER: you won't be using it much, but lies+curiosity remove the need for resources mostly, expecially on a page you will soon find that has low cost pages who's cost cannot be changed, pulsation and urging are similarly good, sword of frost, guilt and either leer or a kiss, blizzard only in very specific situations",1714521628.0

I got the feeling that my car was really ""trying its best."" It always wanted to get me there. And it just so happens that it finally died at a time when I don't really need a car anyway. So, I consider it's term of service complete! That's why I'm not as bummed as I could be. When it broke down this last time, I had JUST driven to New Orleans and back. It could have stranded me anywhere between BR and NOLA, but it held on until just 2 miles from my house.

I also drove this car to California and back just two summers ago! It had about 230k back then if I recall.

Now I'm the guy my buddies call when something is wrong with their car. I kept most of my tools in the backseat in case I broke down somewhere, and it's saved me! Once the battery cable clamp came loose and I slapped a vise grip on it and drove like that for a couple weeks. I really impressed my buddies at the coffee shop haha!

Graduate school, I took a biomedical engineering class with a focus on genetics and materials that I was the profs top student. Everyone else was a bio major. I was walking across the campus with the prof and TA after lecture one day and asked them a simple question about chromosomes and they responded, ""Oh, you REALLY don't know about biology?!""

When I was in the navy was this guy in my unit who I used to horse play with. He and I actually became really close friends. I mean I‚Äôve never had a friendship like this. We hung out all the time during work and after work. We were always around each other. It felt like being in a relationship with a guy without it being gay. We‚Äôd play nut tap, wrestle, etc. it was always friendly and in good spirit.

one day we were wrestling and I had him mounted and I felt him get hard. He quit trying to get out and just looked at me. We locked eyes for a little bit and I leaned in to kiss him but I‚Äôm assuming he got nervous and played it off. Like he said ‚Äúewww you were gonna kiss me? What are you gay?‚Äù A few weeks later we were at a party off base and we were on the balcony while everyone else was inside. We were both leaning on the railing and then he acts like he‚Äôs going inside but then puts his arms around me from behind and embraces me. He puts his face in my neck and slides his hand down my crotch and grabs my junk. He says I wanted you to kiss me. We both heard people coming and he plays it off again. 

Fast forward he came down on order to go somewhere else and on his last night on base he had a little get together with a few  of the guys. When I got him alone at one point I confessed how I felt about him. I asked him if there was a way he could turn down orders and stay. He didn‚Äôt say anything. He just kissed me. It was the most intimate intense kiss I have ever had. I had never and have never experienced anything like that with anyone as I did with him and that kiss that night. He left the next morning. We kept in touch over the years. He ended up marrying a woman then getting divorced. Mentally he was in a bad place for many years but eventually got back on his feet and is doing well. He is the only man, he‚Äôll the only person that I would drop everything for if he called me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready‚Äù I would give up everything for him. But he is very closeted. I truly believe we could have had a beautiful life together. I have never gotten over him and now I just do hookups so that I feel wanted or needed but I have no desire to be in a relationship with anyone because they will never be him.

VR has been ""coming soon"" ever since the early 1980's.

*ANYTHING* can happen if the Singularity happens. A full blown Matrix, which is what you really mean by FDVR, would be like addicting your entire work force to a drug that makes them completely passive. That's great if you don't need a work force anymore, because AGI is handling everything. Otherwise it would cause total collapse.

TLDR:  CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT


Is it not acceptable to discuss two points he made..?..

-He characterizes the state‚Äôs actions as ‚Äútaking away your ability to reproductive health‚Äù :: VALID

-He then goes on to say ‚Äúthe onus is one you. If you are sexually active and do not want to get pregnant, you need to be sure you are taking steps‚Ä¶‚Äù and goes on the list some easily accessible steps for pregnancy prevention.

Exactly. That would be taking charge of your reproductive health. Surprisingly, he didn‚Äôt even mention condoms which also protect against STDs. HEALTH.

I absolutely understand the issue. I absolutely do NOT support this state‚Äôs, or other state‚Äôs, laws surrounding women‚Äôs health.

I am NOT ‚Äúschilling‚Äù for TX. I am trying to get past the rhetoric.

The Surpreme Court did NOT ‚Äúassault women‚Äôs reproductive rights‚Äù. It unfortunately accepted a case that was PRESENTED TO THEM and they did the same thing that RvW did: legislated from the bench. Please understand that. We were told 60 years ago RvW was NOT enough. It‚Äôs an unnerving reality that this SC did nothing any more nefarious than the SC in RvW. They just arrived at the opposite decision, and at the time, there was a strong contingent that believed their decision was detrimental.

WE failed women. We LET politicians use Abortion Rights as a talking point over and over and WE never held them ACCOUNTABLE for not doing anything more than TALK.

This physician goes on to talk about voting. DAMN RIGHT.

‚Ä¶but we MUST remember who we voted for this election that then FAILS US. Period.

It is NOT a talking point. It should never have been just a platform.

Constitutional Amendment. Period. If the individual you support isn‚Äôt pushing for that, they need to GTFO. Period.

That what it was ALWAYS going to take. That is ABSOLUTELY where we are at now. We just learned that the hard way by the SC decision.

Amendment. Nothing less. Vote them in, but then f#cking vote them right the h#ll out if they fail, and let them KNOW WHY.",1714521631.0

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","I think the term is properly applied when the NOC takes on a level of agency and importance in the party that is similar to or greater than that if one of the player characters.

Like, a useful NPC hireling isn't a DMPC. An NPC the party rescued who has some important information or a MacGuffin or whatever but doesn't overshadow the player characters also isn't a DMPC.

It's a DMPC when the DM plays the NPC like a player character, but with access to the knowledge and authority you have as a DM. They stop acting like NPCs with their own goals who merely intersect with the player characters, and instead the PCs exist to help the DM's shitty self-insert in his self-actualization journey, or they provide validation for how ""cool"" the DM's OC is.

It's a bizarre phenomenon. Someone who wants to make a cool character can just play the game. Or they can make a lot of interesting NPCs.

I mean there's ones online but I don't think they're ""real"". I'd probably score pretty low because I don't understand basic math and science. I love science but I don't ""get it"". Reading and history I'd probably score pretty high...so long as they didn't score on spelling or punctuation/grammar lol I suck at that stuff.

So I might end up around...idk 100? Is that low? Or is that average? Heck I might even score lower then that.

I've never considered myself smart...at all. I'm as dumb as a bag of bricks. Which goes against the usual stereotype of Aspergers lol.

I dropped out of high school because I was already being held back a year and it was getting too hard for me. So I never finished and idk if I can get my GED because I'm so dumb...plus tests...ugh...I freeze up on tests.

I could never manage college I know that. idk if I can manage a job even...never worked. I'm 33 now, and I got diagnosed at...21? and was able to get disability so that's what I live off of...plus a LOT of support from my parents.

There's a ""school"" for people with Autism (both low and high and people inbetween...where I feel I am inbetween lol) about an hour or so away from where I live. I'm hoping to get these ""hours"" through DSHS to apply to the school so I can go to the classes. They teach a lot of life skills there and I really want to learn these so I can be able to manage life on my own...somewhat...when the time comes for my parents to...you know. I hate talking/thinking about it because I instantly get upset so...moving on...

There's a lot of things I need to learn. I just hope my brain can actually function enough to where I really do learn these skills. I'm also extremely forgetful so there's a worry there that I will forget a lot...

Maybe eventually I could try to take the GED...and get a job...but right now I'm trying to focus on life skills.",1714521631.0

Sort of like going from the pretty secretary who gazes adoringly at the hero and marries him at the end, to the hot secretary who offers to have sex with the hero but doesn't expect marriage.

1st is personal preference. I understand that for most of people cryptic lore isn't a benefit, but I like it. 

2nd is a good point, but on other hand there is always a dilemma - use compass or another notch during exploration. 

3rd yeah, but it also provides challange for people who want it and it allows player to avoid it all for basic ending 

4th and 5th. Most of charms are useful. All spells are useful. Nail arts are optional, but can be a handy tool sometimes and using them feels cooler, in right hands they can give advantage in some fights. 

Suggestuons... Well, thank God you are not team cherry... 

Man those ""make a difficulty selection"" advises are controversial. Especially considering that depending on ending difficulty changes drastically.

What even 2nd suggestion is. How is it supposed to be implemented. It will punish exploration and basically goes against your first suggestion to make easier mode.

3rd suggestion is just stupid. The game is very open. Also am I only one who think that making physical obstacles preventing entering the area wich can be skipped by a good player and more complex attacks which make you use your arsenal more versatile is significantly better design than ""no you aren't supposed to be there, we multiplied health of everything there to make you suffer and seek for attack upgrades which will lead to power creep""

4th maybe. But you already said that you didn't used half of given spells, nail arts and charms. Which honestly a good take, especially for arts, but other things are used a lot by different players and all spells are handy for end game challenges.

5th  a) you just want a bigger game b) I bet you haven't found all secrets anyway.",1714521632.0

However, I will also say that I personally did not care what middle name my son had (who uses middle names anyway. Plus, I don't even have one). We decided on the 1st name together, which was the ONLY name that both of us liked. He picked a middle name that fit well with the 1st name (and was also a last name of some cult-movie star that he liked). When the baby was born, though, he filled out the birth certificate and then immediately changed his mind on the middle name and wanted to use his father's name instead (his father was terminally ill at the time). So, I said ""Yeah, go ahead and change it"". However, instead of changing it, he just SQUEEZED his father's name in between the 1st and middle name, giving our son two middle names, which also happens to be the name of a famous Confederate (and we were not from the South, but lived there, and definitely did NOT want our baby named that). I did not know until i got some paperwork later in the mail. I meant to change it, but never did. We never used that 2nd part of the middle name.

In order to break this cycle, we must first understand that actions of a group do not necessarily apply to individuals. Our minds are at odds with us, because we naturally categorize the things and people we meet. It makes our realities much easier to navigate if we attribute basic understanding.

By understanding how your mind works, you should therefore limit the amount of natural prejudices you have. I‚Äôm not saying you should completely let your guard down on all situations, but at least realize the cognitive complexity in situations.

The one good thing is that now you and your doctors know about this mutation so you can take preventative measures.

It can definitely all feel overwhelming, though, when you first find out. Have you talked to a genetic counselor? They can help point you in the right direction in terms of doctors/specialists and screenings! 

This is for the USA (for males):

For prostate cancer, you‚Äôll want to get exams (at least the PSA blood test) annually, rather than every other year which is what most men in America currently do. You can start that at 40 years old. 

For male breast cancer, ask your doctor (or Google) how to do self breast exams to check for lumps/abnormalities. You can also ask your doctor about possibly getting mammograms at age 50 (or 10 years before the earliest diagnosis of male breast cancer in the family, if applicable). 

For melanoma, make sure you‚Äôre seeing a dermatologist every year for skin exams. 

For pancreatic cancer, IF you have a family history (if no family history, you don‚Äôt have to do any screenings for this), they can do annual MRIs or annual upper endoscopies starting at age 50.",1714521635.0

I have a lot of respect for people working in these environments. Please know that most see how swamped you guys usually are and are trying your best. The customers usually expecting an apology on hands and knees for incorrect orders are usually the same ones that come in rude af.

I, I guess as such, have a super high level of appreciation for things that do not ""require"" interwebs/online/""the cloud""/etc.

I told her we would support however the student identified as and she laughed at me. I reported this to HR but they did nothing. This is also the same school that stopped having voting for homecoming kind/queen after a gay couple won and it made people ""uncomfortable"". The last thing was about housing - the dean of student success said that they would not house people based on their gender identity, but ""whatever was in their pants"". It was such a toxic place and I am glad I left. I did my best at every turn to advocate for LGBTQIA+ students, but it was definitely an uphill slog. You are 100% NTA.

I'm on YouTube 24/7 and hate it. Just press on with your career. All careers are eventually going to suck, maybe figure out a way to spice things up within it. Maybe it's some new angle or some new problem to solve outside of your scope of knowledge. Like PhD skills fused with art or some shit like science paint and then some controversial art piece emerges. I'm not one to type here as I'm lounging in the sun in my patterned robe and funky I don't know what style my paints are, I have dreadlocks in my hair because I don't have a reason to do anything about it look. But I'm just saying, let's not waist our talents and skills...rather let's use this time as reflection, take what we learned and move on already. If you get really bored without YouTube....I discovered that beetles play beats at eachother. I'm going to try and program it into a beat machine and see what's up with that, I can share that with you if you want. I'm suppose to be an industrial designer working on new tech and here we are typing out bs on reddit. I get it, everything sucks right now, but it ain't gonna change if we don't. So let's get up out of bed and go to the bar and at least forget for a moment that YouTube exists and that there are real people out there in the universe down to collaborate, do things and collaborate on whatever the hell is going on. I'll make myself an available person for whatever. I got stories, random ideas, random music for you to check out. Just get out of bed. (I'm also telling this to myself).",1714521639.0

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","Oh good, cause I really wanted to be told how to play the game with the faction I've played for about a decade at this point. The best games are always the ones you need a guide for that goes play-by-play on how to win. Stellar design. Y'know what would help even more? I bet if there was a timer for the dwarves, to reach a certain percentage of completion every ten turns, that would really help players enjoy the game. It's so unique that no other race has it. I think the base chaos wastes game had something like that, but I can't remember if it was good or if it was really good. It sounds like you thought it was really good, so it must have been really good. I bet everyone plays it still. 

Look, dude, you're probably better at the game than me. No contest, but you know what I am guaranteed to be better than you at? Game design. Timers (especially rush timers) are not a good mechanic anywhere. I'm glad you can play the game and enjoy it, but your anecdotal enjoyment does not trounce decades of empirical evidence to the contrary. Look at any other game that uses a timer mechanic. You'll find either the timer is critical to the core of gameplay (arena rougelikes, puzzles, escape rooms), or you'll find that the game doesn't use one. You don't need to project a lack of critical thinking here. It's a bad mechanic. Fact. You can double down if you want, but it doesn't change the evidence.",1714521639.0

- When you‚Äôre riding him, make a horizontal thrusting motion instead of bouncing up and down or diagonally on his dick. It takes a bit of practice to get it right but when you do, it really feels like you‚Äôre the one fucking them and not the other way around. I find that leaning forward slightly while having my hands on his chest or pinning his arms above his head helps get the angle right. If he‚Äôs into that, it‚Äôs a great position to spit in his mouth, choke him or slap him.

- Fuck his face. The best position for me is when he‚Äôs lying down on his back and I‚Äôm straddling his head with my legs - a pillow helps to adjust the angle. My hands will either be holding on to the wall, the bedframe, gripping his hair or pinning his arms down. Tell him to suck your dick and thrust with your hips. I like to pull back every now and then to give him a light slap. 

- Dirty talk. Tell him he‚Äôs a good boy, your little slut, whatever gets him going. But just like for everything else here, ask him before springing it on him!

- More of a top thing, but fingering or rimming him while he jerks off can lead to very strong orgasms. Start slow for both and ask him how he likes it.

- And possibly the most important thing: don‚Äôt hesitate to ask him what he wants you to do, and let him know it‚Äôs okay to tell you during, before or after sex. You don‚Äôt have to guess everything to be a good dom and it‚Äôs a lot easier to please someone if they‚Äôre vocal about their desires!",1714521640.0

Title of this post: ABYG for wanting more? 

Backup of the post's body: He's a very good person. Noong bago kami sa relasyon, kahit papaano naman nag eeffort sya, kaso after a few months sobrang chill na lang nya. No more effort, kumbaga dati nga e halos hindi na mag effort, lalo na ngayon, wala na talaga. Mama's boy, walang sariling desisyon. Hindi maalam makipag communicate. I told him want I want sa relasyon namin, hindi ako materialistic na tao. I'm very vocal sa kanya para sa ikaaayos ng relasyon namin. Kaso kahit anong gawin ko, wala s'yang binabago sa treatment n'ya. Puro ako nag eeffort, ako bumubuhat sa relasyon namin. Nakakapagod. Not until I met this woman, she treated me so well. Alam ni girl na in a relationship ako, I told her na I can't cheat. Kaso si girl, hindi n'ya ako tinigilan, hanggang sa dahil na sa kanya kaya ko nakikita worth ko. Help, I don't know what to do.

"Keratoconus","t5_2r6xc","Fellow Canadian here in Vancouver. 

I paid about $750/eye for the originals (with the fitting fees) and replacements like you said are about $600/eye. My contact specialist doesn't believe in them needing to be replaced yearly, and I've had the same lenses for multiple years now with no issues. I've broken one in the past, not sure how, but otherwise It's been pretty groovy. It's really become cheaper than anything else the longer I go with the same set. They can always polish them and make them feel like brand new if needed, but proper cleaning will keep them lasting well past the ""year expiry"". 

That being said, do make sure you still see them yearly to ensure they're still fitting correctly and keep an eye on your eyes incase they get worse.

For extra context, I wear mine from basically 8 am - 10/11pm with no issues. Treat them well, use a hard lens cleaner nightly, store them in solution overnight, and you'll be grand. Well worth it to get your vision back to perfect or near perfect if you can.

DO NOT HAVE ANY FEAR OF CALLING! Thats your proof & he won't find out you called.
By the way many building owners who receive cash aren't even filing that they have a passive income especially if it's cash.

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Answer: Marques Brownlee (also commonly known as MKBHD) is one of the largest tech reviewers on the planet, with nearly 19 million subscribers on YouTube. known for his extremely high production quality and fairly unbiased reviews.

On April 14, he posted a review of a product called the Humane AI Pin, a small wearable device with an AI assistant you can use at just the push of a button, which began shipping a few weeks ago. In all honesty the idea behind the product is fairly solid, but the execution was pretty bad and was got bad reviews from multiple sources.

> After many days of testing, the one and only thing I can truly rely on the AI Pin to do is tell me the time.

- [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24126502/humane-ai-pin-review)

  
> Murphy‚Äôs law states that ‚Äúanything that can go wrong will go wrong.‚Äù That pretty much sums up my first three days with Humane‚Äôs Ai Pin.

- [Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/tech/humane-ai-pin-in-depth-review)

> Almost everything about the pin was a UX disaster for reviewers.

[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91092156/humanes-ai-pin-was-never-going-to-be-great)

Marques continued this trend with his review, titled [The Worst Product I've Ever Reviewed... For Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitZV6k8zfA).

In terms of the tweets you posted, the first one is just hyperbole from a tech influencer for clicks, Humane is still kicking and selling their product. The second tweet comes from another silicon valley startup founder who was likely upset seeing Marques trash a fellow silicon valley startup's product and claimed that Marques and other tech reviewers have an ethical obligation to avoid ""crushing a startup"", this is the tweet that originally sparked this ""drama"". The problem they have is that the title is supposedly ""sensational"" (which is debatable) and that a creator of Marques's size has the ability to crush a product before it even launches. This second point is somewhat reasonable, Marques himself published a review on his second channel where he reviews cars of the Fisker Ocean in which he called it ""the worst car he's ever reviewed"" due to his awful experience, and in the 2 months since then Fisker has nearly collapsed as a company. [Marques himself posted a video about his thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QztFpzKsdeA).

Humane themselves have responded to this situation as well. [Their media director Sam Sheffer tweeted](https://twitter.com/samsheffer/status/1779677818189722100):

> an honest, solid review marques ‚Äî all fair and valid critiques, both the good and the bad 

> feedback is a gift. we reflect and we listen and we learn and we continue building.

[Humane also posted a statement thanking early adopters for their feedback and stating they'll work to address the problems](https://humane.com/media/our-first-ai-pin-cosmos-update), they seem largely unbothered by the whole situation.

TL;DR: YouTuber posted a poor review of a flawed product, some guy on twitter gets mad about it and claims doing so is unethical for *reasons*, company doesn't seem to care and thanks him for giving them honest feedback and constructive criticism.",1714521641.0

As for me, when I read the Bible, the Bible itself demands an understanding of these other cultures. When I look at what we know of those cultures the average understanding of lev 18 simply doesn‚Äôt hold up. As such I personally cannot accept it as a guideline for what constitutes sexual immorality referenced else where in the Bible.",1714521642.0

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","Two main reasons in my opinion are to make money or to feel good. 
  
Make money is pretty simple, its the RMT market mainly. Cheat to get items, sell those or carries for cash, done. You don't care if you get caught and banned, you care if you can make a profit. Cheating to win cash tournaments is also part of that but probably much rarer since its harder to get away with.
  
My suspicion is that RMTers are a minority of the actual number of people cheating, but they make up a disproportionate nunber of banned accounts. They tend to be very blatant and aggressive and doing stuff more likely to get caught, and like I said, their only concern is profit. 
  
Then theres cheaters who just do it to feel good. Sometimes its the thrill of bullying people. Sometimes its fooling themselves into thinking that theyre better than they are, or fooling their friends to feel like the big man in their squad.
  
I feel like the latter category make up the bulk of the people actually cheating in tarkov, they just make less of an impact because they're usually trying not to get caught so they aren't speedhacking and vacuuming all over the place.",1714521643.0

Always the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù because I felt hurt often by their toxic and partial behavior. I was 8 months pregnant and my aunt called me one day and told me she wasn‚Äôt going to see me anymore. They all abandoned me and my three kids and unborn child. My toxic narc husband left me for another woman a month later and became a an emotionally and financially abusive monster to me and my kids for years. They never said a word. Acted like we didn‚Äôt exist even when I called them begging for them to please live my kids even if they couldn‚Äôt love me. Hung up on me. It‚Äôs been 10 years. No one every told me why. The ripples of ACES and trauma my kids have endured because of that cruel abandonment, still makes my blood boil. They deserve whatever the get. My conscience is clear. I know now that truth tellers who call out toxic family dynamics get the ax.

"JuJutsuKaisen","t5_gdma4","1. This is a fair judgement but I think you can infer:
- He knew Maki was undergoing promotion for 1st grade and used the opportunity to be witness to it
- The exact scale of the Shibuya incident was unknown prior to sorcerers being placed outside the station. No one truly expected someone like Gojo to be sealed so they concluded Naobito‚Äôs presence was enough.

2. Mahito running free was necessary for the main struggle Gojo would have in the B5 fight, the influx of Transfigured humans, without them Gojo would have likely killed Jogo immediately after Hanami.

3. I don‚Äôt really get this one tbh, he eviscerated everyone in a 140m range. He was a fair bit outside the station at this point which is where most of the important people were and the range just barely extended to where Inumaki was stationed.

4. I see this brought up often but I think people tend to misunderstand Gojo‚Äôs intentions. The way the 0.2 DE was set-up, if Gojo had interacted at all with the Special Grades they would immediately wake up and given he was not operating with the knowledge he‚Äôd be sealed his thought process was to eliminate the transfigured humans who were immobilized then focus on the Special Grades with much more space to fight.",1714521643.0

In one article he claims that the wife pushed his elderly mother, who had just given the daughter in law $30k cash, down a flight of stairs the day before she vanished with the kids. Then we learn in Part II episode that he was the one with the massive coke habit.

"ZeroCovidCommunity","t5_7a63lg","Outdoor transmission isn't impossible, it's just very unlikely, similar to fomite transmission (touching contaminated surfaces).  

Previously, there was mention of a controversial case of a super spreader individual who infected a bunch of people by jogging past them outdoors at a park: [https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/china-claims-outdoor-jogger-sparked-covid-outbreak-but-offers-scant-evidence/](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/china-claims-outdoor-jogger-sparked-covid-outbreak-but-offers-scant-evidence/)

Some people are super spreaders and just emit more of the virus with their exhalations, and strenuous exercise is known to dramatically increase the rate of emission of virons: [https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/covid-gym-exercise-aerosol-particles-rcna32938](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/covid-gym-exercise-aerosol-particles-rcna32938)

Also, people that are severely immunosuppressed often have very high viral load of many new variants that others may lack any immunity or resistance to.  Such a person may be completely asymptomatic but actually dangerous to be around unprotected: [https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/24/covid-research-chronic-infection-immunocompromised-patients/](https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/24/covid-research-chronic-infection-immunocompromised-patients/)

The other thing to be aware of is ambient outdoor air quality, particularly the level of particulate pollution known as PM 2.5.  Covid infections, deaths and long term complications (long covid) all bear a clear linear relationship with this part of the air quality index (AQI).  If the air quality was poor during those days it may have actually lowered your resistance to infection, perhaps substantially: [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/air-pollution-linked-with-higher-covid-19-death-rates/)

You can check AQI daily on this site: [https://www.iqair.com/](https://www.iqair.com/) and monitor PM 2.5 levels in your room with the Ikea Vindstyrka air quality sensor if you're interested in trying to account for this factor.  

It's possible that any one or all of those scenarios happened in your neighbors' yard that faces your window over the last few days.  

Circling back to the possibility of outdoor transmission and that super spreader jogger...Remember that case happened in China, a country with off the charts particulate air pollution, which may mean that their situation is vastly more severe and dangerous than in Western countries with good air quality.  However, as wildfire smoke increases emissions of PM 2.5 we may see our situation gradually degrade to become more like theirs.  Just something to keep in mind going forward...

"AskProfessors","t5_2tvlb","Did you reach out to him *before* the Q&A to indicate you wouldn't be able to attend and had questions? Or was your communication with him entirely after the fact? 

If I hold study sessions outside of class hours - which I'm not paid or compensated for and do only out of the goodness of my heart to help my students succeed - I reward those students for attending those sessions. It isn't an obscene reward that'll guarantee a pass, but I'll offer some tips and tricks that I will definitely *not* give those who didn't attend. However, if someone reaches out with legitimate interest in attending but cannot due to valid reasons, I will *always* pass along that information. Some students work, some have family obligations, and whatever else may happen. To assume everyone has the flexibility to make extra sessions like that is incredibly classist, so I'm happy to accommodate when and where I can. 

All that being said - even if you *did* choose to report this, I can all but guarantee that nothing at all would come from it, other than whoever you reported it to being convinced that you're a disgruntled student. This genuinely comes off as you want to report him because you didn't like the reply you got, and you're aiming for retaliation through reporting. Ultimately, the Q&A session was held separately, outside of class hours and without him being compensated for it, and you - nor anyone else in the class - is entitled to that information. Yes, I personally would have worked with you given circumstances *if and only if* those circumstances were communicated to me in a timely manner. If you hadn't shown up to my study session, didn't give me any email notice about it, and just came around expecting the same information I gave those who attended the study session, I'd probably have the same response. Communication is so incredibly important in the teacher/student relationship and it absolutely goes both ways. 

I really hope this came off as being frank, but not mean, as that was not my intent. Rather, I wanted to give you a view into how this can and probably will be viewed from an academic perspective if you choose to report this. 

So yeah, this is crappy and I get your frustration, but it also really isn't something to report. Just do your best, maybe chat with some students who did attend the session, and move on. And if you can, try to attend study sessions like this when possible. When I hold them, it's generally for a good reason.",1714521645.0

At some point in the early 1830s, Smith began floating the idea of establishing the Mormon church in Ontario. In the summer of 1837, he announced that he had been called by God and/or an angel named Moron to go on a missionary trip in Canada.

It was a hilarious failure. At the time, Upper Canada (Ontario, basically) was split between competing prot denominations. Smith's arrival was met with anger and hostility. While nobody shot him for being a pedophile, he was screamed out of basically every parish he went to.

Despite all that, he still managed to find about a dozen suckers before he headed back to America, where he was immediately fined for running an illegal bank.

Today, there's something like 250k Mormons in Canada, although most of them are now in Alberta, because of course they are.",1714521646.0

Officer requested to search the vehicle, asked us our relation, and pulled us all out for detainment. It was my ex's father's car so I didn't refuse. They asked if we had anything, and I told them, tall boys on the floorboard. 

They called in a K9, searched the car, found my ex's pot stash, (that I seriously had no idea she was traveling with), and the booze...

They let us go, no questions afterwards. I guess something about a Hispanic male traveling with a white chick and a whitish girl gave them reason to search?

They told me that they were interested in gun running as that stretch is a common corridor. Afterwards a small distance away, we began our tall boys.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Jax Q has more range than literally any marksmen in the game. Garen can still noom with deadman's plate and spin. Marksmen also have low base MS.

Everyone has mobility and crazy dashes that can noom all over the lane. And only high level players will actually use MS to dodge/kite everything. Steelcaps is nerfed but armor and HP items will be much more valuable now that LDR no longer has it's passive and the current Cut Down is being removed.

The mobility creep is indeed very real and kind of insane compared to old league but honestly marksmen are being the very last class to be truly affected positively by it. And if it does come out of control Riot will instantly hotfix it as they do to anything regarding marksmen.",1714521647.0

A simple bed frame is not really that expensive; I'm going to assume that is a Full Sized Mattress -

Obviously for $50 there are not the greatest Bed Frames, but they will do in a pinch. I would be inclined to put something under the feet, especially in a carpeted room.

To makes sure the frame doesn't damage the carpet. 

These are just the first things I found, not necessarily recommendations. Just to show you that a Bed Frame need not be that expensive.

For now if the budget is tight, you can leave it, but ultimately you DO want to get the bed up off the ground. 

There are video on YouTube about making your own bed frame, some eleborate and eligant, and some very utilitarian -

[https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=build+a+bed+fame](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=build+a+bed+fame)

For a low budget frame, this is all 2x4's -

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYSOpGeFt1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYSOpGeFt1U)

There are several videos like this where someone make a small 2x4 frame, and sets a larger 2x4 frame on top of it to give the appearance of a Floating Bed.

"INDYCAR","t5_2sdeq","The 1999 CART season was an all-time great season, and late-90s CART were all-time great cars... though it seems like that's a period you've already seen if you kept up with CART through the early 2000s.

IndyCar during the split years 1996-2008 was pretty awful from any objective perspective. The level of competition through the field was especially awful.

Post-merger, all of 2009 through 2012 are exciting championship battles that stay tight to the very end. Though 2009-2011 are in the terrible 90s-era IndyCar cars (""shitboxes"", infamously), and the schedule is pretty oval-heavy for modern tastes or CART-era tastes, so I don't think I'd really recommend them as ""great watches"" unless you are especially curious.

2014 was IMHO a very good season to watch with lots of twists and turns, the better car in the DW12, and a better schedule. 

2015 was, ""on paper"", probably *the* definitive answer to your question. I think someone else also recommended it.

If people come across nice and they have a nice home, you‚Äôve checked the home, your happy with the application, what extra checks can you do? I‚Äôve never been to a rescue that doesn‚Äôt do home checks. Unfortunately you are probably correct and this man may manage to get a dog from somewhere dodgy, but this is not really the situation I was talking about. At some point you have to put some trust in people otherwise the dogs will live in the kennel for life.

I was just saying it‚Äôs okay to leave a dog for a few hours once it‚Äôs settled. When my dogs have had a good run I will pop out for a couple of hours and the dogs enjoy the space to rest.

Edit to say - I‚Äôm not taking the word of people on Reddit, this is the experience of multiple people I‚Äôve met in real life, and applications I‚Äôve seen fall through. What you are saying is people are going to make up a whole lie to get through a rescue application and pay hundreds of pounds to abuse the dog. I expect it unfortunately happens but I expect it‚Äôs rare. If you want a dog on a whim it‚Äôs much easier to buy a puppy, look on Facebook etc.",1714521648.0

I went to my gyno, and they very rudely brushed me off, I found a new gyno. That doctor found SO much growth mostly on my left side, around blood vessels on the left side, including my left ureter, I could have eventually lost my kidney if not for her excision around my ureter, and now we know what symptoms to keep an eye out for incase I do have my left kidney ever be at risk because of endo.

"Law_and_Politics","t5_9ajocb","I propose that it is indeed harder, not easier now to publish and for readers to find alternative and minority opinions on topics of national importance.   Most local newspapers are gone or have abandoned their editorial pages (or reprint boilerplate from distant owners).  Cable has been a pitched battle between competing owners all trying to grab pieces of a shrinking viewer pie.      The news desk has always been under funded and lacking in investigative chops.  Back in the Walter Cronkite / Huntley-Brinkley days there was enough money from vast viewing of ads to ensure well reported and edited independent content.   
Now with so many people getting their ‚Äúnews‚Äù via an app or as a forwarded tweet, the depth and breadth is questionable if it is there at all.  I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I speak with daily who are now even slightly aware of major international goings-on.   Never would have happened when content was well respected and pretty universal.  Everyone turned on channel 5 and saw/hear the same thing.   Little disagreement on what the news was.  If you didn‚Äôt catch it, you read it in the morning paper.
Ok - you got me on implementation.   Maybe a National Chanel like the BBC, run as a corporate entity like the post office so fairly independent.

You are unlikely to get much sympathy here because I guarantee that the majority of the adhd women of this sub are siding with your husband because they themselves are the victims of their partners weaponized incompetence. 

You want to know what to do? Go around the entire house and pick up every dish/cup and take it to the kitchen then empty the dishwasher and refill it and turn it on. Then go around the entire house and get every piece of dirty clothing then go and start a load of laundry. Then go to the living room and tidy up every thing out of place.

There you have now been 1000 times more helpful than decoding what magical order you presume your husband wants the bathroom cleaned in. Watch him when he cleans and make note of where he prioritizes cleaning and how. You don't even need to clean the entire bathroom clean the toilet and wipe down the counter that's automatically 2 things he no longer needs to do.

There are a few notable others, but latest is Alan Wake 2.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It's possible... it's clear they have communication issues of some sort, if her fiance is afraid in any capacity to talk to her.  Sometimes it's because he's afraid of the reaction he'll get due to childhood trauma or her overreactions (both not good), maybe it's because he has a guilty conscience because he's doing something shady (not good), or maybe it's because he's uncomfortable talking to his partner about uncomfortable subjects (also not good).  

If these two can't talk to each other openly and honestly (she couldn't just ask him to come clean with her before they went either) it spells problems down the line.  Maybe they are problems they can deal with though... only time will tell.

I've been in relationships where my SO wouldn't be open with me, and it's not because I'm unreasonable (I'm known for being super laid back), it was because he had a guilty conscience, was doing things to actively hurt the relationship, and liked hiding things from me.  I'm a very open person and don't like secrecy and lies when they are hiding very hurtful things, which is where my perspective comes from.

At any rate, maybe some marital counselling could do them some good.  I don't think it would have done my situation any good though... I mean, you can't force a cheater or liar to stop doing those things unless they truly want to.",1714521650.0

Some favorites:

Breakdancing competition. That really pushed me out of my comfort zone, I don't shoot action normally. While my camera was not the right tool for the job, I got some good shots.

Food festival. I brought a macro lens and got some good food photos. The vendors were thrilled when I shared the food photos with them.

Student fashion show. A university held a fashion show for their design students. All the clothes were designed by students and the models were students. One of the first times I used a telephoto lens. Holy crap, now I know why runway and sports photographers use monopods. My arms and shoulders were aching from handholding that big heavy telephoto lens. 

Local comic con. I approached some friendly cosplayers and took photos of them. 

Cocktail party at an industry conference. This was my first time shooting a dimly-lit party in a hotel ballroom. Forced me to really up my skills at flash photography. 

It's so fun to give yourself a variety of photography experiences through events. You can also meet great people. Asking people to take their photos can be an ice-breaker and sending the photos after can be a relationship-builder.

Hope this helps.",1714521650.0

Buying multiple copies of any game is more like hoarding than collecting, regardless of scarcity. I think that's the reason behind the mixed response to your post -- it hurts to see a rare game one dearly loves sitting on the shelf of someone who values the copy only as much as its resale value\*.

"CamGirlProblems","t5_3ax4r","Hey! I shaved my head about two months before I started camming as sort of an end of relationship liberation type thing and I had a ton of guys who loved it! About 6 months in I bought a few wigs and started wearing those. I decided that I liked wigs online and my real hair (or lack there of at the time) cause it kind of helped me be ‚Äúin character‚Äù and separate myself from my cam persona. I‚Äôve continued to wear wigs and I really like the fact that I don‚Äôt have to do my hair before each stream! It‚Äôs a huge time saver! 

Regardless, there are guys who are really into buzz cuts and short hair so I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it. I hope you are feeling better and come to find some acceptance regarding your new look. It really can be liberating :)",1714521652.0

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","I personally have seen many scenarios, people who dated forever and ended up breaking up, some dated forever then get married, some who dated very short and get married, some who dated short and break up. So, in short, there‚Äôs no ‚Äùright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù but generally speaking, I do think rushing into anything isn‚Äôt the best. Six months is a bit short, but as we get older we don‚Äôt need to date as long for many reasons (we know what we want, biological clock, etc), and it can be enough time. 

As long as it‚Äôs possible, I agree with other folks that you guys should try living together for a few months then get engaged or married. You can see a lot more in someone when you live together. There are circumstances where living together prior to marriage can be challenging (religious reasons or whatnot), but I‚Äôd say advocate for it regardless. Especially if you want kids, ideally, you‚Äôd like your partner to be a good father. Which takes time to see but living together can help you see more (not all) and work through things before tying the knot. The last thing anyone would like is to rush to marriage and have kids, then face a number of problems.

I personally want kids myself as well, but I strongly believe building a solid foundation in your relationship is critical to the success of you, your partner, future family and kids. If I had to choose, I rather not have kids than have kids with the wrong man. Good luck! So happy you found someone you cherish so much!",1714521653.0

I've had families who want to continue with PT and will pay OOP. In my state (CO), many hospice agencies will pay for 2-4 PT sessions to try to promote safe transfers etc, not to rehab. Other agencies near you may do this too, but again it's not curative in nature. Hip fractures are difficult. For many people, it precipitates additional decline and moves the patients baseline significantly lower, but every so often people defy expectations. 

It may sound harsh, but you cannot assume you or your family are the small percent that will be the exception. If she didn't progress in PT at the hospital or rehab, time will not make her more participatory. If she can't follow directions, or if her pain is so significant she cannot participate, she won't rehabilitate either. 

This is a difficult crossroads for you, and as others encouraged you have to truly consider what your goals are. If she isn't eating or drinking and requires IVF to bring her back to herself, to me it sounds like her body is trying to shut down and you're bringing her back. As another comment said, this can be a revolving door. Are days at her facility better than the hospital? What will give her the best quality, not quantity?",1714521653.0

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","As someone who is currently drunk, you probably should calm down with the alcohol dude.. Does this happen when you drink other stuff (due to the same or similar amount, based off how much by % of alcohol and # of drinks)? If it does, you probably just don't tolerate alcohol well and/or you drank those ~5 drinks in that bottle way too fast)..? Those aren't ""normal"" side effects from that amount of alcohol, though I'm not trying to freak you out (you'll be fine - HYDRATE).

If this somehow *only* happens with a rather specific type of wine then.. I don't know. Wine does cause side effects that other alcohols don't due to the tannins, etc. Red wine is a migraine trigger for me, as an example. But it shouldn't be effecting you to the degree you're describing.

... I did make a post a few years ago on my old account about the evils of bourbon. Which I stand by. But it had more to do with the taste and general hatred of bourbon (drank it because my ex had it and it was the only alcohol in the house + rough time). So I'm certainly not judging.

"Cricket","t5_2qhe0","It is not possible to ""hold"", where hold means holding it stationary. There could be no normal force between his hands and bat at the moment because it is non inertial frame. A good example is apparent weightlessness of a freely falling object under gravity. Suppose an object on weighing scale is dropped from rest under gravity. As soon as it starts going down, the normal force between them would become zero and scale would also read zero. 

The insiders' argument applies only to inertial motion and it is impossible only if pivot (point of application of normal between hand and grip) is on topmost point of handle. That argument isn't even good enough for the equilibrium situation (although that doesn't apply here).

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

You are mistaken.   If they weren't one of those, they wouldn't be considering voting for Trump.

Plus i was mid way through the same chat with two arsenal fans and i just decided to end the chat with both of them.

I don‚Äôt see the purpose in debating someone like that. 

Short version of why he is wrong since you seem to genuinely want to know. 

One was a ban for a red card. The other was a ban for comments made in media. One is automatic that a ban will be considered due to the red. They can immediately start making a decision. 

The other requires an investigation. And given it says O‚ÄôNeil admitted the offence. It seems likely there is a period of time given for managers to reply to the allegation.

So it‚Äôs logical that O‚ÄôNeils ban took longer to be decided than kompany. Even with no knowledge of the processes used to make these decisions.

A basic knowledge of these bans quickly shows you why on took around 10 days extra to be concluded.",1714521655.0

"abusiverelationships","t5_2ua08","before writing this, I just want to say that a lot of mental health issues is a part of this. I've never met such a person in my life, and I care for her to death. but when we got into a relationship, things eventually crashed. it got abusive. 

""you're doing it again"" 

""you made me feel this way"" 

""great, now I want to kms"" 

""if you could stop thinking, that would be great"" 

my ex was in a bad place, due to mental health. the smallest thing became the biggest fight and she would explode. when I tried to explain what I feel, or explain my perspective, she didn't want to listen to it and wanted to leave, and said things like the words above. 

it's not like I was the most perfect person either during fights. I got more and more emotional fight after fight. but I was never once aggressive or mean towards her, and I certainly did not say things like these. it would have broken her. 

still, I feel like I deserved it. my opinion or emotions just didn't matter, why would I try, time after time? it just made everything worse. I should have let go long before. 

at times she would sh after a fight. many times i stood outside the locked door trying to talk to her. 
that is to this day, one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever experienced, and logically, I know it wasn't me, but I think I'll always blame myself for that. it was the fight she had with me, that caused her to act. if I wasn't there, it wouldn't have happened. that's that. 

every time, after calming down, we talked about it, and she actually tried to comfort me about it. she is an incredible person at heart. but yeah, mental health. 

only one time, she did say that it was my fault. I don't think she even remembered saying it afterwards, and I never brought it up, because I didn't want her to feel the guilt for telling me that. never in my life. but i will never forget it either. those words, they went deep. and I guess I'll never know if she meant it or not.",1714521657.0

Very easy and straight-forward quizzes. Even the essays for this course are really easy to receive a good grade. You basically choose one or a few images to talk about a historical event in Japan. I'd say the whole course is an easy A (or even A+).   
  
+ SLAV 307 Literature and Film in Eastern Europe: Just attend all the lectures, do simple weekly discussions online, and make an easy presentation/blog, you get a free 80%. From there, you can choose to write a final paper that can boost your mark from anywhere to 80% to 100%.   


Worst: 

+ PSYC 217 Research Methods: LOL it's the course not the prof really. Most students are just psych students who take it as a mandatory class. I know PSYC 218 is worse, but oof I really didn't like PSYC 217. Good luck running a group experiment, writing a research paper, and doing presentation poster for an event with hundreds of students at night.   
  
+ PSYC 302 Infancy: Dr. Emberson is just an unreasonably tough grader (she's sweet tho). She makes you really stressed about getting high marks on Generalization Assignments which make up 60% of the course. If you can get an 80% on research paper for most classes, be prepared to get a 67% for this one.",1714521657.0

If you don‚Äôt want to work the 9-5 which there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with it , look for jobs that‚Äôll fit ur occupation. And 3.)

There is an entire section of the Federal Trade Commission that regulates the children specific ad laws. (https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/advertising-marketing/children)

It was noticed that kids were extra sustainable to ads back in the late '50s, basically with the rise of TV and by the '80s was pants on head insane. A large percentage of the cartoons in the '80s were created by toy companies, as vehicles to sell more toys, rather than TV shows that had toys as merchandise. 

It got so bad that Congress had to pass the ""Children's Television Act"" in 1990 that put strict limitations on how and how much children could be advertised to.",1714521657.0

While i don't think he would make a good plan for killing us with poison or something else subtle, i could definetely see him snapping in the future over something and then trying to kill us. He has always been very implusive. I remember one time i threw away some of his scrap.¬†


(He had promised to throw it away if my mom got a job since he had lost his due to cheating with a women in the office and had gotten a new shittier one that didn't pay nearly as well. And my mom ofcourse got a job to help support the family.)


Then my dad never threw it away so i did. (Months had passed).


He stomps into the living room and looks so angry and he says ""my scrap is gone."".


All i said was ""oh, yeah"".


He replies, ""Oh so you know about this?"".


I got scared and kept quiet.


He yells, ""WHAT DO YOU KNOW!?"".


I reply while trying not to stutter, ""I threw it away.""


He stares at me like he wants to kill me. I was so god damn scared. You ever get that tingly feeling where you feel like your gonna piss yourself?¬†


He then walks away quietly back into the kitchen and starts crying so loud and then laughing like a fucking maniac.


My mom looked worried and my sister was just going to school so i left with her and my mom while he was having his meltdown tantrum.


As were leaving i can hear him slamming shit.


My sister got dropped off and then i told my mom i didn't want to go back.


My mom ended up giving me some money to offer to my dad as a peace offering.


We stayed away for a couple hours to give him time to calm down and eventually we come home.


My hand is shaking as i hand it to him and i told him im sorry.


I alreadly knew if i tried explaining why i did it he just yell more anyway, that's why i apologized.¬†


He just slaps the money on the floor and says, ""it aint about the fucking money."".


After that i hid in my room.


There's been other time's too but i can't remember them at the moment.",1714521657.0

It'd need to be predictive so you can make small segments of changes color without having to purge, and the filament might have to be more viscous when melted to avoid mixing two different colours and muddying the change area... But that's where I'd waste my time.",1714521658.0

When it's ""my body my choice"" it's referring to the medical procedures that they will be going through to terminate a pregnancy (also take the pill). This is about whether you should be allowed to decide to have that medical procedure. And since it's becoming a thing of the past in quite a large swath of the US it's looking like nobody but the government has the right to choose these days.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I don't think ultimatums are bad, I think the general advice of them being bad, is to do with the fact it can end relationships. And, giving someone an ultimatum, could potentially be abusive, if used as coercion. Ie, you must sleep with me 3 times a week, or I'm getting a divorce. Things like that. What you're doing is not abusive. You are just informing the people around you of a hard boundary you have, that you need to have to feel safe. So, not bad because ultimatums are bad. They aren't, of themselves, bad. 

Anyway, that being said. 

Bloody hell, lovely. You're going through a lot here aren't you? I am sad to hear your friends aren't supporting you properly. 

It sounds like that woman friend you have, she is not a safe person to be around. Women in wide friendship groups are quite vulnerable when you're young. Especially, if people in the group are behaving like this!

They are letting rapists be around everyone else in the group. It's horrible behaviour. Even, if they thought the person might not have done it they are still saying, this isn't a deal breaker for them. If they will take that risk with your safety, they are dangerous people. Not safe! 

Its not too much to ask, it's not even the bare minimum. 

You deserve to have supportive people around sweetheart and I am sorry you aren't getting it. 

You did right to tell her your boundaries. Well done. 

It looks like it might be time to walk away from these friends. But, you can find more friends. Getting involved in women's groups, or charity work that's focused on women can be a really good help on that. 

And we are all hear if you want to talk. üíö",1714521658.0

I can see a few reasonable things to be concerned about. Tipping over never crossed my mind, but how stable are these bales? Could one tip over and push through the sidewall of the trailer (since they're usually held on by rivets that are often damaged by trailer dings)? Is this a legal way to load this? Will a DOT officer cite me for this? Etc etc. 

I know from experience the first concern isn't an issue, because they won't tip over as long as you don't try to tip them over lol. DOT wise? Probably good, but friction alone certainly doesn't meet the securement requirements, so it might become a question of how stable the vehicle would be should they slide around.

"Totaldrama","t5_2u6ph","Strongest is a toss up for me between Amazon and, throwing them out there, the Gapphers. Amazon speaks for themselves; strong players in Heather, Gwen, and Courtney with Sierra's strength and potential, and Cody himself is a good, resourceful, and smart player himself. Gapphers though I feel don't get appreciated enough. Like Amazon they have both Gwen and Heather, but they also got another S Tier player in Duncan, alongside Leshawna who is also really strong in the game, the strength of DJ, and Harold who is the MVP. 

Weakest might go to Kinosewak I will not lie. Their best and strongest player was Jasamine and later on Sky, who was more focused on Dave at the time. I guess Scarlett counts but she was dealing with Max half the time and, while I love him, is pretty trash at the game. Amy and Sammy don't do much and are too focused on each other, and Amy's strategy only works on people braindead like most of the team. Rodney was a liability despite his strength, and Topher was non focused on the game at all really. Like oh my God, the moment the other team got rid of the arguably worst player of the season in Leonard they NEVER lost again to my knowledge. 

Victory and Grips are also contenders but like, the main problems were synergy or being stupid; and even then they had more than two hitters (Victory has Lindsay, Harold, Leshawna, hell and DJ at his best cooks. Grips had an actually solid line up overall but would just fumble usually and had to go against one of the best teams in the game's history.).",1714521659.0

Over that time I gained 3/4"" length and .4"" girth. Since I was pumping at the same time I can't say it was all due to the Phallosan. I certainly felt the strain a lot and believe it contributed.

christians believe in a tri personal god that was incarnate, one of those 3 persons having 2 natures and dying for humanity and ressurected from the dead 3 days later  
some jews believe in a dual personal god while others believe in a mono personal god, awaiting the arrival of that god in the flesh to save them and make them the rulers of the earth

2. our beliefs are nothing alike, you'd know that if you ever bothered to study our beliefs and not just blindly listen to whatever richard dawkins or r/atheism tier arguments you heard regurgitated over and over that theists have refuted for a long time (almost 1500 years give or take now)   
   
3. islam is built around the idea of fulfilling a fulfillment, as well as warfare and conquest which is why it's responsible for more than 70%, almost 80% of the religious wars ever waged

christianity is about personal attonement and redemption through graceful acts and faith through christ who is a fulfillment of the old testament's prophecies of the messiah

"Connecticut","t5_2qji0","Florida sucks, Connecticut is a much better place to raise kids. I was born in Miami, my family moved to Connecticut when I was young, but all my extended family and close friends stayed in FL so we visited often. I love my cousins to death, but, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, they are all either very dumb or miserable. I think that has to do with the education and the political climate down there. (My family is Cuban, Cuban Americans are uniquely poisoned by right wing brain rot. For context they were doing the QAnon thing way before it went mainstream.) Also, Florida is much larger than Connecticut, so, unless you live in a big city (Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Tallahassee), things are much further apart and harder to get too. And outside those cities I would say there is even less to do. Outside the big cities the food sucks, it's almost entirely just fast food and big chains. Connecticut is much better. It's more expensive, I think, but a big reason for that is just that it's a nicer place to live. But it sounds like you'd rather live in Florida, so go for it.

"worldjerking","t5_3fawf","Yeah, Ishmael too iirc.

Apparently it wasn't that uncommon for people back then to write very affectionate, deeply intimate letters to close platonic friends, using words and imagery that would easily make modern audiences think that they were having a secret gay romance, when they weren't. This trend of ""romantic friendships"" waxed and waned in both Christian and Muslim cultures from medieval times up til the late 19th century. 

Which would be confusing because sometimes, there actually was an actual secret gay romance going on, and the two people really were fucking. It's just that they blend in with all the not-fucking people also being really affectionate towards their platonic friends.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9lgh5c/reading\_letters\_from\_history\_im\_struck\_by\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9lgh5c/reading_letters_from_history_im_struck_by_how/)

This was a real historical occurrence - but also turbo fanfic fuel for worldbuilders. Generally speaking, both conservative and liberal cultures in most parts of the modern world don't really have this kind of super-intimate language and behaviors towards platonic friends, so any fiction that harkens back to this more... affectionate... culture will be perceived as extra spicy.

"howyoudoin","t5_2tqcj","For the last FUCKING TIME!!! 

Let‚Äôs settle the ‚Äòwe were on a break‚Äô bullshit once and for all, because I‚Äôm pretty fucking sick of seeing it posted on here.

The Assholes - 

Ross and Rachel were both assholes, and so were all the friends. Everybody was an asshole here. Ross was an asshole for getting jealous and clingy, Rachel was an asshole for putting her career before her personal life and pretty dumb for not seeing Mark for who he really was - it was kind of obvious and this is all what triggered Ross‚Äôs trauma and led to him getting jealous and clingy. We‚Äôll get into this later - And the friends were assholes for not being there for either Ross or Rachel. Ross came to Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe multiple times once his trauma was triggered and they told him he was crazy, which made him feel worse. J and C did something far worse, but we‚Äôll get into that in a bit. 

The REAL Asshole - 

The Copy Girl. I‚Äôm gonna lay it out for you, real simple: Ross sleeping with her wasn‚Äôt cheating, because he was so drunk that night, that he didn‚Äôt even know where he was anymore. Add to that the fact that she kept pushing him all night and he kept saying no until he was too drunk to say anything. Ross didn‚Äôt even know what had happened the previous night, or how he got home, until he woke up and saw her and she had to tell him what happened. 

The poor bastard wasn‚Äôt even fucking conscious while she was having her fun. That sound like consensual sex to you? I‚Äôll tell you what that is, that‚Äôs R*PE! Ross didn‚Äôt cheat on Rachel, he was R*PED. 

And Chandler and Joey let it happen, because instead of getting their clearly too-drunk-to-think friend home, they got pissy because the pretty R*PIST girl wasn‚Äôt fawning over them and went home. Fucking man-children. 

And why was Ross able to become jealous and clingy in the first place? Two words: Carole. Susan. 

Insecurities don‚Äôt just happen. They‚Äôre born and created by circumstance. By people in some cases. And Ross‚Äôs were created by Carole and Susan and what they did to him. 

So there you go‚Ä¶ 

Ross and Rachel were on a break. Ross didn‚Äôt cheat, he got r*ped. The friends were terrible friends all round here. Mark‚Äôs a sleazy piece of shit. And it all goes directly back to what Carole and Susan did to Ross. 

Boom. Debate settled.",1714521661.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Thanks for your submission /u/Electrical_Minute284, but it has been removed for the following reason:

Disallowed question area: **Rant or loaded question** 

NoStupidQuestions is a place to ask any question as long as *it's asked in good faith*. Our users routinely report questions that they feel violate this rule to us. Want to avoid your question being seen as a bad faith question? Common mistakes include (but are not limited to): 

* Rants: Could your question be answered with *'That's awful'* or *'What an asshole'*? Then it's probably a rant rather than a genuine question. Looking for a place to vent on Reddit? Try /r/TrueOffMyChest or /r/Rant instead.

* Loaded questions: Could your question be answered with *'You're right'*? Answering the question yourself, explaining your reasoning for your opinion, or making sweeping assumptions about the question itself all signals that you may not be keeping an open mind. Want to know why people have a different opinion than you? Try /r/ExplainBothSides instead!

* Arguments: Arguing or [sealioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lioning) with people giving you answers tells everyone that you have an answer in mind already. Want a good debate? Try /r/ChangeMyView instead!

* Pot Stirring: Did you bring up unnecessary topics in your question? Especially when a topic has to do with already controversial issues like politics, race, gender or sex, this can be seen as trying to score points against the Other Side - and that makes people defensive, which leads to arguments. Questions like *""If _____ is allowed, why isn't _____?""* don't need to have that comparison - just ask *'why isn't ____ allowed?'*.

* Complaining about moderation: If you disagree with how the sub is run or a decision the mods have made, that's fine! But please share your thoughts with us in modmail rather than as a public post. 

Disagree with the mods? If you believe you asked your question in good faith, try rewording it or message the mods to see if there's a way you could ask more neutrally. Thanks for your understanding!

I went through all of the different providers, and there were a lot of options, but I ultimately chose pomegranate health  (if you search it up use ‚Äújoin pomegranate‚Äù to avoid being flooded with only fruit related content). 

I was initially attempting to avoid a membership, but this one actually offers more than you get with others. You not only get a decent price for the higher doses, but can also utilize primary care services and dermatology (among other things) for no additional cost. It‚Äôs all included in your membership. 

For lower doses, there are cheaper alternatives but once you get to 7.5 this is one of the top options cost wise. 

The membership is $69 a month and tirzepitide is $299. Making your total cost each month $368. 

My first shipment arrived today and the process was pretty easy. One thing I will note that some people have not loved is that they do require labs but if you have recent labs, you can just upload a copy of those.

Daarnaast is bovenstaande vraag denk ik vooral een levensstijl vraag?

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","There is no single method or framework for these problems, anarchists have a range of economic philosophies. Some are communists, some believe in markets, some believe in enumeration, others reject it. 

Some ideas include: workers are paid based on their contribution, workers are paid based on what the market determines, workers receive additional benefits or pay for working more difficult or dangerous jobs. Dangerous work can be divided among a community so that the more difficult work is divided either equally or based on need in order to keep society functioning and then you do whatever else you want to do (many societies based on gathering or agriculture had to do this to abide by seasonal changes). Others suggest that anarchy will involve a different ethos where difficult or dangerous work will be just a part of what is necessary and people will just do it because it's important to keep society functioning (for example, the volunteers going to clean up nuclear waste to prevent a greater meltdown). Others make the (occasionally) valid point that a lot of dangerous jobs don't really need to be done and are only done to benefit a handful of individuals.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","There is a difference between doing ""bad things"" to survive and doing bad things to ""live comfortably"".

We can all grasp the concept of stealing a loaf of bread if you and/or your family are starving and if you have zero dollars to your name. You are stealing because you have no other option.

That is quite different than stealing filet mignon, and lobster tail, and a $100 bottle of whiskey, when you could afford all your bills, and you just want a nice dinner, and don't want to pay for it, because you'd rather keep your money, or save it for something else.

Most of the guys in the sopranos were not doing what it takes to survive. They  weren't concerned with meeting the bare necessities, or even slightly above the amount. They wanted to live a comfortable lifestyle, which is all well and good, but their means to reach that was to do things that hurt other people and the community as a whole.",1714521664.0

In an effort to reduce spam/empty/misleading/irrelevant, or low effort posts in general - we require posts to have at least a few thoughts about it the subject matter in the body or title. For example - posts like ""Markelle Fultz. That is all"" or ""Jonathan Isaac is a monster"" will be removed. As another example, if you wish to discuss a draft prospect, don't just post a YouTube video with his name as a title, at least provide a sentence or two why you'd be interested in that player, otherwise it comes across as spam from someone who is posting that same YouTube video in other subreddits. As a rule of thumb, trade ideas, especially trade machines are to be posted in the daily threads where images are able to be uploaded.

If you want to boost your resume with international experience, this is one good way.

By no means am I saying you can't live abroad in the future, just when you start looking for a job you'll probably look at home first. Then you move out, you'll start buying furniture and stuff, and suddenly moving to Europe or the UK becomes a whole lot more challenging.

"xmen","t5_2s4cn","The point is even guessing is disingenuous.  It's very obvious what it means.  It means the book could survive if they were the only ones in it.  Not a single book or a solo.  X-men are team books, that's an unreasonable standard.  But a team line-up.  If you put out a book that is sync, prodigy, Dr. Reyes, Bishop, Frenzy, and Sunspot, that book is going to sell almost nothing and get cancelled inside of a few months.  

Now who knows, they may still do that, but it would usually be as hellions or NYX or something, a book that they're kind of accepting isn't likely to hit issue 12 let alone issue 20.  When you put out an X-men book, you have a group of characters you have to fill it with for it to sell, and in that group there are very few black males.  He is right about that.  This isn't a measure of the future.  It's a measure of the past.  When they make teams, particularly for the books with X-men in the name, they have to aim for teams that are likely to be able to sell.  

Now usually they also include a few less popular characters that the writer can work with and if we're lucky, the writer nails them and they take off and become viable (we've seen this with Magik over the last decade or so) but that doesn't remove the earlier statement.

Basically, people are just letting fan-rage blind them to the simple facts of Brevoort's statement, which is nonsense because if anything, people that want black male characters in the X-men should be HAPPY he's acknowledging its a problem.  Maybe that means as editor he'll make sure these characters get featured more and become more well-known and viable.  That's a good thing.  Most of these characters are cool (I have never liked prodigy, to the point that his mere presence means I'll likely skip NYX) and it would be good to see them get a Magik style bump.",1714521665.0

"self","t5_2qh96","I started seeing this in the 90s with the Xennial generation, those born from the late 70s to mid 80s and it has just gotten worst. Our societies obsession with looks plays a big part in it. Many want the whole package and doesn't want to settle for less. Most women out there want the same 10% or so of men. Men's testosterone levels have been dropping and this means less confidence and assertiveness. Men in many way have been neutered, afraid to say or do the wrong thing and end up labelled as a creep or predator. Feminism has empowered younger women to be strong and independent, to delay or fully avoid any relationship. The waters have been muddied how men and women should even dress or act. Then there is technology which has people spending more time alone looking at their devices. Add diversity to the mix, that is we no longer have many established communities where everyone kinda knows each other. People feel like they are alone when they go out. No one is making eye contact or looking to make friends. Many people talk about how they want to be alone. It's a bad combo. Your best bet today is the alone dating apps and doing activities where you can find people you share an interest with. Don't underestimate coworkers. Work can be a great place to meet someone, but you have to be careful with sexual harassment. Take your time and if she is not interested move on. The days of fighting to get someone is over. That is now viewed as creepy. Put forth an effort to dress better, workout and take care of your skin and other things. The bar is much higher these days, people take better care of themselves.",1714521666.0

"DungeonsAndDaddies","t5_xpofb","I think Freddie works incredibly hard on Dungeons and Daddies behind the scenes, and I appreciate the work he does. However, I think he is the weakest actor/improviser on the show. Everyone else is playing characters, and I feel like Freddie is playing caricatures, and It doesn't help that the caricatures he plays are of annoying characters without self-awareness. I don't know what Freddie is like in person, but I would guess that he's not really that annoying, and it's just that the line is blurred between what his characters choose to do, and what he chooses to have his character do. Everyone else on the show has allowed their characters to be vulnerable and really connect with others, but I can't recall a time Freddie has. 

This is pure speculation, but the vibe I get from how Freddie interacts with everyone else with regard to creative ideas is more like writers in a writers' room, where ideas get bounced around. So, someone saying, ""Oh wait, no, what if your character did this!"" is welcomed, because other people can build off of it or change it to something else, whereas in improv, that comes off as railroading your idea over someone else's, because once it's put out there, there's no editing it back out, it's just part of what's happening in the scene.

All that said, improv is really fucking hard, so I have massive respect for everyone on the show, and Freddie brings a chaotic energy that is a vital part of what makes D&Daddies such an entertaining show (even if he annoys me sometimes).",1714521666.0

* Do not use personal accounts with friends & family contacts on it, you will be blackmailed.
* If the user has Free karma posts, or one line quote posts, they are suspicious. Stay away.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Your edit honestly makesit sound like you're blowing things out of proportion. She said settle down which many people have already told you is completely different from settling for someone. If you feel like you're settling FOR someone it means that you know there's better out there but you just haven't left or won't leave them for whatever reason. Maybe cuz you don't want to be alone or you think you're out of time, or can't do better etc. When you settle for someone you know that something is missing or even sucks about the person you're with and you don't actually want them, but you'll stay just to stay. Settling down with someone is what you do when you get married or otherwise commit fully to one another and live out your days together. She loves you, she thinks you're dependable and nice. That is what you want out of a husband. I think you have the wrong idea as to what married couples are like. The young hot firey passion isn't really how your life will be like especially if you have children. But she knew she wanted to marryou early on which I think is a really great sign. 

But on the other hand I can see why you'd be upset or concerned by her saying it's better to be with someone who adores you and puts you on a pedestal.... that is a bit weird. But at the same time you do put her on a pedestal. You think she's a 10 and that you're not.... so while part of me understands that that sounds hurtful you're also causing this by putting her above you and seemingly worshiping her. I guess the question is does this mean the level of love between you is unbalanced or is it just the level of attraction between you is unbalanced and if you can live with either of those. I think some level of unbalance is normal though and is to be expected,  especially if one partner puts another on a pedestal.",1714521668.0

First of all, it‚Äôs usually a bit faster if you tell your assistant to pump the pedal five or six times and then hold it down. While it‚Äôs being held down, crack the bleeder, wait for whatever is in there to come out, and then close the bleeder. Repeat. It takes clear communication to synchronize everything between the two people. 

The closer you get to being done, the firmer the pedal will feel, and each time you open the bleeder the pedal will begin to sink to the floor, so the person in the car needs to understand that‚Äôs normal and to maintain pressure, and you need to close the bleeder before the pedal bottoms out.

It just doesn't seem fair to compare artists like Katy or Dua Lipa against Taylor and her Swifties - because none of the artists commonly listed never purposely cultivated/wanted a attachment that, and it's not a necessity to enjoy the music.

"islam_ahmadiyya","t5_da00y","Will base it on Anecdotes rather than hard facts but if you want a better grasp you will have to study Subcontinents history and rely on multiple sources.

Overall Left leaning Writers even in Pakistan have been considerably biased towards Jamaat when they write about stuff so that‚Äôs one pointer over how to look for a wider list of resources before you can form a hypothesis

Regarding Wealth, affluence and Education; I think that stars from the top

Maybe you need to understand how ppl in Pakistan became rich post partition 

MGA and his family wasn‚Äôt exactly rich rich.

As the movement grew thanks to British patronage as Jamaat was a suitable candidate for an alt group ( let‚Äôs say divide and conquer)

They started Gaining wealth and affluence post partition as they were able to convert some ‚Äúinfluential families‚Äù and bridge them into the Mirza family by forming marital relationships 
Also A big chunk came from Hindu Evacuee Property and Agricultural land Allotment where Govt influence is basically everything.
With exception to the Few Princely state which were also British ordained there wasn‚Äôt really much happening in Pakistan part of India pre partition‚Ä¶.



But otherwise your observation isn‚Äôt far from reality for some reasons I think why


1. Usually is the trodden and Poor who gravitate towards such reformative movements and such
( I can use my paternal family‚Äôs example that went rags to riches 
They joined jamaat pre partition when there was not much they had to look forward towards in life
MGAs claims to them was a ray of hope)
Although they did go rags to riches when they moved to Pakistan given the strong influence and control Jamaat enjoyed in Pakistan over the ever Strong Military Establishment and bureaucracy)



That‚Äôs the background 

Second part on the deplorable state of Socio Economic mobility is that well it‚Äôs a sad little Punjabi cult where majority hails from northern Punjab in Pakistan out of vast majority of diaspora is from Rabwah which is a Dirt poor settlement.
Given the regional dynamics, rampant poverty, lack of education and over Tribalism/casteism of the Punjabi cult there‚Äôs only limited opportunity for real change to happen.

Jamaat and Mirza Family does not do anything to change or challenge the status quo rather its happy with some key slaves in Top positions who as you acknowledge leverage their position in order to power trip on others..
It all starts with the intent at the top, there‚Äôs no real intent of sustaining a community other than getting a few hundred killed so the Victim complex remains alive 


Having seen the place there is no real attempt by Mirza Family to promote Socio Economic mobility of Ahmedis until it‚Äôs someone from their own kith and kin who gets to benefit.

This also reflects on the So called Sense of community which is nothing but a Hollow carcass.

Just a quick scan of his Wikipedia page... shows he was a pretty interesting character. 

Obviously not a billionaire (he died in 1943).  And just because he invented Corn Flakes... he wasn't the head of a massive food conglomerate.  Looks like he was a massive health freak and did a lot of research on natural health.  Seems like he was a bit of a nut, although ahead of his time in some respects, and at the same time super religious.  He was obviously a product of his time.

While he definitely was a proponent of circumcision I still see no evidence that he is solely or mostly responsible for the widespread practice it is in the U.S. today.

Americans are way too selfish for that. Many of these protesters are deep in the selfie-selfish TikTok clout. They are making it about them rather than what's really at stake.

Minstrel shows were for laughs yes, but for the laughs for white people by white people. Black people aren‚Äôt in on the joke here, it‚Äôs at their expense. 

Drag on the other hand is not at women‚Äôs expense because they‚Äôre taking the preexisting gender roles and making a caricature of it to make fun of the stereotype. 

Blackface is at black people expense because they‚Äôre taking preexisting racial stereotypes and making a caricature of it to make fun of the characteristics of black people.

Are there hypothetical minstrel shows that make fun of the stereotype? Sure. Are there hypothetical drag shows that make fun of the characteristics of women? Sure.

The proof is in the pudding here though. Women have been a core part of drag audiences and the teams that put together queens outfits since the beginnings of drag culture. There‚Äôs no core black audience for blackface and minstrel shows.

Regardless I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt really know much about drag and the general culture surrounding it? If you‚Äôre genuinely more curious about it I recommend the documentary Paris is Burning as a very good starting point.",1714521671.0

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","Hello all. Thanks in advance for reading this post. I have a job that is going to pay for Master's program and I figured why not if it's free. I know there is a lot of negativity around Master's programs, but I assume a big con with that mindset is the 20-40k of debt to get it, which isn't a factor here.

I'm looking for guidance on if I should do an MBA with Cybersecurity focus or Master's of Compsci with Cybersecurity focus. So managerial vs technical.

I do eventually want to manage, but I want to improve my technical prowess as much as I can before going into management. I've had managers that were great, hard workers, but they weren't technical.... And I didn't really enjoy working for them as much as I do my managers that had a decently strong technical side to them. I figured I could always get a CISSP or equivalent later on if I go for technical master's. Here's quick story of my short IT career below:

Acquired Business Information Systems bachelors degree and immediately landed helpdesk job.

1 year at helpdesk, led team in tickets closed, calls answered, time per call etc and promoted to desktop

11 months at desktop, led team of 8 in tickets closed there as well. Company suffered breach and all of the sudden, a cybersecurity department popped up out of no where with 3 analyst positions, I got one of them. So basically glorified desktop support with cybersecurity analyst title. Imposter syndrome ensued extremely hard for a while.

2 years as cybersecurity analyst at this company managing all phishing campaigns and anything else that comes along with that, handling all Umbrella tickets, Crowdstrike EDR and incident response, etc. Learned a whole lot of OSINT tools. Basically identifying if a threat was real and letting the Sys Admins know then they would handle it. Really lost passion/became depressed being 100% remote and being around people. Realized fully remote wasn't for me (minority opinion, I know) and I needed a hybrid position for mental health. Applied for a cybersecurity administrator job at small company (900 users) that's hybrid and got it.

I have been at new job for 6 months and they will pay for 20k-30k Master's. So here we are.

I'm not the most technical person on the block. My success comes from soft skills, decent at interviews, and strong work ethic. I obviously lack experience as only have about 4 years total in IT. I would rate my technical skills as maybe a 5 or 6 out of 10....

I want to increase my technical prowess, but am nervous if I get into the CompSci master's I won't be able to do it, or it will take a ton of time since I'm not as technical as engineering/compsci bachelor degree holders. I asked the recruiters how intense the compsci program was an didn't really get an answer, they just said 10 hours per week per class, but MBA said same thing... The schools I'm applying for are in the 20k-25k range, so these aren't super high-level, prestigious schools. Take that for what it's worth.

I really appreciate anyone that actually read this wall of text.... I would really appreciate any insight/opinion, especially master degree holders similar to the ones I'm chasing. It would just suck to get into the CompSci Master's program and feel overwhelmed with how intensely technical it may be and not be able to do it, it really at the end of the day is confidence issues, because I've been around some technical people that really impressed me, and I know I'm not on their level.... If I don't pass, I don't get the free money from work btw lol. Thanks again! :)

Cheers!",1714521672.0

"diablo4","t5_2rzx9","If that's how you feel then you probably never cared about the game to begin with. Right?

Because:

a) If you're a cosmetic w**** like many of us, then the crazy crystalline horse at the end of Battle Pass ALONE is a must-have

b) If you're all about seasonal questline, they were never that expansive and this season will have a small one as well, so nothing is changing in that regard

c) If you play for items and loot, this season is literally the best time to be alive as a Diablo 4 player.

d) If you play seasons solely for their unique mechanics, then since you have NEVER interacted with the new Crafting Systems before - they easily fulfill that role for you

If you care for none of the above, what do you even care for?",1714521672.0

"ToolBand","t5_2rfjf","Cheers to that brother, I consider myself very lucky that my mom had the great taste in music she had. I still have her CD rack exactly how she kept it before she passes with the CDs in the same spots that I pull out and listen to when I need to feel close to her again. So many fond memories of us blasting CDs both singing our hearts out together as far back as 3rd grade.

My youth was saturated with Tool, APC, Alice n Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Beck, Soul Coughing, Portishead, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, KoRn and so many others. I remember so so many times with her & my memory isn't great. It's only because of the music and our shared passion for it that I can even remember things that far back. She was a fuckin rockstar to me.. I miss her all the time but when I miss her the most, the music is all still there and to this day often bring back memories I had forgotten until a certain song came on. Drives to the Jersey shore listening to Y100 on the radio before it stopped being a thing, both of us belting out all the words as we drove across the bridges into Jersey.

Music was such a big part of my life because of her. The DJ from y100 Dan Fein even DJ'd her wedding when she married my step dad lol The music will keep her Alive in my heart and memory for the rest of my life üíö",1714521673.0

My sincere apologies if I wasn't clear. DEI initiatives and quota hiring is extremely stupid and I applied a couple of over-the-top examples. Merit, experience and capability should be the metric for hiring. Affirimitve action is inherently racist (just ask the Asians who were rejected from Harvard because they had quotas).

"ProgrammingLanguages","t5_2qi8m","Thanks for this. I was still a bit confused after reading so I took your example of `e ::= x | e e' | Œªx:e.e' | ‚àÄx:e.e' | * | N | Z | S e` and then asked myself what it would look like if we were to try and combine `‚àÄx:e.e'` and `Œªx:e.e'` into a single construct.  
  
With ‚àÄ, we get `Œªx:N.S x : ‚àÄx:N.N : *`  
  
If we allow the shorthand `e -> e'` for `‚àÄx:e.e'` when the dependent function parameter doesn't occur in e' then we get, `Œªx:N.S x : N -> N : *`. Which looks correct.

So I wondered what it would looks like if we tried to combine Œª and ‚àÄ, and got `Œªx:N.S x : Œª_:N.N : Œª_:N.*`, or with the shorthand `Œªx:N.S x : N -> N : N -> *` , and a function from N to Œù does not take a N to produce a \*. So it just doesn't seem to work.

So I think my question ultimately boiled down to ""Why can't lambda abstractions be used to classify lambda abstractions?""

And I guess the answer is just ""Well, because it doesn't work.""  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

I assume you meant those as two separate things. They were hippies. They did not want to be on BC. And not that they didn't want to be on BC because they were hippies? :D

Hormonal BC (aka the pill) affects all manner of women differently. They mess with hormones, sure, because that's how they work. If they didn't alter hormones, they wouldn't be effective. But yeah, some women just can't take them. Personally, I was prescribed the pill for my PCOS, to lessen the pain caused by and the volume of menstruation. I ended up having a horribly painful period for *13 months straight*. Worked as a BC, too, because I definitely did not want to have sex while bleeding! The never-ending cramps made me into a rage monster, as well. 

Sorry, not calling you out in particular. This is just a pet peeve of mine, I guess. I hear a lot of people (both men and women) who think taking the pill is the easiest option for BC, when it can have detrimental effects for women. And since women are the ones to carry the potential child, they are expected to deal with it. My own doctor just kept saying, ""Give it a while longer. Your body will sort it out.""

This will breed resentment and cause her to lose faith in you. Once she feels she can't trust you with her feelings/ emotional well being, that will be the beginning of the end. I'm speaking from experience in your wife's shoes. It sucks being with someone that never prioritizes your feelings. And it's impossible to trust and have an emotional bond with them.

"NavyNukes","t5_2xbbp","If you disclosed your drug use at meps, you may have passed the physical portion but then got flagged for the drug use without a meps approved waiver. Even if meps approved the waiver, to enter into the nuke field, you have a package submitted with a bunch of documents to ANOTHER entity (I forget the name) to be approved for the nuke program (with your disclosed drug use). Sorry I totally forgot about your nuke package being approved (it's been a few years. Usually the recruiter will submit that before you go to meps, so when you pass the physical you're able to sign your contract, but sometimes it doesn't come back in time, or they need more documents... Or you have drug use without the required paperwork submitted to them).
Every LT you know doesn't matter in this instance, unless they're directly involved in this process, otherwise they're just any other outside entity, like all of us here.
Unfortunately, most recruiters aren't very good with the nuke process. This is why we have a special nuclear coordinator, which is likely the only person who fully knows what's going on with your situation. They don't share much with the recruiters, unless the person is approved or needs additional documentation.
Sounds like you may have fallen through the cracks if you found out last minute, or your command was notified last minute, or you were denied last minute by the nuke entity who's name I've forgotten.",1714521676.0

A separate but distinct species, *Storeria victa* occupies peninsular Florida. It has two fewer midbody scales (15) than *Storeria dekayi* and is more likely to have yellow collar markings on the neck.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom and are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.

There are collation effects but they are extremely minor.¬†

But changing the distribution of whether you will hit dupes or be more spread out *doesnt change* the chances of you hitting a specific card.¬†

It still all cancels out.¬†

So if you‚Äôre looking for a specific card in a specific treatment it really doesn‚Äôt change anything.¬†

If you could resell your packs with zero arbitrage, opening a box and then abandoning it when a specific treatment of a wrong card appeared you could get a theoretical infinitesimal edge. But that‚Äôs not possible.¬†

The margin is so slim it doesn‚Äôt make any sense to avoid collared packs or not. You should be more concerned about packs per dollar if you‚Äôre going to undertake opening packs hoping for a specific card/treatment.¬†",1714521677.0

"slaythespire","t5_3hbbd","**Analysis Post (not a recommendation)**

Holy high roll! With a draw like this we likely leave this fight on 64/66hp, which is basically as good as we could hope for. There is obviously not a lot to discuss about the hand today, but we can start talking about our Nunchaku problem.

If we want it on 9 we have to kill with 6 or 16 attacks. To kill with 6 attacks is nearly impossible, although technically possible if we played quick slash weakened twice to kill an acid slime, and then unweakened 4 times to kill the other 2, but that‚Äôs not realistic. Killing in 16 attacks would mean using 5 attacks per slime, which is almost exclusively weakened neutralize, although the killing blows can just be wasting damage by over killing slimes.

So perfect nunchaku setup is probably not going to happen. But we can try to use as many attacks as possible by wasting damage where possible. We can probably use 5 attacks on the 15hp slime, 3 attacks on the 11hp slime, and 4 attacks on the 13hp slime, which would be 12 attacks and leave nunchaku on 5. Maybe we can get it to 6-7 if we really stall for a couple extra neutralize plays. The higher the better.",1714521677.0

It‚Äôs sort of like how some states deal with seatbelt tickets. They won‚Äôt pull you over for not wearing a seatbelt but if they pull you over for something else *and* you‚Äôre not wearing one; expect that fine, too. 

I think it‚Äôs good to inform people about what the rules are. But you‚Äôre right; most GMRS repeaters are not Part 95E type accepted. And frankly there are a *lot* of hams using their amateur transceivers on GMRS. They‚Äôre doing so in ways that are not *otherwise* illegal so it is unlikely they‚Äôll ever see any enforcement. 

Many repeaters are listed on places like MyGMRS and *advertise* the fact that they‚Äôre using amateur or business band repeaters on GMRS. It‚Äôs *clearly* not something the FCC is particularly concerned about. 

The FCC has gone after some distributors and importers for selling unlocked radios. That seems to be where their priority is. They don‚Äôt want people searching ‚Äúwalkie talkie‚Äù on Amazon, buying a radio, and unwittingly keying up on an amateur, business, public service, or other frequency. But frankly they don‚Äôt seem concerned about someone taking the steps to modify a radio to transmit out of band in a way that is *otherwise legal*.

There are subreddits that are apolitical. There are subreddits that are politically neutral or moderate but it depends on your definition of either term since now we're entering a phase where something can be agreed across the political aisle until it is not. 

And then you have the political subs.

And finally, politics is a fact of life. Oh there is a subreddit where people talk about public transit and walkability? Guess what? Politics are involved because people in that subreddit have a vested interest to support those measures. Oh look, a subreddit where police officers like to post in? Oh look, a political thread because maybe those LEs have a vested interest in support of their careers.

Renly becoming king would've started a series of succession crisis and incidents all over the realm. If it was Stannis or Robert as king I think those conflicts could've easily been put down, but strength wasn't really Renly's fortitude and I don't see him charming/inspiring the Lords to stop these disputes. 

Also there's the succession. Many people seem to be under the impression that if he can't have kids bc of his sexuality then he'll go the Laenor/Rhaenyra way, and that seem to be completely opposite of his character. Renly is someone who is proud and egotistical. I don't believe for a second that he'd let Margaery get pregnant by someone else and pass that kid off as his own. Even if he did, he would care about that child just as much as he cared for Shireeen. And though Stannis didn't have a male heir of his own, Shireen probably would've been a lot more enticing offer to accept as heir than a son because hungry Lords could've used her to make their sons King consorts.",1714521678.0

Never finished high school in England so I've no GCSEs. Decided at 30 i wanted a career change and to work in medicine. 

With no high schooling, the Uni simply required me to do a diploma through college (this was the Unis own college but Tafe is just as good) which gave me the necessary entry. 

Because i did the diploma through the Unis own college, i didn't need to worry anything about actual ATAR, i just needed the pass mark they required to then transition (with credit) to the degree. 

Added an extra 18 months onto my education as a whole but I'm so much better for it and wayyyy ahead of others on the degree. 


Moral of the story, ATAR really is for high schoolers wanting to go straight to Uni. 
Do a college diploma in an area that will help you for your degree, maybe even get you RPL and credit for the first year. If i can bloody do it and end up with a 6 GPA, you sure as hell can üëçüèº",1714521678.0

You have come to the right place! Dis be ma JAM! *\[rubs hands gleefully together\]* You need to explore the oldies. The Classics. The Golden Age of musicals, and perhaps some of the more recent (but not in your lifetime. Necessarily) ones. These are my picks. Just the ones I like that have either pro-shots or movies available somewhere. 

* **On The Town** (Bernstein) 3 sailors have 24 hours in NY and meet 3 lovely ladies.
* **Oklahoma** (Rodgers & Hammerstein) Story about people in the new state of Oklahoma in 1906. Changed musicals forever. First show that did NOT start with a chorus line of pretty girls. The song ""Oh What a Beautiful Morning"" started OFFSTAGE, then Curly strode on to finish the song. Broadway was never the same.
* **Carousel** (Rodgers & Hammerstein) couple meet cute in New England in 1873; it does not exactly end well.
* **Annie Get Your Gun** (Irving Berlin) Annie Oakley, sharpshooter, joins Wild Bill Hickock's show and finds romance.
* **Brigadoon** (Lerner & Lowe) wealthy hunters in Scotland find a mysterious village which only appears for one day every 100 years.
* **Finian's Rainbow** (Harburg & Lane) Irish immigrants in the American South. And a leprechaun chasing his stolen pot of gold.
* **Kiss Me Kate** (Cole Porter) Two actors try to do a show (they're divorced). Hijinks ensue.
* **South Pacific** (Rodgers & Hammerstein) Sailors & nurses in the Pacific islands in WW2.
* **Guys & Dolls** (Frank Loesser) Romance, religion, and gambling in NYC's underbelly in 1939.
* **The King & I** (Rodgers & Hammerstein) Englishwoman goes to Siam to teach, meets king. It's complicated.
* **The Pajama Game** (Adler & Ross) Hijinks and romance in a pajama factory in the 1950's.
* **Damn Yankees** (Adler & Ross) Baseball and the devil in the 1950's (retelling of Faust).
* **My Fair Lady** (Lerner & Lowe) Retelling of Pygmalion; flower girl trained to speak like a duchess for a bet.
* **Cinderella** (Rodgers & Hammerstein). Best version is the one with Julie Andrews.
* **The Music Man** (Meredith Wilson) Con man sells boy's bands but falls in love (the original movie with Robert Preston is best).
* **Gypsy** (Jule Styne/Sondheim) Vaudeville child act as vaudeville is dying; story of Gypsy Rose Lee (the most famous stripper in the USA).
* **The Sound of Music** (Rodgers & Hammerstein) Novice in Austrian nunnery becomes nanny to seven children.
* **Camelot** (Lerner & Lowe) The tale of King Arthur and Guinevere. And Lancelot, of course.
* **A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum** (Sondheim) Hijinks in ancient Rome
* **Funny Girl** (Jule Styne) The life of a comedienne in the 1920's, the remarkable Fanny Brice, who was a self-made star.
* **Hello Dolly** (Jerry Herman) Romance and adventure in Yonkers & NYC in 1885. Many hijinks.
* **Cabaret** (Kander & Ebb) Love and heartbreak in prewar Berlin. 
* **Sweet Charity** (Cy Coleman) 10 cents a dance girl seeks love and wisdom.
* **Hair** (Galt McDermott) Free love and other hijinks in the hippy 1960's.
* **1776** (Sherman Edwards) The events surrounding the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This is a MUST see.
* **Company** (Sondheim) A bachelor in NYC in the 1970's learns how to love from his friends. The Neil Patrick Harris version is best.
* **Godspell** (Stephen Schwartz) Jesus and his buddies deal with Roman guards. It does not end well (as you know).
* **Pippin** (Stephen Schwartz) The discontented son of Charlemagne searches for his place.
* **Chicago** (Kander & Ebb) Murderesses in 1920's New York. Won an Oscar for Best Movie.
* **A Chorus Line** (Marvin Hamlisch) Auditions for a new show on Broadway.
* **Annie** (Charles Strouse) Orphans have adventures in 1920's NYC.
* **Evita** (Andrew Lloyd Webber) The life of Eva Peron, wife of the Argentine president.
* **Sweeney Todd** (Sondheim) The demon barber of Fleet Street. The movie's ok but the best is the film of the stage show.
* **Little Shop of Horrors** (Alan Menken) Plant terrorizes everyone at a small florist shop on Skid Row.
* **Seven Brides for Seven Brothers** (Johnny Mercer) 7 girls get kidnapped by 7 brothers. Yeah, it's sexist but those were the times.
* **Singin' In The Rain** (buncha peeps) Watch the original movie with Gene Kelly. A star relies on his dignity. Romance and hijinks ensue.
* **Sunday in the Park with George** (Sondheim). The life of French painter Georges Seurat. And his great-grandson. Maybe.
* **Into the Woods** (Sondheim) A baker and his wife must appease a witch to have a child.
* **Once Upon A Mattress** (Mary Rodgers) A retelling of Princess and the Pea. But funny.
* **The Producers** (Mel Brooks) Producers try a con which fails when their show succeeds. There's an older movie that is NOT a musical. You want the more recent one.
* **Tick, Tick ... Boom!** (Jonathan Larsen) From the guy who wrote Rent (which I don't like), a musical about his stress as he was turning 30 and was not yet a Broadway success. I like this one - watch the Netflix show with Andrew Garfield.
* **Hairspray** (Mark Shaiman) Baltimore in the 1960's, where hairspray - and racism - was endemic. The kids will lead the way.
* **Billy Elliot The Musical** (Elton John) A young lad in the rough mining area in Wales wants to dance. Dad does not agree. The show that launched Tom Holland (he was a Billy - there are always several - in the show in London's West End when he was quite young).
* **Matilda The Musical** (Tim Minchin) Kids take over a school and get rid of the horrid headmistress. There's the original movie, which is not a musical, and the more recent one, which is.
* **Newsies** (Alan Mencken) The story of the real paperboy's strike of 1899, somewhat fictionalized. Amazing dancing.
* **Come From Away** (Sankoff & Hein) What happened to a small town in Newfoundland on September 11th. Wonderful.
* **Waitress** (Sara Bareilles) A pregnant waitress navigates marriage to a bully and makes pies. Wonderful pies. Onstage.",1714521678.0

Isso √© o que alguns autores dessa sua lista v√£o trabalhar. Falando nela...

Se voc√™ √© leigo ou tem pouca experi√™ncia com literatura acad√™mica e humanidades, eu sugiro ler apenas o livro 1. A Lilia √© uma das grandes historiadoras nacionais, al√©m de escrever muito bem!

Se √© mais versado, O Povo Brasileiro √© uma obra prima e Raimundo Faoro leitura obrigat√≥ria dos cursos de Hist√≥ria.

"horrorlit","t5_2uvwj","Read the jacket of the book doofus. I‚Äôve read both but anyway it‚Äôs pretty clearly a book about possession. One of them is called HAUNTING the Buddha. What more needs to be said. This is the description of the other book, 

Since the 1960s, yoga has become a billion-dollar industry in the West, attracting housewives and hipsters, New Agers and the old-aged. But our modern conception of yoga derives much from nineteenth-century European spirituality, and the true story of yoga‚Äôs origins in South Asia is far richer, stranger, and more entertaining than most of us realize.

To uncover this history, David Gordon White focuses on yoga‚Äôs practitioners. Combing through millennia of South Asia‚Äôs vast and diverse literature, he discovers that yogis are usually portrayed as wonder-workers or sorcerers who use their dangerous supernatural abilities‚Äîwhich can include raising the dead, possession, and levitation‚Äîto acquire power, wealth, and sexual gratification. As White shows, even those yogis who aren‚Äôt downright villainous bear little resemblance to Western assumptions about them. At turns rollicking and sophisticated, Sinister Yogis tears down the image of yogis as detached, contemplative teachers, finally placing them in their proper context.",1714521680.0

"popheads","t5_39nwj","Honestly at the time LWYMMD came out, I was in grad school and it was a time when I was a bit disconnected and out of touch from celebrity gossip. That is my favorite Taylor Swift song, and I think it is her best music video and that album was her best era, but I only learned about all of the context afterwards. I always have found her music very bland and boring, and I have felt that way since, but Reputation was fun and interesting to me. My favorites are Beyonc√© and Ariana, and I couldn‚Äôt care less about Jay-Z or who the hell Becky with the Good Hair is, and I don‚Äôt understand why people care about Ethan Slater because I don‚Äôt know who the hell any of these people are. 

That said, I do agree with you and think you‚Äôre right. I think parasocial relationships are just a part of pop music at this point, and fostering parasocial relationships is a great way to gain massive popularity. At the end of the day, I just don‚Äôt get it. I think of Beyonc√© similarly to my mechanic. I went to him because he had great prices and worked very well and efficiently. I didn‚Äôt care about his personal life. I am dedicated to Beyonc√© because she‚Äôs filled my life with bops since I was 11 years old.",1714521680.0

It's not gatekeeping to do that.  


Everyone is mad about it,  but it's true. 

There's a lot of training and the whole ethics side that go into being a jeweller, someone who beads or wire wraps, even though jewellery is produced,  just has no idea about that.  It doesn't mean there isn't skill in those things,  it just doesn't make them jewellers.

Regardless,  I'm done with this because y'all just love your downvotes but what it really is is salt. If you want to call yourself a jeweller and bead to your hearts content,  the smithing police aren't coming so go right ahead,  but it's wrong to do so.  That's not gatekeeping, it's just fact.  It's like calling an apple an orange, both fruit,  but not the same. Doesn't make the orange a gatekeeper to say,  ""dude, you're not an orange,  you're an apple,  be happy as an apple.""

Then finally, my mom won visitation rights, but I still was only able to see her once a month. 
BTW - I wanted to state clearly on my mom‚Äôs behalf that she never did anything to deserve having her child taken from her. Just the sin of having a poor family. I found documents after my dad passed that showed they paid a disreputable old southern judge $10,000 dollars for me. And had this failed there was an airplane waiting at the local airport to fly me and my dad to Brazil, where the family had business interests‚Ä¶ 
I guess when you know what it‚Äôs like to truly be without one another, it‚Äôs harder to sweat the small things. 
Look , I know there are some pretty bad parents out there. I don‚Äôt mean to offend anyone. But we all have this parental measuring stick with standards so lofty no saint could possibly obtain what we think is our due. 
What I learned having a father who was the crappiest husband in the world, but the coolest father in the neighborhood (when he wasn‚Äôt pulling a drunk‚Ä¶), it‚Äôs ok to lower the bar some (no pun intended). It‚Äôs ok to just love them for the fallible humans they were/are. 
Now this is not to excuse the inexcusable - the child abusers, molesters and true narcissists, but just a reminder that there‚Äôs a difference between the parent who loves - albeit imperfectly, and these true monsters. 
Life is fleeting. Don‚Äôt waste it holding onto micro resentments and famial grudges that waste so much precious time. For those of you who are parents, who know what it means to love ‚Äúunconditionally‚Äù, extend this grace to those imperfect ones who want to love you back (and maybe those who don‚Äôt even know it).",1714521682.0

But if you can get back to zero you can find yourself with a year where can utilize 100% of this year's cap as well as utilize a portion of the cap borrowing against the future.

Cacao nibs and beans do contain caffeine, but in much smaller amounts compared to coffee. The caffeine content can vary depending on the form of cacao and how it‚Äôs processed. Generally, cacao is indeed also rich in theobromine which is a stimulant similar to caffeine but has a milder effect on the central nervous system.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","Some things to clarify and ask your closing attorney because this is jurisdiction specific: Technically you can step into ownership of this whenever you want if you have the cash. You‚Äôll be assuming the lien and judgement and would need to be compensated for that, a lender will not want to lend without clear title, and a title insurer will exclude these perils, but you could. Foreclosure of most kinds can typically be halted until it‚Äôs actually sold on the courthouse steps and even after, many states have a right of redemption where you can recover title by paying everyone off. If you‚Äôre ready to settle debts at face value or can borrow enough against the house to settle them on the condition that they are paid off by the escrow agent from loan proceeds, there‚Äôs no incentive for a foreclosing party not to accept that. They only get the cash value owed to them from the sale so why not take it immediately and risk free. As a debtor I believe you actually have a contractual right to pay your debts in any case. Getting the actual home requires a deed in lieu which both parties must agree to. 

All that said, the terribleness of this depends entirely on the size of the debt and if the price is discounted enough to pay it or can be. An underwater home requiring lender write down can take time and may not happen. A home about to be auctioned for HOA, water, or tax liens can often be purchased out of hand with no delay. Investors get the latter all the time. The title insurer and lender will just make their parts conditional on the payoff and signed release and the attorney/escrow agent will take care of it.",1714521682.0

You aren‚Äôt being evicted. The landlord can say what they want. You have a few options, and NONE of them involve him keeping your rent money.

1) If he wants you gone and you don‚Äôt want to stay, pick a date and sign an N11 together for mutual end of tenancy. He would owe you for any days not used, for example if you left on May 10, he would owe you the full last month rent plus the 20 days of rent left in May. If he refuses to pay the leftover, you‚Äôd have to take him to the board to get it back.

2) Give 60 days notice (you‚Äôd have to do it latest the day before you pay rent, so most likely today) and leave at the end of June. He cannot kick you or your subtenant out earlier than that. 

3) if you want to stay, ignore him, keep paying rent and wait for him to open a case with the LTB. Only the LTB can evict you, a landlord does not have the authority by themself to evict tenants.

3) Leave whenever and surrender your money, which you seem to be leaning towards throwing in the towel.",1714521683.0

My friend was ready to fight and die since a new character would get new magic items. I saw the only logical RP choice being to give up the items and go. It instantly made it clear how weak characters were at high levels without every slot being filled with a high level magic item.

My point about suicide was that many more women lose their lives due to suicide rather than homicide and yet there is far less focus on suicide as a cause of death.

I strongly support the idea that no one, man or woman, should be the victim of homicide. My contention is that this focus on female homicide victims is that compared to all the other causes if death it affects a very small number. I'm not saying we should do nothing about it, I'm not saying that at all, I'm saying let's talk about it proportionately to all the other avoidable causes of death that occur for both men and women.",1714521684.0

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I have VERY strong reservations about this. Ever since they started talking about this, i had a bad bad feeling about this. I am pro legalization, but heres the problem, and what worries me the most.

It being schedule 3, that returns it to not only the control of the DEA, but also the FDA. This means that every state, all 38 states where it is currently legal for medical or recreational, it will now be ILLEGAL in those states. This is going to instantly reverse every single state law that states have been fighting for for years. Dispensaries will be instantly raided/shut down. Same with farms.

It will be under direct regulation of the FDA. They are going to have full control of who can prescribe it and for what. They will be in full control of all regulations. There will be competition, no choices. You will only have access to what they allow you to, and for what they allow you to. Will they outlaw flower? Concentrates? Edibles? Will you ONLY be able to get it in tinicture or pill form?

What about thc limits? Will they have a limit on 5mg per edible? 5-10% thc for flower? Only allowed to have ""X"" amount per month prescribed? I have absolutely ZERO faith that they are going to just leave the industry alone as it is. That is NOT going to happen. It would be no different then a state ""legalizing"" any other prescription narcotic. Nowhere in the country can you just go buy percicets, xanax, codeine etc. Every other rx medication is made by like 2 different pharmacitical companies. You will have no choice in quality, strain, potency nothing.

People who are celebrating this have no idea that this is going to be a big loss to the movement and is going to totally cripple the industry. If they choose, the FDA can decide it can only be prescribed to people in the most extreme circumstances, effectively making it illegal nationwide, in every single state all over again.

And if you think this is the ""1st step"" in full on legalization and removal from the controlled substance act altogether, your going to be in for a rude awakening. Now that it has been reclassified, there is virtually no chance of it ever being legal again. They knew exactly what they are doing. By reclassifying it and ""legalizing"" it, all they did was make it federally illegal in every state.",1714521684.0

"AMD_Stock","t5_3fr05","I don't think saying AMD has been supply constrained is the right take away. Lisa was carefully to refocus the customer engaged and ramping stages and how this is an expected part of the ramp. It may well be that some larger customers would have bought more sooner in the ramp, but it's just as likely that they have had more of their early ramp supply allocate to the sampling and workload optimization phases while they get to full production ramp. I certainly was hoping to here more about a pull forward and refresh, but nothing they said today is inconsistent with their prior guide. They always said the ramp would hit full production speed 2H. Saying they are supply constrained before they fully rampped is kinda an unfair spin. 

Lisa's answer about the raod map was interesting. Certainly confirmed there were MI300 variant products that will be announced in the comming months and so still many questions as to what and when and how many and can they further increase the current year guide. I'm also glad she didn't shy away from saying AMD can absolutely complete in the Mega AI DC space and it certainly isn't a winner take all situation.",1714521686.0

like the Yakuza games all take place in 1 city and every street is packed full of content, while games like Fallout and Botw has large patches of empty nothingness

monster hunter games are go into this specific area and hunt X monster if it becomes open world it would technically be the same but the map would look strange since it might have frozen wasteland next to a lush forest connected to a volcano but i cant complain

actually the main gameplay wont change much lol. it would still be accept quest -> teleport to nearest camp -> kill monster -> go home

"Quest3","t5_3xggxe","Hey there, /u/Fragrant_Delay_4170! We certainly don't want that debris/moisture warning on your headset to continue to pull you out of the virtual world, so we popped in to share some steps to properly clean your headset below:  

Required Equipment:  
- A disposable Soft Bristle Toothbrush.
- The toothbrush must be New and Dry to avoid recontamination of the USB port.
- Paper towel, Napkin or a dry cleaning cloth  

Warning:  
- Do not use a pre-pasted toothbrush!
- Do not use any liquid or solvent such as isopropyl, bleach..
- Wear gloves, safety glasses or a face shield.
- Discard the toothbrush after cleaning

Instructions:  
1. Power off the device. Remove all accessories.
2. In a circular motion, brush and clean inside the USB-C port using the soft bristle toothbrush.
3. Make sure the toothbrush bristles are getting deep inside the connector and moving around the inner tongue.
4. Do not over-press down on the toothbrush.
5. In a scooping motion, use the toothbrush to help the liquid come out of the USB-C port.
5. Use a paper towel or a dry cloth to absorb and clean the liquid and debris around the port.
6. Let the device dry at room temperature in a well ventilated area for at least 1 hour (varies).
7. Do not connect a USB cable to the device until the port is completely dry.
8. Do not attempt to charge and do not use the device until the USB-C port is completely dry.
9. Alternatively, use a Compressed Air can to blow inside the USB-C port with 3 bursts. (Safety glasses and PPE must be worn per manufacturing recommendation)

Ultimately, opinions vary. In your situation, some folks would use one (sci-fi/fantasy erotica), or two (sci-fi + fantasy or light + dark), or four. Though, I suspect that most would not *actually* run four, and instead focus on one or two of those subgenres.

That's the information you should care about. The rest is my own -- largely meaningless -- opinion. I've only been doing this a month, so there's no reason to expect that I have any better idea than you do. :)

I, personally, opted to use a single pen-name and only write sci-fi tentacle porn. I do both taboo (dubcon) and non-taboo (consentacles!) with the same name. I'm trusting my blurbs and tags to help readers differentiate if they only want one or the other, but I suspect many readers want both.

If I were to start in on fantasy as well... I'm not sure. I would consider starting a new pen. But I would also just consider using a different font for my name on the cover. It would probably depend on how similar the themes were, despite the setting.",1714521687.0

The effort to kill an unarmed human, who is essentially a non-threat, is too much. You can walk into a concrete structure and demolish it, kill and excavator in one punch, so you should be able to flatten these dudes under your feet just by walking over them. No need to wind up a punch or stomp attack.


The demolition is pretty cool, but it seems purely cosmetic. I would like to do things like destroy a building to kill the soldiers that are shooting from the roof or pick up I-beams from the wreckage to use as weapons.

There are some visual bugs, like the excavator destruction left behind a lot of floating geometry.

While we don't have access to the specific decision-making process behind this change, it's possible that Coinbase implemented the ""Preview Buy"" button to provide users with an additional step to review their orders before execution. This may be intended to help prevent accidental or unintended trades.

However, we understand that in the context of Coinbase Advanced, where time is crucial, an extra click can be a significant inconvenience. It's important for platforms to strike a balance between usability and providing necessary features.

"cyberpunkgame","t5_3az7x","Yeah, I sort of have an answer. You can actually see that the arrivals deck and departures deck are both on the same side of that NCart elevator and the ‚Äúkeycard‚Äù access level would be lower and on the opposite side. There is a walkway there that goes to the NCPD station by MB H10 and you can get up to it by jumping onto the roof.  

From the Bradbury and Buran fast travel, cross the street, up the stairs, turn left on Boreas go up a set of stairs to a walkway, jump onto the tent, then the satellite dish then across to the building towards MB H10. I used the awnings to get a bit of height then jumped to the NCPD rooftop (red AV parking lot?). You can access the walkway from up there. 

The elevator terminal is still ‚Äúlocked‚Äù but it says ‚ÄúNCPD‚Äù when you see it from that side. If you follow the walkway it comes out in the roof where there appear to be a bunch of AV parking spots but no AVs. 

Hook a hard left and the walkway continues (overlooking Bradbury St.) then ends in a dead-end gate (doesn‚Äôt even scan). 

My guess is this was part of something (maybe an interior to the NCPD station that ended up as cut content.",1714521688.0

Jokic -- still a fucking ridiculous player.  Not getting any less ridiculous.

Steph -- has anyone mentioned he's pretty good at shooting the 3 ball?  Probably worth a digression!

The Suns -- just as big fucked as they were the second they signed Beal.

The Lakers -- jesus wept, if these nepo babies understood team construction they'd likely still be playing.  Let's all watch as Jeanie uses a Ouija board, an old babysitter, her brunch friends, and a cluster of people with no obvious qualifications to make basketball decisions.

"DuggarsSnark","t5_fl4tn","Just want to gently comment here as a snarker AND mother of a daughter who died in utero at 36 weeks: 

I am appreciative when public figures bring attention to infant death, stillbirth, miscarriage, child death‚Äîa life event that is so poorly supported because it is so hard and uncomfortable to confront for anyone outside of the experience. Chrissy Tiegen, Thor Bj√∂rnsson, Cristiano Ronaldo, for instance come to mind. 

I had to gently remind myself that ‚Äúunderstanding that everyone grieves differently‚Äù is not equivalent to accepting that style of grieving when I read your post. 


What a privilege it is for you to be able to unfollow and turn away from this type of grief; a privilege to be able to judge without knowing the agony of the most isolating type of loss; or the absolute need for individualized and sometimes open grieving in a tone deaf society. 

Entire organizations (Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep)exist to document and create portraiture for these families as keepsakes because, case in point, society does a shit job supporting and accepting open dialogue and expression from families with dead babies. Infant and child death is often gruesome, always uncomfortable, internally dissonant and unbelievably heavy to perceive because it‚Äôs such a huge universal reverse in how life should go. The loss of life‚Äôs potential cannot be measured, and so commensurate the grief. 

If your judgement is based without knowing the prevalence of still birth (2021, USA 1:25000) and the concomitant societal silence, then your ignorance is seen and your responsibility to amend‚Äîbut again a privilege that you‚Äôre on the outside and able to unfollow. 

If otherwise, I am interpreting your judgement about someone else‚Äôs grief expression as a reflection of emotional immaturity. Sadly this will only deepen the trench for those in society who are isolated and already chastised for their grief expression. 

I would draw your attention to pre Industrial Revolution and turn of the century photography practices of photographing dead family members, especially children. I would further draw your attention to the modern public grieving practices of tattoo portraiture, obituary photographs, memorials in the form of gardens or state parks, and other public expressions of grief. Are these performative? Are they‚Ä¶.for you? 

To say, ‚Äúthis is my child, they existed‚Äù may seem simple‚Äîbut it certainly is not because often times the parents are the only ones keeping that child‚Äôs memory in the present. (Again, others have the privilege to just unfollow).  

I would also draw your attention to inwardly reflect, and find space to consider that there is a finite number of pictures families can take with their dead children before burial; there will be no other opportunities. There will be no first birthday party, school pictures, vacation pictures to come. 
 
Photography of dead children is not performative . It is the historical and sentimental documentation of a child‚Äôs life and represents a completely normal behavior for parents. 

To not grieve, to not process or document or share about this major life event would be abnormal. 

Open to DMs if anyone here needs resources for navigating stillbirth or infant loss. 

Not here to receive condolences with my own personal experience.",1714521690.0

[Analysis]>!This is one of the reasons why I'm a fan of the ""Kyubey is a metaphor for internal logic"" theory. It explains why he must grant her wish, why he's so unconcerned and unemotional, plus more, like how is it that Kyubey can lie or mislead. (Doesn't your own internal logic lead you astray or leave out important information too?) I mean, being a metaphor (and arguably a concept, like MadoKami) isn't incompatible with being a hivemind... But I hesitate to call Kyubey a literal alien, especially since so many of the lessons you can draw from him and his interactions *also* apply to real life, where, notably, there are no aliens (as far as we know).!<",1714521691.0

AWD is different from 4x4, with AWD the truck puts the power where it's needed and cuts down on excess when it's not, with 4x4 all 4 wheels get locked to the same speed at all times.  The fact that they get used interchangeably by the industry adds to that confusion.",1714521693.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So in my mind the last 4 years or so have been a wipeout for whatever reason (UK here but I know trumps getting abused worse than an unwanted ginger stepchild) q

To add to that we had 4 years of essential daily abuse against him, likely way unfounded, he just was not, at all, what the hierarchy wanted in charge (WHO, WEF etc)

Which brings me to my next question, how did Joe Biden get away with what is clearly extortion or embezzlement (you could probably add Bush, Clinton, Obama to this list) in Ukraine?

Also, how can Hunters laptop be Russian propaganda, yet Fox news was asked to take down ""personal information"" if it was never him in the first place? Questionable AF

To completely top my random thoughts off, why is it that maybe, 30 countries or so?, are firing money into Ukrainian aid, knowing undoubtedly, that it will hit the American war machine eventually

Is it Biden? Trump? I don't really know or care at this point to he totally honest

As I mentioned, UK here, but half of Europe has funneled billions to Ukraine, in a roundabout way this is essentially just warmongering 

Same as 1918 with the Balfour agreement, 1948 with the inception of Israel which, I could be wrong, brings about the end of days in the Bible.

I'm just sat here slamming my head into a wall and thinking, how the fuck did we not see this coming?

Essentially we've been cuckolded into a state of ""keep me safe"" while ignoring that this is not the intentions of the higher ups, we're just being told how to think, feel, act, respond, by increasingly disbelieveable talking heads who have no skin in the game in the first place

And no, this is not just a go at the US, the UK is doing the same too but with even more derisable cunts, literally, the world is falling apart, so again, what the actual fuck guys",1714521694.0

Also, you guys have been dating a few months, compared to the lifetime he knew his dad. Maybe he just doesn't feel close enough yet to rely on you in that kind of way.

I'm surprised at your ages that you have never had a partner that lost a parent before. Unless you are way younger than him.

2. Mentally ill people didn't do anything to deserve their illness. They just happen to be ill and they deserve treatment. 

3. Once you start treatment, there's no guarantee you won't have a knock back. Even if you do all the right things. You're not attention seeking, you're a patient on their way to recovery. 

4. Anyone can suffer from trauma. We all have different thresholds and triggers. Pretending that someone 'can't have trauma because they didn't live a horrific experience' is negating their experience when they just need to be in a position where they can cope. 

5. OCD isn't cute, and BPD or schizophrenia aren't automatically dangerous.

6. And finally, we all have mental health, and we all run the risk of mental health imbalance. For some, that results in stress and mild anxiety. For others, treatment in dedicated facilities under close supervision. Either way, we all need to look after our mental health like we do our physical health.",1714521695.0

I was ovulating before, but I felt quite inconsistent. I use to feel as though I'd skip every other period. Period one month, weird long cycle with only sings lf spotting the next.

For the liver support, she has prescribed DIM (I just purchased it from Pure Encapsulations, but I'm unfamiliar with it). As well as NAC + Glycine powder.

For the fatigue, anxiety, and lack of dopamine, she prescribed me Rhodiola.

My new dose of progesterone (this one is oral) is 100mg day 15-28 and 50mg day 5-14.

I recommend the Dutch test (unfairly expensive, I'm so sorry to say) to really get a proper idea of how your body is fairing and what it needs. These recommendations are customized to my results.

Benimaru Shinmon (Fire Force)

Hero Name: Moonlight Mask

Quirks: Solar Eclipse

* He has the ability to create his own fire and control fire. He can use fire that naturally ignited and other Pyrokinetics flames for his own or something more common control the direction and speed of bullets by its heat or ignition. He uses matois (a flag that was used in the edo period by firemen to indicate fires) as a weapon of combat; igniting and controlling the flames on the flag. He can use the matoi as a pole to fly to long-distance areas, and by using his Second Generation ability, can control the flames of other ignited matoi and direct them to a certain place. Benimaru is also highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat, that people thought he had third quirk of super strenght.  Benimaru is a practitioner of the iaido martial arts. Instead of using a sword, he can create a sharp blade of flames on the palm of his hand and strike his foes, a technique branching from his unique Iai Hand-Sword: First Form (Â±ÖÂêàÊâãÂàÄ Â£±„ÉéÂûã, Iaido Shut≈ç Ichi no Kata) fighting style. Utilizing his Iai Hand-Sword: Seventh Form, Benimaru creates a ring of fire behind him that he throws into his opponents. He has many different techniques related to the sun and moon like Fire Moon, Red Sun, Moolight, Sunset and his ultimate technique, Crimson Moon's Sun Wheel.

>!My frown deepens. ‚ÄúUh huh.‚Äù !<

>!‚ÄúThe thing is, it wasn‚Äôt working when Ben used our samples to inseminate her artificially, so we all‚Ä¶‚Äù Gunnar closes his eyes and looks as if he‚Äôs bracing for impact. ‚ÄúI fucked her. We all did. At the same time. Well, one after the other, but‚Äî‚Äù He shakes his head and balls his fists like he wants to punch himself, and I‚Äôm almost disappointed when he doesn‚Äôt. !<

>!‚ÄúI feel awful about it,‚Äù he declares, meeting my eyes with visible levels of shame and remorse. ‚ÄúNot about helping my friends,‚Äù he clarifies, ‚Äúbut because the whole time I was helping them and doing this thing, I was pretending it was you. I was imagining it was you I was breeding, and I wanted it so badly to be true. But it wasn‚Äôt you, and I feel so fucking guilty.‚Äù !<

>!I stare at him, too stunned to move or speak. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing it again,‚Äù he states firmly. ‚ÄúI want you to know that. They can have my seed, but I can‚Äôt do that again. I can‚Äôt keep burying my emotions and denying what I feel for you anymore, Jem. It‚Äôs making me fucking crazy, and I can‚Äôt get through the day without my need for you making every fucking moment torturous because I can‚Äôt be with you.‚Äù!<



And here are some parts from the second book:

>!Gunnar raises his hand. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre able to, are we allowed to fuck her more than once?‚Äù!<

>!‚ÄúWho‚Äôs going to milk me fir‚Äî‚Äù Gunnar‚Äôs on his knees in a rush, and before my next breath, he‚Äôs flicking my nipple with his tongue. I‚Äôm so sensitive and needy I can‚Äôt help my gasp, or the way my legs twist together.!<

>!The milk drips down my body and into the water, and Gunnar steps closer, his eyes huge, as his massive cock jerks at me. Ben‚Äôs voice is low and husky in my ear. ‚ÄúGunnar likes your milky tits, beautiful.‚Äù!<

And TSE shows it's possible, if someone's in a springlock costume, for someone else to manually trigger the springlocks from outside the costume if they get close enough, and since Henry trusts William before Charlie's death, it wouldn't be hard for William to get close enough",1714521696.0

There could be many reasons for infection. Usually you could test for markers in your blood work (c-reactive protein, PV, ESR, etc).

If nothing has really changed in your life/diet I‚Äôd ask your doctor to do a full blood panel and check for infections/inflammations.

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","[Mohair deep dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xckRKk0h5dM) (30min) - the man himself demoing many sounds in this link.

After a lot of hard work and testing, today Howard Gee (ex-Catalinbread) and crew have released the 3rd KittycasterFX pedal  The Mohair Fuzzstortion.

I‚Äôve been looking forward to this for quite a while now, ever since it was announced I was thinking it would maybe be something like a complete revision to the Katzenkonig but when I found out it was a Muff + Range Master I was immediately geeking out, then I heard Howard demoing the pedal and the appeal was virtually instant.. I already own and love their Groovy Wizard fuzz, a pedal that exudes a level of craftsmanship that is apparent the moment you begin playin. I‚Äôve never come across a fuzz that is so perfect, I use the Wizard for everything ranging from light edge of breakup, med gain leads all the way to some of the best sounding fuzz tones that I‚Äôve ever pulled out of my guitar. 

Kittycaster is a local company so the shop nearest to me had a few of these Mohairs in stock‚Ä¶ 3 minutes playing one was all it took.. good god damn this is such a clean, perfect, fat, seamless Muff-esque distortion that adds so much muscle and huge sustain, I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that this Mohair pedal adds *so* much power to every little thing you play. This is what a perfect Big Muff sounds like in my dreams, the eq, the articulation, all the pitfalls that plague my fav fuzz circuit remedied here, made better, and the sustain‚Ä¶. Howard made a joke about this pedal having an e-bow mode and I can easily replicate that crazy sustain, this pedal sounds, feels and plays so effortlessly. I can‚Äôt wait to start recording with this! If you love muff fuzzes until you play live or record and then start ripping your hair out after 30 min of EQ tweaking still leaves you unhappy, this is undeniably the pedal for you.

Some more info:

https://www.kittycasterfx.com/products/mohair

*Continuing our quest for the ultimate in sound + response is Mohair, a five-transistor fuzz/distortion that delivers a refined take on the classic muffy tone. Mohair gives you thick walls of sound and fat, sustaining leads but while retaining a more open, touch-sensitive response.

What if we want to help out another nation... in 2003 the EU sent a 400 strong observer force into Macedonia. Ireland was asked to provide a small number of troops but the max we could send was 12 because any more than that required a UN mandate which requires the 5 permanent members of the UN security Council agree.  China vetoed the granting of a mandate and Ireland was unable to send our troops.  

More recent civilian and military evacuations from Libya, Afghanistan and Congo all required begging partner nations to provide security and transport for our people as we were unable to send over large numbers of troops and equipment to help. 

It has to go. 

Govt can still choose independently to only send personnel on large international military missions if there is a UN mandate but why enshrine it in a ridiculous policy like this that prevents other important missions from being carried out? 

UN security Council hasn't mandated a new UN mission for over a decade apparently. üôÑ",1714521697.0

"psat","t5_2ta12","I got a perfect PSAT score of 240 back in 2005 (my junior year of high school). I remember, I missed one question, on the Writing/Verbal section, and they classified the questions as ""easy, medium, or hard"" and the one question that I missed was an ""easy"" one. I'm not sure of the statistics, but when I took it I believe there were only approximately 1.5 million high school juniors who sat for the test. The private school I went to had us take it our freshman and sophomore years as practice. Interestingly, My freshman year I got a 198, then increased by 21 to a 219 my sophomore year. I remember joking that, as 21 is my favorite number (I was born at 2:21 on 2/21, and I was grandchild number 21 to my maternal grandparents who had 6 children, including my mother) and I had increased my score by 21, I told my friend that I just needed another increase of 21 to get a perfect score. Interestingly, our dean called me to the office, and my mother was there, which tripped me out because she was a teacher, and for her to leave class for ANYTHING other than a suspension or expulsion type of thing was incomprehensible to me. My junior year I had started smoking weed with a few friends, and as upperclassmen were allowed to leave campus for lunch, we spent our 40 minutes getting high and eating at my house or my friend's house (both of us have a parent who is a physician, and another parent who works all day). I thought I was getting in trouble for that. And my mother was trying to look mad, but was trying to hold back a smile. 

Basically, my dean told me that he had spoke to my mother and that other students and teachers had complained about my friends and I coming back for our afternoon classes extremely high and reeking of weed, and had been seen hitting a pipe while still on school grounds. He told me to ""keep it off school property"" and then moved on, telling me that they had received our PSAT scores. He asked me if I knew what the highest score (at the time) was. I told him, ""yeah, 240"" and he asked what I thought I got. I hesitantly responded ""230?"" and he indicated with his finger that it was higher, so I guessed again, ""235?"" and he handed the score report to me. I actually wasn't surprised, as the day I took the exam I had minor surgery on one of my big toes, to remove the growth plate from under the nail as I kept getting ingrown nails despite having properly fitting shoes. When my mom asked how I thought I did, I had told her that I didn't think I missed any questions. She expected me to score high enough to receive a full National Merit Finalist scholarship ($5,000 a semester for 8 consecutive semesters), but she though I was just ""bragging"" or being cocky. I really weas more pissed that I missed an ""easy"" question rather than a medium or hard one, as I felt that, even though it was based on percentiles, I didn't deserve a perfect score after having missed a question. 

My dean said he had never seen one of them before in his career. I celebrated after school with a fat blunt with my friends. I went to University of Kansas (as a native Kansan, I was obsessed with the Jayhawks and the school. I had over 20 AP and college dual-enrollment credits transferred, and I graduated with a BS in biochemistry and a BGS in psychology, and was accepted to medical school afterwards. I haven't smoked weed, despite it being legal where I am and THC and/or delta-8 being legal in Kansas. But I definitely continued to during my undergraduate years, with a high school friend of mine from a different high school and a year older than I being a dealer who sold to the entire KU basketball team.",1714521698.0

This post does not appear to have your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post**  You must  **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfie.**  Our rules are found here https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/index/   Reddit's rules state read the rules before posting in our community.   

If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  The age must be in number form and not spelled out: *25 not Twenty-Five*  **Gender is not required to be in your title**

You may have seen a few posts on r/Selfie without an age in the title, let us explain.   When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification.

sobre as pessoas n√£o questionarem a pr√≥pria verdade eu concordo, √© realmente triste o estado que est√°, os ignorantes est√£o cheios de raz√£o e os s√°bios est√£o cheio de d√∫vidas, se questionar exige introspec√ß√£o, e as muita gente tem uma vida que ou n√£o deixa isso acontecer pq a pessoa t√° sempre fazendo algo, ou simplesmente diz que isso √© ruim com aquelas frase ""cabe√ßa vazia √© oficina do diabo""",1714521699.0

Drop-in tutoring.

Group study session with others in the class.

Go back and redo problem sets you already completed, fixing mistakes and reinforcing as you go.

Use the ""rubber duck method"" for problem solving. Explain to someone else (with internal dialog) as much as you can about how you think you should approach the problem, as if you were teaching someone else. Just the process of explaining can often help jump start ideas for how to proceed.

If you are stuck on a problem, try to construct the closest problem to the original one that you do know how to solve. Then try to figure out how to bridge the gap from what you do know back to the original problem.",1714521699.0

When it comes down to it, what really has this woman done that is so damn terrible? Had a shitty fight with Carole? Tried to create other shows post HW and failed? Began the reality reckoning - which tbh has merit in a lot of ways, but because she was the face, it was terrible? 

I've seen posts made specifically to talk about how she has no friends and I'm sitting here like *fucking why?* How does inciting a conversation about someone else's lack of connection entertain you? 

On her latest podcast episode she actually addressed that. She mentioned the dressing down Ramona gave her on the bridge and she said something to the effect of ""Yeah, Ramona was right. I have an extremely hard time trusting people and letting anyone in because growing up I got so burned so badly so many times that I keep my circle tight AF to protect myself."" It broke my heart to hear it because that's me too and thank fucking God there isn't a mob of people with keyboards at the ready to pour salt on that wound.   

So yeah, watching people salivate over the opportunity to cut her down for things like that is really hard and I have to step away before I find myself in the mud with them.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Take everything I post with a grain of salt, and play what you think will be the most fun, and make the most sense. However, I'm going to give you some fantastic pointers, and clarifications for your build/concept in general. These are not the end-all-be-all's to consider, but they'll surely give you tons of ""bang for your buck"" so to speak.

Races: (We're assuming Monsters of the Multiverse versions here, but we can, if I'm not too lazy... include regular optimal ones as well, as an addendum at the end, a la honorable mention.)

* Bugbear: This one is an odd-duck. You'll benefit from surprise attack even in Wild Shape, which since you're level 20, should be *always*, but many DMs might not allow the long-limbed feature to function since you're no longer a bugbear in form. If they do allow it to function (which I think should be RAW)... then profit.

* Eladrin/Shadar-Kai: Again, Fey Step/BotRQ *should* work while in Wild Shape. If the DM says no, then skip. If yes (should be RAW), then porting into melee as a Moon Druid is obviously a great option, as is porting out of a bad spot or into a better one. Decide if you want resistance to all damage, or one of the special ""seasonal"" effects. (I like Shadar-Kai more, IMO.)

* Githzerai: Getting the Shield spell on a Moon Druid, even once per Long rest is fantastic, but you specifically can cast it with normal spell slots, which you have a lot of, and use less of than the more traditional Druid... AC is something all Druids have to contend with due to Wild Shape often having terrible AC, but since you're level 18+ you can cast while in Wild Shape.

* Halfling (Ghostwise): Either version works, the standard version is about as idyllic as either version. Lucky (Halfling Luck) should work even while you're in Wild Shape and often a natural 1 is one of the worst things to happen to a Druid. Ghostwise nets you a way to communicate while Wild Shaped, which normally (even despite Beast Spells) you don't *really* have a way of doing so.

* Human (Variant): You don't *need* an additional feat, but it is soooo hard to simply pass up to just not justify putting this here. There are a ton of great choices that can make a solid concept even better. Alert, Observant, Dungeon Delver, Resilient, and more... while not game breaking are niche and defining options.

Feats: (We're assuming point-buy as a moderate here, if you roll and roll well... even better, if you roll poorly, then not as ideal... consider options based on that.)

* Alert: Going first is a great option. Going first if you're a Bugbear is *almost* a requirement. :chuckle: Since you're not as reliant on Dex as other classes, getting a flat +5 via a feat is a nice way to improve your initiative without attribute investment, and being immune to Surprise is just icing on the cake.

* Mobile: If your DM says the +10 speed applies to Wild Shape (it *should* but table variance happens...) then fan-freaking-tastic. If not, that sucks, but the ""proto-Disengage"" is likely almost worth the feat investment anyways since you'll often want to move around the field and hit as many enemies as possible depending on form.

* Resilient (Con): This isn't because you *have* a low/odd Con, it is because having a crappy Con save is bad in general... and having a little buffer is *never* a bad idea. Set your ""humanoid"" Con to 13, advance it to 14. Never touch it again.

* Observant: Aiming to get that 20 in Wisdom, but the flat +5s are a decent perk since you're likely to have/want several Wis/Int skills and have a decent score in Int (notably because you can ""ignore"" Str/Dex/Con largely).

Wild Shapes: (Level(s) 18, 19, and 20 grant you access to CR 6 (infinite) Wild Shape. Shapechange is like a *superior* Wild Shape but is limited (typically) to once or twice during an adventuring day, but ultimately lends to CR 20 options. I'll include some honorable mentions for this specifically.)

* Having unlimited access to Elemental Shapes makes them *solid* choices. (Depending on what form is required/desired.) And since you can Wild Shape from the same form into a new ""same"" form, you effectively never have to *not* be in Wild Shape. (Unless sleeping.)

* Mammoth.

* Everything else is niche and based on party optimization (scouting, stealth, etc...) or environmental optimization (giant crocodile/shark...). But, the two above will 1000% (almost always) be all that you'll ever need in combat as a Moon Druid. Solid alternatives depending on terrain might include the Brontosaurus or the Titanothere, assuming your DM has allowed that your Druid has seen either or both of these.

Items:

* Belt of Giant Strength (Storm): A lot of the larger, higher CR creatures will have a decent Strength. IIRC none of them will touch 29 though. So this will always scale well, and since you can wear it while in Wild Shape, all of your forms will have the Strength set to 29. Requires attunement, but that's fine because it is one of the best items you can have.

* Tome of Understanding: So... bear with me here. Archdruids are effectively super super long-lived. You *slow* your aging to about... 1/10th at 20th level. Meaning that you could eventually grow to be 1000-2000 years old (or more, *way* more) depending on your race. (Probably closer to 500-1000 depending on some factors... and not one of the Elven races.) But, that is still more than enough time to have used the Tome 5x and gotten your Wisdom from 20 to the hard cap of 30.

* Barrier Tattoo (Very Rare): Sets your AC to 18... always. Even in Wild Shape (and all of your cool new forms have a really cool design/tattoo on their skin, scales, fur, whatever. If you chose the Githzerai as your race, this means an effective AC of 23 *most* of the time. Absolutely ""OP"" on a Druid.

* You have 1 more slot for attunement with the three items above, and 3 more items of very rare or lesser rarity to choose from. Look at what you *can* use while Wild Shaped, and then what you *want* to use for your build/concept and choose the rest from there.

Remember, now that you're 18+ level in Druid, you can 100% cast spells *while* you are Wild Shaped. This isn't always the ""right"" action(s) to take, but it isn't a terrible choice (depending on spell), and unlike the previous 17 levels you at least have the *option* of spells. Solid choices are long-lasting or even short term buffs... or options like Foresight, Shapechange, Reverse Gravity, Draconic Transformation (""lesser"" Shapechange, IMO), Heal, Investiture of Stone/Wind (but almost any of these spells), Stone Shape/Transmute Rock/Wall of Stone... and finally, Polymorph. Just pay attention to spells that have explicit material component costs. That is the one snafu in an otherwise amazing ""new"" feature. (Beast Spells)

Obviously *any* spell can change the face of a battle, and being smart about their usage is key/critical. But as a Druid you have some *game changers*... less so than a pure Wizard, but no less idyllic overall. Doubly so when it comes to sheer TERRAIN alteration. Obviously.",1714521702.0
"twinpeaks","t5_2rodn","The Dougie people have a problem with is not really even Dougie, Its Cooper's right brain. His emptional capacity, without cognition. The isolated left brain is cold and calculated, entirely self-serving in whatever way is most efficient.. (meaning it's Mr. C). Notice, he isn't evil, kiling everyone in sight or cultivating evil like Windom Earle described of the Dugpas. He takes and does what he wants, coldly, like a machine. I think people tend to miss that. 

It's also very connected to why I think Cooper messes up at the end. It's not hubris over saving Laura. That was a plan involving the higher faculties (Fireman, and Dido),  the hubris was now in trying to pinch off a piece of himself (some of his emotional capacity) and give it to Janey and Sonny Jim.  This left him without the care he needed to show Diane, when they attempted to make the Moonchild of Carrie Page. It's why she had to cover his eyes because he now reminded her of Mr.C and her memory of how his eyes looked when HE came to her.   That is what messed things up. notice both Carrie and Cooper are entirely indifferent to the dead body in her living room.. like father, like daughter. little emotion to pass on. 

I suspect there is a weird balance of things in the universe going on here too. while Cooper has less emotion, his left brain has less self serving nature to it as well, and this is because we see him burning in the lodge after being shot by Lucy. He has been put into the refining fire, like Jungisn shadow work, or the alchemical furnace. The evil self serving aspect of theogical side, shed, and its cold calculating aspect kept.  So both sides are missing their extremes in ""Richard""..",1714521702.0

For instance one of the cholera ghosts can actually be heard by livings when they whisper in their ear but none of the upstairs ghosts know about it. It would be a great gag. 

Another one is Ancestor Spirits. A guest arrives with what everyone thinks is a poltergeist but they find out that the person can actually summon spirits of their ancestors to inadvertently rely on their expertise and experience. Sam and Jay figure out how to do it so Sam can spend some time with her mom, and Jay is trying to channel a dead relative who was a great cook to help with his menu.

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","Welp, I'm done. I wish you all the best mate keep doing what works for you. The irony, besides refuting empirical evidence with your anecdotal experiences, is that your example fits perfectly into the food palatability reward hypothesis. Hyper-palatable foods are ice-cream, cookies, pizza etc. Not fruit and whole grains or any of the foods you eat. You're not eating hyper-palatable foods that give you a dopamine hit and encourage you to keep eating them, thus making you fat. Which is the entirety of the hypothesis. 

Dismissing studies because the researchers have a ""carb ideology"" is hilarious. Also, your understanding of insulin is just wrong. It doesn't account for distinctions between monophasic, incessant increase, and biphasic glucose responses. Telling people to avoid carbs because carbs bad insulin spike forever fat is not nuanced at all. Even if you eat a ton of instant oatmeal, twice, your blood glucose will be back below 0, aka burning fat, in 120 minutes.

If the dad was a pedophile how come they didn‚Äôt find any underage materias in the thousands of files they were able to recover?
Also only a few of those thousands were of asian girls and as i mentioned before the investigators said those images weren‚Äôt outstanding from the other material. He simply had a lot of porn, which honestly checks out with a recently divorced middle aged man.


How can you tell she was drugged in those pictures? They seem like they were playing around and she was playing as if she was ‚Äúasleep‚Äù.
Also the phone in which they found those photos was Asunta‚Äôs own phone (previously owned by Rosario). Would they have kept those images if they believed they showed abuse?


Asunta never said her mum was trying to kill her. This was said by the media after the teacher testified in the trial that Asunta told her that her mom was giving her ‚Äúwhite powders that made her sleepy‚Äù.

"criticalrole","t5_385bw","If Otohan fought the M9 or VM at that level she would be turned to dust, probably literally if she were fighting Caleb. She had, if you include her Super Saiyan form halving everything and the healing potion giving her another 120 effective HP, north of 600 hit points. That is a lot of hit points, and she can deal about 120 damage on her action surge rounds. That is a lot, but if she were fighting the M9 she would have to contend with Sentinel from two different characters locking her down while Ford shot her with Eldritch Blast after Eldritch Blast and Jester and Caleb, who could chew through her Legendary Resistances before turning her into a slug. Given the party several rounds to recover before going again. If she fought VM, she just gets beat into the dirt. VM does so much damage. They have a Rogue with permanent haste, They have Percy with his own action surges and the ability to disarm her with his grit shots targeting her strength save, which is only plus 7. They have Grog who can absorb a crazy amount of damage and deal a crap ton back. They have a Druid who can turn into an Elemental twice, effectively giving her north of 300 HP. VM just out DPR her to death. Also both groups have two people with healing word, that helps.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

You realize, of course, that once you block someone they can't SEE the post where you declare you're going to block them? 

So what you're doing is being performative about blocking someone you don't like interacting with. The only reason to be performative about blocking someone is because you want a bunch of obsequious responses that stroke your ego.

"Zillennials","t5_27k4r9","You made some great points and I just want to throw in my two cents as an extrovert ‚Ä¶

We can find it hard to connect to an introvert too. It can be exhausting if we‚Äôre in a conversation or activity and we‚Äôre giving Level 100 energy and you‚Äôre giving Level 10 energy. It feels like we‚Äôre not being reciprocated. There‚Äôs something innate in humans that we like to be mirrored: that‚Äôs why subconsciously we mirror the other person‚Äôs body language, tone, volume etc when talking to people.

If our energy is not being mirrored, it can feel like we‚Äôre talking to a brick wall. It can also feel like we‚Äôre not being friends, but instead we‚Äôre playing the role of entertainer and the introvert is just sitting back taking it in. Laughing at our jokes, listening to our stories, but not contributing their own. What‚Äôs the point in that? I‚Äôll go to my stand-up night if I want that sort of interaction. If we want friendship, we want it to be reciprocated.

It‚Äôs also true that we have A LOT of friends, and A LOT of potential/nascent friends, random people messaging us wanting to catch up, etc etc, and even for a social butterfly it can get a bit overwhelming, and so if we‚Äôre spending time together and you‚Äôre not giving us much energy (which we thrive on, and derive our own energy from!) ‚Äì then naturally that‚Äôs not going to be something we seek out again.

¬†It‚Äôs a tough one, because I definitely want to say keep being yourself, don‚Äôt put on a fake extrovert persona (that would be so exhausting and unhealthy!), and I also do believe introverts and extroverts CAN be great friends, but it does take a lot of work, it doesn‚Äôt come naturally, and both sides need to make some concessions.

¬†So, hopefully this mayyyy help you understand the extrovert‚Äôs perspective, to give you better oversight over what might be happening when trying to befriend extroverts. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find some good and true friends if you keep trying.",1714521704.0

DISCLAIMERS: This is not my story but my friends, will talk about s h and sewer sliders. 

For context, my friend and I are still in school. Basically, my friend was concerned for one of her other friends. We will just call my friend Abby and the other girl Emily. Anyways, Abby was concerned because Emily kept telling her things that she would do to harm herself. She would also show Abby scars that she had. Emily also had started becoming distant from everyone, including Abby who was like her best friend. My school tells us to report anyone who is like that, and to talk to them and make sure they're ok. Anyway, Abby writes a statement about Emily and everything she has been saying, showing Abby, and acting. 

Abby asked administrators to keep her anonymous but they did not. Emily had to talk to administrators and they told Emily that Abby was the one who reported her, and Emily got upset. Very upset. Emily told administrators that Abby had lied and all that stuff so she didn't have to meet with administrators once a week which is what would've happened if she had told the truth.

A week later, Abby has been emailing Emily on the school computers a little bit. Not a lot, but a bit, to say sorry because Emily hated her after that. Well, Emily told her to stop emailing her and Abby did. Even though Abby wasn't emailing Emily any more, Emily kept emailing Abby, cussing her out, saying things like how Abby was such a bad friend and untrustworthy. Emily also told many people these things and made a lot of their mutual friends turn against Abby.

Then, Emily reported Abby to administrators for ""harassment."" Although Abby had stopped emailing her, stopped even trying to speak to her, Emily still reported her. Abby got called to the administrators office and got in trouble. Emily got in trouble for cussing but that is all. They didn't even listen to Abby's side of the story. Also, Emily emailed Abby way more than Abby emailed her. The administration contacted Abby's parents. Abby did not get in trouble with her parents. Administration told Abby that if she even spoke to Emily again, she would be in serious trouble. 

The school teaches us to talk to those doing harmful things to themselves, but then when we do, we get in trouble? make it make sense. Is Abby the A-Hole?

You‚Äôre right that showing vulnerability/weakness is a test. One that men fail when they show theirs in public. As OP is venting unproductively, but he‚Äôs right on the money.


Looks it‚Äôs nice to say ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt deserve you if they lose respect or attraction the moment you show some weakness‚Äù.  Yes some girls will look past moments of weakness, but those girls often get taken and are married quickly. Meanwhile, the vast majority of still single girls will at best take moments of vulnerability as a negative, and will use as ‚Äúthe straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back‚Äù at worst. And it may not always be that she thinks ‚Äúew, is crying‚Äù but often will be ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not as attracted to him anymore.‚Äù

I get that you don‚Äôt want OP to be discouraged, but this is R/dating advice, where true advice should be encouraged.

Moreover, a perusal of my responses to your messages, though seemingly improbable, would reveal my acknowledgment of the substandard formatting of my essay. Therefore, your contention holds no validity.

Secondly, I find myself within a realm of uninhibited expression, devoid of constriction. I do not find myself cornered, particularly when my interlocutor professes intelligence yet overlooks the capitalization of the pronoun ""I"" at the commencement of a sentence. My adherence to principles of self-respect and mutual respect is evident through my salutations of goodwill, a hallmark of politeness following the cessation of discourse.

Lastly, permit me to address the matter of grammar. Your communication bears semblance to that of a primordial barbarian, a characterization you may find elucidated upon inquiry. I am prepared to expound upon their origins and ancestral lineage, even delving into their rudimentary writing systems. Alas, such elucidation may prove futile in light of the persistent inadequacies of your rejoinders, reminiscent of my own deficiencies in formatting.

In summation, your rhetoric evinces a primitive vernacular, compounded by a failure to comprehend the entirety of my responses, and an apparent ignorance of certain sophisticated lexicons.

This „ÅÆ ""should"" come with a copula, but dropping the copula here sounds less direct and more feminine.

Originally the „ÅÆ was the same as the nominalizer „ÅÆ, so having it followed by the copula, you could think of it as originally meaning something like ""it's that..."" or ""the fact is that..."". But it also gives off a feeling of ""actually..."" or ""oh, this is what happened...""

It can be used to fill in reasons or conclusions for some condition, it can resolve misunderstandings, it can satisfy someone else's curiosity.

This is also where the question marker „ÅÆ„Åã„Éª„ÅÆ„Åß„Åô„Åã„Éª„Çì„Åß„Åô„Åã comes from (""is it that...?"" ""why is it that...?""), implying some kind of personal investment in finding out the answer - anything from questioning out of curiosity to demanding an explanation.

"Schaffrillas","t5_1n3oz0","One more thing before I abandon this point altogether: I've already talked about how Nimona's rampage isn't really a rampage at all, so I won't belabor the point. However, I will say this.

Trying to compare Nimona and the Director is... not a viable prospect. And calling the Director's portrayal ""sympathetic"" is a bit of a stretch, too.

The Director is a member of the privileged elite, an official in a position of absolute authority over the police force of a dystopia, and by extension, just about everything within the city walls. She has everything she could possibly want or need. Her ""understandable"" fear is grounded in the Slippery Slope theory and bigotry: there's no logical connection between giving a commoner a knighthood and letting the monsters in, but the Director connects the two events in her mind as a consequence of flouting tradition. You can't even say this is a consequence of typical Institute brainwashing, because Goldenloin and an entire platoon of knights are there to stop the *real instigator of the city's destruction* from trying to fire the laser cannon into the city - because they recognize the pointlessness of the act. And unlike Nimona, she doesn't respond to attempts to talk her off the ledge by standing down and collapsing into someone's arms, but by doubling down and committing herself to mass murder.

By contrast...

Nimona has spent the last thousand years not merely as the target of bigotry, but as *the Satan figure of the Institute's mythology*. She has spent most of those thousand years, if not longer, *alone* - not a good thing for the sanity score. We're not even sure if she can clearly remember the past after all this time: we don't know if the flashback was there for the audience's convenience, or if Nimona is literally remembering what happened for the first time in years - the scene could support either interpretation, though the latter gives more weight to her emotional meltdown.

She's not motivated by fear and grief. Her suicidal ""rampage"" is motivated by grief, sure, but it's the kind of grief that is driving her to commit suicide, not literal mass murder. It's *psychological trauma.*

When she ""lashes out,"" she's lashing out against people who have hurt or are attempting to hurt Ballister - because she's latched on to him as her only friend in her own desperate slightly-manic way. The attack on the prison, the subway antics, the kidnapping of the squire... she's not doing this because they've hurt *her;* they aren't even aware she's a ""monster"" up until the events of the smartphone debacle. No, she does this to rescue or help Ballister.

The nastiest thing she does to civilians is a) unplug a kid's ride and b) steal a saxophone. Indeed, she actually rescues a kid from being hit by an out-of-control vehicle and even returns to her child form for the first time in a thousand years just to de-escalate the situation.

Now, I don't disparage your opinion, I don't dispute the fact that Nimona went over-the-top, and I'm not going to try to convert you to accepting the message. This is Reddit, after all, and conversion attempts go over like a lead balloon being piloted by Henry VIII.

All I ask is that the facts are respected and comparisons make sense.

"parentsofmultiples","t5_2s8g3","It's absolutely legit. The benefits set in around 9-11 months for us. It started with them being able to entertain each other in the playpen while I relaxed a few feet away on the sofa. Since then (they're 2.5ish now), the benefits expanded:

* **Entertainment:** They can interact on their own for long stretches of time while I relax, work, or watch adoringly. My friends with only children sometimes complain that they can't go 5 minutes without their kid (understandably) interrupting them to play with them.
* **Bedtime/wake-up routine:** Our goodnight routine takes five minutes (teeth-brushing, diaper changes, pajamas, tuck-in, kiss, sometimes a song or story), whereas other parents talk about being exhausted by bedtime negotiations that last an hour+. But after we leave, they're not alone! They get to babble to each other, hang out, sing songs, hold hands. Same in the morning ‚Äî we don't have to wake up as early because they're content to hang out with each other for about 40-60 minutes before we come in.
* **Social skills:** They have the advantage of constantly honing their social and developmental skills with a peer outside of school.
* **Behavior:** They'll monitor each other's behavior. They take pride in putting each other in time-out (and the one in time-out accepts it! sometimes better than from an adult, haha) and going ""no, no, no"" when clocking the misbehavior of the other one. This means less work for us, and useful peer reinforcement for them.
* **Competition:** There is no greater motivator for good behavior than competition. If one sees their sister doing something that elicits praise (e.g. cleaning up a mess, trying a new food, holding onto the shape rope, etc.), she'll try to show off too.
* **Sweetness:** This is the most potent, beautiful benefit in the world. I can't describe the fizziness in my heart when I see them cuddling one another; when one is scared to get her shampoo rinsed out, so the other holds her hand; when they cackle uproariously at each other's jokes; when I see them holding hands and singing lullabies to each other on the baby monitor; when one is having a tantrum, so the other rubs her back consolingly and urges her to ""breathe in the flowers, blow out the birthday candles"" to calm down; when they push each other on the swings; when they protect each other; when they comfort each other; when they tickle each other; when they delight each other; when it's apparent that they have a bond that I feel equal parts longing, awe, and elation about.",1714521709.0

Yes, Frodo was giving the illusion that he had come to the end of his money but he still had enough to supposedly pay Sam a wage as a live in servant. So by no means was he poor. 

Following that, we can assume that Crickhollow would still be a fairly large house with plenty of space.

As for why the bathroom would be so large? Well I think we are thinking of bathrooms in a modern sense. 

Bathtubs ""at this time"" would be freestanding and mobile. And dedicating an entire room to them was unnecessary. It's quite likely you would place them near your fireplace in the front room to use them. 

So no, Fatty didnt cram them into a tiny modern bathroom. They are likely placed near the fire in the living room which would be much larger.",1714521710.0

It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet a stranger who I think is pretty and she‚Äôll just choose to have no personal interest in her relationship with me and fix my life‚Äù. That is a very fairytale/Bollywood view of relationships that‚Äôs detached from reality. 

Girls can love just like any human can love. But just like any human, love is hard and takes time and constant effort. Don‚Äôt hate real human girls because Bollywood romance treats female characters like they aren‚Äôt people and their only purpose in the story is to serve the male lead.

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","The right has garbage anti-worker politics, no argument there. The only question for me is which group would he easier to win over. The thing is, a lot of populists have tried for years to convince leftists to actually prioritize economic issues and kept hitting a wall. We‚Äôve been told time and time again by leftists in no uncertain terms that they have no interest in actually focusing on economic issues because it goes against their ideology.



Meanwhile there‚Äôs a good chunk of people who are socially conservative but still believe that the working class has been given a raw deal in this country, and even support things like unions and minimum wage increases. Those people still can still often be unreceptive to addressing economic issues, but they aren‚Äôt nearly as hostile and unreceptive to it as most leftists. 


So while reaching out to right wing populists won‚Äôt necessarily be easy, I still think it‚Äôs the next logical step at this point, because we‚Äôve been trying to reach out to leftists for years and they‚Äôve made it very clear that they‚Äôre not only disinterested but actively hostile.",1714521710.0

Reddit may not want to hear it but Intl Law is very grey, with many issues requiring layered reasonable military analysis.

I liked the dogfights and he likes the gunfights. One air and one ground. We always played ground battles. So when I suggested we try a space battle, I figured he'd be down to try it out. Nope. Got into a game and within 10 seconds of flying, he put the controller down and gave up because, ""There's no point in learning something he'll never do again.""

I was thankful there was a combination mode with both ground and air combat. But since then, I noticed it's his way or the highway. He gave me ultimatums just like your friend did. ""I'm playing this. Join me or don't."" I stopped joining because I just wasn't having fun anymore. Made new friends online and in person and began playing with them when he cried like a baby for not winning (the game he wanted to play from the beginning).

The best way of getting any truth out of her is to drop the firm declarative ""we are over if you slept with someone"" as this will just have her keeping quiet on whether she has or hasn't. And if you think about it why would she be open and honest about it given you have said ""Fucking another person is a deal breaker for me"".

You have pretty much told her the consequences up front. So of course she is gonna say nothing.

If you really want to find out, you'll have to walk back this statement and make it seem that this consequence will **not** happen.

This then comes back to whether you wish to reconcile or not because walking back on your stance, having her come clean and then you putting the brakes on things anyway **will** turn your divorce very acrimonious and will ruin whatever holding your words have with her.

So yes, it is a two edged sword and yes you may find the truth, but it could cause huge damage if you end up holding to you ""Fucking another person is a deal breaker for me"" stance.

If you have R on your list of possibilities, then walking back on this and having her open up on the truth **will** require you to be open to at least trying to work through that with her.

It is better to consider this from a point of Lewis acid-base theory. Boron and Aluminum behave similarly so it is worth looking at BH3 and BF3, but these both have unfilled octets (6/8), so they can act as acids (they accept electron pairs).

3, many disciples fled away or forsook him after christ was captured.

4, when christ enter Jerusalem they thought he was a hero and was about to make something glorious in their eyes, but christ had done nothing to satisfy them after the entry.  He was not the one they wanted.

"fidelityinvestments","t5_40w64h","Thank you for connecting with us on Reddit, u/BobLemmo. You certainly have the right idea here. Allow me to elaborate on this topic a little more.  
  
First, when you deposit funds via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or check, there is a collection period of 2-6 business days. During this collection period, you are able to trade up to a certain threshold for eligible securities but will not be able to transfer or withdraw until it is fully collected. You can check the estimated collection time under the ""Balances"" tab on¬†[http://Fidelity.com](http://fidelity.com/).  
  
As I mentioned, Fidelity generally allows clients to trade with uncollected funds. If you look in your ""Balances"" tab, you will see a section titled ""Available to trade."" You're allowed to use the amount shown to trade despite some possibly being uncollected. As you've noticed, you may encounter a warning message if you go to place a trade with uncollected funds. The warning message appears to alert clients that buying a security with unsettled/uncollected funds and selling it before the post date could potentially trigger a GFV. Although the warning will appear, you can still place a trade.  
  
For background, a GFV occurs when you buy a security and sell it before paying for the initial purchase in full with settled funds. Only fully collected cash deposits or the sales proceeds of fully paid-for securities qualify as ""settled funds."" A violation can also occur by liquidating a position before it was ever paid for with settled funds because no good faith effort was made to deposit additional cash into the account prior to the settlement date. If you incur three GFVs in a 12-month period in a cash account, you may be restricted to only trading with settled cash for 90 calendar days.  
  
While it's best to watch out for and avoid violations on your own, our system will try to warn you on the trade preview screen, when possible, if your transaction risks a GFV. That said, just because our system warns you about a GFV does not mean that one will necessarily occur. In the example you provided, you're certainly on the right track of how one may receive a GFV. For clarification, if you place a buy order for a security using uncollected funds from a recent deposit, you may see a GFV warning. However, a GFV could be triggered by a subsequent sell order.  
  
Below, I've included a link to an article on¬†[http://Fidelity.com](http://fidelity.com/)¬†that dives more into cash trading violations.  
  
[Avoiding Cash Trading Violations ](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations)  
  
Next, regarding fractional share trading, fractional trading (dollar-based investing), can be done using uncollected and/or unsettled funds. Fractional and dollar-based trading is available on our website and mobile app, and the feature is enabled on your account simply by placing your first fractional or dollar-based trade.  
  
Based on your post, it sounds like you've already placed the trade, but for reference, currently, you can place market or limit orders, good for the day of the trade only. Fractional shares or dollar-based orders are eligible for real-time execution during market hours (approximately 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET) on standard trading days, trades in dollar amounts may currently only be placed while the market is open.  
  
On [http://Fidelity.com](http://Fidelity.com), fractional trades (or dollar trades) can be executed by logging in and doing the following:  
  
1. Click ""Accounts and Trade"" then ""Trade""  
2. Select the appropriate account from the dropdown, then click ""go""  
3. Enter the symbol, action, and quantity type (dollars or shares)  
  
In the event that you do not see the ""Shares or Dollars"" field, click the link that says ""View Simplified Ticket."" Here's more information on Fractional Shares:

"AskUK","t5_2t4s3","The word biscuit comes from the Latin word 'bis' and 'coctus' which means 'twice baked' (biscotti in modern Italian). They are baked and then dried in a slow oven to help preserve them and that makes them hard. A biscuit has a snap or a crunch, and can be sweet or savoury.

The word cookie comes from the Dutch word 'koekje' which means 'little cake.' Cookies are moist and soft like cakes, and are usually sweet.

The word cracker comes from the Dutch 'kracken,' they are thin, flat and hard and so 'crack' when bent, so their name is probably onomatopoeic (as in, they're named after the sound they make). They are usually savoury, and often eaten with other foods such as cheese and chutneys.

In the UK we usually know the difference between all these foods, and we use the words to distinguish what we mean. However we do sometimes call crackers 'biscuits' as they are really a subset of biscuits.

In the US, they call both biscuits and cookies 'cookies,' and only distinguish crackers as something different. However, they do have some things such as 'snickerdoodles' that we would simply call 'cookies.'

American 'biscuits' evolved from 'hardtack' or 'ship's biscuits' which were baked up to four times to make them hard and durable for long sea voyages. They were too hard to eat, and so had to have a drink or a sauce to soften them up before eating - such as a gravy. Over time Americans started adding fat and a raising agent, changing the food significantly to something resembling a scone or a dumpling but keeping the name ‚Äòbiscuit‚Äô despite it no longer being twice-baked and hard.

To the UK mind this is like taking a pizza and swapping the bread for breaded chicken but still calling it pizza rather than chicken parmigiana. American biscuits may not be scones, but they‚Äôre not biscuits either. You've obviously made a new dish, just give it a new name.",1714521714.0

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

This is YOUR honeymoon.
YOU and YOUR fianc√© get to decided where you want to go.

I am completely taken aback by your friend‚Äôs response though. 
That is quite an intense reaction to someone saying they don‚Äôt place a country high on their list of possible travel destinations, especially when discussing a honeymoon.
Where is her empathy when you discussed your reasons? Why are you required to empathize with her husband, but she can‚Äôt with you?
Why is she being so defensive?

I have German ancestry and I don‚Äôt have Germany high on my list of places to travel to, and for a honeymoon I would prefer somewhere more romantic‚Ä¶ like Italy or France.

I wonder, has your friend or her husband recently had some political changes? 
I ask because there is a trend recently with the rise of white nationalism, and some people are taking commentary about certain countries where atrocities have occurred to a scary level.
Is her husband acting like this too?

I understand that she is currently your MOH, but I, personally, would reconsider her role within your wedding party and even reconsider the friendship.
Something is up and lashing out at you because you don‚Äôt want to visit a country for your honeymoon is strange and unsettling, plus her insulting and belittling you is rude and unfair.

Hopefully you have another friend that can transition into the role of MOH.

I wish you and your fianc√© all the best, safe travels on your honeymoon, wherever that may be.",1714521714.0

Great, now that we all understand that none of us likes when people die, how was a country supposed to respond to what happened on 10/7? Like what is the tangible, real-world response to that supposed to look like in your mind? 

That's why they called your talking points cheap. ""People shouldn't kill each other."" ""People shouldn't rape each other."" ""People shouldn't be bad to each other.""

"submarines","t5_2s3g2","What do you see as the challenges for your fictional research vehicle with regards to having a single operator? DSRVs are commonly controlled by a single person even if they can support multiple people. But if you have particular constraints given the fictional setting, you can have fun with the world building.

With research submarines, most people are going to think something like Alvin or another DSRV. Are you thinking something more akin to NR-1 which would be more challenging for a single operator? Or perhaps you could envision a vehicle normally reliant upon autonomous systems that are failing due to ""scifi"" maguffin; which is more realistic than you might think. In that case your protagonist may have to rely on more old school skills for operating the vehicle in the inherently unforgiving environment.",1714521715.0

I'm confused at what the perceived value is in training assault troops to use handguns. Even for roles that once carried a sidearm (eg, someone whose 'primary' weapon was actually impractical in some situations, like a medium or heavy machine gun) they switched to issuing M4s as a 'sidearm'. 

If a Marine has pistol training, they'll have a pistol marksmanship badge on their uniform. It's cool to have, but, much like the martial arts belts, most infantry units don't have the free time to invest in those programs.",1714521715.0

I think that would be the best chance of meeting the most requirements without a lot of customization, and possibly with better fee structure for the multiple types of user access. You can find basic CRM features in those tools; then add on a free or lightweight CRM if more is needed. It's been a few years since I demoed field service tools, so I can't say what's good now. I helped a small biz client with similar requirements implement Service Fusion and it met their needs at a price that wasn't crazy. They provided good support. 

There are a lot of ways to approach the solution depending on customer budget, goals, and possibly unstated details in your requirements. E.g factors related to physical store sales; what exactly is included in *streamline the sales process;* any other details in the installer portal like time tracking, materials tracking, e-sign, ability to sell add-ons or enter field changes. Also, *integrate seamlessly with Quickbooks* needs to be specific about what data and which direction(s). Apps will say they do this and often disappoint. You might need a 3rd party integration tool like Make, Zapier, etc. to get it right.

In the CRM space, I would consider Zoho because the platform has the extra non-CRM functionality you listed, and it has good integration options.",1714521717.0

"kayakfishing","t5_2snlv","I have the 106mk.  There is no 106 Autopilot.  You may already know this, but if not, here goes:

The autopilot has a ""head"" that rotates, turns, has spotlock, ""north"" heading, and 19 speeds (0.5 to 10.0 in .5 increments).  This comes in the 120 and 136 autopilot models.

The 106 motorized version has the same pound thrust rating as the autopilots.  There's no ""head"" on the trolling motor.  It goes forward and reverse, all steering is done by the rudder or other methods.  The throttle is completely adjustable.  

As for stability, I don't stand yet because I want to fish, not swim.  Lol.  It's super stable and people fish standing up from them.  You can look up Rad Reeling Fishing on YouTube.  He had a 106mk and stood up on it and rocked it pretty hard to show the stability.  

I got 3.6 to 3.8mph on mine.  

If you do get a motorized kayak, please find a battery on Amazon.  Don't buy into the brand name hype for 3 times the price.

The 106mk is a heavy yak.  It's built VERY well (the hull itself).  It won't win any speed records.  

Everyone will tell you the pros, so I'll stick to the cons:

1.  Purpose-built, proprietary motor.  You cannot buy just the motor (from what I've heard from others).  Also, you can't buy a 106 PDL and ""upgrade"" the drive to the Minn kota.  They don't fit.

2.  The battery goes under the seat, so no room to store other stuff.

3.  The trolling motor plugs are kinda cheap and break somewhat easily.  Some people don't have issues, but many do after a season or two.

4.  The accessory tracks are plastic.  This wouldn't be so bad if they were just standard tracks.  They are proprietary, so if you want to get replacement aluminum tracks are drop-in replacements, you're looking at $100 or so for just the two front tracks.  OUCH!

5.  The back of the seat is lower than the front.  It's quite comfortable, but it makes standing up more difficult than if it were more level.

6.  The design leaves a gaping hole in the floor when you pull the motor up.  Let's say you're beaching the yak.  You come in fairly ""hot"" and pull your motor up before it gets too shallow.  You land on the beach as expected.  However, the tiny wake you created coming in now hits the beach as well, and comes back out, bringing in some water through the opening.  Anything you have laying in the floor is susceptible to being washed out. 

7.  It's been on the market for a few years.  There have been minimal changes, if any.  The design was revolutionary at the time, but it's lagging in the middle of the pack now.  (E.g. no swivel seat, seat can't be moved fore and aft, limited cockpit storage options).

8.  The motor creates a hump in the floor, so laying a Plano box in the floor, it will tend to teeter and move around.

9.  Premium price tag.

I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm sorry girls were so cruel to you. High school is bullshit, I was branded a slut (by boys and girls) for being with my bf ONE TIME and bullied out of school from it. Being a teenager fucking sucks. 

Going into adult hood without a plan and not having the support system to help you also fucking sucks. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and BPD 15 years ago and the system, no matter what country you‚Äôre from is not built to assist people who aren‚Äôt a regular functioning person. It‚Äôs geared towards making the rich richer. Society is laying waste to many groups of people some of them might be ‚Äúnormies‚Äù but they‚Äôre stuck in generational poverty, abusive families and other shit that is out of their control. 

Am I happy with my life? No. I‚Äôm dealing with a lot of medical pressure right now and I‚Äôm unable to work and earn a living. I feel like a massive waste of space and waste of my husband‚Äôs time because medically I‚Äôm fucked but it‚Äôs up to me, no one else, just me to make sure my life means something to myself. No one is going to fix my life, I have to do the work.

People have no idea what I've been through and ill never remember why it happened the way it did. It's cool you stick up for people, but with this person my feelings of resentment will never go away I absolutely hate him for cheating and I absolutely hate her for showing me how he really could be and wonder if she was too much for a narcissist to control which makes me look even more weak.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a privilege that men maintain.  


It‚Äôs not about an opinion I hold, its about phenomena that have been widely corroborated by numerous pretty widely cited studies, such as this one: [https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/35/2/187/5370650](https://academic.oup.com/esr/article/35/2/187/5370650)

to indicate that unconscious biases are completely absent from the hiring industry is absurd. If you‚Äôre overseeing a large amount of remsumes simultaneously, you are far more likely to be prone to said biases as an evaluator.



female crash test dummies weren‚Äôt used until 2022. That definitely contributes to it.   


It‚Äôs harder and at times more expensive to find furniture designed for women‚Ä¶ And women can‚Äôt buy every furniture piece that they use. I can‚Äôt ‚Äújust buy‚Äú a new bus seat when I ride public transit or a new shelf when I go grocery shopping. The AC thing is not necessarily and issue. We were talking about matters of privilege, not what levels of inconvenience they might bring.

as for representation, would you want a board of elder men to dictate the proceedings on abortion rights, or would employing more women result in greater opportunities and equality? Do you really think having the majority of media catered to you isnt a privilege? It‚Äôs widely been accepted as isolating when you‚Äôre the only one of your kind in your field. ‚ÄúWomen's political representation is¬†**closely linked to the promotion of legal equality of economic opportunity**. The data show a clear relationship between the political representation of women and legal equality between women and men, regarding their opportunities and potential to participate in the economy‚Äù

also, a lack of gender representation can result in a lack of role models. It also decreases stereotyped thinking and precludes the establishment of biases or negative self assessments.",1714521720.0

### Thank you for your submission to r/gameverifying. Please read the pinned post at the top of the sub, or [linked to this text here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameverifying/comments/1bcuh69/).
This is an automated reminder to ensure that you have provided enough information for us to verify your games/consoles.
### Do **NOT** share any information relating to the value of the game/accessory/console(s) you wish to verify. You will receive a warning.
**Posts will be REMOVED if you do not have the required information.**
### Please note, that our time to verify is 3 weeks. **Do not repost** if you do not get a response within a few hours, as we deal with hundreds of submissions a day.
Ideally, we'd need clear images of the **full** front and backs of games, along with any other items you'd like verified. If you have already shared these images, please disregard this comment.
In short, **no back/front images, no verification.** It's that simple. If you are missing some images, please **reply to this comment** with an Imgur link to the images in question. **Do NOT make another post, as this will be removed immediately under Rule 6.**
### To commenters, 
Please ensure that you do not use [debunked methods](https://www.gameverifying.com/wiki/debunked) of verification and **only** comment if you are sure that you are correct. ""Wait for mods"" does not absolve you from misleading information, and will lead to a warning. Do not forget to [read our PSA's](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameverifying/comments/1asmryg).

This sounds pretty confusing for you.

You gotta ask yourself: do you want to stay married to her or not?

That's a big question because you‚Äôre starting to not trust her.

Once she knows you don‚Äôt trust her, your relationship might be over.

Why? Because a relationship with no trust isn‚Äôt really a relationship.

Also, what does it matter if she's finding ways to be happy on her own?

Maybe she's just keeping busy by herself or with someone else, like a professional or a friend.

But if it doesn‚Äôt hurt you and you‚Äôre happy, then what's the big deal?

However, if you find out she cheated, that could really mess up your relationship.

And if you keep worrying about her cheating, even if she isn‚Äôt, that could also hurt your relationship.

Either way, being too suspicious might ruin things.

So, think hard: do you want to stay married to her?

If yes, maybe stop snooping around.

You could talk to a counselor, share your worries here, or write them down.

But if you keep pushing it, it might end your marriage.

Ask yourself if it's worth it.

If you think it's more important than your marriage, maybe you should think about getting a divorce.

Because finding more dirt will just make things worse, especially if you have kids.

It‚Äôs better to end things peacefully than to let everything blow up.

It‚Äôs your choice.

Your actions will lead you one way or another.

I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs cheating.

It‚Äôs common to think that if someone isn‚Äôt romantically involved for a while, they might look elsewhere.

And that‚Äôs probably the best-case scenario.

She could have just left you or asked you to let her do this openly.

But since she‚Äôs hiding it well, if she is, it means she doesn‚Äôt want to lose you.

She‚Äôs trying to keep you happy.

I don‚Äôt see a problem here.

And since you‚Äôve been away a lot, it‚Äôs possible you might have cheated too.

Or maybe not.

Maybe you‚Äôve been totally loyal.

You might have been tempted but never did anything.

I don‚Äôt know.

All I‚Äôm saying is, if you keep going this way, no matter what you find out, you might lose your relationship.

You need to decide if that‚Äôs what you want.",1714521722.0

Yo no s√© mucho de excel, pero si me atrevo a decir que SQL te puede funcionar mucho mejor e incluso puedes exportar a un archivo de excel si as√≠ lo necesitas.

No necesitas aprender SQL avanzado para tu problema.

Yo he hecho algunos proyectos en servidor web. Pero si necesitas estar en tu PC (o localhost) puedes instalar xampp y acceder al phpmyadmin para crear tus bases de datos en MySQL. 

Despu√©s puedes hacer consultas sencillas para tus necesidades y si ya encuentras que necesitas alguna consulta m√°s compleja puedes ocupar el chatgpt, me atrever√≠a a decir que la versi√≥n 3.5 igual te da buenas respuestas.

Y en el peor de los casos, si no encuentras una soluci√≥n clara, puedes mostrar mi cv ü§£ na mentira. Puedes consultar en este mismo grupo y dem√°s que alguno de nosotros va a salir con una buena respuesta.

Most of the men in dbd are tall muscular beings that look like they‚Äôd ragdoll you in a fight. The feminine designs tending to stray away from the physical threat allows them to truly be something that makes you uncomfortable as well as scared.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc",">¬†How am I hurting myself by not worshiping god? If it turns out that god doesn't deserve our worship, why should I? If it's to avoid being punished, wouldn't it be obvious that I was faking it?

bc in the case that God does exist, it ISN'T the case that He doesn't deserve worship. If God does exist then you're just wrong for holding this position

I'm not sure why you (not literally u, but ppl I'm general) think that they would actually be in the right in not worshipping God if God does in fact exist. You would just be in the wrong, ie, not good

that's where the arrogance and wisdom comes into my reply, because you (not literally u of course) think that whatever you think about God not deserving worship actually translates to reality, and it doesn't.",1714521723.0

It was a second floor room with ocean views. The room was lovely, the super tall ceiling made it feel big and spacious.

It was our first time at the Ventana and we had the most amazing weekend ever, I would definitely stay in a standard room again. In my opinion the greatest value is all the complimentary amenities, the georgeus location/scenery and the all-inclusive food.

"Coachella","t5_2qsp9","30 is probably one of the most represented demographics at Coachella so no worries

Tickets usually go on sale from the website at the beginning of the year. If they sell out don‚Äôt worry, you can buy them second hand on sites like stubhub usually for not that much more

You have a few options in terms of how to stay. You can car camp at the festival which I‚Äôm personally not a fan of because you have to be there all day and the facilities aren‚Äôt great. As a 30 year old I don‚Äôt have the energy for an all day festival anyways

I prefer to grab an Airbnb nearby, ideally with a pool. Hang out during the day and then head to the festival around 4 or 5 depending on who you want to see. Main negative with this is dealing with the traffic getting in which is horrendous. Don‚Äôt forget to get a parking pass, or Uber is an option too but a bit more chaotic. Hotel is a similar option and may have shuttle to make travel a bit easier

Google some packing lists but my main advice there is just pack layers and a blanket to sit down on. It‚Äôs a furnace during the day but can be cold at night. Food and drink are pretty accessible so bring your credit card. If you have an Amex platinum card they have a lounge you can chill in if it gets too hot, it also has charging. The Heineken lounge is usually a good spot to chill as it‚Äôs not too crowded and plays music

"buildapcmonitor","t5_anjfp1","yeah, it's a tradeoff, that's always how it works. what i'd recommend is:

- ""standard"" for the ps4
- ""faster"" for the ps5 if you're playing at 120, ""standard"" at 60

don't use the extreme setting, it's just gonna fuck up the image for no benefit whatsoever. on faster, you might see ghosting at low framerates, but it's going to be good for 

i promise you you're not gonna feel any difference there. the frame time lag _alone_ is 8 ms at 120 fps and 17 ms at 60 fps, the playstation's controller itself has about 30-40 ms, and end-to-end latency on a console tends to be around 150 ms. those extra two milliseconds you shave off on the screen's end won't matter much here. they'd help get rid of hardware motion blur, but you got a lot of sample and hold stuff at those framerates, and most games specifically include motion blur anyway, so it's unlikely you'll even see much of a difference.

extreme with mbr specifically can help in competitive games, because of how backlight strobing works, but again, it has its drawbacks. that said, at least that would make some sense with your future ps5 if you ever get held back by motion blur.",1714521726.0

If you don't think your parents are likely to change then I would explain to your parents that this is about your children and their faith formation and that they should be respectful in that aspect.

Not an easy conversation but I had something similar in that when my children were baptized this year both my wife who did not convert and my parents who are protestent sat in the back pews. I explained, especially to my wife, that she hadn't shown any interest in what we were preparing for over the past year and in the future we can definitely make her more involved if she would like.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz",">As a minor, I don‚Äôt think you can be held to a legal contract. A real lawyer can confirm. If so, sign anything they want and get them off your back, as long as it is dated before your birthday. Then if they try to enforce it later - invalid contract and they can pound sand.

No, this is generally untrue. A minor can be held to a contract unless he disaffirms it, and he must do so at the latest by the time he reaches the age of majority and is aware of it -- otherwise he is said to have ratified it and it may be enforced against him. (Minors can also be held to contracts they enter into for ""necessities,"" like food, clothing, and shelter even though they are minors. In many states, this category includes education and medical supplies.)

But the OP is not describing a contract, I don't think -- he seems to be describing a FERPA waiver. He can revoke that FERPA waiver at any time he pleases.

Unfortunately for the OP, the parents have no general obligation to pay his tuition, so they may respond to his revocation by refusing to pay the school, and the school may response to an unpiad student account by deregistering current classes and not permitting OP to continue to attend.",1714521726.0

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

"stalker","t5_2r74m","I always play with [Mags Redux](https://github.com/RAX-Anomaly/MagsRedux) when I make my own custom modpack. I'd say it's the most immersive gameplay mod out there, and I install every addon it has a patch for.

Starting with the major one you have probably heard, [Boomsticks and Sharpsticks](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/boomsticks-and-sharpsticks). It's quality isnt the best(definitely better than vanilla Anomaly) but it adds a lot.

[Pretty Pistols Pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/pretty-pistols-pack) is pretty good too, it even has a [reanimation pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/pretty-reanimated-pistols) that makes it even better.

[AUGmented](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/augmented-the-aug-pack): as it says in the title, adds more AUG's into the game. A must-have if you are looking for a tacticool gameplay.

[Blindside's reanimation](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/blindsides-weapon-reanimation-and-rebalance-loner) is a good alternative for BAS if you prefer quality over quantity. You can make them work together too but it may take some time. They aren't compitable by default because they make changes to the same weapons at times.

[Retrogue's Additional Weapons](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/retrogues-additional-weapons-part-1-ar-type-weapons) will improve the AR's in this game a lot, I heavily recommend it.

[LEWD guns](https://www.moddb.com/members/lun4t1c/addons) are also very well animated, unfortunately I dont think they have patches for Mags Redux.

[JSRS](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/solarint-gunshot-overhaul) is a must-have in every modpack, it overhauls most if not all sounds in the game.

[Weapon Parts Overhaul](https://github.com/ahuyn/anomaly-wpo) and [Outfit Parts Overhaul](https://github.com/ahuyn/anomaly-opo), you can find them in almost every modpack and they do deserve the fame. These will replace the weird and unrealistic repair system of vanilla Anomaly with a more realistic one.

[Grok's Ballistics Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/100-groks-ballistics-overhaul-eft-like) will make gunplay 10 times more realistic as recoil and damage will actually make sense now.

[Dissasemble All Items](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/disassemble-all-items) is a much needed QOL mod especially useful for WPO and OPO.

[Grok's Body Health System](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/100-groks-body-health-system-redux-for-151) is a must-have if you want a hardcore(and realistic) experience. It says 1.5.1 but it works well in 1.5.2 so dont worry.

That's all I can recommend for now, but as I mentioned installing a modpack is just a lot easier, installing and setting up all the mods above will probably take you at least 2 hours. Then you will open the game and your Anomaly may be broken for some reason, and you have to do it all over again.

Dark Signal is very different from modpacks like EFP or GAMMA which completely overhaul vanilla Anomaly, Dark Signal only aims to improve the vanilla game without making it too hardcore or complicated.

BTW, if you are going to do it all by yourself with MO2 you should always check whats inside the folder before dragging it into your profile, some mods are not set up properly and need adjustments for MO2 to set them up properly.",1714521727.0

Honestly just make sure you eat beforehand as best as possible because I was too scared to eat beforehand and too scared to eat on the plane which can make you feel all blah. But for real‚Ä¶ it really wasn‚Äôt that bad of a flight. I usually cope on planes by falling asleep or just shutting my eyes with music or a show playing full blast. I‚Äôm always jolted awake by landing and realize it wasn‚Äôt that bad or that long! The biggest thing is make sure you burp (if you can). The air pressure changes will fill you with air and not burping made me feel even more scared. Nobody seemed bothered or s* on my flight, and beforehand I researched how common it was for people to get s* on planes and it actually doesn‚Äôt happen nearly as often as you‚Äôd think. There might be some turbulence but it won‚Äôt last long. Otherwise, it‚Äôs probably wayyyy smoother than an average car ride! Just find something to do and relax for a bit.

That it counters big cards too is gravy. It doesn't have to do that to be a good card; it just has to disrupt your opponent's early plan, then be a playable taxing card too.


The fact that playing the body screws over your future tithes is exactly what makes the card interesting. You're keeping a grip of 7 cards. You don't HAVE to play the body turn 2. You can play something else; say, a giver, and keep tithe up. Or another 2 drop; develop your Leonin Arbiter or SFM, or hold up Bowmasters for EOT. In these instances, you can hold up Tithe for the bigger drop; Rings, Chords, Karns, etc.


But in some instances, you WILL want to play the body, either to stall your opponents One Ring or Chord, or because you kept a sketchy hand and didn't draw something proactive.


These decisions are what makes the card specifically interesting.¬†",1714521728.0

I work for a company that does this. Over 250k employees around the world, most in Eastern Europe and Asia. Don't think for a minute that people in other regions of the world can't do as good a job as you. It may take them time to get up to speed, but at 25% or less of your cost. The investment is worth it.

To be clear, I love working from home when I can. It's a massive step forward for worklife balance, but it is path to keeping wages low.

"anime","t5_2qh22","**FIRST TIMER** Sub entirety

I would put this show very high on my best of anime shows list.  Sci-fi/space opera is one of my favorite genres and I've watched many anime and dozens of live action sci fi shows in full.  I'd say this show did pretty much everything well.  The world they built was so compelling and they did a wonderful job inhabiting it with interesting characters ,  The show had a wonderful central fulcrum of Jinto and Lafiel and their complicated at times relationship.  

* My biggest criticism of the show that I've mentioned several times is that we only saw one side of this epic conflict for the most part.  This made the Abh in a way, the designated protagonists no matter what they did and when they were clearly in the wrong.  I'm hard pressed to think of another sci fi show/ movie/franchise with an overarching enemy where we know practically nothing about them.  Ones that come to mind, like something like the Aliens movies, more just present evil monster aliens.  I don't think it made as much sense for a show where the big villain is half of humanity who are just looking for self determination.  Admittedly, this is the only sci finI can think of where the alien invaders are presented as the good guys so it is an intriguing premise in some ways.
* Another thing I wish they had more of was the romance between Jinto and Lafiel.  Crest was more a romantic adventure with a sci fi setting.  The rest of the show was more straight sci fi.  I'm not saying that it's completely bad though because if there was little to no romance between the 2, I'd probably not have missed it, it's just that the little bit we got made me want more.
* Worst episode: First one, as the first half was boring confusing.  Thankfully it improved a lot.  I also thought Banner III episode 1 had boring stretches.
* 2nd Best episode:  I almost don't want to decide because I thought this had 2 of the best episodes of sci fi I've ever seen.  2nd best and very close would be the Crest finale.  It was epic and a great resolution to the plot.  The action scene in the amusement park was one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in anime or live action, it was fun, tense, exciting, suspenseful and hilarious!  I loved the small sad story arc with the mechanical horse they rode :D
* Best episode: Banner II episode 2 when they encountered the people of the prison planet.  When watching, I didn't even notice the passage of time because I was so absorbed in everything going on.  How the Basroil crew managed to unravel who should be their contact person in the territory then the amazing transition to one of the most unusual and original plots ive seen in sci fi where a population of male prisoners wants to take captive of the female prisoners for sex and they had to find a way to rescue them.  Describing it might sound like an adult movie plot but it was done so well in execution as was this entire arc.   The Basroil leaving the planet and Angusson being epically killed by a tidal wave was one of the most stunning endings to an arc I've ever seen.
* Worst character: I generally didn't like Lafiel's father, he was flat and it came off as strange that she came from him.  I liked him way more in the Birth OVA when he seemed like an action hero in his own right though.
* Best character:  Admiral Spoor!  She was the grande dame and over the top villian every drama should have but she was part of the protagonists!  She was just so arch and disdainful and the actress really chewed the scenery; she reminded me a lot of great arrogant sci fi villians like Q.

"greatpyrenees","t5_2uhd2","Seconding the recommendation to incorporate the crate when you are not leaving! I'm not sure if other dogs are like this, but I realized my pup is way happier to ""go"" than ""come"". So if I stood near the crate and tried to lure him, he would not do it. But if I stood where he was and said ""go to your crate"" he would think about it. I made it a game, starting with throwing treats in the crate while saying ""crate"" and doing that over and over. Then I would say crate and only give him treats when he went in, then we worked up to only giving treats if he went in, laid down, and stayed. Then I added in closing the door, and giving treats through the closed door. If you have a kong or other puzzle feeder, that can be a way to increase the length of time that they're happy to be in the crate at first. Making it fun and making a big deal by cheering and waving my arms around seems to motivate my pyr as much or more than the actual treat üòÖ

"CSUS","t5_2saj8",">Capitalism failed us, and the people in power in this democracy who let those same corporations go unchallenged

We are in agreement there (I realize you might have gotten the impression I disagree with you on the basis of your beliefs, and not just Che in particular, so I just wanted to establish this)

>Which is why a mix of Socialism/Communism/Democracy would be, in my opinion, the greatest chance for humanity to work as a unit to become something greater

Personally, I feel we need to create something new. Our continual reliance on the methods of the past in this new world are going to keep dragging us into the same old squabbles over and over again (especially given the American culture's individualist streak having 200 years of entrenchment by this point, making most collective minded ideologies difficult, if not impossible to pitch to the common person). Additionally, Socialism and Communism have so many schools of thought by this point (the byproduct of being a 200 year old ideology that is frequently espoused by intellectuals trained to think in abstracts, I don't know which you personally subscribe to but I feel you will have noticed this in leftist circles too), it's base is entirely divided over how it should be implemented, leaving me unconvinced unity can be achieved for long to implement positive change if we follow this same path. I am aware of how difficult the process in creating something new is however, so I get I might be swimming alone here in thinking this a valuable option

>I know his history well, almost certainly better than your google research got you

This is a side note, but I'd recommend avoiding sentences like this when having discourse like this. Part of the Left's division has been spawned by the intellectual-minded wing looking down on the rest of the practitioners due to a perceived lack of information/expertise/understanding of the materials, and lines like these encourage these divisions (really this can happen in any movement, but the Left has been hit most heavily by it). On my own end, I realize my writing might make me come off as up my own ass or looking down on others, so sorry if that has been the case. Trust me when I say I have done my reading, just because we disagree on one man does not mean you know better than me or are somehow more genuine in your beliefs.",1714521731.0

No, that's not the problem. But at this point, after many rounds of talking to her, having a huge fight (about something else) which led to her threatening to never have sex with me again simply because I disagreed with her about something important, which led to couples for us and individual counseling for her, she has stopped altogether and basically declared she simply will not ever have sex again and doesn't really seem to care that it is a problem for me.

Why didn't you ask about the 75,000 Americans who die from alcohol every year? Why don't those 75,000 deaths bother you as much as the 15,000 gun deaths does? 

It's really strange when people only care about some people who die but not others. 

>Every other developed nations around the world have strict controls on guns and the proof that it results in significantly less violent gun death is overwhelming.

Idk it's weird guys, it's like I've gone through whatever the hell happened to Sophia in Pistis Sophia but I'm I'm both Sophia and Jesus. Like no one is saving me but myself.  

So

Of course I can tell you exactly what I think is going on rn. Basically ""evil"" forces are trying to force good souls in this dimension so they can vampirize their energy. They do so by driving people insane with tactics like gangstalking, convincing women they've been ""exposed"" through cyberstalking/actually exposing them, then turn them into cam girls, making people stay depressed and stuck focusing on pointless shit like vanity (all social media pretty much) and desperate to achieve status or whatever. Let's add wars, both inflicting pain and suffering and basically locking the whole world under psychological terrorism. Everyone is pretty much freaked out WW3 is about to happen.

Why do you think the world sucks big time all the time? What would be the point? Where is justice? 

Who's gonna reach enlightenment like this? How can you be emotionally and mentally at peace with all this stuff happening? Almost impossible, right?

The solution is pretty simple. We're all god. We're all one with the universe, it's within us and all around. We are all Jesus or whichever saviour of choice, it does not matter since it's all the same. Fuck em spiteful evil losers, we're on the Jesus train. Choochoo.",1714521732.0

This happens to pictures taken today and pictures taken months ago. It's not just the weird color, it has that weird border glitch on the left and bottom (ignore the stupid shadow on these images). 

If I open an afphoto I created in the past, there's no glitch. (Mind you, the only one I found has converted the layers to pixels.)

"floxies","t5_37smh","I work out, box, play soccer, basketball (plus other sports) and even have played tennis with friends/family with no major problems. Originally my tendons were hurt so badly that I was unable to walk for up to 6 months and rehabilitation took about 2 years. I was fine for a year after then relapsed via another antibiotic that had me using a cane to walk for at least 4 months. Rehabilitated myself yet again, back to boxing now but I need to take it easy on the heavy weights still when I work out. I also aggressively bike, jog/etc with little issues other than soreness that requires rest from time to time. The only thing I find that really bothers me still is jumping on our trampoline/skipping as my Achilles tendons still get pretty sore after a while.  

I would say the trick is any tendons you haven't been using since being floxed, use them slowly and carefully when trying out activities again. They seem to need time to break down and rebuild (kind of like muscle) and they do eventually reach a stage where they function like before (if not better) but it is a very slow process that requires time and patience. I also eat nutrient rich food, use heat packs/warm water to get blood flow to my tendons which help recovery. I use ice on them initially if they are really bad to get the swelling down, then move to heat a day later if it's really bad although that is rare now. 

If you are new to doing activities again, I'd recommend swimming as that will help build them up better, the water is good for the body and risk of re-injury is a lot lower.",1714521734.0

If you haven't read *Lord of the Rings* yet, you should.  *The Hobbit* is much better as a book than a movie; like, better by at least two orders of magnitude.  
  
*The Expanse/Memory's Legion* is science fiction, but my god is it smooth, it goes down easy.  It's got intrigue and lore, not massive amounts but enough to keep the reader hungry; there are a handful of plot similarities, but being sci-fi I'm not sure it would translate.  
  
*Ender's Game.*  I won't tell you anything about it except that you should read it.  
  
*Anthem* is Ayn Rand's one good book.  It's of a kind with the post-WWII dystopian novels like *1984,* *Fahrenheit 451*, and *Brave new World,* and it's actually pretty okay.  The philosophizing isn't so heavy handed that it ruins the rest.  We all tried to read *Atlas Shrugged* so that you don't have to, but nobody reads *Anthem;* *Anthem* is okay.  
  
*House of Leaves.*  I won't tell you anything about it except that you should read it.  
  
[*The Green Meadow*](https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/gm.aspx) is a short story by H.P. Lovecraft, I just love the prose, I can see what he's painting.  Don't read about his cat.",1714521734.0

"NFLNoobs","t5_326ue","It seems as if you've got a lot of Browns bashing answers, but no real attempts to answer the question.  

First you're omitting some things. Yes he nearly beat the Chiefs.  The Chiefs were up 19-3 when Mahomes got hurt and was out for the rest of the game.  The Chiefs only scored 3 more points the remainder of the game.  So it's not as much nearly beat the Chiefs as couldn't beat the Chiefs even without Mahomes.  

Even the playoff win was suspect, They beat the Steelers who were 11-0 and inexplicably fell apart losing to the Bengals backup quarterback at home among other things.  They won 1 more game, but were clearly struggling.  You'll take any win, but it still wasn't the best win.  

As far as his performance, he was ranked in the 20s in QB rating and just about every stat and worse in the 4th quarter.  He was ranked something like 36th out of all QB's in the 4th quarter his last 2 years in Cleveland.  

And there were nuances to his departure as well.  The Browns wanted to upgrade the QB play so they went after Watson.  Watson turned them down, but Baker was upset they went after Watson and asked for a trade.",1714521735.0

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Some of them sure, there are all sorts of reasons why people get involved in this stuff. Like in my situation, I got involved with the far left because it felt like the right thing to do. Then I got arrested and hit with three felonies... those charges were eventually dropped but I was really pissed about that. This got me involved even more and then I ended up around some very fucking dangerous people whom took major advantage of me. I legit almost died a few times. I risked my life for causes and people that did not fucking care about me one bit. 

I literally was called ""canon fodder"" behind my back (I found this out later). The difficult thing is I (and others) got super loved bombed at first, it felt like a cult looking back on it. I was literally traveling around the country at one point getting involved with various movements and situations. 

As one would imagine, the far left (and I am assuming far right) tends to attract some people whom are simply not stable or are outright dangerous. They then take advantage of lots of others, they get off on the power and control. 

I literally still face some consequences to my involvement.. it has made my life difficult and I still do get tracked and harassed by the courts, cops and some members of the far-right and far-left. Hell, I even got called a ""traitor"" a few months ago and then also had somebody call the cops on me. When the cops showed up they showed up like 7 to 9 deep and were screaming at me to try to startle me/trigger me. A few years ago I literally was followed basically everywhere by them. I've even been featured in fucking press conferences and shit. I got doxxed by Andy Ngo etc etc etc. 

The sickest thing is a lot of ""leftists"" completely weaponize the police and police encounters on their own. 

Like I said, I still agree with a lot of the positions held by those that get involved in protest movements but the tactics are off and the risks are just too great for me. I did meet some wonderful people over the years but I also met some awful ones. 

Also, some of the older guys are just chasing younger girls (and guys) to be real. There also are a lot of cults working on the fringes of the far left (both political and not). But yeah the ""scene"" is really fucked up. Not playing when I said it nearly cost me my life and or freedom several times. I got completely ""radicalized"" and it took me a long time to break free of that.",1714521735.0

So what you can do is draw out a right triangle with hypothenuse length sqrt(x^2 + 9) using the Pythagorean theorem you can then determine that one leg is length x and the other leg is length 3.

If you label one of the acute angles equal to some value theta, you can then set x equal to some trig function in terms of theta. You can then substitute x for this trig function in terms of theta to make a new function in terms of theta.

You can then use trig identities to integrate this function. Then you can substitute back in terms of x, giving you a solution.",1714521736.0

That's what most of them are afraid of, but as far as I know there's been VERY FEW instances of anything like this actually happening. And you can't just look at somebody and go ""yeah they're not really trans. They're up to something."" It's probably a mix of bigots and people with legitimate (although unlikely) fears.

You could also do this with your shirt, assuming again you're hiking in hot weather and not sweating in colder weather. Cotton will retain water and take more time to evaporate.

On a side note, if you're hot and not sweating or not sweating a lot, it could be you're not adequately hydrated BEFORE you start a hike and the lack of water causes your body not to effectively regulate your temperature as it rises from exertion and air temp/elevation. I would make sure you pee light yellow before you go hiking, drink water going into the day before you hike and on your way out to the TH besides during the hike, of course.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","The OG film made it so the astronauts landed over two thousand years later in the 40th century due to time dilation from travelling at near-light speed. 

The remake doesn‚Äôt have to have the spaceship land so far in the future and they can even scrap the whole time travel aspect if they find it too far-fetched. The first movie said the astronauts were only going to Mars whereas Charleton Heston‚Äôs crew was supposed to be travelling hundreds of light years to a new solar system. In this universe the astronauts might have to earth only after a couple of years after the apes took over. 

Also, the first two films were inspired by the Cold War and the threat of nuclear Armageddon. The origin conceit was that the apes naturally evolved sentience while humans devolved after the end of civilization. 

The idea that the ape uprising happened suddenly in reaction to human mistreatment of apes developed in the sequels, when the series went from a nuclear allegory to a civil rights allegory. That was where the original version of Caesar and his revolution came from, although he had a very different and less grounded back story (the original Caesar was a circus chimp born to time travelling ape scientists).",1714521737.0

Now when you pay full price ur expecting a brand new car that runs smoothly right?... But in the modern dating scene you have someone tryna run you a used beat up 2003 Lincoln LS for the price of a BRAND NEW 2024 Ford Bronco.

Y'all say some shit like this and then get mad when the dealer says you don't have the credit or cash to shop here.

As you said, the majority of them still think conquering other nations is a-ok, and that good Garleans tired of that shit like Jullus are too small to fight back or have already defected to other nations. 

The only saving grace is that they're only powerful in their heads, thanks to the huge decimation of their population and conscripts defecting en masse.

"dataisbeautiful","t5_2tk95",">You seem to lack a basic understanding of how unions work, how teacher compensation works, or how numbers in general work because you can't even tell when one number is bigger than another. It's not hard to falsify your claim that teachers make more than the median salary in every state. Teacher pay and median salaries by state are both publicly available information. You can look at the numbers and see which one is bigger, and for most states it isn't the teacher pay.

* - citation needed.  Not to fear!  I have that information.  [Here](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/teacher-pay-by-state) is average teacher pay by state.  [Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/14/median-annual-income-in-every-us-state.html) is the median annual income in each state.  Notice that in **each and every** state, the average teacher salary is higher than the median wage.

>It's also weird that you're comparing to the general median salary at all considering how much education and training teacher need. How do their salaries compare to people with similar degrees? The answer is teachers make significantly less than other professions that require similar levels of education.

I think being paid better than most of the other people around qualifies as not being poorly compensated.  And it seems silly to cry poor when making more than most people around you who don't get summer break, winter break, spring break, sometimes a fall break and a slew of holidays.

>So not only are your facts wrong, your argument doesn't hold water.

Nope, facts are right.  See above.

>Oh, and 2100 hours is an entirely reasonable estimate for how much a teacher works in a year. The fact that you find it laughable tells me how little you know about the profession.

* - citation needed.  Wait!  I can help here again!  [Here](https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article/9/3/231/10191/New-Measures-of-Teachers-Work-Hours-and) we see teachers work an average of 34.5 hours per week annually (more during the school year, less in summer).  That's 1794 hours per year on average.  Teachers would have to work about 17% harder to get to 2100 hours.  Meanwhile, the average American, working 41.5 hours a week is getting in a good 2158 hours.

"brisbane","t5_2qutz","You are at a crossroad.

It's going to be incredibly hard work, mostly from you. A Psychiatrist is only going to go so far and is likely going to recommend DBT and/or CBT. Making that happen is itself a challenge. A middle-ground along this challenging road is to engage relationship therapy, preferably with someone who is aware of BPD and trauma-related disorders.

Alternatively, it is too much work that you do not accept. That's a decision for you to make. The critical and most important thought to keep in your mind, is to look after yourself. You might think you are, when you are not. It's extremely important to prioritise this, not just for you, but also for her. This seems counter-intuitive, but it is so incredibly important.

"Rollerskating","t5_2vjfl","The worst injuries do tend to happen when you're doing absolutely nothing! The good news is the fibula is a good bone to break, well, if there actually is a good one! I broke mine off skates, but was skating competitively at the time and it was not really problematic to get back to skating once the bone healed. It wasn't painful at all to skate again, but it did take a long time to get my flexibility in it back and I'm not sure it ever got to 100%. It got good enough to not be really noticeable anyways. I found that the best stretch I could do once it was healed was to put on my skate and use the sides of the wheels as leverage to stretch it to each side. Obviously it'll be a while til you need that but hopefully it might help you stretch it better when it's time!

I've skated so long that my family (while they'd still love it if I quit) has zero expectation of me ever stopping so it's not really a discussion that has to happen. You can't bubble wrap yourself and you can't predict injuries. I mean, my bad wrist break was when I was coaching derby not playing and barely moving, and I actually broke my ankle while at physical therapy... for my ankle. DOH!

Before you can retort, I try to break your words with your moans. I dig deep, my hips dropping down for a solid minute of the most intense fucking of your life. My hips bounce fervently into you. Each thrust sends a wave of force through your body. Your tits roll back and forth on your chest as I let my hips move at full force. Sweat drips down me as I groan. I'm holding my breath at times to keep control of my own building orgasm. 

I gasp and growl as I reach my physical limit. My hips slow down just in time to stop me from cumming. I thrust much more slowly, my chest huffing as I smile.

"daddit","t5_2rxue","I travel pretty regular for work. At my peak, I‚Äôm gone 2 weeks a month.

At first my wife got upset as she was under the mistaken notion that I was out partying and leaving her at home. When she realized that I spent almost all day in a car or in a convention center, ate shit fast food for dinner then went to bed, it was a bit of an eye opener for her.

She‚Äôs since realized that out of a 5 day trip, I may get a few hours to myself one night and that‚Äôs what I tend to talk about as the rest of my trip is so fucking boring‚Ä¶but it pays the bills.

That said, I‚Äôve encouraged her to take ‚Äútime off‚Äù from the family so she can get away. I literally see her walk past, then a toddler, then 3 dogs, everywhere she goes.

She went away for 17 days back to her home country, she‚Äôs gone on a short vacation without me, and she‚Äôs much happier for it.

It's also crucial to consider the long-term implications of taking on additional debt, including the impact on your credit score and financial future.

Ultimately, the decision to take out student loans to pay off high-interest debt should be based on your individual financial situation, goals, and risk tolerance. I'd recommend consulting with a financial advisor or counselor who can provide personalized guidance and help you make an informed decision. Good luck!",1714521741.0

A plot hole and an unexplained plot point convey two very different things, with the former being a criticism and the latter just something that isn't creating issues and can be explained later or not at all without causing issues. Especially since Plot Holes, as I said, tend to mean the entire story breaks down or it trivializes previous issues. Media literacy is important.

When people were discussing adapting Halo into a show and how Mass Effect would look, there were people saying that they were actually annoyed at how Mass Effect has such a condensed history. That all the interesting things happen over the course of a couple of decades. And I agree.

The fact that I would have memories of the outbreak of the first contact war *and* have witnessed the Reaper war is absolutely absurd. Colonies set up, complex dynamics, etc etc.

Like, if anything, I get why everyone thinks humanity is the council's favorite and such. It's so short of a time frame, and boom, here they are.

I think the Quarian thing is them trying to make it mysterious to the player. A bit of leaning on the fourth wall. It makes no sense within universe that Quarians appearance isn't known. If I tell you no one knows what George Washington looks like, you can google right now and see a bunch of paintings of him. Same thing, but better in ME. It's just silly.

And yeah, maybe. It's vague enough that it works, but it jumps a lot of details to get there, some of them huge. It's not impossible (hence the arguable), but the entire story right now is vague enough to not be plausible with what we know. At least, AIs should be accidentally happening more often than it seems to.",1714521742.0

When you're paying back the last of your loan in 30 years (I assume, you haven't provided many details), those 10.16 million are worth much less than they are today, so what you're paying back isn't comparable to 10.16 million in today's money.

If we assume an average inflation of 2% per year, over 30 years, that's about 81% of accumulative inflation. so if we take that 10.16 million, in 30 years, that will ""only"" be about 5.6 million in today's money.

"Equestrian","t5_2r4or","I would start off by having a veterinarian that specializes in lameness and sports medicine. 

Our vet was actually one of the first vets to learn how to do ultrasound guided SI injections in the US. When you ‚Äúinject‚Äù the SI, you‚Äôre not actually injecting into the joint. It‚Äôs super deep, and you risk hitting a nerve and dropping the horse to the ground. Our vet usually does a mix of Sarapin and some type of steroid. They inject around the SI and into the lower back to get rid of inflammation. Depending on how bad the inflammation/lameness is, they will stay on Robaxin for 2 weeks, 2x a day. 

A lot of people are saying kissing spines, which yes, but also kissing spines pain is almost always secondary to something else. I‚Äôve had horses with grade 2 changes, and one horse that had no joint space through his whole back that never had an issue. So before you go spending   thousands of dollars on diagnostics like x-rays, I would do a good ole lameness exam with a good vet and start from there. 

It might also be, you inject the SI, and horse is still off behind, and he might have a soft tissue injury behind as well. A lot of time high suspensory injuries present as back/hock pain. 

And also don‚Äôt listen to the whole ‚Äústeroids are bad for your horse‚Äù bit. Steroids get rid of inflammation. If you‚Äôre doing the injection once, and never have to do it again, great! But I don‚Äôt get why some people are so hot on PRP and other biologics. You cannot control the amount of platelets, and you don‚Äôt really know exactly what you‚Äôre injecting with. No one truly knows what a ‚Äústandard‚Äù dosing is, or what a ‚Äústandard‚Äù protocol is.",1714521743.0

Maybe they get to the river and see there's actually another group trying to get across already. Maybe they're halfway across and fighting for their lives again forty alligators, or dozens of tentacles the size of trees. The players can't do anything except watch as this other party is devoured.

Or they get to the shore and as they're preparing their boat a storm giant skeleton stands up on the other side. Towering over the forest. Maybe it looks their way before moving away and disappearing into the fog. Or maybe theirs the roar of something massive and terrible sounding. The giant skeleton then flees the are in fear of whatever it is.

Maybe the other shore is shrouded in fog, but as a gust blows through the party can briefly see dozens of skeletal warriors armed with bows standing on the other bank of the river.

There are times as a GM when the only way to get the point across narratively is to be overly dramatic and heavy handed. ""Yes, you can cross THE BRIDGE OF CERTAIN DOOM if you want, but as you approach you notice the Tarasque is sitting on the other side picking it's nose.""

Although I personally think the best option is to just let everyone know before the next session, ""hey I love your enthusiasm, but I want to make sure you're all having fun. So I'm telling you now that if you cross the river it's going to be a TPK and you'll all need new characters. If you want that, cool. Everyone needs to bring a replacement character to the next session, and we can maybe see who the last man standing is. If you don't want to be playing new characters by the end of next session, then you need to decide to do something other than cross the river.

Also comes down to whether you actually need the transcoding support - that's impacted by the number of users and the media being played (encoding, resolution etc).

For example most of my media is 1080p, h.265 that I watch on my iPAD and it does quite well without gpu transcoding assistance whether on the network at home or over VPN when away.

depends abit on what u want to do and how much effort u will put into aiming, alot of people dont benefit from going superlight as it only really allows you to improve further while also requiring more mechanical skill from u. objectively lighter is better but its not always the case in practice (unless u main apex or aimtrainers)",1714521746.0

"Psychosis","t5_2tyg2","Try not to give into the feeling. I had a hyper realistic dream with psychosis living my everyday life. During the dream the psychosis would run back to me everything that was going on as if it was preordained. Even before I had psychosis in the dream I was having dreams within those that was as if predicting the future. Seeing places and people that I ram I to later and then developed psychosis.

 Heck even now I have been to places and had a psych that was in the dream as well. Even called places that were from the dream as well. Went to the same psych ward, had the same breakdown at work. The only reason why most of the stuff is on repeat is because I fear that it is going to repeat and the psychosis took away my reasoning during the time. 

Even now after living with psychosis for coming up to three years now I think and having to live with it on a daily basis I get the same ""We are reading your life like already written book."" from the psychosis. But even with all the evidence that it presents me and the flashbacks to the time that it told me in my dream (Which was a 1 to 1 of reality.) I just ignore it and try to move along in life and not worry about it. 

Sure it's iinteresting if it was true, but even if it did tell me that all this was going to happen in my dream and I'm living in a reality where I was predicted to do these things. This is after I have lived in my dream several times on repeat. *Shrugs* Eventually the psychosis would have figured out how I worked and can predict what might happen. Or heck it could be a intense halusination using some part of my brain chemicals to make it feel like all this is preordained. (No matter how much the psychosis wants to instill the feeling of ""We are telling the truth and you are just going through life by the book that we wrote."") 

Somethings can also be explained that the psychosis is directing my response and thus making what it bad predicted in the dream come true.

Just do your best not to give into the feeling no matter how real it feels, and don't think your just stubbornly denying what the psychosis is telling you. You are here. Live life knowing that you are. (Apparently I had the same Truman show experience I my dream as well. A fun reminder from the psychosis just told me.)",1714521746.0

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","While I can't directly answer the question, I have never sought a dom personally, I have a couple relevant tips. These are really basic for interpersonal relationships and many people may assume you don't have to be explicit, but

- Clear communication is a must.
Green: this person can speak clearly and openly about what they want and listens to you in a way that you feel safe doing the same. They tell you when/if your wants don't match with theirs on a particular topic.
Red: this person does not focus their attention when listening to you/prefers to talk about themselves and what they want over you. If you are not feeling heard, or get the feeling that they are being performative, this may be the case.

- Boundaries are sexy
Green: this person has boundaries, they want to tell you about them, they ask for yours, and they demonstrate respect for your boundaries. Especially the small ones. You have to be comfortable saying no to them.
Red: this person is avoidant/disinterested when talking about boundaries, theirs or yours.
Red: they cross small social boundaries or behave unpredictably/unreliably. Watch their actions and consciously compare those with what they have said.

And importantly: They say the basic stuff out loud and don't simply assume that the two of you are on the same page",1714521747.0

What sets should you buy? Honestly if you're just cracking packs, collecting and playing casually, then whatever you think sounds interesting. There's no specific set that you *need* to get.

3) CBP may push her to voluntarily relinquish LPR at the border. If she doesn‚Äôt they still have to let her through and issue a Notice to Appear for a judge to make a determination.

He presensts Kuro≈Ñ as some kind of cynic, while he is one of the author (with modzelewski being the second) of famous 60s letter to pzpr in which they critziism form Trostkist perspective dominance of PZPR. And the fact that Kuro≈Ñ remains one of the saddest portirats of communist opposition.  He dosen't mentioned Karol Modzelewski who remained socialist, while still being an important guy in opposition. He dosen't mention Anarchists (of course), he dosen't even mention reformists parts of PZPR. 

Of course i fucking hate most of stars of the polish communists opposition. They are bloodlusting liberlas, fethizing the capitalist. They're responsible for mutiple deaths during the transformation. But that dosen't mean that 70s and 80s. Poland was shit. Hell 80s Poland wasn't even socialist and Jaruzelski was a fucking militarist. 

I always wonder why tankies like to present CIA funding as so kind of undermining argument. "". Same goes for Solidarno≈õƒá, you don't need CIA funidng to build stable social movment. If the material conditions of the working class in the siad region is bad and their class consciousness is high they will flock to your organiazation. If communists poland was so fire why the fuck every ten years thosand of workers protested. 

AND THE MOST ANOYING IS THE FACT THAT HE DOES NOT MENTION FAMOUS ONE OF THE FIRST SOLIDARNOSC'S SLOGANS WHICH WAS ""CHCEMY SOCJALIZMU BEZ PA≈ÅEK I KASTEST√ìW"" which means something like We want socialism without police bats and helmets.",1714521749.0

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","Ah, i see your distinction. I could be twisting that, and you may be right. I'm not a debater by any means, and I see this different as kind of semantic. I guess my naive usage of ""government"" is something akin to ""those institutions, systems and collectives that administer control over a territory"" (i just made that up). So very much meaning the tangible idea of government, as opposed to the process of governance.

Just quickly googling it seems to support that kind of definition as pretty standard: 

""1. the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office.
""the government's economic record""

Wikipedia says 

""A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state.""

Despite that, your usage is obviously legitimate too, and I recognise that usage. Im not usually active on this sub tbh, and kind of blown away by how intensely it revolves around dictionary definitions! 

If we accept that the parties are governed by their agreement, then yes I suppose the agreement is, in that way, a kind of government. But i would argue that this language is unhelpfully confusing, especially in this context, and maybe a better word could be used? 

Maybe the two parties are ""governed"" by their agreement, and are under the ""governance"" of it, as opposed to the ""government"".",1714521751.0

"Gadgetry","t5_90r23l","Congratulations on becoming a new parent! Finding the right baby wrap or sling can definitely be tough, but you've identified some great criteria to help narrow down your choices. Here's some info to consider for each point:

**Comfort:**

* **Wraps:** Popular options known for comfort include Solly Baby Wrap (\[similar baby wraps\]), Boba Wrap Carrier (\[Boba wrap\]), and L√çLL√âbaby Dragonfly Wrap (\[LILLE baby wrap\]). These use soft, breathable fabrics that distribute weight evenly.
* **Slings:** Look for slings with padded shoulder straps like the Maya Wrap ComfortFit Sling (\[maya wrap sling\]).

**Ease of Use:**

* **Wraps:** Some wraps, like the Baby K'tan Wrap (\[baby ktan\]), are designed to be easier to put on for beginners. There are also many online tutorials for different wrapping techniques.
* **Slings:** Slings are generally simpler to use than wraps, requiring just one shoulder strap. Ring slings like Nalakai (\[Nalakai ring sling\]) offer quick adjustments.

**Versatility:**

* **Wraps:** Most wraps can be used for multiple carrying positions (front-facing, hip carry) as your baby grows.
* **Slings:** Not all slings offer multiple positions. Look for adjustable ring slings or convertible slings that allow for front or hip carrying.

**Durability:**

* **Wraps & Slings:** Many are made from machine-washable fabrics like cotton or modal. Look for options with reinforced stitching for long-lasting use.

**Safety:**

* Always choose a wrap or sling that complies with safety standards set by ASTM International (an organization that sets safety standards for consumer products).
* Look for brands with certifications on their websites.",1714521751.0

Streamlabs was originally a community software created on top of OBS Studio, which has since been monetized and then sold to Logitech for $89M in 2019, largely without ever contributing back to the open-source code. They've also been involved in several controversies before.

Officially, this subreddit supports open-source and community-based projects. If the support we provide translates to commercial products, that is an added bonus. 

Because Streamlabs is a company, they have the money to pay for full-time support staff. For issues with their software, it's better to seek support on their website or [their subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamlabs/).

Because scripture clearly says animals are used in farming for their wool, milk, pulling ploughs and of course their meat for food. Humans are made in the image of God, who breathed life into us. Animals are not and did not have this. There is no plan of redemption for animals (they do not have souls to redeem).

I'll go take a seat when you present something of substance to back up your claims. 

Why would God give them to us for food? As I said l, after the flood, He did and here's the passage in Genesis to prove it. 

‚ÄúAnd God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, ‚ÄúBe fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. And the fear of you and the terror of you will be on every beast of the earth and on every bird of the sky; with everything that creeps on the ground, and all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given. Every moving thing that is alive shall be food for you; as with the green plant, I give all to you.‚Äù

Now im also on my 3rd therapist trying ICBT. I will say ive been suicidal several times, even had intrusive thoughts about it and compulsions. im still struggling to keep my head above water tbh. Im sorry you're struggling so much and I want you to know that you arent alone out there. This group is proof of that to, there are so many others out there struggling. I highly recommend finding a therapist that does ICBT therapy, its the only shred of hope I have left. If you do end your life, you are letting OCD win, cause thats what it wants, to control your life until your last breath. It doesnt have to be that way, it will get worse, much worse before it gets better. We have to believe it gets better and you will get better <3. Hang in there and breath.",1714521752.0

Here's how I would approach it.

Tzeentch would be playing a game with the antagonist, and he'll promise to reveal the true nature of reality. But of course it's never so simple... He tells the antagonist that he will provide him three versions of true reality.

The other two are for the author to figure out, but one of them is that they're all just a work of fiction, but words on a page, drawn from the minds of the true creators and offered up as mere entertainment.

The protagonist will dismiss it outright (because wouldn't we all) and pursue another path, and of course whichever of the other options he pursues is wrong, the irony of course being that we as the readers know the true nature of their reality.

It doesn't directly break the fourth wall, but subtly hints that Tzeentch just might know it's there.",1714521753.0

My husband is rarely home for dinner, so we don't have many ""family dinners"" like I had growing up. 

But anyway, my kid is so bad at eating meals and so unfocused (autistic, maybe ADHD). Honestly, school has helped with his time table. 

But I make dinner a ""dinner party"" and make a charcuterie board with no actual main. I try to keep it well balanced and he is able to flit from one side of the board to the other and keep some focus. I use different dishes and sometimes we share. Which is also fun.

Book 3 was the point where they became international hits, and there was MASSIVE hype for the release of book 4. 

I was given the first three books for Christmas when I was 9/10. Book 4 came out when I was 12, and EVERYONE either wanted the book or decided they were too cool for them

It's easy to forget how influential the books were. Before Harry Potter, kids wanted gameboys and Pokemon. JK made reading books popular again. Without HP, other series like Percy Jackson, Series of Unfortunate Events, Twilight, etc, wouldn't have been as successful",1714521755.0

"anime","t5_2qh22","**QUESTIONS**

1. LoGH comparison is most obvious and accurate, I flashed back to the show when watching some of the space battles and this show was clearly modeled on that.  Star Trek (especially the Next Generation) was another clear one as you had the lives of spaceship officers and many similar plots, like the prison island plot would have fit perfectly.   Another weird one that Crest reminded me of is the non sci fi adventure movie Romancing the Stone with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.  That's a wonderful movie about a dangerous adventure in South America where the 2 people form a romance and it REALLY reminded me of Jinto and Lafiel on Sfagnomr at times.
2. Crest was so different from the rest of the show, like a romantic adventure with a sci fi element.  The other ones seemed 1 side LoGH though.
3. Don't really know but some parts seemed so rushed like the Abh just quickly defeated United Mankind at the end of 2 seasons and that was given really short shrift.
4. Already mentioned mostly but Banner II was my favorite season and I guess Banner I my least.
5. Crest of the Galactic Heroes: Triumph of the ~~Galactic Empire~~ Abh
6. Yes I would highly recommend it, especially to fans of sci fi/older sci fi.  I'd tell them to soldier thru the first episode where they speak unsubtitled Abh and they will enjoy the rest.
7. Yes I thought so.  I in fact prefer what it does to a lot of modern shows.  Orchestral music instead of blasting techno.  The slower pace that isn't made for ADD sufferers and allows characters to breathe.  I shudder at how they would remake this today :-o
8. Maybe.  It's rare that I read source material for an anime, it usually takes me years if i end up doing so.

The consoles are the existing Dyson set with the 4-piece set bonus built in.  The 4th fore slot is freed up by the Proton Duals being moved to the Exp Weapon.  BOff and console layouts look good to me.

To me, if there is anything to be upset about, it's that not one of these ships brings a new secondary deflector to the field.

"astrologyreadings","t5_2yyht","Don‚Äôt worry! Astrology is one of the most complex topics out there. It‚Äôs an art and science that can never be learnt completely and takes lifetimes to learn. We‚Äôre trying to decipher cosmic intelligence. Try watching and reading about your placements one by one. There‚Äôs so much to say, but I‚Äôll just quickly list the most important placements you have. Your are a Libra rising (in Swati Nakshatra) with Venus as your lord in the 5th house Aquarius (in shatabhisha Nakshatra). I can say confidently say that you‚Äôre a super creative person and you need to be doing something in your career that‚Äôs creative. There‚Äôs also a strong love for understanding mysteries, and life and death. That‚Äôs shatabhisha Nakshatra. Your rising sign and where the lord goes shows your life path. 

Your moon sign is your mind, emotions and basically how you think. It‚Äôs the most important factor in your personality. Your moon is in Scorpio (in Jyestha Nakshatra)and also conjuct ketu(also known as the south node). Scorpio is a water sign, emotional and intuitive. It originally rules the 8th house of secrets, the occult and transformations. Moon in Scorpio indicates a very emotional person, their minds are like oceans with waves going up and down. They can get obsessive and possessive about interests and people. Scorpio moons are definitely more inclined to research the occult and desire to learn the mysteries of life and the universe. They can be quick to fall in love with anything, but get quickly burnt out. It also indicates issues with your mother, maybe she was authoritative or wasn‚Äôt there for you emotionally growing up. Your moon being conjuct ketu is a strong sign for spirituality, strong intuition and seeing and understanding beyond the physical realm. 

Also, so your sun and mercury is in Pisces, not Aries. Pisces is the final sign of the zodiac, the 12th sign. It‚Äôs all about the final destination of life, blending into the unknown, dreams, spirituality, compassion and creativity. Pisces sun and mercury in the 6th house..hmm you would be very compassionate and caring and also introverted. The sun is your confidence and how you shine in the world. Mercury is  your intelligence and a receptor. Yeah, hmm you seem to be a quite compassionate person but also extremely creative and mystical. You don‚Äôt have a lot of placements signalling extroversion, other than your libra rising. Libra risings tend to want to make connections with people and create harmony, but I fee you kind of lee a distance from people.

A few notes - If you post or comment in this subreddit and have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned. We are a SFW sub that keeps content PG-13 and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.


Please do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.


Please REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


We will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported...give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

"Handhelds","t5_2xf7o","As a long time xbox fan, I agree. Xbox One and the Series consoles have been nothing but an absolute snooze fest in comparison to the 360.

As good of a deal as gamepass is, subscription based gaming is silently and slowly killing the gaming industry. Because why take a risky investment making a new title if the fans have hundreds of games to choose from? They've built a cash cow and now they're sleeping on it.

For example, why were there so many amazing games to play on the 360? Because the developer of the game had to make sure it had the engaging ""FUN"" aspect. You know, the whole point of video games? They had to make the game stand out from the competition in order to win consumers over.

Now that subscription gaming is mainstream, the money just constantly keeps flowing in. They don't have to work for that big return when a new game drops, it just comes without the work. Don't get me wrong I love that most 360 games are backwards compafible. But the problem is that they're relying on previous hit titles to be their service. That's just borderline lazy.",1714521760.0

"NatureofPredators","t5_6sz7xl","Sounds unlikely - all of the genefixed venlil have at least grandparents who aren't. Personal connections are anathema to bigotry. Beyond that, the differences between them aren't *that* profound.

The non-fixed venlil we see have the exact same potential for bravery and aggression as any others, Slanek and Tarva being the obvious examples. It's just been locked up by a lifetime of indoctrination. The modifications certainly didn't manage to reduce venlil emotional volatility at all.

Honestly, I think that the farsul were just on some pseudoscience bullshit when they concluded that the nose removal reduced aggression.

The most common thing you'd see is hardcore Federation loyalists on the non-fixed side, but after decades among the four-chamber heart of the SC anyone who hasn't fled to the True Federation is part of a dying and fringe ideology. Racism from the genefixed side, probably almost nothing at all. It's a little hard to call your own granny an inferior species, you know?",1714521760.0
"Writeresearch","t5_34i7v","First they blindfolded me. After several hours of transport in darkness i was stripped naked, my head was shaved and i was completely restrained to a metal chair. That's when they took off the blindfold. The room was so bright my mind just saw white. They were playing some sound like a nail being dragged across a blackboard. Once my vision returned i noticed the man sitting behind a table with a small black box on it. There where two wires leading away from the box that draped down the table to the floor and appeared to be connected to the chair. Thats when i realized my feet where in a large pan filled with what smelt like salt water. The man stands up and walks towards me. He has a large stick like a horse whip in his hands. He tucks his hands behind his back allowing the stick to hang ominously over his head as he speaks. He tells me he is only here for information. If i am truthful with him then nothing will happen to me. However if I lie the lie detector on the table will buzz and for every buzz there may be a penalty. Now its making sense its not for electrocution but to feed bio info to the device. But because of the set up I can not rule out electrocution as a possible response. From behind someone stands with a large syringe filled with a clear liquid. I am told it is a possible repercussion of being untruthful. At that moment the sound of a generator being spun up is audible in the room. My heartrate is through the roof at this point. At any moment he may decide to ask me a question and with my vidals being what they are right now they may decide its an untruthful response. He continues for the next hour describing some of the various penalties will be before a rag is placed over my face and i instantly lose consciousness. I wake up some time later in complete and utter darkness. I'm floating in a liquid and it appears I'm in a coffin sized box. Im left here for a amount of time i am unable to tell. Thats when a hiss starts and im out almost instantly. I awaken back in the chair, naked again. The same man is in front of me and asks ""so are we ready now?

The director could have said this movie represents obesity in the sense they don't sugar coat it by representing it as a happy fat kid. Obesity has weight and has consequences in the movie. But still, it's just a symptom of a larger problem and that's Charlie, a multi-problem kind of guy.

"Epilepsy","t5_2s1h9","Left temporal lobe epilepsy/hippocampal transection surgery here. 

Before I had my first GTC 12 years ago, I had pretty selectively great memory.  300+ digits of pi, remembered everyone's phone numbers from my childhood- that kind of thing.  Part of the reason they recommended surgery was because they saw my memory decline from top 5% to ""average"" and they didn't want to see it drop further.

They *did* warn that there was a chance the surgery would make my memory worse, but that ""doing nothing"" would have a higher chance of this (based on the trend over the 12 years).

Sadly, my memory is pretty shot now.  But I'm grateful that my epilepsy is far better under control- or else they would have resorted to a full left hippocampul resection.

In regards to how I've learned to cope- once I learned to accept it, I've become *very* dependent on writing everything down somewhere.  At work, OneNote is my best friend.  I am constantly typing everything during meetings (fortunately, they're almost all virtual).  OneNote is invaluable because the ""search"" function and ""tabs""/""groups"" makes notes so much easier to find, organize, and actually use.  Outside of work, if I need to remember something, I'll put it into my phone- either in a note or on my calendar.  Search functions in both.

In general, pen/paper notes are terrible because they'll all get jumbled and never actually used.  

It hurt a bit at first to feel ""dependent"" on things, especially the frustrating times when I forget to write something down- but better than vainly hoping I have my old brain back.",1714521761.0

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

 Please read all the rules before engaging in this sub. We're adults here, so communicate, please!

"DIYUK","t5_2yv61","My situation several years ago is not to disimilar from yours and i tell this not as advice but as what has been done and worked.
We moved into out 1935 semi detached bungalow and had to basically start renovating. Estate sale hadn't been touched since at least the 80s and the lighting circuit looked like the original.
So my dad (corgi register central heating engineer) and i got to work on plumbing. Got a sparky infir some electrical work and a fitter to build the new kitchen.

While my dad was working on the boiler i made a start on the bathroom. The idea being to take tiles off. Put most of the new furniture and fittings in and finish with decoration asap. The problem was that as i was going round the bathroom knocking on the walls for that hollow sound that indicates loose tiles it wasn't the tile that were loose but the plaster behind them. I ended up pulling about 70% of the plaster off. Got a plasterer in for advice and costs etc and was told he could dot dab and skim coat in but it would be done over 3 days due to prep work etc. It would be another week as he only had 2 days to spare this week. To get that done i stripped the rest of the plaster off. All the ways round to the brick work gaves the walls a light wash and good brush down and then liberally coates with a pva/water mix in order to seal it. Plasterer came in later thatbweek and did his think after which i tiled floor and walls.

 It's been like that since without issue.",1714521762.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","If you're in a safe place and that you know can stay safe...

Sometimes the point of a thing is just doing it.  Even if it doesn't work.  In this case, you'd be showing yourself you can stand and put up boundaries and try to enforce them as much as possible because you are worthy of better.  Not deserving...  Worthy.  Worth is based on who you are and simply being a human being existing in the same space as others.  Deserve is based on what you've done or your circumstances.

You are worthy of better.

So start with small things.  Start with accepting that you are worthy of good things.  That doesn't change even if the police can't issue a TRO for you (though medical records for your broken arm would help with that).  Talk to the police, to women's services, to almost anyone.  Let it be awkward.  Let it be hard.  Let it feel embarrassing or isolating or exhilarating.  All of that is valid.

Then maybe accept that you are worthy of living.  Living a life free of fear, harm, and guilt.  Fear, harm, and guilt brought to you by others who have let you down in life and created trauma.  And free from fear, harm, and guilt that you build within yourself by yourself.

Sometimes it takes a while for the bird who was once in the case to realize it can truly fly away.  Give yourself grace as you navigate this new life.

But also...  Fight for this new life too.  Don't be bogged down with the negativity of ""it might not work"".  As Wayne Gretzky taught us, ""You miss 100% of the shots you never take.""

Take your shot.",1714521762.0

"hypotheticalsituation","t5_2uccy","I'd be more worried that someone would try to kill me to get rid of this annoying app on their phone telling them where some random low-level millionaire is than I would be about anything else. 

Notably, killing me doesn't get someone access to any more money than I have on my person when they kill me. So financially, there's very little motivation to kill me.

And I can turn it off at any time, so if someone kidnaps you for the money, just turn it off. So there's also very little incentive from anyone with the means and knowledge to kidnap a millionaire to actually do so.

Lastly, I'd spend a few thousand early on to develop a sister app to the first. It just tracks to see if anyone has done 'x' yet for the day. Maybe it's take a selfie with me, maybe it's ""go get a coffee"" etc. That starts at a random time. And whoever logs doing that thing first gets 2 grand. This way, I'm spreading out the money just a little bit, I still make 2.9 million a year, and now everyone who cares enough to track the app every day, can make a cool 2 grand without having to commit any crimes or harm me in any way. I'm basically a lottery to leave alone vs. worthless if you hurt me.

Alternatively, since everyone follows your location, you're one of the most valuable marketing tools on the planet. Give away 9 grand a day instead of the 2 mentioned earlier, once people start associating you with ""the guy who gives away thousands of dollars every day for free"" and see you remotely positively, brand and celebrities would pay massively to have you attend charity events, brand launches, parties, movie premieres etc. Because you being their means that everyone on the planet suddenly can see their event.

Potentially, you turn 10k a day into far more of you, manage your time and money right as the most famous person alive.",1714521763.0

1. ""Ile to kosztuje i czemu tak drogo?""

S≈Çyszƒô to pytanie przynajmniej 5 razy dziennie. To pytanie nie jest, nie by≈Ço i nigdy nie bƒôdzie zabawne. Je≈õli u≈ºywasz tego pytania, wszelkie szanse na dodatkowy rabat w≈Ça≈õnie przepad≈Çy.

2. ""A jeszcze tylko spytam...""

Je≈õli sko≈Ñczy≈Çem obs≈Çugiwaƒá ciƒô i przeszed≈Çem do nastƒôpnego klienta, a ty sobie przypomnia≈Çe≈õ, ≈ºe potrzebujesz jeszcze kilku rzeczy, wr√≥ƒá na koniec kolejki, a nie przepychaj siƒô na prz√≥d. Twoje zapominalstwo nie jest ani moim problemem, ani problemem klient√≥w, kt√≥rzy byli za tobƒÖ i czekali w kolejce.

3. ""Nie znam siƒô, ale wiem lepiej...""

Je≈õli jednoznacznie stwierdzam, ≈ºe nie masz racji, to znaczy, ≈ºe nie masz racji. Je≈õli uwa≈ºasz, ≈ºe twoje ""wydaje mi siƒô"" jest lepsze od mojego ""wiem"", to nie wracaj p√≥≈∫niej z pro≈õbƒÖ o zwrot albo ""reklamacjƒÖ"", bo ci nie dzia≈Ça.

4. ""A bo w internecie widzia≈Çem taniej.""

To kup w internecie. Zrozum, ≈ºe koszty prowadzenia sklepu wysy≈Çkowego w szopie pod Radomiem sƒÖ ni≈ºsze ni≈º sklepu stacjonarnego w centrum miasta, i nie jestem w stanie sprzedawaƒá w takich cenach jak w internecie.

5. ""Chcia≈Çbym sobie zbudowaƒá takie co≈õ‚Ä¶""

Super, powiedz, czego potrzebujesz, a z przyjemno≈õciƒÖ ci to sprzedam. Ale je≈õli nawet nie po≈õwiƒôci≈Çe≈õ 10 minut na sprawdzenie, czego potrzebujesz, i oczekujesz, ≈ºe ja ci to powiem, to muszƒô ciƒô rozczarowaƒá. Nie jestem in≈ºynierem/technikiem/wynalazcƒÖ, jestem handlowcem. Moim zadaniem jest zapewniƒá ci dostƒôp do odpowiednich czƒô≈õci w dobrej cenie. Mam 25 000 pozycji asortymentowych, nie mam wszystkich schemat√≥w i kart katalogowych w g≈Çowie. Je≈õli potrafiƒô, to chƒôtnie co≈õ doradzƒô, ale projektowanie, lista element√≥w i zdobycie wiedzy do wykonania projektu le≈ºy po twojej stronie. W sklepie spo≈ºywczym te≈º nie pytasz obs≈Çugi, jak ugotowaƒá zupƒô, prawda?

6. ""Wonny.""

Ludzie‚Ä¶ myjcie siƒô. Nie sƒÖdzi≈Çem, ≈ºe bƒôdƒô musia≈Ç to m√≥wiƒá, ale to prawda.

7. ""Zabawiacz.""

Je≈õli akurat nie ma klient√≥w w sklepie, to absolutnie nie znaczy, ≈ºe siedzƒô i jedyne, o czym marzƒô, to rozmowa z tobƒÖ o tym, jak to kiedy≈õ by≈Ço dobrze. Mam 20 e-maili do odpowiedzenia i 10 zam√≥wie≈Ñ do spakowania zanim przyjedzie kurier. Na prawdƒô mam co robiƒá.

8. ""Przerywacz.""

Je≈õli prosisz o wyt≈Çumaczenie czego≈õ, wys≈Çuchaj mnie do ko≈Ñca. Je≈õli bƒôdziesz mi ciƒÖgle przerywaƒá, wtrƒÖcajƒÖc swoje domys≈Çy, moja chƒôƒá pomocy drastycznie spadnie.

9. ""Kolega.""

Nie ma znaczenia, ≈ºe jeste≈õmy w tym samym lub podobnym wieku. Nie jeste≈õmy kolegami, nie ≈õlizgali≈õmy siƒô na jednym g√≥wnie w przedszkolu. Bez wzglƒôdu na wiek, dla mnie jeste≈õ Pan/Pani, a dla ciebie ja jestem Panem. Szacunku i kultury trochƒô.

10. ""Negocjator.""

""Jak by≈Çem w Turcji, to tam trzeba siƒô targowaƒá. Pan mi opu≈õci cenƒô na tƒô jednƒÖ sztukƒô.""

Czy ja ci wyglƒÖdam turka? Ceny mam ustalone tak, aby obie strony by≈Çy zadowolone. Rabaty udzielam sta≈Çym klientom lub tym, kt√≥rzy zamawiajƒÖ ilo≈õci choƒáby zbli≈ºone do hurtowych.",1714521763.0

Please resubmit your post so the title contains one of the following approved phrases, to indicate you're unwavering support of the Dear Leader:

* I love King Spez

* Worship Daddy Spez

* I love our Dear Leader Spez

(Of course, some variations of these phrases are permitted, but you must still celebrate King Spez in the prescribed manner)

If you do not wish to demonstrate allegience to the Dear Leader, consider departing the domain of the Supreme Landed Gentleman and actually touching some grass.

He can also, for the most part, kick and mark. So the coaching staff use him as a kind of ruck-utility. Ball in our forward 50 give ruck to Hawk and let Stanley drop back to defend the counter and lock it in. We win a turnover he just powers forward in transition to get numbers to a contest.

Saw some footage on Fox Footy from the weekend showing just that last point. He powered forward on turnover, took a defender as a man in F50 and allowed 2e to come in as 3rd man up and mark the ball 35m out, in front of goal.

I also recall reading a piece of data science in the AFL a couple of years ago and these data scientists said that the number 1 stat that was least correlated with winning/scoring/etc. (basically all the good stuff) was hitouts to advantage.

Finally, we won a flag with Stanley. That wasn‚Äôt an accident.

"Cruise","t5_2qm8s","I did a two-week cruise with Azamara last summer. I loved pretty much every minute of the trip. Here are a few tips that worked for me:
- get fantastic coffee and a light breakfast at Mosaic and enjoy it in your room, away from the nouse and crowds at the buffet
- enjoy the light jazz and snacks at 5:45 pm before dinner
- if you like alcohol, spring for the premium beverage package so you can have great wines, cocktails and single malts
- make an effort to get to know the staff as they will have a huge impact on your happiness
- do an excursion at every port (or just chill on the ship, if that's the vibe you're seeking)
- check the podted menus every day to decide where to have dinner. Ibhad some great meals in the dining room and at the buffet (for Indian, Asian, Moroccan and British-themed meals)
- book a Chef's Table, if you can afford it. The food, wine and service are exemplary
- the spa is hideously overpriced but if they give you a ""new customer"" credit, use it for a hot stone massage
- the gym is basic, but useful. I did yoga, pilates and stretch classes
- don't worry about wearing white at White Night, if that's not your style. I didn't bother, and everything was fine
- the behind-the-scenes ship tour is, once again, wildly overpriced but really informative 
- skip the photography packages, art sales and jewellery unless you're prepared to drop $$$

‚Ä¢ Montgomery Scott (again with the special interests, but also the spiky skill profile, the strong food preferences [see: TNG], the difficulty adapting to new routines)

‚Ä¢ Data (sort of free, but I do just like to mention how loved he is by the crew especially his best friend Geordi. It kept me alive as an undiagnosed teenager.)

‚Ä¢ Tam Elbrun (god, that one episode just built him out so much as someone who has sensory processing disorder, difficulty with hyperempathy, extreme loneliness‚Ä¶ he is me)

‚Ä¢ I already said Geordi LaForge, but it‚Äôs the social awkwardness (despite being a Lieutenant Commander), the spiky skill profile, the constant feeling of overwhelm by one or more senses‚Ä¶ yeah.

In Class Search for Summer 2024, it will only show what applies to the Maroon General Studies requirements. If you search Fall 2024, it'll show you both. I hope this answered your question.

First, can't non-rec you today. They *can* however run a ""will not promote.""

Second, signing a page 11 doesn't mean anything except you acknowledging receipt. If they want to run it, they can do so just the same without your signature. Failing to sign, however, will prevent you from filing rebuttals when applicable. Not saying your choice was wrong, just clarifying the actual meaning.

Third, your Article 31b rights are basically the same as Miranda, and you should review them. If they're read to you, it means you're suspected of a criminal violation and it is not in your best interest to waive them. Even if they are not read to you - in fact, especially - I would not recommend speaking about the issue to anyone, leadership and peers alike.

Finally, you can go down to your installation's defense services office and try to consult them, but until there is something more than ""SgtMaj said I'm being investigated, but I don't know why or what for"", you won't get far because there is nothing for them to advise you about.

"GardeningAustralia","t5_3342f","Hi u/professorkek, 

Usually with cool season grases(rye, fescue & bluegrass), they will be able to perform well and maintain colour throughout the cooler months, but will struggle in the warmer months and will need plenty of water. As these turf types need a lot of water to thrive, we generally recommend using warm season grasses. 

With Buffalo grasses and Zoysia grasses, they are usually only available as a turf roll/slab and are not available as a seed. Please note, all warm season grasses (including buffalo, zoysia, couch and kikuyu will have rhyzomes, which gives them their wear tolerance and ability to recover if damage occurs). 

For specific recommendations for your area, I would recommend reaching out to our local turf suppliers in your region and they will be able to assist you in finding the right turf type for your area. You can see who your local turf suppliers are and their contact details by using this link and entering in your postcode - [https://lawnsolutionsaustralia.com.au/turf-suppliers/](https://lawnsolutionsaustralia.com.au/turf-suppliers/)",1714521766.0

"FinalFantasyIX","t5_2wlj6","I think the only odd thing is that equipment is missable. Once you cross certain story thresholds, the inventory in shops change making low level items impossible to acquire. You can synthesize equipment by combining them meaning an endgame item could be permanently missable if you didn't buy items and keep combining them upwards. Learning abilities is also attached to certain equipment so if you skip too many items, you can be unable to synth certain endgame items or miss abilities completely.

There are guides on exactly how many of each item you need and there is a trick for infinite money fairly early on the game. If you don't want to follow a guide and like blind playthroughs then buy and keep stock of a minimum of 1 of each item and steal as much as you can from every boss.",1714521766.0

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

"interviews","t5_2qity","I am pretty sure you edited your original post. It wasn't just that you followed-up (there's no issue with an initial thank you follow-up email - that is the norm) - it's that they were very clear that you did not qualify/measure up and I believe you said told to look at another company  - and then you continued to contact them and note things you worked on - there is no way within a few weeks your qualifications would get to a certain point they are looking for - so it rubs people the wrong way - when they were clear from the get-go. It's also like you are pushing this newfound qualification. It's not a positive experience to get these types of emails - after you've been told it's a no. 

One follow-up if there was a positive discussion -  would have sufficed. 

Some recruiters/HM may be bad at follow-up, but if I was the Hiring Manager (and I hire people), I would think this is unhinged, when I made it clear it wasn't a good match, and this person kept contacting me trying to push that they are in fact a good match. I would not have framed it like this employer though initially though.  If you sent a simple thank you note for their time and to think of you if anything comes up that aligns with your experience/expertise - that would have been fine.",1714521767.0

Me, my social worker and doctor do expect that there's a possibility that I have ADHD. However, due to the long waitlist and a bunch of other things going on, I haven't had the time to pursue it yet. My doctor suggested to pursue the diagnosis if I return to university since the school can help with that, while providing accommodation.

Gatwick is on two routes to London.  One goes to [Victoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Victoria_station) which is a grand old Rail Terminal that sits between Buckingham Palace and the river and Thameslink services which run through London towards places like Bedford, Peterborough and Cambridge and these will stop at stations including London Bridge, Blackfriars, City Thameslink (which is right by St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral) and St Pancras.

Okay full disclosure I haven't read the book yet.  I'm definitely aware of it and I have talked with associates who have read it.

It appears some guy found documentation in an archive that wasn't labeled.  Which totally happens, you know, things get misplaced all the time.  Hell I found documentation via archives that were in plan sight.  This sounds plausible right?

Here's the problem.  The proof, is that its a document from someone calling himself Every the Pirate and its written in code.  The author assumed its a spy, again not unreasonable. 

What IS unreasonable, is immediately thinking it was Henry Every.  Every was a Rockstar in his era.  There were books, plays, songs, and so forth written about him soon after the heist of the Gunsway.  Everyone knew who he was.

He also went by a lot of alises, Benjamin Bridgemen and Long Ben are just two examples.

To me?  This is probably a spy who took the name as a sorta joke.  Its like Deep Throat, Mark Felton wasn't Linda Lovelace. 

That's my two cents.  I'm at least glad someone wrote about Every, he's a monumental figure in pirate history and he somehow got away with his crimes.  That's not common at all.  Also he was a mass rapist, just kinda felt like noting that as hero worship of Every was common as early as 1706.",1714521768.0
