Got the road bike for a freaking steel too though. Local shop specializes in high end road and TT bikes (Palm Beach FL, moves several 10k-15k bikes a week) had a tange prestige steel frame with full mechanical, rim brake r8000 on the floor and for well over a year (no one in 2018-2019 wanted to touch a steel road bike with rim brakes) just could not get anybody to even look at it. I have been keeping an eye on it for about a year at that point and when I noticed that they had literally stopped wiping the dust off of it I asked how much. They countered ‚Äúhow much you want to pay for it?‚Äù I offered $1000 and they agreed just to get it out of the shop",1627776000

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I would assume any game that has some sort of pay to win mechanism has a variety of this exact system going in their game. 

I can see subtle ways where matchmaking is based upon stats that are only achievable through massive amounts of micro transactions or some form of payment.

I used to play the NHL series from electronics arts and you could tell pretty quickly after the first or second week that it was no point in playing online unless you just dump cash into the game because it just became the players that you saw over and over and over again that would win games were the ones you had to pay out the ass for. You could see within the first month where players honestly spent thousands of dollars on a team and the advantage was so far beyond what was capable of achieving just playing the game that it was stupid and that's why I ended up not playing that series in years.

Which sucks because I love hockey and I love hockey video games. To get that full value you want to play online you want to build your hut team you want to do all these different things but it doesn't make any sense to because players are just so far advanced by buying teams it..... sucks.

Also for anyone who's just saying like ""oh you probably just suck at the game"" I would play regular online games with the pre-existing teams and win 60 70% of the time.... but there was no incentive there's no collecting or team building there was no reason to play the game.....

Here are some resources you might find helpful in creating and keeping healthy, ethical poly relationships: 

**Books:** [More than Two](https://www.amazon.com/More-Than-Two-Practical-Polyamory/dp/0991399706), and [The Ethical Slut](https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Slut-Third-Practical-Relationships/dp/0399579664).

**Subreddits:** /r/Polyamory

Couples: Feel free to post, but we highly recommend you please read this page about [unicorn hunting](https://morethantwo.com/coupleprivilege.html).

Couples looking for a unicorn will often say they want someone to ""join"" their family. Poly triads are not (AB)+C. C isn't ""joining"" anything. You all will create something completely new; four different relationships that all need time and attention. A+B (as with any major life change, your relationship dynamic will probably shift), B+C, A+C, and A+B+C. Imposing unethical, unfair dynamics on a partner may lead to your removal from this subreddit.

I‚Äôll try to keep this short but for starters, I would like to say that I have long thought and accepted that I was the one who was in the wrong in this situation. The title kind of expresses that. However, another recent event has me thinking that maybe the other person has the bigger fault (or it‚Äôs just both of us). 

The club situation happened a few years ago. I (young woman) went out with 2 other young women. I knew the one girl and she brought her friend. We were all exchange students and I really wanted to go to this well-renowned club and they did too.  The vibe is slightly sketchy in terms of there being drug use, little lighting, and this is in a country where we don‚Äôt speak the language, but English gets us around just fine usually and theres a good lgbt+open attitude. 

Anyways, in a well-lit area I meet this cute tourist guy after we bonded over shared concern for a person who was a bit too out-of-it. He was there on his own (also wanted to see this famous club while in town) and so I took him in under our dance group wing. At one point, he asks me to get a drink with him so I tell the girls that. So I was drinking some and he was cute and apparently we were both thirsty so at some point we head off to a slightly secluded area to have a make-out session (not that it matters much, but truly just that). I never left the club but completely lost track of time.

At some point, I‚Äôm checking my phone and realizing the time and start freaking out because I was gone for an unreasonable length of time. I see that I also don‚Äôt have cell connection. I find some, and see texts from the 2 girls. They say something about them trying to look for me and hoped I was okay but eventually left (I think they reasonably thought I went home with him). I sent apology messages right away because if I were in them, I would have really panicked a bit at that.  I felt pretty bad. This is my I think I‚Äôm the ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äú moment. 

At a later point, I told someone else this story and they were saying that the girls really should have looked harder and not just have left. Some part of me agrees because it‚Äôs kind of girl code and I would have never ever left the club without telling them. But I mostly think we just didn‚Äôt know each other well enough.


Okay, flash forward some time. I invite this girl to a group reunion event (vaxed people), she agreed and helped plan to plan the date. Then the day before she cancels, because she‚Äôs on holiday. Not that people can‚Äôt cancel, but it was like no heads up and this plan had involved people traveling there and taking off work. Now we‚Äôve all had to reschedule. 

Added together, I feel like it changes the perspective on the first story a bit, due to some character issues. I‚Äôm wondering if people agree or if AITA?

"QAnonCasualties","t5_1g87gi","From MedCram's YT video ""Coronavirus Pandemic Update 59: Dr. Seheult's Daily Regimen (Vitamin D, C, Zinc. Ouercetin. NAC)"" (21 April 2020). Booked down into a comment helpfully posted by Wishful Thinking:

Vit C = ?mg + naturally occurring in fruit, so eat fruit with vitamin C.
Vit D = 2,500 IU daily or ""62.5 mcg"", so maybe 3 25mcg capsules, or 2 50mcg.
- See notes below about obesity and dosing for vitamin D.
Quercetin = 500mg 2x/day
N.A.C. = 600mg 2x/day
Zinc = 50mg/day short term of exposed to virus, otherwise 40mg daily is safe.
Sleep = 7-8 hrs/night

This video explains the metabolic reasons for the recommendations, and the studies backing then. Other MedCram videos go into detail on some of the supporting metabolic functions that help protect against many such infections.

I take vitamin D September to April anyway from living far enough north to make sure I have enough. My doctor has recommended that for decades. If your are not out getting full sun on face and arms for 15-30 minutes per day then you may need a vitamin D supplement anyway, even in Texas.

I order NAC and Quercetin through Amazon, though a better health supplements store (like GNC) will carry them, too. Zinc is available in most any grocery store, but be mindful of the dose as too much (more that 40mg a day) long term can impact absorption of copper (obtained from food), also an important metabolic mineral.

I get sleep in my bed. Okay, yes, sounds like a joke, but really it's about restful sleep, and for most folks that is in an actual bed. Anywhere you sleep comfortably and wake rested is good. As a teen your sleep requirements are likely longer, but it's really about how rested you feel.

If you are ""morbidly obese"", meaning BMI 30 or higher, the recommendations for oral dosing of vitamin D go up. It appears weight impedes either absorption or the metabolic conversion into calcifediol. I am taking 200mcg (8000 iu) daily. This is not covered in this video, but is available from reviewed studies. I could dig that up if needed. Many doctors don't know this, and may be concerned about ""such a large dose"".

You cannot avoid getting infected, even when vaccinated, especially with the more recent variants. Being ""metabolically ready"" is your best defense to shortening an infection, keeping an infection from making you feel sick, and helping your immune system and the rest of your body better defend and survive an infection. After that following the safe distancing, mask wearing, and hands washing are excellent safety measures.

That said, _being vaccinated_ vastly improves your protection against even the Delta variant. A more recent MedCram video shows the data on that protection. Natural immunity from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain is of little help against the Delta, but the protection from any of the US vaccines is well above reasonable protective levels. If you can get vaccinated, even with the 1-dose J&amp;J, you GREATLY improve your protection. If the aforementioned vaxteen.org/texas can help in any way so the better.

It's a free country. You are free to wear a mask. Anyone who demands you take off your mask (apart from your parents or legal guardians or law enforcement) does not support freedom of choice. Plain and simple. ""I support your right to not wear a mask. I ask you support my personal free right to wear a mask."" If that doesn't shut them up then they're not about freedom.",1627776001

I think the whole thing was a strategy error on Red Bull's part. They wanted to take advantage of the track being as rubbered in as possible, but by waiting as long as they did, they put their drivers behind Mercedes. Had they left their garage 20 seconds earlier, it would've been fine for them.

Had the situations been reversed, Red Bull would've done the same to Mercedes (most likely). It's all about pushing the rules to gain as much of an advantage as a team is able to. I'm relatively confident that it's the way the sport has been for years.",1627776002

"NotHowGirlsWork","t5_adf18","LPT: If you've never been to a gyno before and/or if you're getting a transvaginal ultrasound for the first time, and haven't yet engaged in sexual activity (with a partner or solo) that involves penetration, or if you've found penetration painful/uncomfortable/difficult: 
1) Tell the gyno, just to make sure they're on the same page; 
2) If you're not sexually active *at all* and there's no then ask if you can not have a pap smear, because recent recommendations are reducing the schedule on which people who aren't sexually active/don't have new partners would have them. However, since the HPV virus can be transmitted from skin to skin contact, partnered sexual activity that wouldn't put you at risk of pregnancy or most other STI's may still put you at risk of HPV and may require a pap smear.
2B) There's an HPV vaccine now. If you haven't got it as part of your standard immunizations then get it now! Even if you're not sexually active and not planning on it for a while, the entire series takes ~6 months.
3) Ask them if they can use the pediatric size speculum (unfortunately pediatric size ultrasound wands don't exist, but for children or small/thin adults it's sometimes possible to get a clear enough image through the abdomen during a transabdominal ultrasound to be able to avoid a transvaginal ultrasound)
4) If you're really concerned, ask if you can insert the speculum/wand yourself, although the doctor or tech will have to move/adjust it. The reason this might be helpful is that some people have a uterus, cervix, and/or vagina that aren't at the ""typical"" angle, which is not a medical problem, but it can make getting medical equipment in that much more troublesome because the medical professional won't know what angle it's at until the first time they done an exam or imaging.

As far as ob/gyn selection, I've noticed no problems with being ""gentle"" or ""rough"" going along gender lines. However, male doctors and older doctors do tend to have a ""what if you change your mind"" attitude more than younger ones; and the bigger concern is that among my friends and I who've had experienced inappropriate behavior during a gyno appointment while the female nurse chaperone conveniently happened to be out of the room, 100% of it was from male ob/gyns over 40-50 or so (I think that part of it's just age and culture change - it used to simply be easier to get away with it, and now it's not, which I suspect might be why we're seeing the more recent cases of abuse by medical professionals come up in fields like sports medicine)

Also a bigger possible issue than your age with regards to sterilization might be whether or not your insurance and their hospital/medical group are willing to cover or perform sterilization procedures - so even if you don't have to wait to be ""old enough"" to be considered competent to make that decision, you may still have to wait until you can get off your current insurance coverage and set up with different coverage.",1627776002

When you‚Äôre peeking from far away to line up the shot, normally you have your head exposed or something so for some reason it seems like the chance they have to hit your other limbs all stacks to what‚Äôs exposed to them from far away.

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt; The only stories that people call great anymore are stories that are only protected by nostalgia 

This is untrue, across both the MMO genre and more in general.

Shadowbringers' MSQ, Secret World Legends and SWTOR's Class Stories (especially Imperial Agent) are all good MMO stories that are either stand-alone from older entries in the IP or their own separate IP.

Shadowbringers' builds on FFXIV's previous content, but given that it is its own separate ""world"", you can enjoy it even if you got a five-minute story synopsis and were handed a skip potion. It becomes vastly more enjoyable if you get the bigger picture behind it and the links to other parts of the story, but it's functional and interesting even without. The expansion's most popular character was one who barely had any screen time prior to ShB.

Secret World Legends is a garbage fire as far as monetization/grind goes, but the story's still fantastic and doesn't rely on any other IP for nostalgia hooks. 

SWTOR's story content is older but they're still some of the the best story content in the game even for brand-new players that have no grounding in the Old Republic setting.

This is really just more a WoW thing. WoW has been relying on the scraps of people's attachment to early WoW/Warcraft III for so long that they've failed to build up any really compelling story arcs outside of stuff rehashed/related to the old stuff.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","The diatonic scale and all its modes (7)

Melodic minor and all its modes (7)

The third option and all its modes (7)

The diatonic scale gets all the love because historically, pretty much the entire western musical system is based on the diatonic scale. We had the diatonic scale long before we had 12 evenly spaced notes. We have a 12 note system in large part because it was a good way to use the diatonic scale in different keys, not because we started with 12 notes and picked 7 out of it as you're doing. The major and minor keys were developed out of the diatonic scale, with some alterations such as raising the 6th/7th in minor keys and have remained one of the largest defining features of common practice period harmony. However, one mode (Locrian) was rarely used because it lacked a perfect 5th. People only know it because it gets lumped in with the other diatonic modes but its overall importance is minuscule.

Melodic minor was a variation of the natural minor scale used to showcase some of the common alterations made to that scale for use in functional harmony and the minor key in the common practice period. It was rarely used as a scale in its own right, more as a variation of the diatonic scale. More recently, however, it's somewhat common to have the modes of the melodic minor used on their own. Modal jazz, for one, will use the modes of the melodic minor in a chord-scale type approach and they're a significant part of jazz education. You don't need to look too far to find it on some other genres too, I'm sure they have use in metal and 20th/21st-century classical music for starters.

The third option doesn't get much love because it has two consecutive semitones and lacks a perfect 5th, both of which are oddities in a system that expressly avoided those for the most part. If I had to name it I'd call it a whole-tone scale with an added passing note. The whole tone scale does get used on occasion, but it's nowhere near as common as the diatonic scale. Someone like Ian Ring might have names for these but I dare say that very, very few musicians will recognize them.",1627776004

There are also a pile of Universities here to develop a portfolio that may include student housing.  Dalhousie, Saint Marys, Kings, Mount Saint Vincent all located in Hfx.  Then you have  Acadia an hour away in Wolfville.

Seriously though, every Belmont has had it bad in one way or another. Trevor was a bit prideful and ended up getting stabbed and almost killed by Isaac as a result in Curse of Darkness. Simon didn't completely destroy Dracula and ended up cursed until he gathered Drac's body parts and purified them. Christopher didn't make sure Dracula was dead during their first encounter and thus the Count came back 16 years later and possessed his son and he had to do it all again on Hard Mode. John Morris overused the Vampire Killer whip and it killed him prematurely.

This would be my thought process: (Inheritance question. What do I know about it? Long term, basis is date of death or AVD, or **when distributed before AVD**, or no later than 6 months after death). Becki died on March 5, Mark inherited stock with FMV **3,400** **on her date of death**. Stock was distributed to him in Oct when FMV was 4,500 (waaay past 6 month, can't be his basis). AVD was elected (no longer need to keep in mind FMV on date of death), **stock was 8k on that date.** Becki originally purchased it in Yr 1 for 1,200 (irrelevant). Mark sold it for **4,500 on the day he received it** (at this point - can't be the date of death (AVD was elected), can't be Oct date (past 6 months)). That leaves us with **8k - 4.5k. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

If being thin, nice, and celibate was as meaningful as people here said, a bunch of church girls wouldn't rot alone into old age with no dating experience. The limitations of ""female privilege"" wouldn't be tinder matches with zero offline follow up.

"AskEurope","t5_2uayg","&gt;Whats your favorite brand?

Well, I currently live in Finland and we only have access to the big brands here: Kozel, Pilsner, Kru≈°ovice, maybe Staropramen. I just in general prefer darker beer, and imo Czechs just do it better than anyone. 

&gt;Do you have something like ""slivovice or hru≈°kovice""

I've had a few exchange students from Poland and Slovakia introduce it to me :) I assume it's more or less the same in Czechia. That shit is tasty! And no, I don't think we have it in Russia. The only analogs I can think of are [Chacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chacha_%28brandy%29?wprov=sfla1) (which is actually Georgian, but everyone drinks it here anyways) and various herbal liqueurs akin to J√§germeister. Every region has its own which is usually made of locally sourced herbs and berries. For example in my home region of Karelia we have [Karelian balsam](https://foodperestroika.com/2019/06/02/the-great-north-part-3-karelian-balsam/) (which is a rather modern invention as I came to understand from that article).

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","I bought the $35,000 Model 3 in March 2020 and that was way out of the price range I was looking at. I initially just wanted to buy a cheap used EV to get to work. I wasn‚Äôt anti Tesla, but I didn‚Äôt want one just like I didn‚Äôt want an iPod when it came out. But then I just kept looking at all the EVs out there and they were total garbage. The $35,000 Model 3 was the only good value I could find, so I went from trying to spend under $10,000 to buying a brand new Model 3. I spent so much time watching videos on it that YouTube eventually showed me some Solving the Money Problem videos which really sold me on the stock, so I put all my money into TSLA on July 1st 2020 and then kept buying with every penny I had. With the profits I made, I essentially paid $10,000 for my car‚Ä¶ not that I‚Äôve sold any stock, but buying that car was the best decision. 

I‚Äôve been working from home for the past 16 months so I‚Äôve had no need to drop $3,000 on autopilot, but once I start commuting to work again I‚Äôll most likely buy it by allocating my overtime pay toward that purchase. I‚Äôll also subscribe to FSD for at least a month, but while my commute is 50 miles each way, it‚Äôs pretty simple and autopilot would give me everything I need, so I‚Äôm not sure that It would be worth $199 a month for FSD at this point.

I mean, what's the point after a while ? Eternity seems boring. I like the idea of being non existent. Watching The Good Place made me realise that my feelings were shared by other people too! Everything should come to an end at some point, it's only natural.

As this is the only life I get, I definitely want to make the most of it and be the better version of myself I can achieve to be. My good actions can survive me, and if I manage to teach my children to be good people too, then this is also my legacy to the future generation.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This came about because card processing sites usually do charge a pretty high fee to process cards and deposit the funds into a company account. This is the case for nearly everything, retail, food, etc. Same goes for wire and echeck services, but its a way to get the funds instantly. A company can opt for domestic ach receipts instead, which would require customers to give a company their banking info and it takes longer (1-3 days depending on banks), but most banks charge nothing for ACH services.

Companies that either don't offer ach payment options for free to customers  or charge a blanket service fee for everything, are doing it on purpose to squeeze an unnecessary extra few bucks out of their customer as miscellaneous income. Oftentimes the fees are inproportionate to the credit processing fees or wire fees. Wire fees are like 20 bucks average and credit card processing is only 1-9% depending on industry. Its immoral, sneaky and just downright fucking mean to charge anything more than 2 dollars for convenience fees.",1627776009

My son doesn't get a reaction like that but be hates breathing in his hot breath and feels discussing if he has to sneeze or cough because that is indeed gross to do in a mask that you then have to continue to have pressing on your skin.

My kids are healthy and have a very low risk if they should contract covid.  My wife and I are vaccinated so even if my kids somehow got covid it wouldnt be an impact to my family.  If they want to force teachers to wear them more power to them but covid still isn't a big deal for healthy children and if the parents are also vaccinated it's not a big deal for them either.

"ChristianUniversalism","t5_2spxl","Personally I think of ‚Äúhell‚Äù as the realm of ‚Äúthe dead‚Äù‚Ä¶those not yet awakened to spiritual life (Eph 5:14, Col 2:13)

I see the Lake of Fire as a Refiner‚Äôs Fire, in which death and hell are vanquished (Rev 20:14: Mal 3:2-3, Heb 12:29). 

And Gehenna (the valley of Ben-Hinnom), I see as the place of judgment for IDOLATRY for religious leadership. This is where Jeremiah judges the LEADERS of Israel for allowing CHILD SACRIFICES to Molech and Baal (Jer 32:34-35, Jer 19).

So too, those who now employ the ungodly doctrine of Eternal Torment to frighten children into believing are metaphorically sacrificing children to the false fires of God‚Äôs wrath, rather than preaching a True God of Love, Mercy, Gentleness, Kindness, and Peace (Gal 5:22-23).",1627776012

"JonBenet","t5_35vmd","I edited it right after posting it and before getting a notification to your reply. I thought of more that I wanted to address concerning your comment and thought it better to edit the comment vs making a new one. I understand your criticism of it but the edit button is a feature that exists on this website and does serve a useful purpose that I am allowed to utilize.

You are bringing up another post which is not only off topic but is suggestive of something that I wasn't discussing in that post. I barely mentioned the broker. I merely asked if the person knew how long the process might have taken between the broker and John Ramsey so I could get a better sense of the timeline. I even explained this. I don't work in banking but I do know that various tasks involve a process that someone who is familiar with it should be able give a general time frame of how long it might take to do. I didn't know if they would know this but figured it couldn't hurt to ask if they did.

I have no idea of what you are discussing there with John Andrew Ramsey. How would I know his motives for posting? I have seen no reason to suspect his motives and I think pursuing the DNA evidence is a wise move to make in this case. I have nothing negative to say about him and can't judge the man for believing his family is innocent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Regardless none of us needs to go back to the beginning and start over and sometimes I think you want to do that, relearn and unlearn facts we have come to know.

Can I suggest that instead of viewing it this way (quoted above), you view it another way? I am somewhat new to the case and don't know as many of the facts as others might. I might ask questions that others already know. I might want to discuss things that don't interest some people. I might pick up information that isn't credible and will appreciate a respectful correction. I might accept expert opinions or sources that others don't. I might have opinions that others don't agree with. I might apply things that I have learned in my education and career to this case, in ways that others might not think to do or that they flat out reject. Over time, with more information, my opinions might change. Can you please give me room to participate in groups without all the criticism, attitudes, personal attacks..?",1627776015

https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/12/the-story-behind-ron-pauls-racist-newsletters/250338/

&amp;nbsp;

Some other choice language regarding black/gay people:

&gt;In an item titled, ‚ÄúThe Pink House?‚Äù the author of a newsletter--again, presumably Paul--complained about President George H.W. Bush‚Äôs decision to sign a hate crimes bill and invite ‚Äúthe heads of homosexual lobbying groups to the White House for the ceremony,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI miss the closet.‚Äù ‚ÄúHomosexuals,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúnot to speak of the rest of society, **were far better off when social pressure forced them to hide their activities**.‚Äù When Marvin Liebman, a founder of the conservative Young Americans for Freedom and a longtime political activist, announced that he was gay in the pages of National Review, a Paul newsletter implored, ‚ÄúBring Back the Closet!‚Äù Surprisingly, one item expressed ambivalence about the contentious issue of gays in the military, but ultimately concluded, ‚ÄúHomosexuals, if admitted, should be put in a special category and **not allowed in close physical contact with heterosexuals**.‚Äù

&gt;The newsletters were particularly obsessed with AIDS, ‚Äúa politically protected disease thanks to payola and the influence of the homosexual lobby,‚Äù and used it as a rhetorical club to beat gay people in general. In 1990, one newsletter approvingly quoted ‚Äúa well-known Libertarian editor‚Äù as saying, ‚ÄúThe ACT-UP slogan, on stickers plastered all over Manhattan, is ‚ÄòSilence = Death.‚Äô **But shouldn‚Äôt it be ‚ÄòSodomy = Death‚Äô?‚Äù** Readers were warned to avoid blood transfusions because gays were trying to ‚Äúpoison the blood supply.‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I the only one sick of hearing about the ‚Äòrights‚Äô of AIDS carriers?‚Äù a newsletter asked in 1990. That same year, citing a Christian-right fringe publication, an item **suggested that ‚Äúthe AIDS patient‚Äù should not be allowed to eat in restaurants and that ‚ÄúAIDS can be transmitted by saliva,‚Äù** which is false. Paul‚Äôs newsletters advertised a book, Surviving the AIDS Plague--also based upon the casual-transmission thesis--and defended ‚Äúparents who worry about sending their healthy kids to school with AIDS victims.‚Äù Commenting on a rise in AIDS infections, one newsletter said that ‚Äúgays in San Francisco do not obey the dictates of good sense,‚Äù adding: ‚Äú[T]hese men don‚Äôt really see a reason to live past their fifties. They are not married, they have no children, and their lives are centered on new sexual partners.‚Äù Also, ‚Äú**they enjoy the attention and pity that comes with being sick**.‚Äù

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","My take is that if such a technology was available, and the same process to abort was used to transfer an embryo to this incubator, then it becomes similar to embryo donation.  Currently, we allow couples who have frozen embryos to agree to have them destroyed, and those embryos cannot be donated without both parties consent.  

So if this technology existed, unless both parties consent to it being incubated/donated, then it cannot be.  If one party consents to the destruction but the other doesn‚Äôt, well, then there better be a way to cryogenically freeze these embryos, otherwise it will die.  

The policies around IVF do provide guidance on this one - to destroy or implant, you need both genetic donors to consent, and in absence of that, it‚Äôs kind of in limbo.  Arizona has the most ‚Äòpro-life‚Äô policy when it comes to IVF embryos - in the event of a couple divorcing with frozen embryos, custody goes to the one who will try to bring it to have it implanted, so maybe in some places there would be single party consent for incubation.  In no state is there any requirement for the implantation/gestation/incubation of embryos where the couple changed their mind and do not wish to go through with it.  They either pay to keep it frozen or sign off to have it destroyed.  

Given how the pro-life lobby has been mum out this, I assume they should be just fine with embryos being destroyed if no one agrees to the incubation.",1627776015

Fast Lane comes with 12 vehicles (10 cars, 1 motorcycle and 1 scooter), garage decor, some stuff for the living room, dining room and that's about it. The Create a Sim items from both are nice, both come with items for children and adults. I picked Fast Lane just to see the results and I'm glad I picked it because it's much lower in votes than the rest.

"rollercoasters","t5_2rzez","So i guess ill do a little trip report since this was my first time to universal. Ive always been a disney person and VC finally gave me a good enough reason to hit up Universal. I had 2 days and honestly, it was as much time as i needed in the parks outside of spam riding velocicoaster.


Velocicoaster (6x, 5x front row, 1x back row)

P u r e  b l i s s. Video's and pictures do not do this ride any justice, it is a work of art. Its the first coaster since i was a kid that actually made me hold onto the restrains occasionally... or well.... the side of the seat if i want to be more accurate. After my first ride and knowing how all the forces occoured it was solidified that millennium was finally getting kicked from #1 after 15 years.


Hagrids (2x)

This had more of a kick then i was really expecting for the type of ride, all of the launches felt good. The restraints (sidecar, wasnt aboe to get a bike ride) were tight, and didnt help it was being forced into my thigh, thank god it doesnt have much air time. But the 2nd ride was much more enjoyable since i was able to reposition better. I onoy wish that after the last launch there was.... more? It just felt like such wasted potential.


Hulk (1x)

Ouch? I know its been a few years since its been retracked but even in the dront row it was not compfortable. The trains felt really tight, almost like an arrow. This was my first B&amp;M sitdown but ive done plenty of inverts, hypers, and dominator at KD and they felt so much more spacious.


Kong (2x)

Probably the best ""dark ride"" ive been on. I have no connection to the new kong series so no clue what was going on but wow, that was really entertaining and is i guess their competitor to flight of passage. I still think i prefer FoP because it just felt more immersive (and the sound track is amazing)


E.T. (1x)

What... i grew up with E.T. as a kid.... and.... im just so confused.... i went into it thinking that the ride might be a bit confusing for people that have never seen the move before but the second half.... what the actual fuck... also the flying over the city knock off peter pan sceen... can only be actually seen from one side of the vehicle, the other side gets a good view of the catwalk


Jimmy fallon (1x)

It was definitely entertaining but still confusing as hell for someone that frequents NYC enough to audibly say ""thats not how that works"". I mean it was in the AC so i cant complain, but the seats were awful


Gringotts (1x)

Not what i was expecting and in all the best ways! Its been years since ive watched a PoV of the ride and was pleasantly surprised. The lats on the more dark ridey section was good too. Only complaint is that the seats were hella tight


Mummy (1x)

Just like Kong, i had no connection to the mummy movies so i went into just for the coaster aspect and its was quite fun, its definitely showing it age with how rough it was but it was still a solid ride.


Unfortunately didnt get to ride rip ride rocket since it was down each time i was over in studios. Also didnt get on ripsaw falls because the lines were over 90 mins so ill retcon what i said earlier, it had the longest lines, not hulk.

OVERALL, Universal was an interesting time but the fact it is arguably more expensive then disney, it just felt lacking. Everything was very pretty but any sense of immersion they were trying to build was broken instantly just by looking out at the lake. And i guess thats my overall opinion on universal, look at it from one angle and its beautiful, but dont look over slightly or you will be disappointed. Also glad i got to stay at lowes pacific which while a nice hotel, it felt like a discount poly resort.",1627776016

"horror","t5_2qh9x","Here Alone (2017) - a zombie film with all of the usual zombie film tropes, but with a melancholy, unusually affecting heart and some unexpected twists.

Sexual violence in the film:  

* Again, none. Nada. Zip. It's awesome.
* As far as objectification, the lead character is a woman whose plight is portrayed realistically and sympathetically. There is nudity and sex but it makes sense in the context of the film and neither instance is exploitative.

If you would like to now go into the film cold without knowing any more, stop reading here.

Otherwise continue reading for a bit more discussion, with no spoilers.

Synopsis (written by me because IMDB has spoilers): An appalling and virulent epidemic has already decimated most of the world population, severely infecting its remaining carriers with symptoms including delirium and unpredictable behavior coupled with aggressive outbursts (hello, fast zombies.) A young family decide they will try to outwait the ""new plague"" in a dense, lonely, forested area that the father is familiar with, reasoning that if they choose a place as far away as possible from other people, the zombies (excuse me, ""infected"") will have nothing to lure them to their vicinity. That's the familiar part, which the film gets out of the way briskly in the first fifteen or so minutes: no more synopsis after that to avoid spoilers.

Why I like it: One movie trope is left out that's it's nice to not see; for once the the hunter/survivalist husband is not a dick, or abusive, or insane, or a right-wing fascist, and his wife is not a timid doormat or helpless victim. Instead she is the center of the movie, as played by Lucy Walters in a tightly-wound performance of suffering and resolve as she first learns to live alone, and then finds out that she might not be as alone as she thinks she is. Some nice practical and makeup effects too.

Here Alone is streaming for free on both Tubi and Vudu, and Amazon Prime and Google Play both have it to rent.",1627776016

"IncelExit","t5_26rn4p","And they're used to communication as a norm. You aren't supposed to ""just know,"" and checking in or asking for explicit consent isn't considered ruining the mood or weak.

I've been pointing this out for a while. If you live in a city or college town, I guarantee there are nerdy people who get it on, somewhere near you. Some, maybe the majority, will be ""freaky people,""\* but there will also be plenty of vanilla folks who just find the freaky norms kinder and more relaxing. 

I think a lot of sexually inexperienced people feel that freaky people are doing, like, calculus sex and they themselves haven't solved for X yet, so they have to complete some prereqs first. Which is true in a way, but 1) those ""prereqs"" are about self-awareness and mental hygiene and social skills, not about getting to X base by Y grade, and 2) my advice is to make friends with the freaky people, not try to get freaky sex. Being in a community like that will help undo a lot of toxic ideas and give a person a more positive self-image, and that will drastically improve their odds of finding whatever kind of sexual/romantic relationship they're looking for. 

Except, a lot of incels want a very stereotypical, neurotypical romance as they envision it: immediate mutual visual attraction, partners fill all of each other's needs for intimacy and affection, no significant opposite-sex friendships, regular p-i-v sex without much explicit communication around it, a partner who presents as conventionally feminine who can wear off-the-rack sizes, no attraction to other people, no fluctuations of desire from either party. Anything else, they eloquently maintain, is ""cucked.""

I think there are plenty of people aiming for around the 750k mark, or couples around 1 mil. Most of us live luxurious lives in Australia and 750-950k will certainly allow that. Unfortunely expectations and norms are set by those proximal to us, so we can always re-define luxurious as a bigger house or a newer car.

My take is that people aiming for numbers much larger that 1 million tick a number of the following boxes: Earn signifigantly more that median wage, Don't know what to do with their lives outside of work, Have medical issues, Have expensive hobbies, Have loads of kids, Have a unhealthy hoarder mentality with respect to money",1627776019

"animalid","t5_2s27w","I saw something about peppermint... seems like a lot of animals don't like it.  I've been looking up how to fill in the holes too.  Most suggested is tiny gravel or non-clay cat litter.  I didn't know that chipmunks take dirt out of the burrows in their cheeks and put it elsewhere.  Then I saw the estimate of how big the burrows are.  Eekk!

Considering they are fairly solitary animals unless it's mating time, we are shocked by how many burrows there are in the yard or how close they are to each other.  We have witnessed an occasional chipmunk tussle... they cross paths and grapple for a minute or so, then chase each other.  Our neighbor has also noticed a huge amount on his land.... they have an orchard and have tons of holes dug next to the trees.

These bots steal content and repost it to build karma. For example, this post is stolen from **[this original post](/r/IWantToSuckCock/comments/i421hx/i_want_you_in_my_mouth/)**.
  
The accounts are often resold and are used to spam, scam, or for other nefarious purposes.

If you check [OP's profile](https://reddit.com/u/Knottutom), you will likely see many posts and comments based on past popular contributions from authentic Redditors, but the OP is not invested in these communities and they will only regurgitate content as long as it takes to build up enough karma to make money by selling the account.

As far as the carbs, Im pretty confident that all the passages are clear. The only think I can think of is that the fuel filter is stopping fuel flow, but I high doubt that because the fuel pump would just pull the fuel through and when ever I pull the carbs off and check the fuel lines I get gas on the engine case so I know the fuel lines aren't backed.

I poured the drink over some berries and citrus peels in a leftover (cleaned) whiskey bottle for storage and presentation. I imagine leaving the fruit in there for a while may result in a more complex infusion of flavor, but I made these just a few hours before we drank them!

Honestly the drink tasted great even though I used pretty cheap ingredients all around. The recipe was tasty enough that I might try to repeat it with better quality spirits.

*Settler's Punch*

- 1/2 cup Gin (I used New Amsterdam)
- 1/2 cup White Rum (I used Castillo)
- 1/2 cup Jamaican Rum (I used Appleton Signature)
- 1/2 cup Creme de Cassis (I used something cheap)
- 2 Oranges (juice &amp; peels)
- 2 Lemons (juice &amp; peels)
- a bunch of raspberries (I used like a dozen ‚Äì maybe 1-1.5oz?)
- splash of simple syrup
- bottle of Champagne or seltzer (I used the cheapest sparkling wine I could find tbh)

Muddle the citrus peels and berries with the simple syrup (suppose you could also use sugar). Add in the gin, rums, Creme de Cassis, and fruit juice. Ideally, let that all sit for a while before straining it and bottling with citrus peels and berries. Serve over ice and top with Champagne or seltzer. Garnish with a lime wheel.",1627776021

"AsianParentStories","t5_2u8j6","I know exactly how you feel. I‚Äôm nearly 21 now however im from a south asian family of 6 and we had a head lice problem for years. The problem started for us when we moved from the usa to uk (i was 11). I remember the shame, fear, embarrassment and most of all the struggle to get rid of it. I also remember completely losing hope that i‚Äôd ever be able get rid of it because yes, the treatments didnt seem to work. We tried so many of them and my parents were also desperate to get rid of it but after 3 years of living here there seemed to be no solution. My siblings had it too. Even when I cut my hair short and used the treatment it didn‚Äôt work. In school other students knew about it and used to gossip. I felt horrible all the time thanks to that. My parents gave up after 3 years, and like you, my mom started getting angry whenever i brought it up because she felt like nothing could be done and we just had to live with it. 

I‚Äôm 20 now no longer have head lice. In fact i haven‚Äôt gotten it since we managed to get rid of it as a family shortly after I turned 16. This was three years after we gave up on treating it and succumbed to having it. So i had it for about 5 years and it was hell. I think the problem is that lice become immune to the treatment if you use it too much. And for all i know maybe some of these products are eurocentric, made for white people and aren‚Äôt adapted for the thickness of south asian hair. But i believe the brand hedrin made some improvements to their treatment which is why it worked for us when we tried it again in 2016. I no longer have lice. My hair is long and clean (in fact it‚Äôs always been clean which is why it attracted the lice in the first place). And in fact all i get told now is how nice my hair is. I have slight issues with dandruff but it‚Äôs a problem i‚Äôd much rather have. I agree with the others here that you should see a dermatologist. I also think if anyone else in the household who may have it you should try to persuade them to do the treatment too - though i know it may not be easy. What made my parents desperate to treat it was that schoolteachers and parents started to gossip about them and at one point wanted to take me out of school until it was resolved. You might able to use the same leverage if you talk to your school and get them to intervene in some way. 

Lastly, I know how easy it is to get into self loathing because of problems like this. I felt a lot of self hate about my race because of this - thinking about how people may see me as being from a dirty indian family.  Especially since there was a fair amount if racism ib my school. But if it went away for me, i think it will go away for you. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through this and if you need to talk please send me a message.",1627776023

"history","t5_2qh53","Great question, we mainly see these things come up in cases like Alexander, where a passing by head of state would make a sacrifice either to honour the dead or be like ""Sorry I just killed your descendants, don't curse me"" but they do come up in guides like Pausanias' (who seems to have definitely gone to the one in Troad, and is very familiar with Snake Island but speaks about it as if he's getting it from other sources). I don't think people would have purposefully travelled just to see these locations, as the cults were localised, but if you were in the area it was probably something you'd do. 

Speaking of Alexander, his tomb seemed to have been a bit of a tourist and pilgrimage spot as well before its disappearance, with mentions from the 15th century of people traveling from distant lands to go there and a final from the 17th of being taken there by locals when traveling through.",1627776023

"rush","t5_2r4wq","It was a great effort from young, idealistic, creative musicians. Bastille Day and Lakeside Park are enduring Rush classics, both musically and lyrically excellent. Going Bald is a bit of a novelty, but the humor is endearing, and the guitar riffs are rockin.

The Necromancer and the Fountain are excellent fantasy listening experiences. Both are cinematic and sensory. They create settings, characters, and plot through the marriage of the music and lyrics. They contain the creative seeds which will come to fruition in 2112 and Cygnus X-1 I and II.

My only critique of these two epics is that they are sort of ‚Äúchoppy.‚Äù There is less cohesion between the separate parts of the epics. In 2112 and Hemispheres, the Overture and Prelude are an arrangement of all the separate parts of the song, which are then unfolded as the epic progresses. In Necromancer and Fountain, there is no musical relationship between the separate parts. They‚Äôre just kind of strung together without any uniting musical themes.

Overall, I see Caress of Steel as a stage in Rush‚Äôs evolution. The elements of what would make them great were present in seed form. It‚Äôs an album of energy, creativity, and ambition, which traits they would continue to hone through the years. While I wouldn‚Äôt put it in my top 3 (mine are Hemispheres, Moving Pictures, and Power Windows, in no particular order), I do treasure it as a record of their early years.

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","Wasn't that a lore retcon to try explain why Russ and the VIth weren't at Terra after a lore retcon wrote them onto Terra? Also what? They're rescued by the Raven Guard after the attack on the Vengeful Spirit? Sounds uncannily familiar to the bit where the White Scars saved them from the AL. How peculiar. 

If they hadn't left that would be, as you said, another 50k Astartes plus a fourth Primarch on Terra as the Traitors lay siege. That's a second Primarch in the teleport attack since he would be demanding a round two plus with Sanguinius there's a good chance they can kill Horus this time together. Even if he misses his chance with Sanguinius, there's still the Emperor to tag team with. That would change the entire universe so neither can happen but just recycling Dorn's plot for Leman is lazy (though quite honestly I might expect that). 

In essence it seems like they wrote themselves into a bit of a corner and made up a BS reason to try get back to established canon.",1627776023

Both ""Black Widow"" and the Space Jam sequel (free to streaming subscribers) collapsed in their second weeks.

"COVID19_support","t5_2f6rwj","&gt;he‚Äôs not anti-vax or anything, just a little bit wary of a vaccine that‚Äôs so new

Yes, some covid vaccines are using newer technology. But covid is also new. It's a new disease, and there are no proven reliable treatments for severe covid.. In many cases all doctors can do is provide oxygen, and ventilation, and hope for the best. The medication/antibody treatments they are trying are also new, many of them available under the EUA (emergency use act) just like the vaccines. This is all new.

Historically mankind has had more experience creating vaccines than in treating severe covid. Also mRNA vaccines are not completely new. And there are other non-mRNA vaccines available for covid that were created using more traditional vaccine methods.

Sure it's possible to have mild covid and be totally fine. But it doesn't go that way for everyone. Yes, statistically some people do worse than others (obese, underlying conditions, elderly). But some of those people survive covid well. Also some people who are young and healthy die from covid. It's all new. Hard to know how it will go for you until you just get it and find out.

For me personally - I'm betting on those that have spent years/their entire careers researching vaccines over those that have only had just over one year to try to figure out how to cure severe covid. So far, treating severe covid doesn't look like it's working out too well.",1627776025

"OmadDiet","t5_3jw4b","Yes! When I was trying loss body fat and my calories were low, I made the mistake of training after an all day fast with no coffee and no calorie cycling. 

I would work a semi-active 8 hour a day job then come home and try to train while saving my OMAD for after my workout. My performance was horrible I got weaker over time with this. If you dont atleast maintain your exercise performance while losing weight, you WILL lose muscle mass.

What became my miracle worker were 3 things:

1. Switching my workout to first thing in the morning. That way I am not too tired from work to exercise.

2. I added plain black coffee before my morning workouts and that made things even better. I felt strong again and was getting stronger even though I was losing weight.

3. The last strategy I discovered was calorie cycling. Let's say you need 2400 calories a day to lose weight. If you are doing hard exercise like me, you can eat 3400 calories, 3 days a week the night before a coffee fueled morning workout. And then eat 1700 calories for the remaining 4 days a week.

That would give you a WEEKLY AVERAGE of 2400 calories a day. While performing your best with your morning workouts!

To ask ""is there meaning in the world?"", is the same as asking: ""are there minds in the world?"". There are minds, therefore there is meaning.

This year inherited a low-ability class that loved these dumb code breaker starter things a colleague made, like A=4, B=19 etc. and then a numeric code would spell out the lesson title or objectives or whatever. 

In October I had a brainwave and started giving them (English) sentences spelled phonetically in Ancient Greek instead, with the same guide to transliterate it back into English  (roughly, Greek pronunciation is not always exact or clear, alpha = a, beta = b or v etc.). My thought was that it would do the same job and also get them more familiar with the Greek alphabet so they wouldn't hyperventilate when the odd symbol appeared in a physics equation (literally only three or four in GCSE?).

Anyway fast forward a dozen or so of these 5 min starters through the year, of course the sharper kids in the class got faster... To the point there's a girl who could make a decent stab at actually reading a sentence, like sounding it without using the guide or writing it in the Latin alphabet first. My head of department was not as impressed as I was.

tl,dr; accidentally taught bottom set y10s how to read ancient Greek",1627776027

Then while I was dealing with the ""termination charges"" they billed me for lan line, tv, and internet over $200, because it was non-promotional pricing, the best part was I only ever had internet through them. 

They said they canceled it and everything was taken care of and they said that I'd be getting my money back. I didn't get my money back for the first charge and I noticed I got charged again. 

That's when they told me I would have to sign up and make a new account and go in and cancel my account payment methods so that they would stop charging me because they couldn't control it on their end. I did, and got all my money back, but will never ever return to them again. The service was good enough for what I needed, and it was less than half of Xfinity, but never again.",1627776028

"thetagang","t5_27n9fl","Well, one of the benefits of options is that you can control your level of risk so that if you have a price in mind that you will sell at, you can sell a covered call at that strike price and your share shouldn‚Äôt be exercised unless it is above that strike price at expiration (note: there are maybe some situations with dividend dates where things could play out differently, but GME does not currently offer a dividend as far as I can tell so it‚Äôs not relevant). For instance, the price is currently around 160. The September 17th premium for a GME covered call at a strike of $640 (4x what GME is currently worth) was $1.84 per share, or $184 for the 100-share lot. So unless you think the probability is *so high* that GME will be worth more than 4x what it‚Äôs currently worth in a month and a half, by not selling a covered call you‚Äôre most likely leaving money on the table. Eventually the point is to sell for a profit, right? So why not make some extra money while you wait, and if it pops and hits a number you‚Äôd be comfortable selling at, so be it.",1627776029

They clearly want her to be an actual child, but with what her job is, that simply becomes a plot hole as there is no way you could convince me that someone like that would be a CPU. We know that Neptune's only real proficiency as a CPU is in military, both leading and actually fighting. That makes Neptune being a lazy and innocent child even more of a problem. I think having her come into power via revolution and establishing an unofficial democracy is perfect to explain all of this as it will give her a military background and an explanation for being chosen by it alone, as a military focused leader is the best choice coming off of a revolution. The regret from some of her darker actions during said revolution would explain her trying to be kind and lighthearted. Establishing an unofficial democracy will not only explain how Planeptune is stable despite her refusal to do most CPU work, but also could be a motive for a revolution with the idea that the previous CPU abused her power. All of this would also make Neptune a generally more interesting character as she both would have unique political views that others can't understand in a world like this, and it would give her a much darker and machiavellian personality she could tap into both intentionally and by complete accident.

Basically, this wasn't really me trying to continue the story, rather it was me venting through fanfic. I know I should have either just explained myself here or in a different post, but I couldn't help it as seeing Neptune once again being written as pathetic and unable to stand up for herself pissed me off. I apologize for all of this.",1627776030

Once a QB hits the laughably low minimum threshold for accuracy they never miss any throws. I think having a Miss/Bad/Good/Perfect user input window for throws would be a great addition. A bad pass would be catchable but inaccurate, probably stop any RAC attempt, good would be normal madden throw, perfect would have a higher catch chance and a lower int chance.

Perhaps you could adjust the size of the windows by ratings/archetype. Give pocket passers the widest perfect window, it would be a nice balance against the mobile QB meta.",1627776030

Think about it- City let sancho go for 17 million (including sell on) who was a promising young creative winger, and they're now spending 100 million on Grealish, a youngish (still 25) creative winger.

Over the years, all these altruistic sentiments kept being dashed again and again when it became apparent that most of them 'chose' to be homeless. With reasons ranging from bad attitude towards partners and kids at home, arrogance towards community at large, incorrigible vices, drugs, rejection of help by those closest to them, poor (if any) work attitude, self-entitled feeling that society is to blame for their ill fate etc. Bottomline: self-inflicted.

additionally, hiding the parts of a character that make them interesting is just illogical at best and actively detrimental at worse, which is the case with the example you're giving.",1627776034

You also implied that you can‚Äôt do any blocking at all in quali, which is incorrect as you can hold your line if you‚Äôre on the same type of lap (outlap to outlap, hotlap to hotlap). Blanket penalties are not handed out in quali.

You‚Äôre allowed to overtake on an outlap, but there‚Äôs an unspoken code amongst drivers that you don‚Äôt. Which is why morals/sportsmanship is being talked about, rather than legality.

Also, Hamilton wouldn‚Äôt have had to ‚Äúconsiderably speed up‚Äù, so not easy case for penalty. Your words yourself that he wasn‚Äôt going so slowly in the outlap, probably a bit too quick (wanting to stay in front of Max) which likely compromised his following hotlap.",1627776034

The Irish hills are either 40 degrees and ready to rain or 90 degrees and super sunny so prepare for both and hope for something inbetween. I'm not sure if it changed with covid but the fan interaction stuff was great in years past with tons of driver meet and greets, drivers going to merch haulers, and Q&amp;A sessions all morning. There will also be tents of people selling stuff so check those out too and try to get a good deal on diecasts, shirts, hats, or other collectibles.  The pit passes are definitely worth it and be sure to bring a sharpie to sign the wall, track, or for a driver to sign your ticket, hat, or diecast. Also be ready to get there early and stay late because traffic sucks around the track and I personally prefer to spend more time relaxing around the track than getting stuck in traffic or missing the end to beat the rush.

That‚Äôs when the weight piled on when I started taking it!!! Im sick of eating so healthy and working out and not a single Lbs lost??? That‚Äôs why the late night cravings are no good for me, I‚Äôm so out of shape now!!! I used to be a fit person! I hate it! Now if this new medicine causes weight gain I‚Äôm screwed!üòûüòûüòû
Some people tell me you have to pick whether u want to be fit or happy?? To me I deserve both ya know?  Ya know I got this frustrated before and stopped all meds, yes very bad but man I get so üò° with all the side affects and blowing up like balloon. I won‚Äôt do that this time but there‚Äôs got to be something to help! I guess there‚Äôs a spit genetic test u can ask for and helps get the meds that work for you?

So hopefully I‚Äôll get weaned off gabapentin, it will be hard but worth it! I liked it in beginning now I just take it bcse I‚Äôm so used to taking during day. It doesn‚Äôt give me that pick me up feeling it did before. Your body gets used to it they say. I know you were saying maybe when u stop lithium or something you will get off gabapentin?

"RomanceBooks","t5_2sxjx","{Where the Stars Meet the Sea by Heidi Kimball} is a bit like that. It's HR though. 

Juliet and little brother Harry was taken in by her titled aunt after death of her father, a Scottish sea captain, and her mother, a titled lady who eloped for love. Juliet will get her inheritance on her 21st birthday, but until then she's under control of her aunt. Forced to accompany her aunt to visit Shaldron Castle, Juliet only wanted to keep to herself, as her cousin (her aunt's son) has professed love to her, but he's only ever like a brother. A chance encounter with a boorish stranger with a severe limp and walking stick lead to her anger, only to find the stranger is not only her host, Duke of Halstead, he expressed an interest in her... much to the dismay of her aunt. However, her aunt has a diabolical plan to force her to marry her son...

The aunt was constantly reminding Juliet to ""know her place"", and subtly ""why isn't my son good enough"". 

I didn't like the ending though. The resolution between darkest hour and resolution took too long and the threat that made sense at darkest hour didn't make any sense right after that.",1627776035

"badhistory","t5_2wo26","To be honest I'd no idea it was such a long ass article, moderation is rather light on the Saturday posts so you might have gotten away with it if you didn't have a very new account - automod queues those for us since we tend to see a lot of spam accounts.

The key difference would be that Furr is one of the notorious revisionists and for those we want to avoid giving sources like that a platform to score points for one side or another. 

In case you had posted that, the odds were low that someone would review both videos and that could be seen as a victory for the maker since ""no one could debunk it"", while in reality it's more that people are a bit tired of seeing yet another Furr rant distorting history. 

So in short: check the frequent offenders list in the wiki, and if you want one of them debunked, you have to focus on a few specific points that you want debunked.  

BTW you'll still have your posts/comments removed by automod for a while, your comment karma will trigger it. Nothing personal, it will however usually take a bit of time before you can see them on the sub.

Set up a stage and do some 'theater in the park' style entertainment if you want. Bring a band and sing some music with a hat out. That's fine.

Choking up the entire walkway with guerilla theater while people are trying to get to work feels extremely rude to me.

Of course there might be some other factors affecting the real world transfer rates, but I doubt you should suffer from too bad load times. And if your other option was an internal HDD (not SSD), the external SSD would probably end up being faster.

Dug up this comparison: https://hardwarecanucks.com/storage/external-drives-vs-ssd-vs-hdd-for-gaming/ and it looks like the performance of a modern external SSD plugged into a USB 3 port is very comparable to an internal SATA SSD.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","No worries, you must be very patient to take time to read the whole conversation, or at least scroll down to the last reply.

People do know animals are sentient, and they do prefer taste of animal flesh and calories coming from animal foods over lives of said animals. That is observable every day in supermarkets, restaurants as well as poor countries where people still keep and slaughter their own animals. Do they ponder ethical considerations of these actions? I don't think so, I do not think that human beings are rational creatures, neither do I believe that people have full access to their decision making processes to be able to explain why they make the choices they make, or even that their goal is consistency in life.

However, the mistake you are making here that I need to point out, is reducing animal products to ""sensory pleasure"" alone. Animals taste good, yes, but people do not eat food for taste alone. They also eat food as a source of calories. People typically justify eating animals as means of food, not taste.

Yes, you ""don't need to get calories from animals"". But people simply do not value lives of animals as much as they do value lives of other humans, so in their eyes, there is nothing wrong in killing animals for food. 

I won't speak for an average normie omni, but their thought process, from what I can tell, is this:

p1 we prioritize lives of humans

p2 humans have to eat calories to stay alive

p3 non-human animals are one such available source of calories

c non-human animals are a valid source of calories for sustaining a life of a human",1627776037

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","To add to this: the medium of online dating places a handicap on men because we cannot convey ourselves *at all* other than through text.

When it comes to creating attraction; guys do not realise how powerful voice tone and timing is. Text *robs* you of that trait and women don‚Äôt realise that one of the reasons why it‚Äôs so difficult to gauge guys in OLD is BECAUSE of this lost channel of communication.

This is why I harp on and on and on about establishing very early that your not a big ‚Äútxt‚Äù person and make it clear that you will CALL her because then you cut through this ambiguous communication death trap.

Cold approach allows you to completely convey yourself properly.

Cold approach allows you to see her for what she actually is, rather than discovering that her photos were 10 years old.

Cold approach is blind though, you have literally no idea of her background, you have to guess her age, etc

At the end of the day, OLD is the *shittiest* method of all at least in terms of ability to communicate attraction.

If you had two scenarios the same girl in each one: one OLD approach vs cold approach, you‚Äôll be way more likely for success in cold approach.

I‚Äôm curious - the sexual acts your wife did with other people included men and women ? Is your wife bisexual or even lesbian ? I wonder if the threesomes and orgies were a safe space for her to do what she was really into - have sex with women? Just something you had in your post about the bride looking at your wife a certain way‚Ä¶

Advice is - first clearly communicate if you are unhappy or would like something specific in the bedroom- don‚Äôt stew on it. Your wife is under no obligation to say yes but if you don‚Äôt ask it won‚Äôt happen.

You didn‚Äôt mention if you have kids - if you don‚Äôt already- take precautions until this is sorted. 

You also mentioned your wife has stepped things up recently - it will be interesting how long this lasts",1627776040

A few things I think could really help you:

1) Dont be afraid to get loose with the linework! Im not sure if youre using a ruler for a lot of these lines, or are just being very meticulous, but dont be afraid to loosen it up! Super strict linework can often lead to stiff looking drawings.

2) With Goku's hair, it can sometimes be tricky to understand how its all supposed to work; getting an understanding of that can help a lot.  For instance, his little round bump in the top right is meant to more or less be outlining his skull. So making sure that lines up with where his head would be bald helps. Same with other small details like where the hair starts on his head/neck, etc. The little things!

3) Study lots of different styles! These two are already pretty stylistically different, but studying the different ways different animators/mangaka/etc have drawn DB through the years can really help inform your own personal approach. And finding that unique voice of your own is the real goal here. [Here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/06/42/00064250eab173af6ded2b52b81133be.jpg)  [are](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/00/ec/1700ecd2f568a6ca9fba5b648b0c0ec1.jpg) a little sheet of different animators drawing the characters for a small example of what i mean.

"qualitynews","t5_2r20f","KABUL, Afghanistan ‚Äî Haji Sakhi decided to flee Afghanistan the night he saw two Taliban members drag a young woman from her home and lash her on the sidewalk. Terrified for his three daughters, he crammed his family into a car the next morning and barreled down winding dirt roads into Pakistan.

That was more than 20 years ago. They returned to Kabul, the capital, nearly a decade later after the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Taliban regime. But now, with the Taliban sweeping across parts of the country as American forces withdraw, Mr. Sakhi, 68, fears a return of the violence he witnessed that night. This time, he says, his family is not waiting so long to leave.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not scared of leaving belongings behind, I‚Äôm not scared of starting everything from scratch,‚Äù said Mr. Sakhi, who recently applied for Turkish visas for himself, his wife, their three daughters and one son. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm scared of is the Taliban.‚Äù

Across Afghanistan, a mass exodus is unfolding as the Taliban press on in their brutal military campaign, which has captured more than half the country‚Äôs 400-odd districts, according to some assessments. And with that, fears of a harsh return to extremist rule or a bloody civil war between ethnically aligned militias have taken hold.

So far this year around 330,000 Afghans have been displaced, more than half of them fleeing their homes since the United States began its withdrawal in May, according to the United Nations.

Many have flooded into makeshift tent camps or crowded into relatives‚Äô homes in cities, the last islands of government control in many provinces. Thousands more are trying to secure passports and visas to leave the country altogether. Others have crammed into smugglers‚Äô pickup trucks in a desperate bid to slip illegally over the border.

In recent weeks, the number of Afghans crossing the border illegally shot up around 30 to 40 percent compared to the period before international troops began withdrawing in May, according to the International Organization for Migration. At least 30,000 people are now fleeing every week.

The sudden flight is an early sign of a looming refugee crisis, aid agencies warn, and has raised alarms in neighboring countries and Europe that the violence that has escalated since the start of the withdrawal is already spilling across the country‚Äôs borders.

‚ÄúAfghanistan is on the brink of another humanitarian crisis,‚Äù Babar Baloch, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said earlier this month. ‚ÄúA failure to reach a peace agreement in Afghanistan and stem the current violence will lead to further displacement.‚Äù

The sudden exodus harks back to earlier periods of heightened unrest: Millions poured out of Afghanistan in the years after the Soviets invaded in 1979. A decade later, more fled as the Soviets withdrew and the country fell into civil war. The exodus continued when the Taliban came to power in 1996.

Afghans currently account for one of the world‚Äôs largest populations of refugees and asylum seekers ‚Äî around 3 million people ‚Äî and represent the second highest number of asylum claims in Europe, after Syria.

Now the country is at the precipice of another bloody chapter, but the new outpouring of Afghans comes as attitudes toward migrants have hardened around the world.

After forging a repatriation deal in 2016 to stem migration from war-afflicted countries, Europe has deported tens of thousands of Afghan migrants. Hundreds of thousands more are being forced back by Turkey as well as by neighboring Pakistan and Iran, which together host around 90 percent of displaced Afghans worldwide and have deported a record number of Afghans in recent years.

Coronavirus restrictions have also made legal and illegal migration more difficult, as countries closed their borders and scaled back refugee programs, pushing thousands of migrants to travel to Europe along more dangerous routes.

In the United States, the growing backlog for the Special Immigration Visa program ‚Äî available to Afghans who face threats because of their work with the U.S. government ‚Äî has left roughly 20,000 eligible Afghans and their families trapped in bureaucratic limbo in Afghanistan. The Biden administration has come under heavy pressure to protect Afghan allies as the United States withdraws troops and air support amid a Taliban insurgency.

Still, as the fighting between Taliban, government and militia forces intensifies and civilian casualties reach record highs, many Afghans remain determined to leave.

One recent morning in Kabul, people gathered outside the passport office. Within hours, a line snaked around three city blocks and past a mural of migrants with an ominous warning: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt jeopardize you and your family‚Äôs lives. Migration is not the solution.‚Äù

Few people were deterred.

‚ÄúI need to get a passport and get the hell out of this country,‚Äù said Abdullah, 41, who like many in Afghanistan goes by only one name.

Abdullah, who drives a taxi between Kabul and Ghazni, a trading hub in the southeast, remembers speeding toward the capital when fighting erupted recently, picking up a group of Afghan troops who demanded a ride along the way. Two days later, his boss called to say that Taliban fighters had asked about a taxi driver seen evacuating security forces ‚Äî and had recited Abdullah‚Äôs license plate.

Terrified, Abdullah says he will find any way to leave.

‚ÄúTrying to leave legally is costly, and if we go illegally it is dangerous,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut right now the country is even more dangerous.‚Äù

Farther west, a surge of Afghans have flocked to Zaranj, a hub for illegal migration in Nimruz Province, where smugglers‚Äô pickup trucks snake south down the borderlands to Iran each day.

In March, around 200 cars left for the Iranian border each day from Zaranj ‚Äî a 300 percent increase from 2019, according to David Mansfield, a migration researcher and consultant with the British Overseas Development Institute. By early July, 450 cars were heading to the border each day.

Those who can afford it pay thousands of dollars to travel to Turkey and then Europe. But many more strike pay-as-you-go deals with smugglers, planning to work illegally in Iran until they can afford the next leg of the journey.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have any money or means of getting a visa,‚Äù said Mohammad Adib, who is considering migrating illegally to Iran.

Mr. Adib fled his home in Qala-e-Naw, in the country‚Äôs northwest, in early July after the Taliban laid siege to the city one night. As dawn broke, he says the paw-paw-paw of gunfire was replaced with wails from neighbors. Electricity lines littered the ground. Doors of houses were broken down. The road was stained with blood.

‚ÄúWe cannot find another way out,‚Äù he said.

In Tajikistan, officials recently announced that the country was prepared to host around 100,000 Afghan refugees, after the country received around 1,600 Afghans this month.

Other neighboring countries have expressed less willingness to host an outpouring of Afghans, instead beefing up their border security and warning that their economies cannot handle a new influx of refugees. Leaders in Central Europe have called to increase their border security as well, fearing the current exodus could swell into a crisis similar to that in 2015 when nearly a million, mostly Syrian migrants entered Europe.

But in Afghanistan, about half of the country‚Äôs population is already in need of humanitarian assistance this year ‚Äî twice as many people as last year and six times as many as four years ago, according to the United Nations.

Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, 40, borrowed $1,000 to bring 36 relatives to Kabul after the Taliban attacked his village in Malistan district. Today his three-room apartment, situated on the edge of the city, feels more like a crowded shelter than a home.

The men sleep in one large living room, women stay in the other and the children cram into the apartment‚Äôs one small bedroom alongside bags of clothes and cleaning supplies. Mr. Mohammadi borrows more money from neighbors to buy enough bread and chicken ‚Äî which have nearly doubled in price as food prices surge ‚Äî to feed everyone.

Now, sinking further into debt with no relief in sight, he is at a loss for what to do.

‚ÄúThese families are sick, they are traumatized, they have lost everything,‚Äù he said, standing near his kitchen‚Äôs one countertop ‚Äî out of earshot from his family. ‚ÄúUnless the situation improves, I don‚Äôt know what we will do.‚Äù",1627776041

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","That's true, it's definitely possible to bring this up to the boss as a permanent solution in a way that doesn't affect business, if it's something I'm wanting to do I don't have to go out of my way to be obstinate.  

But in this scenario, if we take the story to be true, there wasn't really a chance to do organization. It was an impromptu thing where Screencap Guy was headed out to throw away the bagels, got asked for one, and handed the bag over. 

I'd bet the boss wasn't even there, it sounds like this was the closer shutting things down in prep to leave. The boss only knew from looking at cameras the next day, likely before the employee even had a chance to voluntarily approach and explain what happened. 

And they didn't give them a chance to defend themselves, they just said ""nah you're fired.""

In reality, I bet there's more to the story. But as a hypothetical, I don't think the employee did anything wrong.",1627776044

Cutting funding to Planned Parenthood? Nope. Budget related. 51 votes.

Ignoring climate change? Nope. Cutting subsidies for green energy and adding them for fossil fuels is budget. 51 votes.

Make it harder to vote? Nope. Simple inaction on the Senate's part lets red states do the dirty work with no consequences. No votes necessary at all.

Judges? Nope. The nuclear option is alreay precedented. 51 votes.

Are you going to make her believe that she needs wigs and make up to be accepted by you? Are you going to stop inviting her to your birthday and your anniversary because you hate the way she looks?

If you take the time to look at charts and see what historically does well during recessions while factoring what caused those recessions it‚Äôll give you some clues.

Historically what‚Äôs done well is gold, bonds, and defensive sectors like healthcare, utilities, and consumer non durables.

How did I get there? I worked at a Amazon warehouse for 1year. Am joined Amazon Technical training for software engineering. I passed the exams and they settled me in Arizona at one of Amazon‚Äôs tech hubs.

My point is going to university may not make u the best Engineer around and it gonna take u up to 3yrs I believe.

But go to university and enroll in big companies tech programs. That will get you a job in those big companies as a techie.

I know of many graduates struggling to secure a Jon in big tech companies. Rather they stuck with startups etc.

Unless you going to Stanford university and those other big engineering universities",1627776046

We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python.

The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of ""how do I..."" questions, so you will not get the best responses over here.

On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places.

Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

They're not bad for the cat - in fact, they can be more nutrient-dense that the cuts of meat humans eat. Thus, catfood is actually helping to use up the whole animal, rather than just discarding the non-appealing parts.  That's part of being more sustainable. We're unlikely to ever give up meat entirely, and who/what else is going to use up those parts of animals?",1627776048

"Fedexers","t5_2au4lz","Can confirm that's the way my Ground linehaul contractor wanted us to do it. 

I got a brand-new Freightliner that had a bad leak from the power steering pump in its first week. I was new at the time and wrote it up in my VIR. I got a phone call en route saying I'd have to swap for a rental truck as soon as we got back from that day's trip and that I shouldn't have driven it at all. ""Next time, just let us know and we'll get it fixed next weekend."" 

Except that wouldn't have worked because, this being a brand new truck, it had to go back to Freightliner and they kept it for like three weeks waiting for the parts. Whatever.

Ground linehaul coordinators at hubs would really prefer you not red-tag trailers for shitty tires, busted lights, or air leaks, since they're already loaded when you get dispatched with them, but we'd do that shit all the time. I ain't gonna take a bald, dry-rotted tire on the 400-mile trip to our meet just to have it blow 200 miles from the hub and sit three hours waiting for FleetNet to get someone out to repair it. And if I get inspected and there's a bad trailer air leak or missing marker lights, whose record carries that ticket? Mine. So you can keep those on the yard until they're fixed.",1627776049

"Scams","t5_2qrt0","The lady at PayPal doesn't work for your bank, so she can't actually ensure anything. Long story short from whatever they told you, they're essentially saying you have no recourse with them, and that you could/should try your bank (i.e. they're politely telling you to pound sound).

The reality is your bank may also not side with you. When/if they refund you, they're not getting that money back from the person that scammed you, so they're essentially giving you money and taking the loss (though there's recourses for banks, but that's another story). So it comes down to if the bank thinks your situation is either within their fraud policy, something they can recoup, or if your worth the loss if they think you're a valuable customer. But I'd say they're not going to be thrilled taking a loss over a situation like this. 

I'm not trying to be harsh, but you really need to face reality in order to avoid situations like this entirely. This wasn't exactly a random skimming/phishing incident, and if companies didn't draw a line somewhere, they'd not be companies anymore.",1627776050

Also no, Pyro can be easily knocked back by a sentry, and if we're saying that the enemies are so far away that a heavy can't kill them, then it's also too far away for a soldier or demo to do significant damage, as soldier's rockets will have too much fall of and demo will have to be pipe jesus to land direct hits and that range or charge up his stickies, thus wasting valuable uber time",1627776050

There was a [study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.demenzemedicinagenerale.net/images/mens-sana/AutomobileDestruction.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjo0JD_wI7yAhUKv54KHa3PCOEQFjABegQIHxAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw0I9Cr2MtfP9D5dWeBIEpT3) done about this, the way certain language can change our perception of the world at large. Participants were asked to view a videotape of a car crash, and were asked questions about what they had seen afterwards. When certain words were used, the way the participants viewed the crash changed significantly, from how fast they thought the cars were moving, to how much damage they thought they had seen.

They seek to reassure the person they helped that doing so was not irksome or a major inconvenience. Hence ""No Problem.""

If Eren chose to save Paradis, but killed his friends in the process then it would have been pointless for him to chose Paradis above the rest of the world. One thing that is great about Erens plan is the moral dilemma it presented. Saving a minority because your friends and family are among them vs saving a majority, but sacrificing your friends and family.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","It‚Äôs definitely not a 1 to 1 comparison, but relays the point that Apple is okay replacing an existing product line with a new one. I do think they‚Äôre reaching a little more with this one though since iPod to iPhone were both locked down systems while the Mac is not nearly as locked down as the iPad. This is arguably why it‚Äôs a more difficult ‚Äútransition‚Äù for both consumers and Apple. Apple is trying to convince users that the iOS paradigm for apps can be used on a ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù computer. I think they‚Äôre being very cautious about how much leash they give and collecting feedback along the way. They‚Äôll give just enough for most anyone to be able to use it as a daily driver, but will keep as much control as possible past that.   
  
I don‚Äôt think Apple discourages people from buying both a Mac and an iPad Pro, but I also don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs why they made the decisions they‚Äôve made.  
  
As far as price goes, iPads seem expensive for the software experience they offer, but the hardware is absolutely stunning from every aspect. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they had a slightly lower margin on the iPad compared to MacBooks because of the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù hardware. But the steep iPad price might make it even. Who knows",1627776053

* Freezing is way too powerful, flamethrower just can't compete with the insane utility of freezing.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

Children are learning social skills that are only relevant to the very specific circumstances for this year and the longer we keep harsh covid rules in place, the more these abnormal behaviours will be implanted in our youth. Children are only going to get less and less social as we prevent gatherings. 

As an anecdotal example of rules creating negative effects, last year my little brother was kicked out of his middle school 7 times due to covid rules. This wasn‚Äôt willful non-compliance, most of the time it was because his mask was under his nose and his school had a tolerance policy. One instance he was kicked out for playing tag, one instance it was literally just because he was running around. Because apparently jogging puts too much strain on our health resources.  He wasn‚Äôt even given warnings he would just be sent to the office and sent home. This eventually led to him dropping out and refusing to do his work for the last two months of school. 

Many restrictions are fair and reasonable, but many are not and strict procedures can not be universally followed throughout Ontario‚Äôs elementary, middle, and secondary schools. Fully mature adults are not capable of following covid restrictions and it‚Äôs laughable that we are trying to force 6 year olds to comply. Students‚Äô mental health can not withstand arbitrary and poorly implemented rules.

I understand that PC volunteers are at the mercy of the home government and things change. Still, when I search for possible positions, I‚Äôm still seriously confused as to what exactly I will be doing.

The reason for this is Peace Corps honestly has no idea what you'll be doing. Outside of like TEFL, there's just not much structure. Some of the site placements are more aspirational than anything. This is frequently due to the fact there are more volunteers in-country than quality sites. Or people end up in bad sites for political reasons.

I totally agree with you that the posted assignments completely misrepresent things. We had a lot of people ET simply because what they were told they'd be doing and what they actually ended up doing were entirely different things.

I still believe this isn't the proper solution (as even if one cannot commit suicide, their reasons to do so do not go away) but it is good to hear it is somewhat effective. 

My other concern is for the difference between the modes of suicide discussed here, dying by gas might be interpreted as a ""softer"" method than jumping from tall structures onto hard surfaces. Whoever is willing to go for the latter I'd assume will have an easier time finding a replacement, either by different tall buildings or jumping in front of trains etc. I'm just speculating however.",1627776058

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; This is simply not correct.

That's simply not correct. The percentage of people on the Forbes top 400 who rose from poverty to becoming billionaires is at an all-time high. And you don't have to be born into poverty to be self-made. You just have to you know, make your money for yourself. [9 out of 10 of the world's richest people are self-made.](https://fee.org/articles/what-9-of-the-10-richest-people-in-the-world-have-in-common/)

&gt; They stumbled upon their money (Bezos started Amazon with a $250k gift from his parents for example)

Turning $250,000 into billions of dollars isn't stumbling into your money. Furthermore, that was an investment in the company. They didn't just hand him $250,000 cash. 

&gt;they got extremely lucky and they worked hard.

And more importantly, they created a whole lot of value for other people. 

&gt; It isn't possible to have that level of success without all 3 of those, plus a whole bunch of other things that society gave them.

I mean it is. Oprah was born in poverty, where exactly did she stumble into her wealth? 

&gt; For example, you could have a big chunk of money and work extremely hard and all the luck in the world still wouldn't be enough to create Amazon or SpaceX in Somalia. They got a massive amount of utility out of the systems of infrastructure, social stability, publicly funded education, legally protected IP system, baseline wealth, social services, banking systems, financial ecosystem, and business protections that are fully created by or propped up by taxpayer funded government programs, without which they couldn't have done what they did.

Yet everyone else in the developed world gets that same utility they just fail to use it to become billionaires. 

&gt;Does that just not mean violating any explicitly defined laws?

That's probably impossible. There's basically no human alive that doesn't break several laws a day. 

&gt;Or does it mean treating their customers and their employees well? Because they pretty obviously haven't always done that.

Well if their customers weren't treated reasonably well they would patronize these companies. And if the workers weren't being paid enough to ameliorate the downsides of having to work they wouldn't be working there.",1627776060

Remember these are relatively uneducated, low wage, non union workers. There's not always somewhere else to go.

Saying ""wear an N95"" is yelling into the void -- putting an onus on individuals to mitigate the hazards caused by the employer. OP's take that the issue of active attacks on unionization, lack of healthcare, and inadequate engineered safety are spot-on. Workers have no power against their employers, inadequate access to preventative care, and I'm environments with more particulate than ever before with more power tools being used, and the focus is on just wearing a mask -- masks which will break seal if you smile too hard, which you'll take off for lunch -- a mask can not be the only, or primary, line of defense. Stone workers should wear a mask, sure, but they should also be empowered to push back on unsafe work conditions without fear of retaliation, have adequate screening to catch silicosis early (without bankrupting them), and have useful dust reducing equipment. And those are policy positions you can actually advocate for that hold those with actual power accountable, while saying they should just wear a mask (while yes, they should) just minimizes folks who are already disenfranchised in the situation.

Fight the systems, don't demonize the folks being exploited by said systems.",1627776060

..anyways! Moving on. When you work your final day, as long as you have enough hours worked, you can apply for EI online and it will tell you what you need at that point, EI is there to help you while you seek work. Every two weeks you will need to fill out a ""report card"" in order to collect the payments you are entitled to for the weeks you are collecting. While on EI you must be seeking fulltime employment the entire time you collect. You are allowed to work while collecting but you still need to be seeking full time work as well. If working while on EI you need to declare your earnings on the bi weekly reports. 

You can also visit the r/eicerb sub too if you have more question. There are a few people on there who know what their talking about but also some people who give half informed information so take it with a grain of salt. In the end the EI call centre is the best place for questions.

"AnotherEdenGlobal","t5_vii9r","My observations, conclusions and advice to give after about 2 days of abusing this strat with a low-shadow Clarte:

152 SPD is enough to guarantee an action before Cyrus' action. You also need a 10% SPD difference to guarantee any 2 characters act in a specific order.

If Clarte does not have an INT badge, then Staff Quake + Staff MaxHP is not enough for Vedrfolnir to OHKO Wave 2 Cyruses. Staff Quake + Staff MaxHP + Gaia (Dormant Ore) also may not be enough without sufficient INT from a badge. Clarte has trouble with Wave 2 because the INT buff from Vedrfolnir will ensure a clean OHKO on wave 3 even if gear is slightly off.

Violet needs Power of Mind and her personal weapon in order to guarantee 100% Crit rate. If she fails to crit, she will not kill. You can also get her to 100% Crit without the grasta if she manages tor each 320 LCK, though this is unadvisable. Otherwise Sword Quake + Sword MaxHP + Mind is enough to guarantee a clean OHKO on Wave 1.

Clarte has a lower base SPD than Violet, and Violet also starts with enough light to get a +5 SPD bonus by default. Without any equipment, Clarte is down 24 SPD, which would guarantee Violet to act before Clarte, which screws the strategy up because Clarte needs to activate Lunatic on turn 1. Because SPD difference is the main issue, Clarte's best weapon is a +10 Luna Baculus which has good base stats and most importantly, +30 SPD (Aceto Vita also works if you already have it, but DO NOT go out of your way to farm it as it takes about 2 months to do so as farming Luna Baculus is much faster). While the +30 SPD isn't enough by itself, as the margin of 6 SPD will make it mostly random who goes first, which can once again screw the strategy up because Violet killed wave 1 before Clarte activated Lunatic. Clarte can reach the SPD threshold with a +20 SPD badge or better, but not taking an INT badge may leave Clarte too weak to OHKO wave 2 Cyruses. Stats Badge may be enough with Guidance Ring.

Alternatively, you can buy a Heavy Duty badge from the auction and give it to Violet. Violet does not require a PWR badge to OHKO wave 1, and the -30 SPD penalty combined with the +30 SPD on Clarte is enough to ensure Violet acts after Clarte. Alternatively, Heavy Duty badge on Violet and SPD badge on Clarte can also work if a Grasta Mule (explained next paragraph) is present or if Clarte swaps his weapon to Miaki's Staff and also equip Guidance Ring (FGAD) for the extra firepower to compensate. The Indomitable Sword can also be used to slow Violet down (but if combined with Heavy Duty badge then Violet becomes too slow and Cyrus may outspeed her) but in turn requires a Crit Rate +15% Grasta Enhancement to offset the lack of Crit Rate on weapon.

Clarte can also reach Wave 2 OHKO threshold with the help of a Grasta Mule, which in turn lets Clarte devote his other equipment slots to reach the SPD threshold to outspeed Violet. For Clarte, the Grasta Mule is any other Staff user who may or may not be combat-competent. To properly make use of a Mule, you must use Dormant Ore on both the Max HP and Quake grastas so they affect the entire party, and hand them off to the Mule so Clarte can carry extra Gaia grastas for extra firepower. However, unless the Mule actually needs EXP or is carrying a manifest weapon that needs EXP, the Mule is a liability that eats up a party slot that could have been someone/someone carrying a manifest weapon that needs EXP, meaning you will be spending more real time (even with macro) farming the same amount of EXP.

So, in conclusion (and TLDR):

Nobody can be slower than 152 SPD (otherwise Cyrus may outspeed them)

Clarte needs at least 25 more SPD than Violet for a safe outspeed margin (otherwise Clarte may not activate Lunatic in time)

Violet needs +50% Crit rate from sources outside of her skills, Quake and MaxHP grastas (otherwise she may fail to kill Wave 1 on bad Crit rolls)

Clarte needs one of the following in addition to Quake MaxHp Gaia grastas and being able to outspeed Violet (otherwise he fails to kill Wave 2):

* An good INT badge
* A Grasta Mule so he can have more damage-boosting Grastas
* 175 Shadow to receive enough INT bonuses",1627776062

We haven't had a major war in over 75 years to reduce the population, but covid has been a bit like a war, killing millions, putting many countries in debt they will probably never get out of and virtually enslaving future generations into being obligated to USA, China, Russia etc. 

Instead of getting a proper &amp; legitemised education, too many people are believing all they see, hear &amp; read on the internet &amp; social media as well as their peers and a lot of misinformation is around (just look at all the videos on SovCits with their interpretation of the law &amp; constitution. Behaviour of teens has always caused concern to society, but these days it seems to be more violent &amp; of concern (mass shootings, kids with knives &amp; guns in schools, drugs causing more burglary &amp; thefts.

On the whole, most are generally just typical kids, better educated, but finding it harder to find work as mechanisation is reducing the number of positions available and getting a part time job in many companies, especially in USA, wages are so low people can't rent accommodation on what they are paid meaning students have to work 2 jobs to make ends meet, leaving little time to rest &amp; attend classes, while to management are ""raping"" their customers to be able to pay the millions they receive in salaries &amp; bonuses.

I live in a developing 3rd world country, choosing to move here from a 1st world one, as my pension wouldn't cover rent, let alone all the other expenses of living a lower standard of living.  Here an unskilled wage is around USD12/10 hr day, but costs in general are much lower &amp; most people don't pay tax due to low income. They are hard workers, show respect to people, especially elders, crime is low as most people are trying to exists daily rather than work out how to steal &amp; rob others, who usually haven't anything of value, &amp; those that have, employ armed security to protect it. When people in rural areas move house, that is what happens. - the whole house is moved. The males put bamboo poles under the house &amp; lift \^ carry to the new location, which can be kms away and can take most of the day. The women &amp; kids get involved with supplying water &amp; food to the lifters and it is a community event &amp; payment is usually a ""party"" at the end with food &amp; drink being supplied, after the usual rituals of priest blessings &amp; some other ""superstitions"" also being carried out.

Kids in developing countries I feel could greatly educate those in western countries in many aspects, but I suppose we will just continue on the way we are &amp; hope that things work out?",1627776062

"CovIdiots","t5_2hzjsw","So I haven't been in public school k-12 in like a literal decade, but as I understand it's only worse now.

I can tell you that if you learned anything relevant to the outside world past your very basic math and English lessons, it was due to a teacher taking a little free time to actually teach you.   
Things like writing checks, balancing checkbooks, and even understanding the basis of what a political platform is outside of a basic definition was never a part of the lesson plan. 

Also, because everything is geared towards the end of grade test, it's the same thing over and over.

I won't say everything we learned was useless. It's just a lot of it was never properly expanded upon, never actually contextualized, or you had the ""You'll learn about this next year"" to ""You should have learned about this last year"" ordeal.",1627776064

Pokemon was one of my first loves around 6 years old as well, and in high school I found DOTA on Battle.net and was hooked on battle arenas. After playing LoL for 3 years(it felt like decades), then DOTA2 for a few years, I've since bounced around to a bunch of failed MOBAs(Big shoutout to Dawngate). This 10 minute format is so much more manageable than those potential marathon games.

*****
&gt; In 2021, Portugal registered a resident population of 10,347,892 people, marking the largest population decrease in the last 50 years, according to the census results released by the National Statistics Institute.

&gt; Last year&amp;#039;s figure was also 214,286 fewer residents compared to the past decade, according to INE. &amp;quot;In terms of the census, the only decade in which there was a decrease in population was between 1960 and 1970,&amp;quot; the INE said in a statement.

&gt; According to an analysis by INE President Francisco Lima, Portugal registered a positive migration balance, but that &amp;quot;Was not enough to compensate&amp;quot; for the reduction in the country&amp;#039;s population in the last 10 years.

You could improve the game (following direction others on the project would like to go) or turn it into your own creation. That way all the basics are out of the way (basic graphics, points keeping, user accounts) so you can focus on what you want. Also, working with established code helps you get used to best practices.  C++ gets me befuddled too.

Ok. The concept of convergence goes into some undergrad math, so if you weren‚Äôt a math/physics major it makes sense that it *doesnt* make sense. This will be a long reply because it‚Äôll try to cram the ideas of about 2 months of an upper-level college course into one comment. If you‚Äôre really really interested, i can find time to do some sort of voice chat to talk you through it. 

First, imagine a variable *e*. *e* represents any number greater than 0. i.e. any positive number. Let our infinite sequence be called s, and let x be some number. Let the kth term of s be called s:k. So in our example, s:1= 0.3, s:2 = 0.33, etc. We say the sequence of partial sums converges to a limit x if for every possible value of *e*, there exists some number m such that for every k greater than m, or when k is between m and infinity, the absolute value of s:k - x is less than e. 

Ok let‚Äôs break that down. First let‚Äôs denote the absolute value of s:k-x as abs(s:k-x). We know that abs(s:k-x) has to be either a positive number or 0. It follows that if we can show that abs(s:k-x) is smaller than every positive number i.e. every value of *e*, then abs(s:k-x) = 0. 

Here‚Äôs a simple example that we will use later for the proof. 

Let r be a number bigger than negative 1 and less than positive 1. Let our sequence be defined as follows: the first term is 3(.1) = 0.3. the second term is 3(.1)^2 = 0.03, etc. The nth term is 3(.1)^n. Clearly, each term of this sequence is smaller than the previous term. 

We will show this converges to 0. The formal proof is not as intuitive, but if you want it let me know. Choose any value of *e* i.e. any positive number. You can choose 1, or 0.00000001, or any other positive number. Clearly, there is some n such that abs(3(.1)^n -0) = 3(.1)^n  is less than *e*. Let that value of n be denoted k. We know that every term after the k^th term is smaller than the k^th term, so they are smaller than *e*. In other words, abs(s;k-0) is less than *e*. Since our value of *e* is arbitrary, this argument works for all values of *e*.  Thus we conclude that our sequence converges to 0. 

Ok great. So how do we show that for the infinite sum?

There is a certain type of sequence called a geometric series. The first term is a(r) for some number r that is between positive and negative one. The second term is a(r) + a(r)(r). The third term is a(r) + a(r)(r) + a(r)(r)(r). So on and so forth. We can see that the nth term is the sum of ar^k where k is every integer from 1 to n. 


Let us call the nth term s:n. Thus, we get equation 1:

EQUATION 1: s:n = ar + ar^2 + ‚Ä¶. + ar^n. 

Multiply both sides by (1-r) to get: 

(1-r)s:n = 

ar + ar^2 + ‚Ä¶. + ar^n - ar^2 - ar^3 - ‚Ä¶. - ar^(n+1) = 

ar + ar^(n+1)

Divide both sides by (1-r) again to get equation 2. 

EQUATION 2: s:n = (ar^(n+1))(1/(1-r))

Note that equation 1 and equation 2 are equal. 



Now let a=3, and r=0.1, noting that 0.1 is between -1 and 1. Then,

EQUATION 1: s:n = 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003‚Ä¶ = 0.333‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

EQUATION 2: s:n = (0.3 + 3(0.1)^(n+1)) (1/0.9) 

Notice anything in equation 2? In our earlier example, we already proved that as n goes to infinity, 3(0.1)^(n+1) converges to 0!!! We are left with the following:

EQUATION 2: s,n = 0.3 (1/.9) = 1/3 as n approaches infinity

since equation 2 = equation 1, 1/3 = 0.3333‚Ä¶..

end proof (QED)

If at this point you‚Äôre not convinced, go back and carefully read the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs. Most of the logic is there. Like I said, if you have any other questions i‚Äôd be happy to respond via reddit or some type of voice call. Cheers!",1627776067

The fact is, as a franchise, Fallout does have a lot of cache in the industry, and people will always be excited for a new entry. Bethesda, for all the hate they get lately, does have a minimum level of quality they achieve in all of their mainline games that gives me confidence they will never put out an actual stinker.

"neoconNWO","t5_3kcxv","Movie pitch idea: 

In the not too distant future, a Trump-like Republican populist (but competent) is swept into power on a wave of rising xenophobia, caused by a series of COVID-like virus outbreaks killing large swaths of the world's population.

Shortly after getting into power, he begins a campaign actively demonizing immigrants, and pushes a policy of ""Americanization"", where immigrants are rounded up and put into camps, forced to learn English and pledge loyalty to America, Christianity, and the Republican party.  Opposition parties are banned, freedom of the press is curtailed, and critics of the government begin disappearing.  Government agents are being placed in the homes of potentially disloyal citizens to monitor them directly.  In this setting, our plucky immigrant protagonist begins to discover that even more sinister forces are at work, eventually learning that some of the people at the camps are being deliberately killed so the government can harvest and sell their organs.  The hero desperately manages to smuggle out video evidence, which is sent to the rest of the world, but is killed in the process.  The movie ends on a note of uncertainty, with a message recorded to the leaders of the world from the protagonist before they died, ending with the simple line ""Now that you know, what will you do about it?"".

And just as the libs in the audience are about to cream themselves declaring this the greatest work of fiction since *The Handmaid's Tale*, the screen fades to black and displays:

&gt;This film is dedicated to the brave Uighurs, Taiwanese, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, and all others standing up to the horrific oppression of the Chinese Communist Party, who is doing all these things right now.

&gt;Now that you know, what will you do?",1627776070

Biden being slightly less shit than Mitch doesn‚Äôt magically make Biden not shit. Enough of this lesser evil nonsense.

How is supporting the left wing of fascism who‚Äôs only difference from the GOP is that they tolerate gay and brown people, revolutionary? You don‚Äôt vote in socialism, why is this such a hard concept to get? Even you admit they are shit at their job. Why all this whinging?

"Miami","t5_2qi76","&gt;The policies that made these cities great aren't being voted for by the people there anymore.

Really? So all the politicians just basically get into office without being voted in? Or do you just think that everyone votes the same way you do?

&gt;And rising housing costs,

Your do realize that rising housing costs are a symptom of success in a city, right? As more people want to move in, competition for space increases, and process go up. The cities aren't successful *despite* high living costs. The living costs are high *because* the city is successful and people want to live there.

&gt;rampant homelessness

Which is also a major problem in South Florida. We just close our eyes and pretend it doesn't exist.

&gt;ocasional to frequent riots

You mean exceedingly rare riots, right? Unless you're referring to any protest that doesn't prominently feature Trump flags as a ""riot,"" in which case the actual term you're looking for is ""civic engagement,"" and it happens to be a major draw of many of these cities.

&gt;lockdowns and businesses closing bc of restrictions

Minimum business closures, faster GDP growth than Florida, and a higher GDP per capita even *with* COVID restrictions and in years where the GDP declines would ask point to then being much more economically successful than any Florida city, so I'm not sure why this would make people leave. Oh, also much lower COVID numbers.

&gt;and lack of labour bc everyone is on covid relief

There are labor shortages everywhere right now. Funny thing is, the labor shortages are as bad or worse in places that legislated away expanded COVID benefits. Turns out, COVID benefits have absolutely nothing to do with labor shortages.

&gt;The Dems used to run these cities great which is why they used to be so great.

Man, if those cities - cities with highest incomes, higher GDP per capita, higher quality of life, better education, etc. are not great anymore, that would make every city in Florida an absolute hellish shithole by comparison, huh? Unless you're not actually basing your beliefs on anything except ideology, which would make your entire argument kind of stupid.

&gt;But nowadays, many of them are being destroyed despite Portland and SF having the highest income tax in the nation and Seattle having one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation.

[Not even close on ""highest tax rates in the nation."" ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-us-cities-with-the-highest-taxes-2013-03-02) And the funny thing is that despite somewhat high tax rates, people still want to live in those places. Especially wealthy people who contribute to the local economies. Turns out, taxes aren't all that important, except to broke mooks who think they would be millionaires if it weren't for all those peanut taxes (and not because they lack anything of value to offer anyone.)",1627776072
"ComplotDuDebile","t5_4nqra6","Je dis pas que c'est plus logique, juste que le mod√®le terre plate est plus intuitif, plus terre-√†-terre (sans mauvais jeu de mot), peut √™tre mieux acceptable par certains qui ne ""croient que ce qu'ils voient"". Le mod√®le platiste est critiquable sur beaucoup de points notamment l'incoh√©rence des mouvements celestes (notamment les √©toiles qui ne sont pas les m√™mes et qui ""bougent"" dans deux directions oppos√©es suivant l'h√©misph√®re o√π l'on se trouve) mais la gravit√© c'est pas le meilleur angle pour critiquer le truc je trouve. 

Mon point est justement de dire que beaucoup de ph√©nom√®nes naturels sont contre-intuitifs, donc logiquement plus fous que les th√©ories plus gr√©gaires. M√™me en lisant ton post je trouve pas que tu fasses honneur √† la ""logique"" gravitationnelle. La gravit√© est une force ok mais pourquoi agit-elle comme elle le fait et pourquoi la mati√®re a tendance √† s'attirer elle-m√™me ? Pour nos sens la mati√®re est inerte, elle ne s'organise pas toute seule, alors pourquoi l√† elle le ferait ? (Je pose volontairement drs questions qu'un ignorant se poserait, mais il faut se dire que la probl√©matique a tr√®s certainement d√©rang√© de nombreux esprits brillants avant Newton). On ne peut que constater la r√©alit√© du ph√©nom√®ne gravitationnel mais je ne pense pas qu'on puisse en expliquer l'essence, du moins si j'en crois la recherche effren√©e du graviton qui est un peu le Saint-Graal de la th√©orie du tout.

"forhonor","t5_38p4n","I think rhe WuLin catch a raw deal. Each of their heroes does something wholly unique to them. No other character has flow feinting like Tiandi. No faction sports an assassin that is the anthesis of parrying like Nuxia. I've never seen a heavy that has the control over their own stamina the way Jiang Jun does. The Shaolin's Qi stances are an interesting way of mixing up fights. And before Zuanhu unblockable lights were seen as insane. So I personally think people need to give the WuLin faction their well deserved day in the sun.

As for me, I'm not sure I have a favorite faction. But I suppose I have the most rep in Samurai. What can I say? I'm just a filthy weeb. I like characters with speed, so Orochi called to me from the start. And when Aramusha launched, well that was it. Yeah, I catch shit for ""light spamming"" but I've learned to blade blockade with the best of them. And Deadly Feints is among my favorite mechanics. I've not really learned Kyoshin super well. Counter attacking isn't really my style. But all the Samurai have the best drip there is.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Epigenetics is when genes are turned on or off due to some trigger in the environment. It doesn't directly alter the genetic code of the DNA, but it changes how the code is expressed. Some of these changes can be long-term or permanent. Epigenetic changes to gene expression (switching on or off of genes without altering DNA) can be inherited by future generations, so this is something that can have really long lasting effects.

The spike protein which is in the vaccine has been shown to have epigenetic effects, including altering the function of ACE-2 receptor in a detrimental way. I can't find the reference for that study, but here's a link to another study discussing epigenetic effetcs of other viral proteins, including from coronaviruses in the same family as SARS-CoV-2 (SARS and MERS). Those viruses cause epigenetic effects which disrupt immune function among other things.

"Scriptable","t5_ntiup","Not to sound like an old man reminiscing, but I‚Äôm gonna reminisce for a bit and then answer your questions.

I find it kind of funny how when iOS 14 came out, widgets were all the rage and people couldn‚Äôt get enough of them. This sub was hopping with people of all experience levels, making some really awesome things‚ÄîWeather Cal is the obvious one, but there were lots of other great widgets too. Enthusiastic users created a couple of different script/widget repository sites, and Simon introduced the built-in gallery. Projects were started to create user-curated documentation and a proper, RoutineHub-like site for script sharing, and I started a project to port Scriptable‚Äôs APIs to Node.JS‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and then it all slowed down to a trickle. I know Simon has been very busy with Data Jar and Runestone. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs worked on Scriptable lately; he frequently retweets widgets, but there hasn‚Äôt been an update for the app in six months. He did [mention](https://mobile.twitter.com/scriptableapp/status/1409472155436335104) a month ago on Twitter that he has plenty of plans for future development of Scriptable, but I think he‚Äôs taking a break from it with the intent to come back later with sharper skills. There does seem to have been a slight resurgence of users on the Discord server in recent weeks, but it‚Äôs not what it was.

Even I sort of lost interest in the app for a while; I was busy learning to use Node.JS and Python and helping people with Shortcuts, when I wasn‚Äôt dealing with school. But Scriptable has remained as the best JS testing and learning environment I know, and I‚Äôve used it mostly for that this entire time. Lately, I‚Äôve gotten into exploring the design and capabilities of the app in depth. And oddly enough, after all this time, I finally find myself creating scripts and using the app the way it was designed, for things that I used to rely on Shortcuts to do.

(Sorry, that was a lot longer than I expected.)

So, I do code in Scriptable, more so now than I used to. I think I might even begin to release some of the scripts I‚Äôve written.

Anyway, to answer your question about where to get scripts/widgets: here‚Äôs a list of a few places I know of.

-	https://widgethunt.com

Yes, it's silly that a staged prone crossbow shooter has disadvantage, but there's no reason to expand that rule to flight.

I‚Äôve had first hand contact with him in his rookie season and he was super gracious, signing my daughter‚Äôs jersey when we went to see him at a Skyhawks (G League) game. I also have friends with a business in College Park, Maryland that he, like the other basketball players on campus, frequented, and I‚Äôve heard nothing but good things about him. 

With that said, he was raw coming out of college, and there hasn‚Äôt been any sign of positive development. I think he was a player who was really hurt by the lack of G League games last year, due to COVID. He doesn‚Äôt seem to have a feel for the game at the NBA level.

Bruno has a pro body, and was good (but not great) close to the basket in college. He also showed a little touch from beyond the arc with very limited attempts. His physicality at that level was good for rebounding, but he‚Äôs never showed any handle whatsoever, nor any passing ability, and his court awareness (while not necessary at college, where his athleticism carried him) is weak, due to starting to play organized basketball late. This can be pinned to his upbringing in Angola.

Lots of analysts think he can become a rotational piece with the right training. He didn‚Äôt get it under Mark Turgeon or Lloyd Pierce, and Nate McMillan was trying to win games rather than raise a benchwarmer.",1627776076

"projectzomboid","t5_2sdk8","If you didn't pick an occupation or traits that give you weapon levels then the usual is to go Spear. Crafted Spears can be made out of branches or planks, using knives or a chipped stone (although it's better to craft a stone knife with your chipped stone then use that for spear crafting). If your Carpentry level is lower than 3 then you have a chance that your Crafted Spears will be made with lower condition, so you want to grind Carpentry a bit first (dismantle beds and everything else in a house using hammer, saw and screwdriver).

The Crafted Spears break incredibly fast, but you can make an infinite amount of them. The more levels you have on Maintenance and Spear the more uses you'll get out of them. To fight with Spears you'll need to leave base carrying as many Crafted Spears as you can fit and discard as they break, which makes room for loot. Always carry one spear in your back and a different on your hands, so that when the one in your hands break while still in combat, you can hit 1 to bring up the other.

Once you get a car you can pack it full of spears so that you don't need to pull back if you run out.",1627776077

This is a good assumption. Even logical the more you think about it. The plan was to recruit a team that could go after the Spring Maiden so they would see magic with their own eyes. The huntsmen that were recruited would need to be trustworthy and powerful to be told the truth about their existence and to stand a chance against a veteran maiden.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Probably a bad take, but I think the Bisharp like should‚Äôve been a branching family like Tyrogue and Eevee. Chess has more pieces to base things off of, and pawns can promote into most pieces. I thought it would be cool if Bisharp focussed on Attack and Speed, a rook evolution focused on the defences, and a Knight evolution was Special Attack and HP. It‚Äôs not a perfect analogue but still captures the idea of the different pieces having unique skills. A more outlandish idea was that after selecting from one of those three, any of them could evolve into something based on the king and queen, with the king having the defences and HP stats and the queen having the offences and Speed stats. It‚Äôs kind of weird to have different Pok√©mon evolve into the same one but I think it‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs within the same evolutionary family. And to make the choice between the first three still valuable, they could carry over an ability or moves from the previous stage, unique to each one. This sounds really bizarre writing it out but I love the Bisharp line and I think having more Pok√©mon in its family would be really cool",1627776078

"taoism","t5_2qhmd","The first line of the Tao Te Ching is about precisely your issue. If I tell you my understanding of yin and yang, and I tell it to you in a way that satisfies your curiosity, I have given you an answer, *but you have learned nothing of what the Dao is*. That being said, since you are the curious type, I should give you something of an answer, or else you will never get where you are going.

The Dao is all about mind. And you are using your mind to understand it, which is human and what we all try to do, of course. But you can see the obvious issue here; that the mind is being used to understand itself. This doesn't necessarily seem like a problem *but that is because the mind does not understand the problem*, it doesn't understand itself, in general. It is, like an eye that sees the world, but cannot see itself as long as it is working properly, as long as it is clear. It is only when the mind starts to struggle that we start to see the crinkled edges of it. But can you imagine how useful it would be to use an eye with cracks in it to understand how eyes work? Maybe not impossible but it is certainly a distraction.

So, consider this. Your questions are the crinkles of a mind that doesn't yet see the answers you are looking for. The spots in the eye that hasn't been cleared of debris by tears. What can I do to clear your mind but tell you that your mind has a natural state that is beyond questioning? That it sees the world clearly when it doesn't need to wonder whether the world is this way or that, or true or false, or black or white. It just works in a clear and present way.

All of the terms you brought up are ways of approaching this clear and present way, they are ways of describing reality as seen through an unquestioning mind.

Can you sit quietly for a moment and not engage with a question? Not seek any answer? Can you see that reality itself has no questions to ask, and no answers to give? It simply exists within your awareness. You may come up with questions and answers yourself, but looking at the Tao directly is being aware of that which is beyond questioning.",1627776078

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

"SexWorkers","t5_2skjk","Not sure if there is a difference between GFE (Girl Friend Experience) and ""Full GFE"" but GFE is basically what you would expect a girlfriend to perform, as opposed to PSE which is Porn Star Experience.

So start of with some conversation, cuddling etc, then full french kissing, oral and reverse oral (covered or not, depending on the girl), full penetration (covered), and cum as many times as you are able to within the time limit.  All of this is performed in a relatively subdued way like you were making out with an actual girl friend. Ideal for first timers, and people who dont want to scare the neighbours too much. GFE can sometimes also include anal too (covered) but thats often a paid extra.

PSE is generally if you want the girl to behave like a wanton slut like you see in bad porn movies.  Oral is vigorous and sloppy, probably including deep-throad.  Fake orgasms are loud and aggressive. Probably includes kinky outfits like leather etc.  May or may not include various toys and props. PSE often costs a fair bit more and it tends to be a lot more tailored to what you are after.",1627776079

No one is spending that kind of money when they can just play the game itself. 

It‚Äôs disingenuous to act as if this is something that‚Äôs remotely common or to pretend that it‚Äôs somehow more viable than just playing the game yourself. You‚Äôre not going to gain any sort of advantage over anyone that actually plays, especially when it‚Äôs easier to make the gold in game instead of buying it or just raiding yourself.

**AITA for asking a friend to not eat so much during a party my bf and I threw?**

**EDIT: To clarify -  It was not a buffet. I was about to set the table but all of us wanted to talk first. Lily helped herself by going into the kitchen. The food was not getting cold. (it was still in the oven)**

This happened a week ago and I just can't forget about what happened. I feel so confused so here I am.

I'm 19F and my friend, Lily, is 20F. We have been friends since we were teenagers. She's a really nice and sweet person and so I feel extra confused about what I did.

Last week my bf and I threw a small party to celebrate the fact that our friend is pregnant (this is not about Lily. Lily is not pregnant. This is in reference to another friend). I made all the food myself.

Lily came over and we were all having a great time, talking about babies and things like that. That was until I noticed Lily eating almost half of what we had. None of the other people had even started eating yet. I didn't think much of it when Lily started eating without waiting for us because like i said we are very very close friends so she doesn't have to be formal with us.

We had small sandwiches, pizza, chips, and brownies. I clearly cut them all up in equal portions and even had more than needed food made but Lily just finished a lot of it in the first 30 minutes. She ate a lot of the pizza slices and brownies. I was concerned there wouldn't be enough food for the others (referring to the pizza and brownies, we had enough of the other food)

I noticed some of our friends were looking at Lily and they were obviously feeling uncomfortable. I pulled Lily aside (in the kitchen) and told her if she could not eat so much. It started of as a whisper argument with her just repeating ""are you judging me? are you judging me"". It eventually got loud and she claimed I was fat shaming her and she went out to our friends and told them ""Hey everyone, OP is fat shaming me"" and that was a whole thing.

Eventually we awkwardly stopped the party and everyone went home. The next day she came to our house and told me our friendship was over my heart just broke seeing her so hurt. I think I may be an asshole because maybe I should have been more sensitive since weight is something she struggled with and I know that. I knew that it was a tough topic for her ever since we were kids...and I still said it. Maybe I should have just ordered extra pizza.

So please tell me what you think? Thank you.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 35 letters.**

 You are not being removed for political orientation.  
 
 Let me be clear: The reason that this rule exists is to avoid unscrupulous internet denizens from trying to sell dong pills to our users.  /r/PoliticalHumor mods reserve the RIGHT to hoard all of the dong pills to ourselves, and we refuse to share them with the community.  If you want Serbo-Slokovian dong pills mailed directly to your door, become a moderator. If we shared the dong pills with the greater community, everyone would have massive dongs, and like Syndrome warned us about decades ago: ""if everyone has massive dongs, nobody does.""""

Not the same situation but I was writing a fic when I attempted suicide a little over a year ago and had the same reaction to opening the doc every time. Even seeing the fic in my works page made me misrable. It's amazing I never deleted it. (I had my reasons)

But the thing I really want to say is at the time I thought that I'd never be able to touch the fic again, and while I've still yet to sit down and write it a year later I am warming back up to it. I love my idea and I want to finish it. It'll take time but I do believe I will get there. 

Put them in a box, and entrust them to a friend for safekeeping while you allow yourself time to heal. Be ok with the fact that you just \*can't\* right now. Don't burn them. I know it's tempting but one day you might want to see them again and burning them means you will always be denying yourself the opportunity of that closure. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to make empty promises of it getting better and one day you'll be right back at it because it's possible that in order to heal you decide to move on from it completely. Whatever you need to do is valid, but don't burn the bridge in the moment.

Honestly carry how you want. If someone comes from behind and takes your gun when concealing there's something wrong. When out and about try to catch someone printing or see if you can actually tell if they're carrying 100%. If you're not open carrying or your shirt is stuck behind the grip I doubt anyone is ever gonna know you are carrying. That's just my two cents though. You're gonna see you're printing to yourself even when it isn't. Or at least I always feel like I'm printing but when asking my wife she gets the location wrong. She'll ask if I'm appendix carrying when I have it at 4 o'clock or vice versa.",1627776084

Since FFP became a thing it‚Äôs borderline impossible to cause an upset at the top (unless you‚Äôre Leicester).

Villa couldn‚Äôt dream of offering the same contract City could due to City‚Äôs massive financial power, nor is it likely to be convincing to him if they say they will build a team to try and compete. It‚Äôd probably take ¬£500m to build a squad to overtake City/Liverpool/United/Chelsea 

Giannis becoming a brand or not becoming one probably had little to do with him staying. I imagine if Giannis was told or felt the Bucks had no chance of being able to win the championship he would‚Äôve walked. Grealish probably won‚Äôt have that chance to win at Villa so has to decide to become a Mark Noble / Le Tissier type player who‚Äôll never really win anything of note but go down in club history as a great, or go to City fill his trophy cabinet up and go down as an all time English great",1627776085

They, of course, failed; and one day, Arson performed a feat that redefined how we see the world and managed to burn down the tribe's village; a village that was itself built out of fire. After that little fiasco, Arson was kicked out, and now he ventures across the land, having adventures, and trying to find some way to keep his powers under control.

God is God 


3 Again said God to Adam, ""All this misery that you have been made to take on yourself because of your transgression, will not free you from the hand of Satan, and will not save you.


4 But I will. When I shall come down from heaven, and shall become flesh of your descendants, and take on Myself the infirmity from which you suffer, then the darkness that covered you in this cave shall cover Me in the grave, when I am in the flesh of your descendants.


5 And I, who am without years, shall be subject to the reckoning of years, of times, of months, and of days, and I shall be reckoned as one of the sons of men, in order to save you.""


6 And God ceased to commune with Adam.


4 Then came the Word of God to Adam, and said to him, ""O Adam, as you have shed your blood, so will I shed My own blood when I become flesh of your descendants; and as you died, O Adam, so also will I die. And as you built an altar, so also will I make for you an altar of the earth; and as you offered your blood on it, so also will I offer My blood on an altar on the earth.


5 And as you sued for forgiveness through that blood, so also will I make My blood forgiveness of sins, and erase transgressions in it.


6 And now, behold, I have accepted your offering, O Adam, but the days of the covenant in which I have bound you are not fulfilled. When they are fulfilled, then will I bring you back into the garden.


7 Now, therefore, strengthen your heart; and when sorrow comes over you, make Me an offering, and I will be favorable to you.""



The first 2 prophecies of Christ from The Book of Adam and Eve.",1627776085

Anyway, we split any tips evenly between anyone who is involved in the restaurant and on minimum wage. Who ever was on shift gets an equal share. The kitchen porters make sure the crockery and cutlery are clean, the chefs make sure the food is as good as possible, the servers make sure the customers are happy and the bar make sure everyone (staff included) are watered properly. Everyone plays their part so everyone gets a take of the tips. We make it clear to customers that any tips given are distributed this way and never have any complaints about our system.

Obviously, if the US is paying their servers less than minimum wage then this system would not be fair. America, pay your servers properly and split the tips evenly! One team, one dream and all!",1627776086

The door in GWD, the door in the mind forge, all of Varlamore and what lies beyond, Soul Wars island has room for things to be inserted. Dorgeshuun needs a total rework, it looks cool, but is empty and largely useless. Keldagrim has room to expand as well and it has the unfinished Rise of the Red Ax quest line. Personally I'd like to see something Minas Tirth or Dwarf Fortress based go under it. That could also be put under the dwarf ruins under White Wolf mountain that were added not to long ago. Or is it Ice Mountain? I always get the two confused.

Plus they could plop just about anything in the oceans yo the east, south, and west. Or even expand on the further north regions beyond the penguin base, as that has an unfinished questline as well. 

Failing all of that, there is always room to expand to the Vampyrium and the rest of Zanaris.",1627776087

I gave him the gun and he could see through the scope but I couldn‚Äôt (I figured it out eventually). So I tried looking it up on my phone how to fix with my phone on my left hand and my controller on my right hand.

Dude was flexing on Twitter just the day before yesterday and he brought attention to him self otherwise he could keep doing that with no one to stop him.

Most of the time, they‚Äôd just lay in the tub and chill out until you needed to wash their bellies and the side they were laying on, then they‚Äôd stand up until you were finished. My favorite was this little old bulldog who used to come in with her basset hound sister. Her face was so squished that her nose was actually recessed into her skull, so we had to be very careful about washing her face so she didn‚Äôt breathe any water in. Basically we just went in with little scraps of towel and cleaned all of her little wrinkles by hand. It was like giving her a spa treatment, she just sat there and closed her eyes and made little pig noises until you finished, at which point she‚Äôd jump up on the edge of the tub and give you tiny little kisses. My other favorite was a Great Dane named Gaston who, at 7 feet tall and probably 180 pounds, was way too big for the tub, so we bathed him outside. Except our outdoor area didn‚Äôt have anything to clip him to, so you‚Äôd get maybe half his body wet/washed/rinsed/dried before he got the zoomies and had to go galumph around like a drunk moose for a little bit until he came back for more soapy scritches.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","I actually came back to this thread to mention another argument against veganism.

Related to ""I don't care."", I think the most difficult argument is just personal flaws, rather than an actual argument. Apathetic laziness rather than callousness. ""I care more about having a stock of food I enjoy and don't have to prepare or think about than anything else."" Imagine someone who procrastinates making food and even getting water. Who can't even get anything done of substance for their own life, let alone add their drop in the bucket efforts for the animals. They have trouble even contacting people or going outside. I know I'm describing someone with depression, but I think it makes my point. 

This person could've even tried to get themselves to go vegan in all the traditional ways. The arguments. The documentaries. The slaughterhouse footage, etc. 

People are burdened with backpacks full of problems. They're might be tons of things they can't get themselves to do, and going vegan is hardly near the top of their of personal failures that are causing them the most problems. 

Vegans focus a lot on responding to arguments. But I don't the arguments are the biggest problem. I think the person is. How do you get someone to do . . . ANYTHING? How do you get an alcoholic to quiet drinking or get someone to lose weight? I doubt that rehab just involves intellectual debate about why someone should quit drinking. I know alcohol is an addiction, and I could've used another example, like getting someone to start an exercise regimen or get a depressed person to leave the house. 

I feel like vegans treat this exclusively as an intellectual debate when they end up stumbling on something much bigger than an intellectual disagreement; people's own ability to sort their life in order. People could agree with everything and still not change, either because they're personally focused on bigger personal problems or they're having trouble facing any problems at all.",1627776090

However, roughly by the time the T/D was introduced the A-W got its first nerfs. Plus, people were discovering the Defender and the whole drifting, jousting and pinballing took off. So A-W just didn't work for me that well any more. I then discovered FB and acknowledged I had to learn flying those washing machines after all, and then found out that X-W is actually overall the better ship. 

Still: Everyone should do as he pleases and what brings him/her the most fun. I can't judge anyone for that. I remember it was quite fun at the beginning. Still, I also hate that due to those people you get Empire 8 our of 10 times you queue for quickmatch, and if you get a coordinated A-W stack that can be quite the pain.

The phrase ""you are what you eat"" has seen me adopt more consistent, healthier eating habits which has notably improved my facial appearance (including faster healing of high school blemishes). You'd be surprised what removing chocolates, chips/crisps, and other junk food, does for breakouts. 

Drinking 8+ glasses of water a day, eating more whole foods, sleeping better, working out, eating more fruits for your sugar fix --- in my experience these simple changes to my lifestyle have significantly improved my complexion. 

Add to that, try (key word, try) to stress less and you'll see much greater results to your acne. 

I'm not saying this is the same for everyone as I know there are some people who are really acne prone (what I had was nothing when I compare it to more severe cases), but I've found the above to have worked for me to the point where others have noticed the change as well.

"BoJackHorseman","t5_2zzfr","Well that‚Äôs the rub. Bojack is a very intelligent, cognizant person. But he‚Äôs also ~~human~~ a horse. He‚Äôs flawed. But it really is your interpretation of what is worst, right? Like a guy who says, ‚Äúdriving drunk is incredibly selfish and dangerous‚Äù but does it any way, is he worse than the guy who says, ‚Äúdriving drunk is no big deal‚Äù? Both are narcissistic assholes with no regard for others. 

I guess the way I look at is Bojack says the ‚Äúright‚Äù things a lot. So it wasn‚Äôt so much that he was warning Penny that ‚Äúthis is wrong, you‚Äôre 17 etc‚Äù it was so later he could tell himself, ‚ÄúI told her that we shouldn‚Äôt. But she insisted. I‚Äôm not the bad guy. I *tried* to do the right thing.‚Äù 

For me, that was incredibly tough to watch. That was his lowest moment in the show to me, and so disappointing that he proved everyone (who says he‚Äôs a selfish piece of shit) right. Especially considering it was moments after trying to bang Charlotte at her house, with her husband (who has been super nice to him) right inside. I think it kinda was, ‚ÄúI tried to do the right thing (by Bojack standards) of sleeping with the adult married woman ‚Äîbut it‚Äôs cool because I‚Äôm in love with her‚Äîand she rejected me.

"PERU","t5_2qp9h","En el contexto que el explica que se tienen que entender los motivos detr√°s de Sendero Luminoso, porqu√© surgi√≥ y que muchos de los senderistas de a pie eran victimas (Enga√±ados por el psicopata de Guzm√°n). De ahi viene lo de ""Que tienes contra los senderistas"" (refiriendose a los senderistas de a pie, desesperados, enga√±ados y victimas de Guzman tambi√©n). En otros paises con problemas de terrorismo y/o guerrillas se ve normal y es una teoria aceptada que la mayoria de los terroristas/guerrilleros de ""a pie"" son victimas de las circunstancias, empujados a sus acciones por el desespero. Lo que dice Bellido es que la inacci√≥n del estado peruano y el hecho de dejar olvidada a tantisima parte de la poblaci√≥n es lo que llevo a que Sendero naciera (""El Per√∫ era un desastre en esos a√±os"").

Eso no es apolog√≠a, por el amor de dios, es sencillamente explicar el porqu√© pas√≥ y c√≥mo evitar que vuelva a pasar. Apolog√≠a ser√≠a decir ""¬°Viva Sendero Luminoso!"", y su comentario de Lagos est√° en linea con lo que dijo el APRA en su momento, es una lamentaci√≥n y un romanticismo hac√≠a el hecho de que alguien tan joven diera su vida por la causa, que muestra el desastre que era el pa√≠s en esos a√±os (que una joven decidiera jugarse su vida y finalmente perderla indica que no ten√≠a otras opciones).

&amp;#x200B;

Y todo eso se aplica a Sendero como se aplica al ISIS en el Medio Oriente. No es apolog√≠a, es buscar las causas del mismo. Si no se buscan las causas y a todo el que intenta buscarlas le llamas ""¬°terruco!"" quien se beneficiar√° ser√° Sendero Luminoso al final, porqu√© al no permitir matizaciones obligas a la gente a escoger. Explicarlo no quita que Sendero fueran unos asesinos y Guzm√°n un psic√≥pata, pero sin explicaci√≥n y sin sanar las heridas el conflicto jam√°s acabar√°.",1627776092

FFXIII is certainly a lot more story-driven, so you'll get funneled into battles as much as you do cutscenes, although it opens up later on. However, a lot of the other games are like that too, with varying degrees of wandering around and, in FFVII's case, *a lot* of minigames.

FFXIII has a reputation for being bad, but I think it's overblown. You may have to jump into some others to see if they hit the sweet spot for you.

What do you feel is missing from your time with FFXIII? It might be easier to point you towards one if you have an idea what else you might like.",1627776094

"MedicalCannabisOz","t5_43or0d","That sucks about the sleep and hangovers. CC01 sounds as good as it could get for insomnia but always a chance of something new and improved hey. 

What were/are your faves for the weekend? I watch a tv series or movie in bed after the night dose. If I‚Äôm struggling a bit from too much a comedy gets rid of it pretty quick. I think you described CC01 like that where you can feel a bit ordinary at first and then you‚Äôre ok. 

Ordering 10:10 tomorrow and next available appointment for scripts I‚Äôll ask for (in order of priority) 

1. Isospec 3000, might fix the gsc/20% plus strain issues. That strain is so good at night except for that side effect. I laugh so hard at funny shows and movies sometimes I have to take a break for a minute. ‚ÄòConan and Jordan in Japan part 2‚Äô nearly killed me haha. 

2. CC01 if that fails for sleep

3. Beersheba or your fave weekender

4. Wappa, have to try it for that taste and smell 

5. Any other ones you recommend, I‚Äôm fine taking the chance at my own risk üôÇ

6. The Boss. Just for the sake of sampling something that ridiculous lol. 

Might develop tolerance one day by accident or from being a goose. Needed a gram a night through a water pipe of 90s chronic back then. Whenever I had a break for a month or more I‚Äôd only need one to be gone though. 

Wasn‚Äôt being careful to keep the resistance down whatsoever, typical dumb teenage mull pig üôÑ. Was never fussed about cannabis except for sleep. 

Until I decided to try again via prescription I could only use seroquel for sleep. So effective for that and anxiety as well but you gain weight from more than 1200 calories a day. I got to 129kgs and since around June last year I‚Äôve managed to drop 32 and 17 to go. It‚Äôs coming off twice as quick without seroquel now so big relief.

"PvZGardenWarfare","t5_305ov","Coming from an Arctic Trooper main, he has potential to be broken but what holds him back is his flaws. one of course being his range. Arctic has pitiful damage especially from far range, he suffers to get his own kills which leads him to being one of the top tiers of getting assists. He struggles against mutliple plants, sometimes requiring to be in a correct position and relies on his teamates to help him out on situations like thoses. But because he suffers from getting kills on multiple plants AND needing teammates to back him up from dying leads to his teamates nabbing his kills along side his poor damage output. Also sometimes his freezing capability can be useless at times but all depending on accuracy and keeping watch on ammo since he sometimes doesn't have enough ammo to finish them off while his target is frozen, forcing him to reload which gives his opponent a small but scary opportunity to get you back. This all isn't to say he's complete shit, his pros are very good allowing him to become the 1v1 champ and sqaud of arctic troopers can easily turn lobbies into hellholes.

Both Rosberg &amp; Crofty were literally talking about how Lewis was playing games with the RBs and intentionally slowing down to keep them behind.

Crofty also asked whether Max could pass and Rosberg replied ""Nope, Lewis won't let him"".

It has little to do with ""who's a Drive to Survive era fan and who isn't"", it's just that people were (understandably) mislead by the commentary.

After the data came out, it seems like the vast majority of people realized they were wrong.

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require the **post titles to be more descriptive**, to make it easier for the helpers to figure out if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the bot* `u/Recognize Song` *[currently down]* *(without the space) while including the link in your comment. (timestamped link if needed, no link needed for video posts)*

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

&gt; 
While previous studies suggest the implication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD), no study has investigated its association with early neuroimaging markers of AD. 

&gt; In the Three-City and the AMI cohorts, the associations between HSV infection and (i) hippocampal volume (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ349), (ii) white matter alterations in the parahippocampal cingulum and fornix using diffusion tensor imaging (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ260), and (iii) incidence of AD (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ1599) were assessed according to APOE4 status.  

&gt; Regardless of APOE4 status, infected subjects presented (i) significantly more microstructural alterations of the parahippocampal cingulum and fornix, (ii) lower hippocampal volumes only when their anti-HSV IgG level was in the highest tercile‚Äîreflecting possibly more frequent reactivations of the virus (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03 for subjects with a high anti-HSV IgG level while there was no association for all infected subjects, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.19), and (iii) had no increased risk of developing AD. Nevertheless, among APOE4 carriers, infected subjects presented lower hippocampal volumes, although not significant (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.09), and a two or three times higher risk of developing AD (adjusted Hazard ratio (aHR)‚Äâ=‚Äâ2.72 [1.07‚Äì6.91] p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04 for infected subjects and aHR‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.87 [1.45‚Äì10.28] p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.007 for infected subjects with an anti-HSV IgG level in the highest tercile) while no association was found among APOE4 noncarriers. 

&gt; Our findings support an association between HSV infection and AD and a potential interaction between HSV status and APOE4.  

&gt; This reinforces the need to further investigate the infectious hypothesis of AD, especially the associated susceptibility factors and the possibility of preventive treatments.",1627776098

If you're thinking we should instead order all businesses to reserve staff just to check vacc cards just so the CDC wouldn't have to change policy, the outcome is *at best* same covid prevention for a higher cost compared to ... ""wear a mask.""

&gt;I don't agree with this statement, I think people were continuing to get vaccinated and the promise of not needing to wear a mask was helping to encourage that.

Obviously not, given the vaccination rates went way down.

&gt;I specifically said ""roughly half"", and yes I think 39% qualifies as that. Please participate in good faith and don't misquote me.

&gt;  
&gt;Manchester United, England 2021-  
&gt;  
&gt;**Injuries**  
&gt;  
&gt;The defender demonstrated his mental resilience in coming back from several injuries at Real Madrid who he joined from Lens as 18-year-old in 2011. In May 2013, Varane ruptured his outer meniscus and had to undergo surgery just as he was enjoying a breakthrough campaign under manager Jos√© Mourinho. Then he missed both the 2016 Champions League final and France‚Äôs Euros on home soil with a thigh injury. He made up for both disappointments by winning two more Champions League trophies with Real and the World Cup in 2018. However, he missed Real Madrid‚Äôs Champions League semi-final second leg against Chelsea in May after sustaining an injury to the right adductor muscle. Real lost 2-0.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Aerial threat**  
&gt;  
&gt;Varane first announced himself as one of the world‚Äôs most exciting young defenders in his first Cl√°sico against Barcelona. With Real losing the first leg of the 2013 Copa del Rey semi-final 1-0, Mesut √ñzil swung in a cross from the right-hand side and Varane drifted in unnoticed to head past Bar√ßa goalkeeper Jos√© Manuel Pinto. He repeated the trick from a corner a month later in the second leg. While Harry Maguire is likely to remain United‚Äôs chief threat from set-pieces, Varane will offer another aerial option. That should also reassure fans who are unconvinced whether the 28-year-old is up to the physical rigours of the Premier League.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Athleticism**  
&gt;  
&gt;Varane is blessed with pace and a strong physique, but it is testament to his defensive ability that these are not his defining characteristics. Unlike his former Real team-mate Sergio Ramos, the Frenchman is not the kind of defender to jump into tackles needlessly. Instead he relies on a composed positional game and an ability to drag attackers out of position. The fact that he picked up just 24 yellow cards in his 360 appearances for Real points to his excellent awareness.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Technique**  
&gt;  
&gt;As well as his array of defensive qualities, Varane is assured in possession. The 2018 World Cup winner is happy to bring the ball forwards and rarely looks flustered when passing out from the back. His passing accuracy of 88.7 per cent during his time in La Liga reflects that, and Manchester United fans can expect a rounded defender who plays on the front foot.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Leadership**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ramos‚Äôs larger-than-life presence often made Varane seem meek by comparison, but he has previously explained how he prefers to lead by example. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the kind to shout, to motivate,‚Äù he told Le Journal du Dimanche in 2015. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, I‚Äôve got a big brother side to me: I replace my team-mates, I talk to them when they‚Äôre not doing as well. I‚Äôve always done it, even with more experienced players.‚Äù He could prove to be exactly what United need, given Maguire is the kind of vocal captain who would complement him so well.",1627776100

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","For doordashing: we have a cat tree near our front door and am at scratching post near our back. When we would leave, we would put the kitten up high so he wasn't in front of the door. When coming home, if I had bags, I would go bag first and use them to block his door access. If not, I'd block with legs/feet and be at the ready to grab him. If multiple people coming in, I'd put him up high for everyone else. Also good boys and scratchers when he didn't dash.

Balcony: so our kitten did jump from our 15ish foot balcony ledge that oversees our living room. I didn't know he was up there and moved one of his toys, he jumped straight for the toy. Scared the crap out of me. He was fine. And he's never done it again. I don't think he would have done it the first time if he hadn't gone into straight kill mode. And neither of my 2 adult cats have ever tried to jump and he's never tried again either in the 6 months since. You can try blocking the ledge, putting double sided tape, or foil on/near it to keep him away. 

He also fell off the stairs for a 5 foot drop when he was 3 months. Only did that once and learned to go a bit slower after that too",1627776100

"VintageRadios","t5_37t5b","It also looks like they disconnected the large resistor and judging by the mounting holes, removed a transformer as well. I'm guessing they had a bad transformer, so they removed it, bypassed a tube, and removed the resistors from the circuit to create a circuit that added up to around 120v, basically creating an AA5 layout. They probably changed some of the tubes from what they originally were. Very clever, it it actually worked. Kind of like what someone would do if they were stranded on a deserted island with no parts. Would have to be done by someone with a fairly good knowledge of how tube radios work. The workmanship is pretty terrible, though. Probably not a serious project.",1627776101

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I mean, Svenskeren ended up with double scuttle and still got hard outfarmed and as well had a really low impact on the game. Also he gets ulted by leona with a tristana next to him and he doesn't even proc ulti for the block, untill he finiially get's out of the stun. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that all fault is of svenskeren, I belive that the midgame decision were horrible (they lost 2 tower mid t2 and t3, for nothing but just because they had a bad rotation and synergy).

That said will this game be a win for EG if Contrctz was playing, we don't know it is up to peoplw to argue if the team synergy would have been better, but for sure there would have been more fight back. This game EG got chocked slowly. Look how many stun Jiizuke lended both during laning phase and midgame/lategame. Still none brought anything back (besides one kill on camille). 

I wouldn't blame it on Impact at all btw, he got a counter match up, ganked and died (because svenskeren was 5 second slower) and tped by enemy midlaner. With all the resources invested in order to contain him, I think he did a pretty good job. Kept being a treath and didn't lose, untill extremely late, in sidelane against camille",1627776102

He has complete faith in those around him in order to not loose hope in the situation coming out positive despite it being overwhelmingly negative so much so that he falls into delusional levels of positivity. In other words in the face of extreme adversity he forces himself to see those around him as stronger and smarter so he doesn‚Äôt give up and become suicidal. I thought this was really really really obvious especially by the end. Oh and he just has extreme faith in his luck and tricks himself into thinking he is especially lucky in order to make risky (but rewarding) decisions. Because...

1. play around cannon minions to get your support quest as fast as possible
2. knowing your range of threat for an all-in. Braum isn't the greatest at all-ins especially pre-6, but can still catch people off guard by w'ing to a minion and getting your passive of a squishy in lane.
3. your job is to protect and peel as braum. use your shield to stop powerful ranged attacks from the enemy (it will delete projectiles so you can interrupt things like miss fortune ult, seraphine ult, etc...), and auto attack divers with your passive to assist your team in stunning them. try and tag as many melees rushing in as you can with that passive, it'll get you so much value
4. braum's really tough in poke lanes, you're gonna lose control of the lane if you can't find clean all-ins. just look to play back and play for mid-late game fights

Rewatching our own gameplay when we died. Really easy to do on the ps5 where you can clip the last 5 mins of your gameplay or 30 mins. Just trying to figure out why you died and what you could have done to come out on top is the best advice. 

Watching other streamers who are better than you grind ranked (preferably your own platform). This aspect also helps tremendously. Seeing what they do, learning from them.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My Least favorites are the cliches:

Confederate Victories, Nazi Victories, any kind of *basic* ""what if the historical loser, won"" because it's usually the same old tired scenarios.

And they usually feed into a lot of counter-historical ideas of the losing side.

If the Nazis win, you'll usually see them be super lucky, efficient, and somehow intelligent enough to hold everything together. 

If the Confederates win, they usually seize the day early with all their *godlike* officers and generals, their ""*esprit de corps*"" and knock the Union out of the War while it's still hesitant and demoralized.


What my  favorites are:

Subversions. 

There's everything in the world in those above scenarios that makes for an interesting story if you actually do your homework and do something that's inspired with it.

But also, I just like scenarios that people don't usually touch in the first place.

Alt history is populated by WW2/Civil War obsessed guys.

And if not them, then it's the Roman Empire.

"Gymnastics","t5_2r0th","Funny enough I‚Äôve been making this exact argument since Tuesday since the new broke SHE WITHDREW FOR 2 REASON: TEAM METAL &amp; HER SAEFTY. It was obvious  to me- I don‚Äôt say that rudely. I‚Äôm not an avid gymnastics follower. But it‚Äôs realistic to see that Simone doing Simone routines at the rate of difficulty she has and her execution makes her score a ‚Äúlock‚Äù per say to go for gold whether for teams or by herself.  But on the another upside of having her routines being ‚Äúlocks‚Äù  is another way for US to have a ‚Äúsafety net‚Äù in scores per say if she is doing the routines she is expected to put on. Her scores could possible help minimize a fall or a mistake on that apparatus or just past mistake made before on a different apparatus. And if no mistakes are made than well Simone is just helping push the lead farther ahead.  But now the negative side of Simone being human for once in a competition those scores she puts up have to stay with the team. To be honest I don‚Äôt think a human performance from Simone would kill the team since her level of difficulty is so high. But it would most likely kill the chance to medal in any competition- which she saw coming right away in my opinion. She is on all 4 apparatus that makes up 1/3 their overall score. Once she saw she lost her self in the air she knew that could easy happen again.  Long story short it‚Äôs funny how much Simone can mean to this team finals either way.  And I find it courageous for her first though to be her safety and doing something stupid to danger her but than it immediate went to her teammates and their Olympic moment and having faith in them to do what she knows they can do.  It probably sucked in the moment to have to do what she needed to and put added pressure on Grace, Jordan and Suni. BUT THEN‚Ä¶ I come back and says okay if  Simone stays in and she injuries herself her teammates get to watch her possibly  go off in stretcher right in front of their eyes. What causes more emotional damage or pressure to her teammates. Her withdrawing and being on the floor with them or her getting carted off in front of them. My guess the second one!  What other athlete would do what Simone did? Maybe a lot - i hope a lot would but who knows?  Or would most stay in for selfish reasons? Would most stay in out of fear of not admitting - I‚Äôm not okay? 

When it comes to the media- that narrative like you said would be more accurate than what is being said. But they are also being accurate that is for mental health reasons. They just don‚Äôt vocalize how dangerous her vault could have been and the twistes are the difference sometimes between walking out of the arena that night and being carried out on a stretcher with a neck brace. But that story like you suggested does it benefit them to say that? Yes and No. They make it look like Simone is being a team player without being team player: Media is only team Media at the end of the day.

I also think the average person who watches gymnastics every 4 years  don‚Äôt realize how difficult this sport is for anyone but let alone Simone. They think she is the apparent ‚ÄúGOAT‚Äù but quits on her team:  which is not true. They  think this is what she does for a living and she shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to go to the next apparatus or this is just the risk she is willing to take in this sport. She aware of the danger she puts her self in daily-which yes but Simone or no one didn‚Äôt also sign up to break a neck because they had a mental lapse in the air and felt they had to keep going and couldn‚Äôt have a voice to say I can‚Äôt . The average person watching every year doesnt also take in the accountability of how much mental strength it takes in the sport and to excel in this sport. The also fail to realize if your mental is off your asking for an injury. The brain is the most powerful muscle in our body for a reason. It can freak you out, it can calm you down, it can tell the worse possible outcome and it can tell you the best outcome. Also the average person who brings up well Kerri or her picture and say they whimps now and soft and where is Simone grit. They don‚Äôt know half the story we do. And I have had to set 3 people straight now on how wrong that moment was in olympics history. It looks like it was great but it‚Äôs not at all. I think we all know why. But people don‚Äôt understand this sport even though all you have to be is realistic about it to understand the dangers. It‚Äôs not like a baseball, football, swimming, etc. - also the Kerri comments are the comments make me the most made in all of the comments being made about Simone.

Thankful Simone is more aware of her boundaries with this sport than most people think.  I would hope other athletes have these clearly boundaries but I‚Äôm afraid to say they don‚Äôt. Simone doing what she is doing in these olympics is more than mental health and her safety. But it‚Äôs thrusting mental health in athletes to be talked about. It‚Äôs shedding a light on what‚Äôs being going on in athletes  for way to long now.  It‚Äôs Mental health for their sport and their day to day life outside of their sport.  It‚Äôs been brewing for a while but I think this conversation needs to be had- I‚Äôm sad for Simone to have to go thru this and it not be the olympics she wanted but I‚Äôm happy that she was smart about this and I think at the end of the day is going to really help future athletes to know it‚Äôs okay to say no and sit out if you need to protect yourself and your health.

On a last side note that‚Äôs off this topic a little- everyone should go watch weight of gold. It‚Äôs eye opening it and really gives you an insight to athletes and these pressure.",1627776104

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","But unlike Arknights who literally did screw themselves out of allowing men in their gacha (they opened too waifu heavy so that once they started releasing men their insecure otaku fanbase freaked out and they had to stop) FGO has always been mixed gender, because Fate itself has always been mixed (Gilgamesh and Emiya outrank almost every single waifu in the game, Emiya is beaten only by Artoria and sometimes Arcueid if including all of Nasuverse) so they don't have the fear of that happening to them. Furthermore, we have every year where they reveal the top grailed servants being ones like Okada and Mandricardo, not the myriad of women released each year. and every single survey they read off each anni stream having a top result of ""Give us male swimsuit servants!"" - and the first year they released male costumes, the audience was actually in the room with them and they went *crazy* hype until they found out they were costumes, and the devs then became visibly confused and baffled over why people were upset.

So this is definitely not a case of the company legit believing that there is no audience for them, they *have* to know (and they've said that the female presence in the playerbase has increased over the years until it's about 40%) but they pretend they don't. At this point, I feel like it's not so much them being afraid of their toxic fanbase as them *being* their toxic fanbase...or...something. I don't know. It's really bizarre, since FGO is not just DW's flagship, but a huge portion of Sony's profits overall. Whether they're afraid of a comparatively small portion of their fanbase or whether the devs themselves are allowed to be the insecure weebs (and I bring back to mind at this that years 1 and 2 were explicitly stated to have the costumes designed to match the devs' fetishes) it makes...no sense at all.",1627776104

The quality of life for those on the bottom has gone *down* while worker productivity has increased.   That's what happened during the American Industrial Revolution too.  There was more stuff and more money in the system than ever, but workers were working longer and harder than they used to on the farm and were in worse health.  

That's stealing form people more than any tax is. 

Also you keep saying things like ""HIS Company"".  I want you to try to consider for a moment that ownership really, really is not that clear cut. Why does he own the employees' excess productivity?

"roosterteeth","t5_2s7g9","Full disclosure, I never watched RvB Zero.

The reason was purely based on the initial trailers I saw and how the cast were describing their characters in the lead up. I could be completely wrong, but it seemed like whomever was making these decisions were trying to make their core cast ""cool"" and ""badass""; both of these fundamentally go against what endeared a lot of people to the OG lot. But as it was where they apparently wanted to take RvB, I accepted it and moved on from the series. I had no malice about it.

However, what Torrian's post makes evident is that even though decision makers at RT want it to continue because it's the show that started everything, it needs to end. I think fans will be fine with that. Instead of trying to change a show to go in a direction and cater to new blood whilst expecting old fans to stay, give people like Torrian a chance to work on a brand new thing; something that they can wholly own and be proud of and something that can grow organically and have a fan base of it's own.

Also important to recognize that the more people are vaccinated a certain way, will mean certain variants will die out and only vaccine-resistant ones will remain.  The world essentially failed at controlling the growth of the virus, now with uncountable evolutionary pressures all around the world it will continue to mutate enough to find new niches.  


Our hope lies in:

* A seasonal global lull + increased immunity deprives the virus of an opportunity to replicate a new strong variant
* There are fundamental limitation to what constitutes an effective COVID-style illness and the vaccines we have or will develop will cover all those possibilities
* A new variant so deadly and scary that everything shuts down again, and for real this time",1627776106

"RPClipsGTA","t5_3onkg","When someone is visibly injured, acting out of character, nervous, scared, and points out someone driving them around implicating them in hurting them that is, in fact, a lead to chase down and investigate. Mila told pred that Basem has good relationships with the lifers and them hurting basem made no sense. Mila also mentioned that Basem directly pointed to andi after acting very strange and before calling her that night and saying that something larger than him was happening and he was probably going to die.

To add: The lifers have less reason and cause to harm Basem. They get nothing from it. Basem gives them jobs and interacts with them. But there is a clear line of evidence (Through debts, businesses, and associations) that show there is cause for Basem's business and political associates to possibly want to harm him. You have to weigh this in an investigation as well. Not just ""it doesn't make sense because he said another thing first"". Victims of crimes often do incongruous and strange things. Victims of violent crimes who may have possibly been in a situation where they were at great threat of immediate harm (like Basem was at Otto's) do and say even stranger things to protect their life and the lives of those they care about. Pred has reason to believe that these things were true given the testimony he has gotten from multiple people.

They should go talk with the lifers, Basem did implicate them. But Basem's actions and words also implicate Andi. To not investigate andi after what multiple people witnessed at otto's, along with the character testimony from people who seem to be close to him saying that things were suspicious and strange, would be negligent on their part.

I don't want this to turn into another ""Baas and Andrews investigation gets shut down nearly immediately because everyone thinks it must be meta!!"" situation. Pred is doing police work. If he or the cops don't take the time to talk with the lifers about what happened while he was in prison, then it's time to lambast them for not investigating bovice ripped off his nails.",1627776107

And I'm not comfortable with the ""this is men, this is how they are raised"" like you seem to say. You will find the immense majority of men are just as appalled and shocked by these crimes because most men are normal people. I'm not going to pretend to know and understand all around the matter, but domestic violence does not need to be defined by a broad gender stroke. It would be misleading, at best. Same for bullying, no one is going to convince me that it's only boys who do the bullying.

But for sure domestic violence and mental illness are tough and complex subject matters, and I understand that in an effort to appeal to the masses they dumb it down as much as they can, but it loses something in the process. I don't like when good causes sell out for the sake of attention, I feel it's often to the detriment of said cause. Who knows, myabe I'm wrong! Maybe the attention does get funding for solutions (like the shelters she mentions). But again, approach it from a gender inequality issue, and lose the plagiarized buzzwords.

- Multiple different colors of the same press design (you can see blue, grey and yellow dominos) being sold at the same time. This means they are making small batches.

Both of these indicate that a small crew (or even a single person) is producing them, without many resources invested. In the US that's a bad sign, when you consider how much easier it is to source meth than MDMA there.",1627776109

Having said that, I'd be careful about paying too much attention to the advice of people online about these sorts of things. It's hard to judge who is worth listening to. The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is to follow what interests you the most. If you see the things people do in Houdini and think ""I wish I could do that"", then download Houdini. If you're more interested in Blender, then download that instead. Your curiosity is what will provide the necessary motivation to learn and succeed at your craft.

Preference in essentially all cases is not an active choice by any means. It‚Äôs just an inner feeling.

Just because you don‚Äôt actively choose or decide it doesn‚Äôt change that it‚Äôs something you prefer which is the definition of a preference.

Yeah there‚Äôs artificial things like shaving your legs, or even things like certain types of kinks, which likely aren‚Äôt things you‚Äôre ‚Äúborn with‚Äù in the same sense as sexual preference but it‚Äôs not someone actively makes a choice to be turned on by BDSM nor can they just wake up one day and choose not to be anymore even if they can choose whether or not to actually do it.

"CharacterRant","t5_35frv","I disagree with him making reforms to prevent another Tekkadan forming. There wasn't ever a hint of him being any sort of progressive. Even when he faced Tekkadan he hardly actually lost the battle with them. It was largely politics with Mcgillis which was the risk(even then, in the latter half of the season he absolutely walloped Mcgillis on the political front after a sudden turn of absolutely nonsensical decisions made by Mcgillis).

Tekkadan, even with the support of a major branch of Gjallahorn was still surrounded and exterminated ruthlessly and effectively. The only time Tekkadan posed a legitimate threat was when they wielded a legitimate dainsleif for all of about 30 seconds and missed. Their only dainsleif wielder dying shortly thereafter.

Tekkadan was never a serious threat to him, it was only ever Mika's Barbatos which has been destroyed + Mika was quite literally a one in a trillion pilot. He did solo a MA, not a single other character could ever do such a thing. In spite of this one in a trillion pilot, it was not enough to actually overcome Rustal's Arianrhod and strategy.

The fact that Tekkadan itself was never a major threat(Mcgillis was, even then Mcgillis was handily outsmarted and dealt with) + that his character had been established as wanting to maintain the status quo of the last couple hundred years it seems entirely out of character for him to make wild reforms that undermine the fundamental structure of Gjallarhorn(the seven stars council and it's far reaching influence in order to maintain ""order and control"" as Rustal sees it).

Another Tekkaden rising would make no difference to Rustal. The one in a million gundam, Barbatos is gone. Tekkaden as it was, was handled by Rustal regardless using his manipulation of the press and battle.

The ease with which Rustal beat Mcgillis towards the end made zero sense to me, Rustal appears as a godly strategist with everything mapped out only because of the character assassination of Mcgillis. Mcgillis abandoned all of his logical thinking and reasonable plans for seemingly no reason, it was so out of character. Mcgillis became a brute who just mindlessly charged solo into a massive fleet? wtf lol, where did the cunning strategist go

The ending seems like tragedy for the sake of tragedy without making much sense. The hard headed conservative(and comically evil in a franchise about moral greys) who was used as a personification of the old ways of Gjallarhorn suddenly became a ""good guy"" and was changing the world for the better?

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","What is the point of marriage and the words ""I promise.... In sickness and in health."" If those words are so easily forgotten once we feel the other person isn't making us happy anymore? Those words are the meaning of true love. Maybe instead of finding an out, you should try to communicate with her to see what the real issue is. It's too easy to find an out these days and that is why marriages fail so often, because people are more worried about themselves than they are those that they promised to live and take care of until death. Those wedding vows have lost their meaning. 
   People shouldn't get married unless they are willing to follow through with their word. If you go back on your word, then you aren't very trustworthy yourself. I don't claim to know your situation or how you or your wife feel about each other, but if you are willing to let her go because she isn't making you happy like you think she should, perhaps you 2 didn't love each other to begin with. All I am saying is, don't be like the majority of married couples and give up just like that. Because if you went back in your promise to love your wife, once, chances are, when you find someone else, you will find a reason to leave her also. Fight for what you promised your wife and everyone present at your wedding. If that doesn't work, then at least nobody can say you didn't try.",1627776112

Sometimes even if you dont end up killing that tank/plane that's on a streak you can keep it busy by continuously harassing it, not great for k/d but rewards with good points.

It can be frustrating but also remember the style of combat that took place in the first world war, which in a big part involved simply having more bodies to throw at the problem than the enemy.

Your request was nonsense since holding most opinions that get people canceled don't actually have repercussions. The cancel mob invents the repercussions and enforces them on the rest of us despite their tiny minority status. Hold any of the opinions I mentioned and you're the ""fash"" that needs to be ""bashed"" by antifa or you're the despicable chauvinist misogynist that feminism needs to see ostracized, or you're the racist that needs to be disempowered by BLM and maybe your business destroyed. Those aren't ""repercussions"", that's terrorism and crybullying.

I guess you were sleeping when they came after Chik Fil-a because the founder believes in traditional marriage values and that the state should only incentivize those kinds of marriages for moral reasons. Regardless if you think that such a view is right or wrong, the left went after them anyway. I guess you were asleep when Nick Sandmann was defamed by CNN. I guess you were asleep when Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with utterly absurd crimes to anyone who actually watched the video, watched the interview that happened beforehand, and read Wisconsin's law on carrying under 18. But no, he has to be a racist murderer because the narrative said so because he wears a MAGA cap.

We've already accepted over a million illegals through the border, they were given a court date which 90% of them have not shown up to and they're lost in the ether of our Country's lands. Biden by executive order has just let them all in.

HR1. The For the People act. It automatically registers anyone without regard to immigration status that interacts with the government, so if they get an ID or drivers license, if they apply for benefits, etc, they automatically get registered to vote. Then it makes it illegal to require ID, check their registration to see that they're citizens and if not purge them from the rolls, etc. So they can walk in on election day, vote, and all the ways that they would get caught doing so are illegal for the state to implement to find their illegal vote and throw it out. And then, on the off chance that someone DOES identify them and their illegal registration, the government officials who automatically registered them are indemnified from prosecution for doing so. Already, these people are counted in the census and the formula that determines the number of congressional seats that state gets.

Let me just say that is not terribly reliable information; the photo could be faked, he could have been the janitor, resigned in disgrace, etc.

Explain to me why them sleeping with joker means they‚Äôre straight and nothing else. Explain to me why I‚Äôve slept with men and women.

Atlus have notoriously handled gay characters badly‚Ä¶ did you see the gay representation in this game? 

Nobody here is saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre definitely gay‚Äù, just that they think the ship is cute and they like it.

You‚Äôve got some internalised homophobia going on if it upsets you that much that someone could suggest they‚Äôre gay ‚Äúbabe‚Äù

But I‚Äôll ask again because I‚Äôd like clarity:

What makes you think sleeping with someone you have a strong connection with makes you 100% gay or straight anyway? Because I‚Äôm a living example that proves what you‚Äôre saying just isn‚Äôt true.

Edit: also the legs thing‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the one saying that not me üòÇ

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","&gt; For Sanji to only be as strong as the second strongest in a current Yonkou's crew by the end of the series is an insult?

Yes. Considering how weak he is compared to top tiers.

&gt; Id say Katakuri is around Admiral level (ish)

We don't know how strong the admirals are, but if we are reasonable and assume they're around Yonko level, then this is a blasphemous underestimation of the admirals. 

&gt; so surpassing Katakuri is terms of strength makes him nearly Yonkou level,

Katakuri is no where near Yonkou level. He won't even be able to deal any damage to the Yonkou. He just gets stomped.

&gt;  I know Luffy is gonna be King of the Pirates, but having the 3rd strongest (even that is debatable) be Yonkou level is just silly.

No it isn't silly. And the fact you think Sanji being the 3rd strongest is debatable further illustrates my point on how much he's disrespected. 

Sanji will be close to Zoro in skill. If Zoro will be Yonko level, Sanji will be around there as well. Luffy's crew emphasized quality over quantity, so it makes sense that the absolute strongest crew with so few members will have 3 Yonko level fighters. 

&gt; Rayleigh was Rogers second in command and he wasn't Yonko level.

We don't know that. It's very unlikely this is true considering Zoro will surpass Mihawk. Do you not think Mihawk is Yonko level? 

&gt; This is either Katakuri slander or Sanji fanfic lmao.

No, you're just overrating Katakuri for some weird reason. Saying stuff like he's admiral level is just bizarre.",1627776117

Quarter Finals Time: 3 picks and a smokey

1.Germany (-1.5) v Argentina @ 2.13 - Argentina are a low scoring team this tournament and I think the 3-1 win over Netherlands gave Germany a lot of confidence, they are at least 2 goals better in this I believe. ‚úÖ

2. Australia (-1.5) v Netherlands @ 2.08 - The Netherlands haven't looked strong compared previously. Australia rested some big players yesterday and the Dutch won't park the bus for 60 which is important for Australia's attack.

3. Belgium (-2.5) v Spain @ 1.88 - I feel like Belgium will really touch up Spain here. Spain got very lucky in a scrappy game against Australia. If they fall away that will play into Belgium's hands they love the European indoor style of possessing the ball to find the extra man. Spain playing for a minimal loss and draw against Australia to qualify, they'll need a result here so can't park the bus especially if Belgium score early which they've made a habit of doing.

Smokey: GB ML v India @ 2.88 - This is the upset in the quarter finals I believe. India have been far from convincing irrespective of coming 2nd in a much weaker pool. Their win against NZ came in the last 5 minutes and Japan gave them a scare too in their last game. GB on the other hand have had much harder competition and will benefit from this massively.",1627776118

&gt; AUSTIN, Texas - Country music legend Willie Nelson led more than a thousand spectators in singing &amp;quot;Vote them out&amp;quot; Saturday from the steps of the Texas Capitol during a rally wrapping up a four-day march in support of Democratic state legislators who bolted for Washington two weeks ago to block GOP-backed voting restrictions.

&gt; More than a dozen people in favor of the voting legislation proposed in Texas gathered at the Capitol building&amp;#039;s front gate behind the rally, waving signs in support of the proposed changes.

&gt; Renee Conley, 52, said she attended the rally with her daughter, for whom she is fighting against the Texas voting bill.

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","I'm sorry to hear this OP. All I can suggest is for you to live as comfortably as possible. The only thing you would want to prolong your life is to make sure your assets are going to specific people (and if you need to get a lawyer to do it, by all means please do it). Even your end of life wishes, you need to choose someone that has been there with you through everything both your cancer situation and the infidelity. If there hasn't been anyone, please give every info you need to the lawyer you hire. I've seen how families behave after someone dies...vultures. Someone needs to seriously make sure nothing is taken or stolen, and whoever you want to give your money or belongings to, make sure you do it while you're alive...it's worse when you don't. 

You can also give your end of life wishes to your doctor, so they can immediately give that info to the family. There you can have a list of what you want ready...who they should be talking to if they decide to go to the bank and proclaim that they're the rightful heir to your money, etc.

I wish you well. Live your life fully as you can right now. And yes, you can be at peace when you gave everything you got for yourself (and not for others since quite frankly, your family and husband is stressing you to hell). I'll be cheering you on from afar (I'm still in the US, specifically in CA). I hope everything works out for you.",1627776119

The gun logic was wack in this season. Why waste so many bullets shooting out windows when the bad guy is right there out in the open? And then you somehow still have enough ammo to keep firing automatic rifles for the whole season? Who is finding/making all these bullets?
I quite liked the lack of guns in season 9 and 10. The resources for that kind of tech are dwindling and are deemed less necessary for survival. But with what we know about season 11, I‚Äôm sure there will be a strong resurgence of gunfights soon. And I‚Äôm excited.

So in no particular order, here's what we did this month:

- Had a discussion about the source material corner in episode threads and its lack of effectiveness at times. We had a couple of proposed alternatives like separate anime-only/source-included threads (including possibly not posted directly to /r/anime) or comment chains designated as one or the other.
- Added a new automod report for top-level comments only to monitor for potential source corner violations.
- Updated the recommendation automod comment:
 -  Changed the flowchart to [a new one](https://i.redd.it/vdzlkodz19c71.png) by /u/fetchfrosh 
 -  Fixed the search link for recent weekly recommendation threads.
 -  Changed the because.moe link to livechart.me/search

- Short discussion on condensed edited scenes being posted as [Video] recently. 
- Had a bot spam a recent Jahy key visual thread. Dealing with it screwed up all our monthly action numbers, but /u/durinthal quickly made a script to delete all comments (upwards of 3000 spam comments) *and* get an accurate reading of our real total actions for the month.
- Made some final decisions on the flair site created by /u/badspler and how we'll use it on the sub:
 - Voted to adopt a new flair website that will be used by users to set their subreddit flair. **[Vote Passed]**

 - Voted to inline the old 'FC' (Fanart-contest) CSS flair badge into a reddit-emoji badge.**[Vote Passed]**

 - Voted to display multiple wins of a badge if earned by the user. **[Vote Passed]**

 - Voted to limit the number of award-flairs able to be displayed to two (plus an anime-tracker emoji). **[Vote Passed]**
 - Everyone will be migrated to the new format, so you don't have to do anything!

- We also ended up deciding on how to integrate the WT! of the month winners with the new flair site:

 - Voted to establish a 'WT' (WatchThis!) flair-award badge to be awarded to the winner of the monthly WT project. **[Vote Passed]**
 - Voted to retroactively award this badge to all previous winners. **[Vote Passed]**
 - Voted to use the existing 'Quill' flair-badge to be used as this 'WT' badge (this was awarded to the top 3 WT writers of 2020).  The existing holders of this badge will be swapped to a gold version. **[Vote Passed]**

"mtgfinance","t5_2vv1m","Thanks for your thoughts! I think the Misty artwork is somewhere near the middle for Seb. It's great, but perhaps not absolute top tier. I personally think a lot of it depends on how reprint-happy Wizards is on the enemy fetches over the next 1-2 years. We'll just have to wait and see. After ZR Expeditions, Secret Lair UE, and MH2 variations, they've gone full-hog on them in a 12 month time period. If they chill out for a bit and let the inventory deplete, focusing on allied fetches and other land cycles needing reprints, the current copies could creep back up. Whether this Seb artwork has a serious premium over the others is the tough part. It being a SL drop certainly limits its potential to see a reprint vs. other existing or even other new art in the future. That is, if they stick to the idea of the SL drops being unique art and only available for a limited time without reprints.",1627776123

In the post-Bolt era, 9.90-ish times are actually competitive. Given Japan's reputation as having the best baton pass of any country, four 9.90-ish runners may very well be enough to win with none of the current crop of sprinters being the same caliber as the retired sprinters.

"wow","t5_2qio8","I mean having the villain win used to be a great storyline until everyone started using that and it got overplayed. It worked so well for avengers because that wasn't the norm, and while big comics fans for sure expected the snap, it still had that weight of emotion behind it because Thanos had been built up so well for so long. You can't just bring a character like zovaal in and introduce him immediately say he was behind everything and then have him win. There's no investment behind him we literally just found out about him. Look at James bond spectre. Would have been a greater movie if there had been more buildup behind the villain in previous films. Wasn't terrible because the acting of chrisoph waltz is always great but story wise it was lackluster because he was introduced too quickly to just say oh yea all the previous shit was this guy so he's big AND bad. If they were to ever have had a villain win it should have been Arthas. He was literally the perfect vessel for an oh fuck the bad guy was too strong for our initial attempt and we got clobbered and he won story.

What is the upgrade, and what is the reason for it if my internet is working fine?

My fiber jack is not hooked up to power, but it has always worked fine that way. The reason I got the Google wifi puck is because it allowed me to control from an app which devices are using my wifi. That feature is working fine, so I don‚Äôt see a reason to change anything, except that I get the feeling my setup (of having the Google gateway device between the fiber  jack and the puck) may not be correct or recommended (even though it is working). That is what I‚Äôm looking to understand better.

If that gateway device shouldn‚Äôt be there, I‚Äôll invest some time toward removing it and trying to get the wifi puck to work directly with the fiber jack. If it doesn‚Äôt matter either way, I‚Äôll probably just leave it.",1627776125

Before we go through the usual dance of ""why was he in prison""

Kevin Lynch was in prison because he was from a town where a 67 year old man was beaten to death in his own home by the RUC in 1969 for the crime of demanding Civil rights. He was in prison because he was savagely beaten, unprompted by members of the UDR, after years of petty stop and searches. 

He was in prison because he loved his country, her culture, her heritage. The proudest day of his life was captaining the Derry U-16 hurling team to victory at an all-Ireland. He was in prison because every day after mass he passed the grave of two IRA Volunteers beaten and shot dead by B Specials in May 1922 and he understood what it was they had fought for.",1627776125

"EDH","t5_2scee","[Here's my list](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/D-XWCgShBECvPr7-uWxKQw), in case it helps.

I would say it's relatively strong, at least as far as battlecruiser strategies go. It's one of my best ""fair"" decks (meaning non-combo/heavy control), but it's not oppressive at all IMO. Seems like a good addition to any casual playgroup.

I play a few Ajanis, mostly because he's a leonin planeswalker, though he's not bad for go-wide strategies. 

A few tricks, beside the changeling creatures the other user mentioned, is giving all creature types to your whole board with cards like [[maskwood nexus]], [[mirror entity]] or [[shields of velis vel]]. Since it runs many ""lords"" (creatures that buff a tribe, in this case cats and/or dogs), this makes sure each of your creatures gets pumped for all of your buffs, and not only their type's. It's also great with [[Coat of Arms]]

[[Chameleon Colossus]] can get huge, and [[Mirror Entity]] with your board full is a good mana sink. [[Irregular Cohort]] gives you a 2/2 token that's both a cat and a dog, beside the 2 1/1s from Rin and Seri.

[[shields of velis vel]] and [[blades of velis vel]] are interesting because, being tribal instants with changeling, they have all creature types despite not being creatures, so they trigger Rin and Seri. They also make for some interesting interaction, like a makeshift Maskwood Nexus, saving your board from conditional boardwipes that don‚Äôt kill certain creature types (like zombies), negating your opponent's [[Mikaeus the Unhallowed]], stopping a mutate like [[Nethroi, Apex of Death]] (since you can't mutate onto a Human creature), or making your opponent creatures into rats to capitalise from [[Hungry Linx]].

Yeah, that's mostly it, those are the most ""obscure"" things about my build. The rest are mostly self-explanatory, like [[Cathars Crusade]] or [[Cryptolith Rites]].",1627776126

"WGU_CompSci","t5_gsr7a","I‚Äôve been thinking about almost the exact same thing. With my current job, I started out with no experience just publishing articles on their website, then worked my way up to some content creation, video publishing, then a lot of SEO stuff. I got pretty good at all of that, which I found creative, so my boss started me doing more technical publishing (like for online courses), basic html coding, and now I‚Äôm doing lots of web testing. My ability to spot things to make the sites more user-friendly and pleasing to the eye (look and feel of the site) started getting me interested in UX/UI. It‚Äôs more of a front-end gig, but I‚Äôm a little curious about cyber too (like ethical hacking‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs basically what my brother does for a living). Both feel creative, but a little less repetitive compared to SEO. But yea, this is kind of where I‚Äôm leading, but I‚Äôm probably going to start at WGU even if I‚Äôm not 100% sure. I‚Äôve known developers start as back-end, and switched to UX/UI. I‚Äôve also known UX/UI to getting into cyber. I think the jobs are easy to switch around once your ‚Äúin‚Äù. So getting the degree is my main focus right now.

Also, my brother, who makes 6-figures, said he knows lots of people that have gone to WGU and their skills are really great. So it‚Äôs definitely a reputable school I think. Plus a lot of extra or more niche things can be learned online before/during/after college, much of it can be learned for free. So yea.

"Genshin_Impact_Leaks","t5_3l2acu","Every element get a speciality based on rpg roles :
Anemo - CC/Stunner,CCer
Geo - Shield/Tank
Electro - Energy Recharge/Mana regen
Hydro - Heal/Healer
Pyro - Damage dealer EXPLOSIONS so aoe dmg/Mage dps
Cryo - Crits dmg and crits rate, likely being best phy dmg and single target/Knight or whatever with a weapon dps

What's left ? Dendro could maybe a debuff expert, like decreasing def, atk, speed etc.. but i don't think that would be a great speciality while we have tanks for reducing dmg and some characters decreasing def, what about they would be summoners ?? Or maybe even Necromancers ?? Dendro means plants and so it means Life, what if he can get a control over life, resurrecting your characters as a support ability or enemies to use them as dps ? It is a crazy idea but what if some dendro characters would use plants to copy your character and create like a clone ?? Dendro characters being summoners would explain why they waited to introduce dendro because they needed more time to make some good summoning AI or balancing it ? And also the Dendro Archon is the god of wisdom, knowing a lot of things, also knowing to create life and death with dark magic ? Sumeru has really big Egyptian vibes, and this is the first country that I think of while talking about Necromancing or summoning with mummies and all + Baizhu have a snake around his neck so maybe it's like his summoning animal like in Naruto ?
The summoners idea is so nice I would love dendro doing this, I would like to mention that in Genshin, a great ability that some characters have are the off-field skills, and a summoner fit absolutely perfectly this, this would be the speciality of Dendro, the off field skills, supporting or doing damage, maybe the summoned minions would absorb an element to do what the element normally does ? :

Anemo - minions cc
Geo - a tank minion, maybe provoking enemies
Electro - minion that give a lot of particles
Hydro - a healing minion
Pyro - doing aoe dmg
Cryo - a minion doing big single target dmg

If they aren't summoners maybe they would be a big DoT dmg dealers, like burning or poisoning (maybe with the help of minions summoned ?)
Finally, this is the idea that it is the less likely to happen because geo already do this but maybe they would be better builders than geo characters with woods and plants, making bridge and all for exploration and doing some zones effects, element application or buff or debuff etc..

Anyway I absolutely can't wait to see the first Dendro character to discover what Dendro does, even more hype for the Dendro archon and his country (yes, I wrote a lot but Dendro is hyping me af)",1627776127

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt;  When you look at the hubble pictures of the multiple galaxies it can only leave you in awe and make you think what little we know of anything.  
  
I know right! There's so much we don't know, it's honestly mindblowing how big the universe is. So I understand that the multiverse theory is overwhelming, our current universe already is. Though to me the feeling of overwhelming fits with what I would expect from a Creator God, if I can _fully_ understand it, it's probably not the truth.  
  
And I am a Christian indeed, I would say up until 2 years ago, our ""histories"" were the same. Brought up in a Christian household, church every Sunday, and while I guess I believed, I had no evidence at all regarding the faith, so my faith wavered like the waves in the sea.  
  
&gt; How do you have faith with no actual evidence?  
  
So this is the thing, it's actually not without evidence. But there's this thing I realized, after years of trying to share my evidence with others. It's exactly how I write it, it's my evidence, and not anyone else's. And I've asked God why it is that evidence of His existence is so personal, and like you said, why He seems much more silent in the current days compared to the Biblical days.  
  
The answer so that question is that God is technically in a hands-off policy regarding the world. Look at it this way, when God placed Adam and Eve in the garden He laid down some ground rules. It doesn't matter why the rules were what they were, but it matters that God, who created man, created those rules for man. And then man, making use of their free will, broke the rules.  
  
What does this mean? At that junction, man decided that they know more than God, because surely the rule wasn't in their advantage. And so they decided to follow their own wisdom, instead of the wisdom of God. So what does God do, considering that man has free will? He hides His face from the world, and allows man the freedom to rule over themselves. (Along with the fallen spiritual beings/angels, who rule over men in the spiritual instead of God being the direct ruler).  
  
And that's the current age, where we are ruling over the earth, and God is not the direct ruler. Ruler-ship is deferred to the (fallen) angels, and to us. This is why God doesn't just show up in a grand way, with miracles etc., because that would usurp the rule that He allowed us to have over the world. According to the Bible, mankind has been given 6000 years to rule. (Think of this as based on God's calendar, not ours, so time runs differently). Every second of every minute of this time is meticulously recorded by God, as a record. A record of how man has fared ruling the earth without God. At the end of the 6000 years, we enter into the final 1000 years of the ""Ages of Sin"". In this period God rules directly on earth, in the form of Jesus Christ, who will reign from Jerusalem. According to Bible prophecy, true peace will cover the earth, people won't even dare to sin (except in their thoughts), because the presence of God will be everywhere, and mankind will know what it's like to be under the direct rulership of God. Again, this is meticulously recorded by God, as a record. It is during this period that almost all of mankind will believe and learn the ways of the true Love/God.  
  
_Afterwards_, there is the great judgement. And using the records, those who did not choose to believe, despite all the overwhelming evidence, will be condemned and sentenced to the 2nd death. Because at this point rebellion from God's law will be outlawed, because we will have 6000 years of evidence showing that rebellion leads to pain, death, poverty, despair and all forms of lack (the current world). And furthermore, there will be 1000 years of evidence that God brings remaining peace. And so at this point God, because He is not a tyrant who passes judgement without collecting evidence, can finally sentence those who rebel against Him to everlasting punishment, because then it is proven that all they do only leads to death.   
  
So that's why God came as a servant, and is only present through the Holy Spirit, whom is unseen. In this age He's not in the ""foreground"" so to speak. But the next time Jesus returns, He returns as a lion. Roaring into action, and all will see Him. And then most of His creation would believe.  
  
  
And to get back to the evidence thing, I'll explain to you how I got the evidence and was able to believe. I decided to take a very scientific look at it. If God exists, then He must be as is described in the Christian Bible. And what I started with is the definition ""God does not change"". So therefore He is a universal constant. Kind of like the gravitational constant, or the speed of light, etc. And how do we measure those? We consider what effect it would have on matter, and measure those. We know something like gravity exists, because if we drop an apple it falls. So I started looking in the Bible for descriptions of the constant God that I could test.  
  
And then you start testing these theories in _faith_. Not giving up for a long while, because many experiments go on for years until the results are found. Honestly God shows up super quick, because He's always looking for those who are looking. The best thing you can do is start praying for everything. And write them down so you don't forget. Literally everything you can think of, especially things you have no influence over, but are giving you any form of anxiety or stress. Pray once, write it down, and wait and see. For me it started with not being able to wake up in the morning on time. I prayed that I would wake up before my alarm. I swear since that time I would wake up before my alarm clock goes off. Sometimes because of some random sound, most of the times because I would have to pee, etc. But the prayer was answered, and I realized there's something. After that I started asking for parking spots whenever I would go to the city to do groceries. Lo-and-behold there would always be parking spots. I did have to really train my mind not to go into disbelief though, so I had post-its here and there to remind myself to remain in faith. I remember once I went to the city, and could not find a parking spot. So I started talking to God out loud in the car, asking where's my spot? I swear at that moment this man came RUNNING, crossed the street waving at me to HOLD ON HOLD ON, as he ran to his car, jumped in and drove off. So I drove into His parking spot. Forgot to pay that day though, and got a fine. But I did get a parking spot :D  
  
But these are all very personal, and things that only I would notice. But there were more than enough to make me realize wow, there is a God, and He listens. And He controls _everything_ in some unseen way. And with these small evidences, I continued to believe, for greater and more daring things. And God has always been faithful to deliver. I can tell you so many other crazy things, but the post is getting long and again, it's all my evidence, but if you're curious I can tell you. This past covid year has been the best year of my life, and I lost literally everything I formerly held dear. But it's been AMAZING.   
  
&gt;  I question everything all the time but so far in my life  
  
This is the most important thing, just remain open for new things, the moment we think we understand everything, we're reached a perilous point in life. Question all the things, especially if it's popular in the world.

1. Carly and Jack were closer in the Dark signer arc than Yusei and Izayoi and but jack‚Äòs feelings were rewritten in the following arcs which proves that 5D‚Äòs neglected the romance theme by replacing it with comedy by making 3 woman fight over Jack. 

2. Romance never was a priority of Yusei like it wasn‚Äòt for bearly every yugioh series. Yusei fought the dark signers, prepared for the WRGP, was traumatized by Placido, fought paradox, helped kiryu, attended the wrgp, fought yilaster in the arc cradle arc and spent years to make sure that the momentum won‚Äòt run berserk. 

3. There isn‚Äòt a single interaction between those two which shows any romantic feelings of Yusei towards izayoi which makes it hard to realistically judge how yusei would react if izayoi would open up about her feelings. They even had the ""date"" episode where we git no hint that susei feels anything regarding avtual love towards izayoi. Prove that there are moments. otherwise this discussion leads nowhere because Iam seeing no input from your side.

"CoronaVirusPA","t5_2fu0lz","Thanks for the source. I will defer to a higher comment concerning the maths in demonstrating how a CFR of that percentage can be worse than a flu. There are compounding factors you have to take in. As repeated towards you multiple times, death is not the only thing to be worried about. But thats with all disease and viruses, failing to take that into consideration is ignorant. So if you have a virus that now has an r0 value that is possibly higher than chickenpox, one that can leave lasting various health issues, it is best to take mitigative action. 

The carefree attitude you constantly go on with, which really comes off as self centered brashness is what is so off putting about your comments. Its not liberating to read your posts, there is no aha moments of revelation. The fact that you‚Äôre so focused on CFR really exposes your narrow view.",1627776131

Since xingqiu will only be able to proc vaporize every other hit with her then it may be a case of xingqius swords getting the damage multiplier, although having kokomi and xingqiu could potentially help with that depending on how kokomis skill ends up playing. Obviously if the enemy is innately cryo/electro/hydro this is more or less invalid, with pyro enemies being immune to her (but not kokomi and xingqiu). I do think a ""firework comp"" with her spamming multiple reactions would be very good with her of course, but I see the appeal behind a double electro since that will give her more energy to resonate with the set (although electro traveler and baal both massively help with energy Regen support so it may not be needed)",1627776131

The weird thing is I was never anxious about getting covid like I saw people (outside masked and got tested when I could and when it became more available) but it made me SUPER aware of my health and everything. I got a lot worse in terms of my health anxiety this past year. It started in October when I was convinced I had lymphoma and I just couldn‚Äôt get over it because I had nothing going on and couldn‚Äôt see that many people. The emphasis on maintaining good health this past year has really triggered me for whatever reason and I can‚Äôt get past it! If you can see people outside with masks I would recommend that just so you can feel somewhat normal!! Also get tested and keep your circle very small. Graduating is so hard especially during a pandemic, I graduated from high school last year and feel you to a certain degree. It‚Äôs very hard to see others having a good time or going back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when you‚Äôre not able to, and I‚Äôve experienced it too because I lived with my grandparents, but it‚Äôs also difficult because you don‚Äôt wanna get to ur family sick. It‚Äôs a shit situation to be in and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre still in it. It‚Äôs going to get better. You can try to FaceTime people and see a few from time to time. It‚Äôs going to end at some point this is temporary. It‚Äôs incredibly kind to want to be careful for your dad because there are A LOT of people who wouldn‚Äôt do that so good for you for being selfless!!!!

One question I had went like this‚Ä¶a drug was being given to multiple patients and it asked which patient symptoms would make you question giving out that drug. I had never heard of the drug before. There were like three immunocompromised patients, and three patients experiencing some type of bleeding. After I read the question like the fifth time, I recognized that it said it was being given to multiple patients, so I thought it was most likely a lovenox type drug which made me then choose the patients who were bleeding. Almost guessed and chose the immunocompromised patients. Im not sure If I was right but I would put money on it that I was. You have to answer a lot of questions like that. Also, its super easy to misread the question and even the answers. I almost thought atropine slowed the hr, not raised it. So I would have gotten the ekg rhythm question wrong if I hadnt stopped to think about the drug again.",1627776132

I‚Äôve literally never seen rabbit droppings in our yard until now. I snatched her up and went straight inside. 

I‚Äôm so happy to see her coming back though! I gave her a little wash today (just washed her paws and bum, she has a fluffy but so it gets messy), and she totally got the first zoomies I‚Äôve ever witnessed her do! I am so glad she‚Äôs feeling better!!

PC with aim bots and wall hacks , even when most of the ban activity is on PC but still there is too many hackers .
Alot of high rank players are cheaters , more of them been cheating since season one , #1pred just got banned after 9 seasons .
Dude was flexing on Twitter just the day before yesterday and he brought attention to him self otherwise he could keep doing that with no one to stop him.
This need to stop , the game is almost unplayable,pubs and ranked ....they are everywhere
Plus , there are a lot of bugs not fixed yet , broken audio still there since ever , SOME of us unable to quickly exit deathbox after looting , stuttering on console started to happen after the most recent update ,broken SBMM which make no sense whatsoever and the list go on .
Maybe if we do this just for few days and season 10 launch is the perfect timing when the impact with be the highest , let streamers stream for ttem selfs with no one watching , let Respawn suffer an unusual drop in income maybe that will push them to act",1627776136

Not sure about the RMS - could you explain to an idiot like me? Normally I run it like you mentioned - as much power before flooding, but I was hitting 90%, so I went to read up to make sure I was doing it right. In the Compleat Distiller they use a similar rig for their examples for fractioning and compound stills - 2"", 100cm, 1kW - and they advise that once the still is boiling, power down to a gentle simmer to provide an even flow of vapour.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","I‚Äôve got Brown and Rochester and Dartmouth on my list. I think I‚Äôm very self-doubting for those programs due to low research totals. This isn‚Äôt necessarily accurate, but I always think of top programs as requiring strong research involvement. It‚Äôs just never been my calling compared to clinical work, community service, and didactic opportunities. I was also the student commencement speaker from a graduating class of 3,500 and was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, which I know could distinguish me.

"GreekMythology","t5_2tm3w","Yeah it‚Äôs part of Athens‚Äô founding myth. Hephaestus attempts to rape Athena but is unsuccessful. However his semen ends up on her thigh. She wipes it off her and it falls to the earth, impregnating Gaia who ends up giving birth to Erichthonius (i think that‚Äôs the name) who is raised by Athena and becomes a legendary King of Athens. 

The story gets pretty funny later on. She raised him in secret, putting him in a box and giving the box to the three daughters of Cecrops, the King of Athens at the time and another legendary Athenian king, and she tells them not to open it. Two of the sisters are too curious and they open it up, releasing crows who went to inform Athena. At the time Athena went to grab a mountain (yeah) and was bringing it to Athens to use the rock for the acropolis buildings but the crows told her on the way and she got enraged, accidentally dropping the mountain which created Mt. Lykabettos. The two sisters who saw Erichthonius in the box were freaked out bc he was half man half snake, and so they ran away and tossed themselves off of the Acropolis to their deaths.",1627776138

"imaginaryelections","t5_aaoez","Biden's first term as president was complicated.  Although he had beaten Donald Trump in the 2020 election, many within his own party were dissatisfied with Biden's track record as a moderate Democrat, and the Republicans, steeping themselves deeper into Trumpist policy and rhetoric, did everything they could to keep Biden from achieving any greater change in the United States.

However, this situation was not going to last for long.  By November of 2021, he signed an executive order cancelling Federal student loan debt, managed to get Congress to agree on a 3.5-trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, expanded Medicare and Medicaid, and pulled all American military presence out of Afghanistan.  This period of time in Biden's presidency would make him very popular not only with moderate Democrats but also with progressives and social democrats; though it wasn't any Nordic model of governance, and although he had made some concessions to the progressives, Biden had managed to appease both sides of his party relatively well.

For the Republicans, however, things were utter chaos.  With a Democratic victory in the 2022 midterms, gaining 18 seats in the House of Representatives and 3 seats in the Senate, the Republican party was getting desperate.  Donald Trump, controversial former U.S. president and loser of the 2020 election against the incumbent president, made his return to politics by the time the 2024 campaign season was beginning.  Trump's only competition was with the moderate Republicans and center-right politicians in a clique led by Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney.  However, despite this, Trump still won the 2024 Republican nomination in a highly-contested vote, choosing Marjorie Taylor Greene as his running mate.

After the nomination, Liz Cheney expressed her complete disappointment with the Republican Party in a televised statement, and soon after registered her own moderate-conservative party, aptly named the Moderate Republican Party, and began running for president with Mitt Romney as her running mate.  The Moderate Republican Party gained widespread popularity compared to other third parties, as many within the Republican Party were left unhappy with another Trump nomination.  This split the conservative vote in half by the 2024 election.

The 2024 election was a landslide victory for the Democrats and Joe Biden.  Winning 372 electoral votes, they flipped Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, and Florida to the Democratic side, with close Democratic defeats in Texas, Montana, Alaska, Indiana, Missouri, Wyoming, and Nebraska.  This would be Trump's worst election result in history, and it would be the last time he would run for president for any party.  The Moderate Republicans, despite their relatively-high voter numbers for a third party, only managed to win Utah by a landslide and Kentucky and Tennessee in very close votes between the Republicans and the Moderate Republicans.

This election would be the start of the Seventh Party System.",1627776140
"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","I've never understood this.  How does it take 2.5 hours to run two combats?  Maybe my players are the exception but even a ""complex"" turn doesn't take any more than a minute or two at most.

A wizard that throws a bonus action crown of stars, action casts chain lightning, and moves across ice that requires an athletics check should take no more than a minute if he knew approximately what he was going to do on his turn, most of which is adding up damage dice for high level spells.  Are people rolling separate damage for each creature in a multi target spell?

A paladin that whiffs his two attacks will take all of 10 seconds on the opposite end of the scale.

With the average combat being 3 to 4 rounds how are people having combats that last so long? 20 to 25 minutes for a combat is more in line with my experiences.  

Now if groups are having 1 or 2 massive combat in a day that lasts 7 or 8 rounds and the dm needs 10 minutes a round then yeah, 2.5 hours sounds about right.  That's not following an adventuring day though, so expecting each combat in an attrition based adventuring day to take the same amount of time as the 5 minute adventuring day would be silly.",1627776140

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;it‚Äôs just a reskin of the transphobic ‚Äúyou can only be male or female based on your genitalia! with race and genetics instead of gender and chromosomes.

How so? I never mentioned anything about only being male or female based on genitalia. All I said was that your gender is not contingent on the gender of your ancestors, which is how it is for race, ethnicity, or nationality. I also never said anything about ""race"" being biologically real, which leads to my next point...

&gt;It‚Äôs holding up biological reality as a be-all-end-all

No, it isn't. I don't think ""race"" is really fundamentally biological - it is fundamentally based in cultural and sociological contexts. However, this doesn't change the fact that one's race or nationality is contingent on that of their ancestors - this is how race/nationality is literally defined. Nothing to do with biology or genetics at all, since at the genetic level ""race"" is meaningless.

&gt;I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm 100% in the ‚Äútransracialism is real‚Äù camp, but I‚Äôm not really sure why we draw such a hard line.  


""Transracialism"" is definitely harmful to society in a sense that it allows people to falsely insert themselves in a historical context that they could never actually be a part of. This is why so many people had a problem with Rachael Dolezal, a white woman who pretended to be black. Since she is from a white family, there was no way for her to know the actual experiences of the race that she is claiming to be.

Again, this isn't the same for being transgender, because gender is not contingent on the genders of the ancestors. You *could* make the argument that trans women in particular are wrongly inserting themselves in the historical contexts of cis women (as many TERFs do), but this argument falls flat because it ignores that being trans in itself is a unique historical context that does not impede on the historical context of other gender identities - unlike how a white person ""identifying"" as black impedes on the historical context of being black.",1627776140

"crowfall","t5_35qsx","Yeah but remember the absolute uproar that happened when New World introduced the cash shop for example. No one can deny that the backlash was very swift, very public and very painful, causing a lot of potential damage to New World. 

Amazon handled it like a boss and went to great lengths to clarify their position and tone down the Cash shop push. Will it be forever? Maybe not - but if you actually look through the years of alpha and beta you will see monumental adjustments according to critical and vocal player feedback, including to the core premise of the game!

To me, it demonstrates the importance of holding developers to the coals. And of not being afraid to point to the weaknesses not only in the game but the developer's intentions. 

I have no problem with paid content creators - so long as it's open and honest. Every one of those streamers is perfectly capable of calling dogshit if they see an aspect of the game they don't like. And goddam Amazon will be quick to respond and consider and adjust it. 

Nontheless - yes they're paid - Take it with a pinch of salt. But  I absolutely resent false flag reviews and the appearance of independence where there is none. If a creator is in someone's pocket they should say so because quite frankly there aren't enough critical voices remaining regarding Crowfall and Artcraft as far as I am concerned. They have pushed away most of their backers and the vast majority of the original community by ignoring feedback and pushing distasteful aspects of their game. Now they use &lt;400 sub weenies with 5000 hours in Crowfall and 50 in New World to do ""fair comparisons."" What the f*cking f*ck.

Where is the conversation about: 

- The graveyard that is the dead player base 2 weeks after launch. Compare to New World Beta.

- VIP is a disgrace for a fully priced indy game. 

- Their greedy monetization model around EKs (followed by reducing them to part-time vanity farms) is abhorrent to me.


- Their complete stubborn obstinancy over the years regarding the GUI, the main gameplay loops, the dead world and the absence of meaningful lore or game content other than ""create your own stories cos we're not bothered"".


- The reduction of original Kickstarter elements (Destructible world anyone?) to simple tellytubbies-level capture-the-fort play loops.

Yet I don't see that criticism out there. I don't see artcraft held to the same standards as Amazon or Blizzard or Soulbound Studios or Portalarium. I  don't see enough objective reviews. Just these shills. And the mocking community putdowns of the few articles that start addressing the real issues, like the Angry Peon review, which hit the nail so absolutely on the head which speaks a single pure truth: *If you can't find the fun it was never there.*",1627776140

"TheoriesOfEverything","t5_2suxc","&gt; He's a very respected, serious, down-to-earth researcher that has done so for decades... do you mean to say all his sources (which have remained consistent) are all wrong?

If he is saying aliens are visiting this planet and have been for centuries then yes he is wrong.

&gt;Australian Intelligence report, both believe that the source ARE extraterrestrials,

The australian report is not making that assertion.

&gt;It seems weird to me that you seem to be ignoring evidence from multiple credible people who have high clearance or a good reputation - they all say UFOs -&gt; Aliens quite unambiguously.

If they are saying that (and I doubt they are saying it unconditionally) they are no longer credible.

&gt;The speed of light and every other obstacle you pose ARE UNIMPORTANT, for we are not figuring HOW nor WHEN they came, neither HOW LONG they took.

If they are claiming aliens are here then they absolutely must explain how they got here and these things are very important.

&gt;if you can't figure how these obstacles can be overcome, then it's impossible to anyone else in the whole universe? T

The speed of light is a law of physics. You can't ""figure out"" how to break it. 

&gt;And basically no one AT ALL believes all the 140 cases were new US. advanced aircraft. In fact, and I repeat, THEY HAVE SPOKEN IN THE RECORD THAT NONE OF THOSE CASES ARE.

how would they know?

&gt;You can, of course, keep holding to your biased hipothesis based on absolutely nothing and no one, but drop the fake assumption or self-delusion you are being the most scientifical and based on evidence.

you have no evidence that proves these are aliens. Some of the documents you listed (I didn't read all of them) don't even make a positive claim they are aliens.

&gt; few Lifetimes of Research which all seem to check out in the very specific point that UFOs -&gt; Aliens is a number infinitely higher than the evidence you presented to back up your theory, which is 0.

I make no claim. I have no burden of proof. You are making a claim that aliens are visiting the earth. I don't believe you, you haven't provided sufficient evidence to convince me.

&gt;Everyone that has taken the time to study this topic seriously have all arrived at the same conclusion, 

False. There are millions of people who have studied this and have not concluded the same thing.

&gt; when it is proven it was the U.S. government who has lied, time and time again.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to live in the countryside, in a small neighborhood with 11 houses. Mostly old people, the only ones below 60 years old were me and my family.

For a few months, black cats were found about once every two weeks on the side of the road in the morning, beheaded and dismembered (only the body was left, parts that were cut had been taken away). Those cats did not belong to anyone in my neighborhood, nor anyone else from the town that was a mile away or the other towns nearby. At least, no black cats were reported missing during that time in the area.

One day another black cat was found, this time with a note attached to its remains. The note said approximately this : ""This is enough. Thomas will be satisfied. I shall not return.""

I've left years ago, but as far as I know to this day no one has any clue about who did it, why they did it, where the cats came from, what that note meant, who Thomas was...",1627776141

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'm not the person you replied to, just fyi. But I think the existence of a deadly weapon in the vicinity of your home has the effect of being a potential danger. What if your kid gets ahold of your gun and accidentally shoots my dog? What if you happen to be unstable and randomly decide to murder my family? Every gun owned by every gun owner may not directly effect everyone, but neither does every car owned by every driver directly affect everyone. People still need to get licenced to drive and register their cars because they are potentially deadly weapons. Owning a gun may not ever directly affect your neighbor, but it affects the relative level of danger in the area in which they live.

&gt; You don't even know what i have. You didn't even technically know i have them cause we're only talking as strangers on the internet.

Ignorance does not negate the effect of something. Not knowing about toxic material in your water doesn't cause it to not affect you.",1627776141

1) As a way to deny filtering. The ability to deny the opponent the ability to scry or similar. 

2) As a way to turn on abilities. Look at rogues, they use mill to enable abilities, same as threshold or dredge. 

3) As a way to gain value from graveyard effects. You mill yourself or an opponent to gain the ability to use the graveyard for your advantage, reanimation, etc. 

4) To mill out the opponent and win. 

If your trying to do #4 you have to remember. You either mill them or you don't. There is no almost, you either do it or not.

- you would discriminate based upon disabilities and appearances

- your inclusion of family is conditional upon meeting your standards and not unconditional love

- you lack self-awareness of how incredibly wrong you are

The aunt was obviously confused and was like ‚Äòbut your trip isn‚Äôt for 4 years‚Äô and apparently the niece was under the impression it was one per year as it had been and not a graduation trip. There were also some other details such as the cost of the trip and parents kicking up a fuss but I don‚Äôt remember exactly what they were. 

Pretty sure the judgement for not taking her then and waiting until she graduated was mostly NTA as people agreed her parents should‚Äôve made it clearer what the trip was. I can‚Äôt find the link but would appreciate if anyone else could find it (or correct the details, these are only best as memory serves and this was a while ago).",1627776143

This person has sinned against you. They are the ones needing of repenting, what you need is healing. That‚Äôs the black spot you speak of. It‚Äôs not evil within you, but evil that has been done to you that has been left as an open wound for too long.  

None of this is your fault and you must speak about it. More than that, you need to ask God for healing. He‚Äôs the only one you can help. I know you must think he‚Äôs forgotten about you because of what happened but that‚Äôs also a lie from the enemy. People sin because they don‚Äôt listen to God calling to them. 

I don‚Äôt know you but I feel deeply for you and I know that God loves you very much. I‚Äôll pray that you‚Äôll find healing and someone to confide to. That God will make you feel his love and peace.",1627776143

I guess basic combos technically are cancels, just sounds weird to me. Most characters can combo with a special move out of light P/K or medium P/K. You can test it in training. For me, I always start the move on my controller right before the normal hits. Seems to work well. So let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre playing with Guile, as you‚Äôre holding back, after you hit the medium punch button to throw a medium punch, you immediately move forward on the pad/stick and hit medium again to throw a sonic boom. This gets the special out right after the normal lands. You‚Äôll get the feel of it with practice. Same thing with Ryu, hit medium punch than immediately down forward and medium punch to combo from the medium punch into a fireball. You‚Äôll find it‚Äôs much easier to combo from  squat position vs standing.",1627776143

How would it cost ""6 digits"" to reject on probation? Have you gone through this and your HR is really insistent on a lot of paperwork and evidence? Otherwise what's needed is minimal. I had everything just through my normal management.

How many people do you hire a year and why are you letting go 15%? I'm not sure if you're hiring a hundred people a year or if you're hiring process isn't working, or both... 15% rejection seems very high.

What a special type of wine and honestly kind of a secret, especially in the US. Don‚Äôt buy Tokaji people, it‚Äôs fucking terrible! 

Just kidding. It‚Äôs delicious. 

Nose is deep, thick, you can really sense the sweetness. Candied lemon, caramel, honey. So much honey - like straight nectar. A dab of stone fruit - maybe white peach? Very light but something else is here.

Body is so viscous and full but the acidity is so sharp and this is what completes the wine. Can just feel it on the front of your teeth. More honey, citrus. Slightly nutty and some toffee vibes. 

Finish is oh so long with more candied lemon, stone fruit - peach or apricot definitely - and caramel. This one lasts a *long* time in your mouth.

Really, really, really good. IMO Tokaji is a bit of a secret especially in the US. Not something to drink frequently",1627776145

Then there's fricking Legate Fasendil, an Altlmer in the Imperial Legion who also hates the Thalmor, and he even mentions that altmer disidents exist.

So I don't see why the player wouldn't be able to play a Khajiit and join the Empire in the Civil War.

Counter point: A low bonus should not be used to prevent a player from participating.
There's a limited power budget and everyone has to choose between combat, utility, and social. 

You do actually go on to talk about how to mitigate this, here:

&gt; What each person values changes differently, so I've looked at Charisma + Athletics (Mercenary Captain), Strength + Intimidation (Gang Muscle), Charisma + Religion (Chosen Hero), and Wisdom + Performance (Monk with disciplined form).

Essentially, providing opportunities for every player to get involved with the RP. Which can be paired with calling out specific PCs to give the hint that this NPC is looking at something different. I would, however, reserve having an NPC reject a PCs attempt at communication for when you're trying to put the spotlight on a particular PC (perhaps because they haven't had a recent opportunity to RP.)",1627776147

About 14 i learned i was circumcised and During my late teen years, i had lost most sensation. I remember having a very intense orgasm when i was very young, around 9. Nothing has ever come close to that feeling. And i am unable to satiate my that need that you get from cummming. I never feel like i am done. . . Like i cannot reach that nice feeling that should be there. Also. I was very tight when i was younger with not much skin. I found the way i masterbating encouraged skin growth. Also when i was 19. I found out that i have two piercings in my dick as a result of the circumcsion. From when they used safety pins in the procedure. Circumcision was very common in the area of australia i live in.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","&gt;Not really, there are all sorts of issues that an appraiser can identify that wouldn't bother a resident.  
Only borrowing 40% doesn't make much sense, you're better off borrowing 80% or as much as you can at whatever interest rate you're getting at 40%. You're still paying the same application, appraisal, etc fees either way.

You are saying that an appraiser might discover an issue with the property that is so serious that the lender would refuse to approve a mortgage, but it would not be something that an owner would be troubled by? This is actually something that you've experienced? 

How can you offer financial advice like that without more information? There are so many good reasons why we wouldn't want such a large mortgage.",1627776148

"Jungle_Mains","t5_3ii1w","Back when a Rioter posted data about the champions who take the longest to master, Taliyah was in the top 10 'mathematically hardest' champions with a 50 game sample size (Nidalee was mentioned as taking over 100 games to hit a 50% average winrate). I'd imagine that they're still the two highest skillcap AP junglers, as Lillia is the only release since and now has a winrate that gets lower the higher the elo - she's skillshot reliant, but nowhere near as punishing or potentially rewarding as the other two. Karthus deserves a mention - he's a super simple champion, but his Q can do an insane amount of damage if he has scripter-level accuracy.

All of Taliyah's abilities are skillshots, and she has to constantly kite to do maximum DPS. Her Q can be individually landed 5 times while moving, her W is horrendously difficult to land (and is a vector skillshot) and she's too squishy to avoid being punished for bad positioning.

Nidalee's two forms give her an insane amount of skill expression and a much more complicated clear. If you ever see your jungler getting executed on their first clear, they're probably playing Nidalee. Her Q is one of the hardest skillshots to consistently land in the game and has a giant potential range, while her mobility/resets on W give her a ton of outplay potential.

For AD junglers, I'd say the highest skillcap champion is Lee Sin. His kit is one of the most versatile in the game, and he has an enormous variety of ways to approach each fight. His multiple dashes and ult let him make extremely unpredictable plays to kill carries in a larger fight, and he also has huge peeling potential. Playing Lee Sin well means doing a ton of tower dives and maximising early pressure, which is much harder than powerfarming/scaling.

Kindred also has a very high skillcap due to her being a kiting ADC with a dash on a very low cooldown - she's significantly higher APM than most junglers. Like other ranged junglers, she's very squishy and requires much better positioning, but she can potentially 1v5 if played perfectly.

As for skill floor, I'd argue that Rek'Sai is one of the hardest champions in the game to pick up. She's early game focused and falls behind incredibly easily, her burst damage combo is genuinely difficult to initially learn and tremor sense is hard to get value from. She's like Azir and Kalista - extremely hard to win games with without practise.",1627776149

It‚Äôs worthwhile to be curious about how the desire to be likable or entertaining or interesting influences how you think and act - and then, ask yourself two things.  Thing one, do those changes actually help you towards your goal?  And thing two, are you being your true self in those moments?

Take me for example :) When I go to a social event where there will be impressive or highly intellectual people, I will use words that have a lot of syllables ‚Ä¶ because I want to sound smart. This might help me in some ways, but my true self doesn‚Äôt tend to use words with a lot of syllables. I constantly feel on edge because I am performing, trying to be a different version of myself. When I am able to accept that not everyone will be able to truly appreciate me for who I am, and I am not going to connect with every person on the planet, I can give myself some space to relax and just try to be me. This also helps me have relationships that are right for me, rather than write for the version of me I try to put off.",1627776149

Then I googled ‚Äúwhitest county in Mississippi because I know that racial disparity was one of your points. Found a county 91% white. 

Itawamba county is 27.8% vaccinated.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","OK, the reason for the hate towards him is simple, and not even that surprising. The Q idiots shared a fake flight log from Jeffery Epstein's plane. One of the names on this fake list was Tom Hanks. Again, this is not the real flight log, and it's also pretty obvious that it's not. But we all know how easily fooled the Q people are. So they made up and shared that Tom is a pedo. There is no evidence that he even knew Epstein, let alone hung out with him. The Greece thing comes into play because Tom' s wife is a Greek citizen, both of her parents are Greek. For a very long time the Hanks have gone to Greece to live for part of the year. But the Qdiots have decided that he fled American to Greece because he has charges against him in the US for being a pedo and Greece doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US. Obviously the biggest flaw in this belief is the fact that Greece does, in fact, have an extradition treaty with the US. Another huge flaw in it is that the Hanks still live in the US for about half a year each year, just like they have for over a decade. Forgot to mention, Tom Hanks is also a Greek citizen, as he was awarded citizenship due to his help fighting wildfires in Greece. Anyway, the point is, the only people hating on Tom Hanks are the Q dumbasses because they made up some bullshit about him, most everyone else loves the guy.",1627776152

Tried to cover and keep them as dry as possible, but 2 of the 3 formed p.m. on their lower leaves. Not alot, but close enough to bud sites that I was a bit worried. Trimed off infected leaves and I started spraying with a 10:1 ratio every night and morning. I gave them a real healthy drenching when spraying. By day 3 there were no signs of p.m. anymore. I'm on day 60 now, and still going good. No problems at all from the peroxide/water.",1627776153

Let's say you make a very thin long planter like you said, that takes a surface area of 3 square feet. You are putting 80 lbs of soil in it, which means you will be spreading (equal depth everywhere) the 80 lbs (1 cubic ft) of soil over 3 square ft. This is equivalent of 26.67 lbs/square ft.

"Higurashinonakakoroni","t5_2vjs4","She *couldn't* prevent her friends from killing each other, even though she tried.

It's still bothers me that they never shown or told about her first loops. We are shown Rika in her last loops.

But we've seen Satoko's first loops and... it doesn't change anything at all. She just acts like a brat for no reason and kills Rika, and causing a lot of trouble for her friends in those worlds.

All she need it either give up on Rika, or start study(you know, the thing she was doing to get into St. Lucia in the first place), and to accept Rika's help.

But nah, screw this, Rika is bad even though **I** declined her offer to help, and it was **me** who said ""I don't need your help Rika. Get off"", but it's Rika to blame.

&amp;#x200B;

And also there's no way Rika and Satoko just forget about each other for a few years(or was it a year?) of studying. I mean, they're *very* close to each other. It's not like you stop communicating with your friend, when you're both get into the same university\\school. But it was done like this just for a plot to happens, just to force drama. Imo they should've spent more time on this period of time instead of retelling Oni-\\Wata-\\Tatari- worlds.

Saying that ""Satoko is far from irredeemable"" is a lot of stretching. She already a cold-hearted murderer, who made Mion go L5 just for ""fun"", and a psycho who killing her friends because it's **fun**(and it's info from Ryukishi. And no, he wasn't in ""USODA"" t-shirt this time, so it *is* true). She already killed more people than Takano overall(and mind you, Takano was killing complete strangers, and Takano in each world is a different Takano, while Satoko is the same).

To make an analogy, would you defend a genocider(or any mass-murderer) just because ""he's a looper, so all those deaths doesn't matter. Even though the worlds will *continue* to exist even after he dies""?

Mind you, she *knows* that the world will continue to exist, and that she killing her friends who did a lot to help and save her. I might've understand if she did something to Shion(because Watanagashi\\Meakashi), hence even if her reason to ""torture"" Rika was because ""Rika didn't try to help Nii-nii""(and it would've been at least a bit believable). But she did it to Rena and Mion, just for ""fun""...

&amp;#x200B;

Or at the very least, Satoko should've said ""Hey, Rika, I knew you're a looper. Now I'm a looper too, and we shouldn't go to St. Lucia because it's a shitty place"" instead of ""NOOOO DON'T GO THERE!!!!!"" and jumping to the truck-kun lmao",1627776156

"Velo","t5_2s4ji","I do mostly combined gravel and tarmac tours in the mountains.

Gravel bikes are heavy.  You will only need one if the road is mostly rocks.  I mean real rocks.  Not gravel.  It will handle like a boat.  The wheelbase is long.  The head tube angle is shallower.

An all-road/cyclocross bike is much lighter and faster, as long as the road is mostly dirt/gravel.  Most can handle up to 33mm, which I think is the official cyclocross tire limit.  I would consider 33-35mm to be the sweet spot for these kind of rides.  Can roll over the rough stuff without rattling your teeth out, but still fast on the tarmac.  It will also handle better and be quicker on the tarmac than a gravel bike.  It will be twitchier on gravel descents, but that just means you have to learn how to ride better  :-)

For wheels I would recommend cheap (but not the very cheapest) shallow section aluminum wheels.  ASTM 2.  Some radial flex is actually a good thing, and they will not catch the wind from the side on fast descents and blow you off the mountain.  They are also super light.  Oh, and relatively cheap.  You can destroy them and not feel bad.  I use DT Swiss.  Those things are indestructible.

On gravel climbs you want to stay seated, pretty much always.  Cadence does not really matter.   For me that gear ratio would be too hard.  I use 1x.  38 x 10-42.  avg grades can be around 12% here once you get onto the gravel.",1627776157

The Delta variant got through, but with Australia's track record, it's likely to fizzle out almost immediately. This is why quarantines work. Even if an infection occurs, it's easy to isolate and contain because there are so few of them. And if the whole world had been following a similar strategy from the beginning, it would be significantly less likely for these isolated breakouts to happen in the first place, because there would be fewer global cases to begin with.

Full containment at the border is virtually impossible, but it's also unnecessary. Almost full containment at that stage is enough to enable full containment at later stages.",1627776157

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","Ignore any advice telling you not to tell your insurer. It's as simple as calling and telling them what you are planning to have done. They can then advise any changes to your policy and cost differential then it's up to you to decide whether to proceed with the work. Your policy is based on the manufacturers specification including performance. If you increase the performance of the vehicle the risk profile may change. Failure to inform of this change could invalidate the policy in the event of a claim and lead you open to legal action from any third party insurance that would normally be covered by your own insurance. It's not worth the risk or hassle particularly for something visual on the car that is easily spotted when your vehicle goes to the assessor for any damage claim. In many cases if you want to improve the performance of the vehicle it is better to just trade up to a higher model that comes with better performance (where possible) as you then don't have the hassle of having to explain the modifications to every new insurer when you want to move around. You will also find it very difficult to obtain online quotes for modified vehicles unless it's a specialised insurer, you will also be massively shrinking the number of insurers available to you and shopping around each year will become a time drain phoning insurer after insurer to explain.",1627776158

I think it is worth the price tag but it wont endure like the developers hope it will.

We were waiting for this decision before opening a LISA, and we only did that because we expect to buy a house in the next year or so as we cannot rule out moving again in the future (who knows?). LISA is not the best option to be used as a pension (although it can definitely help).

I personally wouldn't open a LISA unless you at least expect to buy a house with it (if it's your first property). Otherwise, it's money you cannot take out before you're 55 (not without losing 6.25% of whatever you put in), and if you move abroad you cannot keep contributing to it, meaning it's money locked up for a while without maturing much.",1627776158

Business is not just a simple as free market blah blah blah and lots of factors that go into it location benefits vacation how crappy the bosses are just lots of factorsÔøº.  Classic example here is actually oil workers people who work on an oil rig make large amounts of money but they except a lot of risk and it‚Äôs in the middle of nowhere. that industry has had a worker shortage even though those factors prevail.

But after closing those app to hibernation and setting a few permissions to only when using the app. He was able get another 20% got himself optimized back to 96% (I guessing some had 14.4% and 20.6% otherwise be 95%) and could got to 100% but has few apps need either Bluetooth or GPS on all time (one mobile profomance monitor just takes random cell strength speed etc. Month uses less then 50mb data/wifi and 1% battery &gt;.0% since last charge and charge at most daily)

That should get you to much closer to what you had before never be what was when had first week or so unless factory reset and only install certain apps.

You can also as I have set a bixby routine so when your screen is off lock screen phone goes in powersaver mode and when unlocked  powersaver mode turned off.

And to give you a bit help with it you first set it up when you say 
: ""hey bixby, lock screen phone ""
When screen is on screen locked 
Then bixby will enable powersaver mode

2nd command just change to ( unlocked instead of lock screen and Then when screen turns on it will disable powersaver mode) 

Save it then go in and edit it and remove the having to say it command now you will have go into bixby and turn on command (and if phone dies powered off do again) Also need 2 commands one turn off on turn on or you can make routine more complicated so when phone unlocked it turns off powersaver but it's tricky.

The whole thing cane from a routine should be able to look up hey bixby I being pulled over (it can start recording with screen black video audio ect, and there was one for going to  Demonstration since Washington state was putting mini blimps up that were fake cell towers and monitoring the protesters and could even track back where they went afterwards till few miles out of range. But ever since I made routine and still sometimes I have say bixby lock screen but bixby works well through buds live and can do what want so easy plus easy way unlock if make bud a trusted device then its easy as can be.",1627776159

That uneasy feeling is the fact that you know you should do better, don't listen to these people screaming fuck other people because their excuse is just that, lame. 

P.S.

You don't need to dress up to look good for anyone, just make sure is something that is both comfortable and representable, that is call selflove and discipline.

Now if you are going to a more upscale place then you dress accordingly to the occasion. This is not a cultural norm or reform is just you being your best you.

The mats cost around 190k on my server atm and some ppl were like 180k each so itll sell. Its made it so I wont even bother making them unless someone brings me the mats.

The wow token imo is for things exactly like this. They dont want to put in the time so theyll just pay for it. Its a sad truth but its not new. players have always bought gold, this is just a safe way to do it through blizz.

My wife likes me to fuck other women, but with COVID and all that we haven't had the opportunity to do it for a long time. We're still quite cautious, so it doesn't look like it's on the horizon either, with Delta sweeping about. My wife has gone to bed early, and I thought it might be fun to find someone to share a roleplay with, maybe swap a few pics, so that I could show my wife the Kik exchange in the morning as a little Sunday morning surprise! My wife loves the idea of me actually cheating on her, rather than an arranged hookup (how we've always done it before), so she might enjoy the roleplay aspect of it as well as the sex aspect as well. So if you fancy playing out something along the lines of a cheating/infidelity roleplay, getting each other off and having a nice time, knowing that my wife will undoubtedly be getting off to our Kik transcript in the morning, I'm jjconstant on Kik!

The last time we had a gov't shutdown over the debt ceiling, people I knew in the community who worked for the gov't were struggling to get food stamps and shit just to survive while the issue dragged on for longer than it usually does. They weren't getting paid once the deadline had passed, they were furloughed. Some of them required to continue doing their job WITHOUT pay and hoping they would be paid back for it in the future. This has immediate effects on local economies and people's lives. (Larger scale effects depend on how long it gets dragged out).

It has become a cartoon where R's basically make a big fuss and refuse to raise the ceiling (AFAIK it's always the one party that objects to raising it. Feel free to give me data if wrong).

But, sarcasm aside, both you and I apply what is normal for our area to this.  NOBODY is spending $1200 on pictures, plan and 3D.  I‚Äôd say less than 10% of the houses in the 81 square miles I keep an eye on have 3D or the house plan.

You don‚Äôt need a lockbox if you are FSBO.  You are home to let them inside your house.  You don‚Äôt need access to the MLS, that is what Facebook, Zillow, Nextdoor and Craigslist are for.

There really isn‚Äôt an accurate way to track FSBO.  Real estate transactions may be public record and you may be able to do a rough comp from those, but if you never see the inside of the house or yard and the county information is questionably accurate.  It‚Äôs a guess.

My subdivision has 400+ residences.  We have a Facebook page.  Earlier this year, someone posted something like - ‚ÄúWe might be getting ready to sell.  Does anybody know someone who wants to buy here?  Not looking for a listing agent at this time, thank you.‚Äù  A week or so later someone else asked if it was still available.  It wasn‚Äôt.  I just checked the county assessor page and they sold for 33% more (ish) than when they bought a few years ago.  Could they have gotten another 6% to cover the realtor cost?  Maybe.  But that isn‚Äôt the goal, the goal is to make more with a realtor than you would on your own.  Since size does matter and they weren‚Äôt the largest house on the block and I don‚Äôt think they had a pool‚Ä¶I have my doubts they could have gotten much more.

No pictures, no staging, no having to pack up kids, self and animals and leave for a few days.  It was just word of mouth.",1627776162

Of course, one possibility is that the reason Sony/Konami/Geoff/Kojima aren't coming out and denying this is because it is real and they don't want to spoil it.

However, there are other reasons they might not.

Sony might not quash the rumors because it's generating massive hype and free publicity for Abandoned, and the moment they say ""this isn't Silent Hill/Kojima"" it might kill a lot of that hype.

Konami is selling Silent Hill merch and is likely working on a new Silent Hill regardless, so having the internet hyped for Silent Hill is good in their book too.

Kojima has the Death Stranding Director's Cut dropping in September, and having a ton of people look at his every tweet means a lot of eyeball on Death Standing DC and free advertising for that.",1627776162

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/Locdogg39.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

"savannah","t5_2qpx0","This may be a better second post, but this is a very interesting point that I don't know the answer to the implied question. First, let me say that I don't manage anything where 50k wouldn't qualify a family to live, so I have only a small dog in this fight.   


If the properties remain full, then I'd argue that the market is working well... unless it's removing individuals who have already established cultural/social capital in making the area their home. Generally, a high occupancy area is vibrant and good. Arguably, the ""new blood"" that is coming in or cycling through contributes to a broadening an deepening of that area's long-term culture. Starland is an example of this in Savannah. On the other hand, there's risks that people are priced out of homes they could never quite afford as they were just getting by as working class. Or SCAD just eats all of the subsidized housing. Yes, I've complained about that like six times in this post, but it's still horrible.   


If the properties are remaining empty, and they're just acting as vehicles of wealth/second-homes/third-homes, then they're contributing to the destruction of downtown. Savannah has passed the urban blight imitative to counter this. If you're just sitting on property without repairing it and making it function, they seize it by imminent domain. This was increasingly becoming a problem, but due to that initiative, it appears to be decreasing back down again. The seized property MUST be used for subsidized housing, too, so it's cycling back opportunities into the community.   


This is a surprisingly complicated issue, involving a series of competing objectives and rights and values of various citizens.

In the movie, moon blinked owlets appear to be mute, while in the books they can talk - albeit in empty, monotone voices - and while in the books their eyes are described as having a ""haze"", they're never described as having moon-white pupils.",1627776166

It's a variety of factors for me. One is that Vivaldi just got good enough, overcoming the pain points that kept me from using it full time and bringing tons of power features. Around the same time, FF went from being superior in performance to having performance issues for me. There have been a number of unforced errors on things like privacy and a sense that they're drifting in their mission and being heavy-handed about it at the same time. Add to that discontent over their canceling of Brendan Eich and their culture war sanctimony and palpable contempt for a significant portion of their user base, and they have pretty much burned up many years of good will with me.

"SCJerk","t5_3ckoa","There are a few factors at play:

-in the old days, wrestlers leaving was part of wrestling. For the most part, we didn‚Äôt know about it until they turned up on another show. Now, they announce releases online, sometimes months before the wrestler can debut elsewhere. So we get the ‚ÄúREEEEEEEEEE how can you fire m‚ÄôTommy Black?‚Äù whining for weeks before we get the ‚ÄúDAE Malkovich Black best debut ever???‚Äù excitement.

-we‚Äôve had more years of daddy Fed Badding. In the old days, Daddy said Fed was bad and WCW was also bad, so nobody really built their identity around Daddy‚Äôs opinions (except the Glorious Nippon fetishists). When WCW died, Daddy gradually went full Fed Bad.

-More people got online in the last twenty years, and as hardcore wrestling fans often are just maladjusted and dumb as shit, they‚Äôd just go along with the buzzwords and opinions that people who were online before them were spouting. And the founding fathers of wrestling Internet were bitter old Meltzerites, bullied-at-school nerds blaming Vince for their unhappy adult lives. Thus the Fed Bad movement grew.

-Summer of Punk. WWE found they could lean into Cena vs Indie Darling storylines for easy social media engagement. The repeated use of this, plus Vince‚Äôs attitude era character and the aforementioned dumbshitness of wrestling fans, further cast Vince and the Fed as the bad guys to the basement hivemind.

-WWE sometimes changing plans to cater to the hivemind made the downstairs community bolder, and they got fixated on ‚Äúbeating‚Äù Vince.

-General discourse on the internet got massively impacted when Trump went into politics. Toxic tribalism went through the roof as every dumbshit in the world jumped on the MAGA or Antifa bandwagons.

-AEW came along and gave the anti-WWE nutcases in the basement an identity to cling to.

-Hell in a Cell 2019 happened, and every day since then, the Galaxy brains in the downstairs community strayed further from sanity.

-Saudi show 2020 happened, and a mighty REEEEEEEEEE could be heard all the way upstairs. There was now an inevitable link between Bray Wyatt and the basement‚Äôs slip into psychosis.

-Covid came along, doing irreversible damage to the mental health of many. To people barely holding onto reality in the first place, this nudged them over the edge.

-This week, we had WWE breaking financial records and Vince joking about how little he cares about AEW. We had AEW fucking up with one of their advertisers. And then we had Bray Wyatt being released. The hivemind snapped.",1627776168

"NarutoFanfiction","t5_2yhj6","It circles back to the problem that we don't know how big any of the villages are. The academy shows that nine students graduate a year, but that's stupid because of how many shinobi we've seen in the war. There's either alternate ways to become genin or more than one class.

We are never given a true number to any military strength, other than the Allied Forces was 80,000 strong including samurai. In Boruto, they mention that smaller villages did fight in the war, but I don't like Boruto, so I'll treat that as headcanon rather than source material.

Going back to the question, the clans must be large enough to not devolve into incest. The IUCN estimate this to be at least 250-500 people. Except the clans must be even more homogeneous than the usual standard so let's vastly overestimate that to at least 1500. This itself becomes shaky because Konoha has a lot of clans yet probably has below 20,000 people, which itself is a generous measure considering that Konoha should have one of the lowest numbers amongst the five villages via the Kyuubi attack &amp; Suna invasion.

Some clans like the Aburame would accept inbreeding as their techniques aren't actually a bloodline and they'd benefit from biodiversity. Other clans like the Inuzuka would allow more newcomers than usual while some clans like the Nara, Yamanaka and Akimichi have to be more careful. Dying clans would probably accept any new people, even at the risk of weakening or destroying their bloodline.

The Uchiha and Hyuuga clans would not allow any biodiversity, barring an exceptional figure wanting to marry in. This means both clans must be large enough to not devolve into incest, putting their numbers around 1000. Let's throw the Uchiha number into the 500-750 range to account for the recent wars prior to the Massacre. Also, I don't think Itachi &amp; Obito could have murdered like 2000+ people in the night without something going wrong.

The Hyuuga should by all means be one of the biggest clans in Konoha. We don't see much of them, you say? Maybe because most of them are menial workers, servants and low level ninjas from the Branch family. After all, because of the seal it doesn't matter if the Branch to Main family ratio is 20-1. If the main family is pipelined towards being a shinobi, the branch family members are probably just ordinary people with a superiority complex.

"HearingAids","t5_2txac","This is why I use a nonprofit in BC, like Wavefront, (formerly WIDHH), as the for profits will upsell the aids. I have worn aids since I was 4, so I have a few decades of experience. 
Hearing aids need to be programmed so that you hear what you need to hear based on your type of loss. Some sounds can be increased or pulled forward while others can recede. 
I have no opinion or knowledge about what Costco does or doesn't do related to this. There are some trusted brand names specifically Starkey, or Phonak, that you may want to look into/ be aware of. 
I will say, what I always tell new aid wearers, that while it will help to wear the aids, please do not expect sound to be as before. You have a loss and the aids are an electronic amplifier, so you will need to get used to the way things sound. 
It will AMPLIFY EVERYTHING, even stuff you don't want or need to hear and it can be distracting.
This is another reason why having the audiologist program it is beneficial.  
You will likely have to train yourself to ""tune"" things out.
That being said, hearing aids have advanced greatly in the 4 decades that I have worn them as they have gone digital vs analog which I started with.

"canberra","t5_2r584","There was a royal commission report published last year on ""national natural disaster arrangements"", which included the role of the ADF in the 2019-2020 bushfires.

[https://naturaldisaster.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/html-report/chapter-07](https://naturaldisaster.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/html-report/chapter-07)

The report outlines that the ADF generally provides assistance ""on request"" from states and territories, eg it isn't the first course of action.

* 7.3 The approach adopted by the ADF to respond to requests for assistance from states and territories after 7 January 2020, which included a devolved decision-making process, was more flexible and responsive than earlier in the season. Consideration should be given to adopting this approach for future natural disasters.
* 7.4 Processes for requesting ADF assistance require clarification ‚Äì they should be clearer, making it easier for states to request the assistance of the ADF. However, states and territories remain primarily responsible for responding to and recovery from natural disaster.
* 7.27 The ADF has, on request from states and territories, previously provided a range of assistance in the response to and recovery from natural disasters.

Specific to Operation Bushfire Assist for 2019-2020:

* At a meeting of the National Crisis Committee (NCC) held on 11 November 2019, state and territory government representatives were advised that **the Prime Minister had directed the ADF ‚Äòto provide all the support that it can, within its capabilities‚Äô**, and that the Chief of the Defence Force had ‚Äòordered that units respond locally and proactively to assist State authorities**‚Äô**. \[762\] We heard that the assistance provided by the ADF was of significant benefit to the states and local communities. \[763\].

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","So you are correct with niacinamide. But niacinamide isn't a main spot treatment by itself generally and works best with other stuff. Most derms recommend less than those 15-20% formulations. Also with 10% benzoyl peroxide many studies show equal effectiveness with 5%. So your thinking isn't wrong at all.

But with spot treatments you want overkill. You don't want overkill for your daily routines. When I have a blemish or something I am trying to fix up I use 10% benzoyl peroxide, 9% salicylic acid , plenty of lotion for hydration and after 2 days of this if it is red I will cut back on one of the two and also apply a tiny touch of cortizone with aloe.

You never want to be too aggressive with your skin and spot treatments are NOT meant to be applied daily for more than a few days. Different people have different tolerances so I don't want you to think 2% salicylic acid does nothing. It is still very solid. But it is daily strength. When it comes to AHA or BHA more IS better in terms off exfoliating the spot.

On a daily basis you don't want to over exfoliate and most people shouldnt' do it more than twice a week. But we are strictly talking about spot treatment.

Just give this a try for your next spot treatment.

1. wash face
2. apply lotion
3. apply STRONG active spot treatment (AHA/BHA, benzoyl peroxide combo) . It won't be as strong because of the lotion buffer.
4. use bandaid or some type of little covering if at night
5. If you notice sensitivity after 2 days (e.g., red skin) skip active and just use lotion and face wash and apply a very light layer of cortizone 1% cream just to the spot.
6. Always use sunscreen

This works for whiteheads through to cysts. The difference is cycsts might take 5-10 days and whiteheads will take 1-3 days and will require no picking. :)

Make sure your normal routine has 1-2% salicylic acid in it. Or 0.5% if you are going for daily BHA. This will help to keep your pores clean. I personally use 2% BHA or 10% azelaic acid (w/ 0.5% BHA) on evenings I do not use 1% retinol. I alternate those throughout the week evenings and it keeps everything solid.

What I would offer is that some of this might be reality, and some of it might be misplaced assumptions - maybe they're not hanging out without you as often as you think?

I also dealt with a situation a couple years ago where I was left out of a few events with a group of girlfriends. Turned out one person wasn't a fan of me (her loss) and I was outside what she defined as the squad. Whenever it was her turn to plan events, I was not invited. However, everyone else in the group would include me in hangouts whenever they initiated the event.  The problem was, she was the biggest event planner in the group and it felt like I was being frequently excluded from my friend's circle.  Could this be the case for you?

Either case, sounds like you're doing everything right. Perhaps make it really clear that you're hurt when you're not invited (so that no one can play stupid if they don't invite you next time).

Her then opting to basically state every little thing she was irritated by about him, seemingly as a response to a relatively small outburst, is making things worse and childish as hell. I'm not justifying what OP did, I'm saying that her response to it is equally awful.

He then apologises and instead of accepting the apology and trying to move on, she plays the cold shoulder game, making her response to everything worse than his initial verbal outburst. If you think this is an acceptable sequence of events when someone is clearly tense and stressed to the point they had an outburst, then idk what to tell you.

I think he's one of the most underrated players in the league (and yes, before we go down this path, I've heard all of the criticisms before), he's played as a 9 before with good effect and goal scoring for Lyon/Ajax/Burkina Faso/Chelsea, and to be honest, I think it's far more suited to his skillset anyway.

As a result of this, I'm not worried at all, and I don't think we need another striker. Davis will go on loan, and if Wesley ain't up to snuff, we've got options. I'd rather we buy a midfielder before we thought about a new striker.",1627776175

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;The New York Times bestselling author of Darwin‚Äôs Doubt presents groundbreaking scientific evidence of the existence of God, based on breakthroughs in physics, cosmology, and biology.  
  
Beginning in the late 19th century, many intellectuals began to insist that scientific knowledge conflicts with traditional theistic belief‚Äîthat science and belief in God are ‚Äúat war.‚Äù Philosopher of science Stephen Meyer challenges this view by examining three scientific discoveries with decidedly theistic implications. Building on the case for the intelligent design of life that he developed in Signature in the Cell and Darwin‚Äôs Doubt, Meyer demonstrates how discoveries in cosmology and physics coupled with those in biology help to establish the identity of the designing intelligence behind life and the universe.   
  
Meyer argues that theism‚Äîwith its affirmation of a transcendent, intelligent and active creator‚Äîbest explains the evidence we have concerning biological and cosmological origins. Previously Meyer refrained from attempting to answer questiid itons about ‚Äúwho‚Äù might have designed life. Now he provides an evidence-based answer to perhaps the ultimate mystery of the universe. In so doing, he reveals a stunning conclusion: the data support not just the existence of an intelligent designer of some kind‚Äîbut the existence of a personal God.

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","Well I mean I‚Äôm sure some of that is factored in as well lol. With a typical 40 hour a week job you‚Äôd work 2080 hours a year (before vacation time) I‚Äôll say an average PTO a person gets in the U.S is maybe 2-3 weeks‚Ä¶so let‚Äôs say 1980 hours worked per year after vacation. The 3.5 months vacation for a teacher is 460 less hours worked than a typical 40 hour a week job with 2.5 weeks vacation.

So that makes 52 hours a week the break even point where a teacher works the same amount of hours over the course of a year as a typical 40 hours a week employee with 2.5 weeks of vacation. Anything under 52 hours a week and their salary is actually ‚Äúhigher‚Äù when calculating in hours worked. Anything over and you‚Äôre actually making less per hour.

I‚Äôm not a teacher hater, my wife is about to become a teacher. That‚Äôs a hell of a tough job putting up with kids and parents all day. All I said is vacation time is surely factored into the pay. If you make 50k a year and work 45 hours a week during the school year, on a per hour worked basis it‚Äôd be closer to a 57k salary.

Try to mimick more masculine woman styles until you are able to finally able to dress how you want. Be subtle with the colors you choose. For me I changed things like my toothbrush color, began using pastel sheets on my bed, sometimes cutting the collars off on my shirts made me feel better. 

Your mom should not hit you, that is not okay. They should not deadname you or use the wrong pronouns. I give you permission to correct them if you feel safe, every single time they do it. 

I know how it feels to not like my body, but with enough persistance it is something you can love and change into something you like. 

Nothing is wrong with you, you are completely normal and deserve compassion and respect like every other human. Never forget this.

You do not look retarded, and even with all the things you do not like about your body right now you deserve to be treated consistent with your identity.

You are not better off dead, though I personally know how it can feel that way a lot. 

You deserve a happy life and to be able to have kids, you may not be able to bear children but my doctor told me you can actually brest feed as a trans woman. Also you can freeze sperm and if you are bi/have a surrogate or a husband with a sister she could donate eggs so you could still gdt a child with both your dna. There are a lot of possibilties.

NSW Health said there are now 53 people in intensive care, 27 of whom are on ventilators.

You could go to restaurants and drink, or suggest that you meet at bars or invite people to your home for social gatherings. If you enjoy hosting/cooking you can eat safely and still get the social aspect fulfilled. And that way the food will actually be amazing too.

Another thing that I have seen non-americans be really surprised by is how cavalier we are with handing over our bank cards to a server or bartender. You don't have to worry about them stealing your credit card information, that just doesn't happen here in that way. If it's a busy bar where you aren't a regular then there's a decent chance the bartender might actually hold on to your card in a bowl behind the bar until you leave.",1627776179

"qualitynews","t5_2r20f","Police in Paris used tear gas Saturday as thousands of protesters joined marches to denounce plans for vaccine ‚Äúhealth passes,‚Äù the latest tensions around the world over government mandates to reward those who get vaccinated and maintain restrictions on those who refuse.

About 3,000 members of police and security forces were deployed in the French capital ahead of the demonstrations, which have flared weekly since the government announced the vaccine pass plans. Police fired tear gas and clashed with protesters in some areas. Protests also were held in other cities across France.

France is among a growing number of nations imposing rules aimed at encouraging vaccinations as the delta variant increases infection levels in parts of the world. France‚Äôs government-mandated health pass, set to begin Aug. 9, will require a vaccination, a negative coronavirus test or proof of having recently recovered from covid-19 to enter restaurants and other public spaces. France is also requiring health-care workers to be vaccinated by mid-September.

French protesters on Saturday made ‚Äúliberty‚Äù the slogan of the day‚Äôs demonstrations.

But polls have shown that most people in France support the health pass. While some vaccinated people may still become infected with the coronavirus, vaccines greatly reduce the likelihood of someone developing severe symptoms, requiring hospitalization or dying of covid-19, the disease cased by the coronavirus, according to public health experts.

Scientists have warned that the longer the virus spreads, the more chances it has to develop potentially more contagious or vaccine-resistant strains.

More than 52 percent of France‚Äôs population have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, but pockets of resistance remain strong. On Friday, the country confirmed some 24,000 new coronavirus infections, a major increase from the few thousand being reported daily at the beginning of July.

Meanwhile, plans for demonstrations in Germany were curtailed after Berlin authorities refused to authorize 13 marches that were expected to bring tens of thousands of protesters to decry coronavirus restrictions.

Judges at Berlin‚Äôs administrative court said that the ban was necessary to prevent a further rise in coronavirus infections with the expected crowds.

Berlin police spokesman Thilo Cablitz said the ruling targeted protests ‚Äúwhose participants regularly do not follow legal regulations, specifically to protect against infections,‚Äù like wearing a face mask, German broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported.

Some of the protests had been planned by Querdenker, or ‚Äúlateral thinker,‚Äù Germany‚Äôs anti-lockdown movement known to spread conspiracy theories and misinformation about vaccines and the pandemic.

Germany has also been reporting a recent rise in cases, outbreaks that experts say have been led by the delta variant and spread by the unvaccinated. The delta variant was identified in just 8 percent of coronavirus cases in Germany in early June. By July 22, it had increased to 84 percent, according to Germany‚Äôs Robert Koch Institute, the country‚Äôs disease control agency.

In Malaysia, hundreds of demonstrators ‚Äî wearing face masks and social distancing ‚Äî took to the streets to march against the government‚Äôs handling of the virus and to call for the prime minister‚Äôs resignation.

Malaysia‚Äôs embattled prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, has been under pressure to step down since taking power in March 2020 after forming a razor-thin ruling coalition with the opposition.

In January, Muhyiddin declared a pandemic-related state of emergency, a move that also enabled him to suspend parliament until Aug. 1. His critics say he has used the pandemic as an excuse for seizing power.

Saturday‚Äôs march in Malaysia‚Äôs capital, Kuala Lumpur, drew from largely young people frustrated with a steady rise in coronavirus cases despite the country‚Äôs lockdown. Demonstrators called for Muhyiddin to resign, the resumption of parliament and for the government to provide aid to those financially hit by the pandemic, the Associated Press reported.

Amid a heavy police presence, many wore black and some carried mock corpses to symbolize the country‚Äôs growing death toll.

After being blocked by police from entering a central public square, protesters sat in the street one-meter apart with a banner that said: ‚ÄúThe government failed.‚Äù The march later dispersed peacefully.",1627776180

However, since you identify with the perpetrator and not the innocent witness, I suppose we are in adversarial positions.

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","&gt; if the parents decide to push the idea on them.

Again, this can be flipped. As a parent, wouldn't you try to push the idea of being cis onto a kid?

It's not a tautology, unless you have some serious evidence to prove otherwise. Cis is not ""the default"", unless you mean the most common pairing of sex and gender. Trans people can be likened to someone being born in the wrong body.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Trans brain's reflect the sex they were born as

Not necessarily. From the [European Society of Endocrinology](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180524112351.htm):

&gt;Brain activity and structure in transgender adolescents more closely resembles the typical activation patterns of their desired gender, according to findings to be presented in Barcelona, at the European Society of Endocrinology annual meeting, ECE 2018. These findings suggest that differences in brain function may occur early in development and that brain imaging may be a useful tool for earlier identification of transgenderism in young people.

From [Smith et al. 15](https://scihub.wikicn.top/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763415002432):

&gt;Out of 14 studies of brain structure (total N=307, N MtF=195, N FtM=112) with a total of 23 results: 6 results that trans people had brain structure similarities to their birth sex, 12 results that trans people had brain structure similarities to their gender identity, and 5 results that unclear results (either no significant sex differences or no significant differences between trans and cis participants, or both).

12 of 18 (66%) results with clear results suggest trans people have brain structures with similarities to their current gender identity.

Here's a good article from Harvard; it links loads of different studies. [https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/gender-lines-science-transgender-identity/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The researchers should accept that they unnecessarily gendered the brain scans

This seems like a very silly way to wave away the evidence. The researchers know what they're doing, much more than you do. Maybe society should accept that we're unnecessarily gendering people? 

I'd also like to ask: why does a kid have to have a gender based on their sex? Nobody's going to do anything with their genitals until they're much older, so why should the toys they play with and their fashion styles be dictated by that?",1627776182

No matter how much you scream struggle or beg me to stop, I will not stop. Even if you show clear signs of severe pain and injury I will keep going. I know that you want to be fucked and controlled by the most dominant man because that's how biology works and I want you to get your primal urges fulfilled. Back then my mother taught me to treat women with respect and that's why I was asking women questions like ""Do you allow me to kiss you?"" and ""Are you okay with me holding your hand?"" and this caused me to still be a virgin when I was 27 years old. When I accepted the fact that women like badboys and I started being more sexually aggressive towards women, when I moved my hand under her top and opened her bra and touched her when she said she wasn't ready yet I got a lot more sexual attention from women. Female scorpions only want to be fucked by the male scorpions with the longest tail, she sharpest stinger and the biggest claws and who are the most aggressive and dominant. That's a way of evolution to create a stronger and larger species in every generation that is more fit for survival. You want the next generation of humans to be stronger? You have a problem with men becoming more and more effeminate and there are too many wimps now? Then of course you want to be fucked by a big guy who is dominant and aggressive, who will never show weakness or emotion and of course it will be painful for a petite submissive female. If you are getting fucked by most dominant specimen of humanity a 225lbs/100kg guy with pure muscles and a penis like a cucumber it will hurt even if he tries not to hurt you. The pain you experience during the rape will show you that the child is worth the effort of pregnancy and motherhood because your children will not become wimps.",1627776182

As great as it is that people are becoming more aware of mental health and taking it seriously I think part of the problem and why we need more awareness is people keep separating mental and physical health when they are intrinsically entwined. Even when we view it as two different things that both are serious, it's pretty rare for someone to have a physical health issue that doesn't impact them mentally, or a mental health issue that doesn't have physical impact/symptoms.",1627776183

I think the karjenners are the only reality family to benefit from this, it was such a perfect storm of events from 2013 onwards, Instagram blowing up, kimye marriage, Kylie take off etc

With social media they can control their own narrative, if it was back in the day the show would be thrown out and cancelled with the views their getting

The kardashians have just been luckier than kris  wants to admit, she sent the girls on career suicide for the most part, Kim helped them all clean up their image, they have 5 years of relavancy mark my words

"portugal","t5_2qmie","Levou-me com uns amigos sem eu saber. Era virgem na altura e tinha feito 18 h√° um m√™s. Pensei que ia s√≥ beber um copo com os mais velhos, e s√≥ percebi que n√£o quando cheg√°mos ao ""bar"".

Entr√°mos, eles pediram uma cerveja e um dos amigos que foi connosco perguntou se eu gostava de alguma mulher ali. Apontei para uma e disse que a achava gira. Ele chamou-a, meteu-me a falar com ela, e foi embora. Ela levou-me para o sof√°, e fic√°mos a falar um bocado. Passado uns minutos, colocou a m√£o na minha perna e a minha m√£o. Na perna dela, e perguntou se n√£o queria subir. O meu pai e amigos estavam perto a ouvir a conversa e o meu pai disse que pagava, caso eu quisesse. Eu n√£o queria, na verdade, mas n√£o tive ""coragem"" de dizer n√£o, queria parecer um ""homem"" perto deles. 

Subimos para um quarto com um bid√©, e a primeira coisa que ela fez foi lavar a vagina e depois tirar o meu pau e lav√°-lo tamb√©m. Lembro-me de achar muito estranha aquela situa√ß√£o. Mas depois pronto, despiu-se (tinha mamas excelentes) e fiquei duro, e ela foi direcionando tudo. Na altura achei que gostei bu√©, mas com o passar do tempo apercebi-me que n√£o, e foi pena eu n√£o ter escolhido o momento em que perdia a virgindade. Mas pronto, passou, e esse momento n√£o me define. E n√£o tenho ressentimento do meu pai, ele deve ter crescido a achar que era uma cena fixe. Pelo menos sei que nunca farei o mesmo com um filho meu.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","**[Nail_clubbing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_clubbing)** 
 
 &gt;Nail clubbing, also known as digital clubbing or clubbing, is a deformity of the finger or toe nails associated with a number of diseases, mostly of the heart and lungs. When it occurs together with joint effusions, joint pains, and abnormal skin and bone growth it is known as hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Clubbing is associated with lung cancer, lung infections, interstitial lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or cardiovascular disease. Clubbing may also run in families, and occur unassociated with other medical problems.

I commented that you should check out blendjet.com a shopify store selling a dropshipping product that is doing upwards of 1 million a month. 

Then I saw another user comment 4 great businesses to study and you told him it's not what you are looking for. I tried to help you understand that his comment was valuable to you - yet you thought you knew better.

New dropshippers get stuck in this loop where they put up a store, run ads, wait for sales, and then get surprised when they aren't profitable. 

The only way to escape this loop is by rising to the top. You can't do that if you are looking for inspiration at the bottom - which is why I tried to tell you not to look at people on ""our level""

I don't understand why you come here asking for help from people who are more knowledgeable and experienced in a field you'd like to get into, but then reject the help they offer...",1627776186

What are you hoping for with the remap?

Ignore any advice suggesting not telling your insurance - if you have an accident that requires a deeper inspection and they find out the cars been mapped your insurance will be invalidated and consequently you might find yourself in the shit.

To add how much it will go up by will be highly dependent on your age, what difference the map makes, where you live etc. Some insurers won't add much, some maybe a shit loads. There are loads of factors.

Trivial changes like de-chroming, changing the colour of your wheels, exhaust tips etc they don't really care. Full body wraps usually ok (insofar your premium won't change) but the cost of the wrap won't be covered. Any performance changes you really should let them know.",1627776186

Something else worth considering is, if you are American, Canadian, Latin American, Australian, etc., whether you have European family heritage (i.e., not UK heritage).

But just buying it low to sell to someone else is *not* right.

It's wrong to do something like that to anyone, but it seems particularly wrong to do it to people who are poorer to begin with. It's like with stealing: stealing from a wealthy man is wrong, but stealing from a poor man is clearly worse.

Some interpretations: Some themes used in Ergo Proxy are about being individualist and question the world and its establishment (politic/religion/science/technology), also there's no moral, be independant and ignore what the establishment wants you to do which means following the system but it's not without issues to not follow it and Ergo Proxy doesn't tell you what you must think, it's your story as seen with the main characters mostly thinking instead of saying what they think, it's because you have to interpret but you now what they represent:

(Re-L Mayer: skepticism, individualism Vincent Law: nihilist existentialist, Kazkys: abuse, greed, Senex: crime, despair, Raul Creed: antitheism, anti-establishment, Daedalus Yumeno: crazyness, Donov Mayer: order, Proxy One: revenge, tactic, megalomania, Doppleganger Proxy: depression, suicide, Monad/REAL: forgiveness, purification, metaphysic, divinity, Ergo Proxy: death, satanism (figurative sense which means against religion and norms).

I like Hakuryuu‚Äôs Mixi-Max design also more. Maybe even the most of all. I just think Taiyou did make more sense story-wise (dynamics with Tenma and his sickness). Although Hakuryuu also does. Taiyou just has that connection to the main character which is important in the anime. I still want to see some cool GO1 characters in a FFI (Taiyou, Hakuryuu, Yukimura, Kishibe etc.).

With Aki I agree. They felt like best friends and she is made for Ichinose.

‚ÄúThis type of atheist is the worst type of person.

"youtube","t5_2qh44","I investigated the channels a while back and the only promoting daniel cc did was on facebook and Instagram, weirdly enough his facebook barely gets any views, he is lucky to get 7 likes, and his Instagram/twitter hardly has any followers, the only thing he posted was his youtube plaque on reaching 100k subscribers, as for the story recap the only other place that channel does anything is on daily motion so their footprint outside of youtube appears to not exist for the most part.

It is weird, that the Movie Recap channel has been around for less than only 1 month and has 253k subscribers and his views are millions on the majority of his videos, I do not know what is happening but I think there is some engineering going on somewhere. Daniel CC even has a sponsor now, I believe it is Nord VPN.

I tried copying the exact same tags that they all did and I was barely cracking 100 views yet all the other ones that use the same tags would get hundreds of thousands, now even Mr Brain Junkie is getting millions of views per videos.

There is something they are doing because their growth is not natural and it has happened all at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that these people are all friends who have found a secret, it makes sense because what would be the point in 1 person having so many channels, looks like they found something out amongst them and they have made different channels to milk as much of the youtube coins as they can, they would easily be making close to 100k dollars a month with those views per channel.

Were it just the random battles required to get through the areas (and I am using Cyrus' reduction support skill) then it would be okay but now that boss battles are getting longer and I'm faced with the need to grind, I really really could use more attack type options.

That's the thing, I've played FFV and grinded for longer than I'd care to admit for those sweet job points...and enjoyed it (mostly). Even if the damage is balanced for it, the feeling of landing a 32hp hit from two characters before getting in 300s from the other two is disheartening and so it lends a feeling of being handcuffed to most fights.

The FOMO is always on the mind because you would be wondering how fun it would be to date around. One thing I'd say that dating around is not as much fun as people make it out to be. There are a lot of pitfalls with that. You may end up having to deal with sexually transmitted infections. Some of these could be cleared while others wont and you'll need to live your life managing the infection. Also, Depending your take on things, dating could be a huge money sink hole. 

It's also not easy to find someone who you like and is also willing to spend the rest of their life with you. A lot of people date a lot and sometimes do not find their life partner and spend their lifetime looking for one. That could get very lonely. 

I'd say that enjoy your time with each other. Develop a close bond and see where the relationship takes you. 

You both guys could be doing a lot of fun things together while you are in your 20's. There's little reason to think that your life would be restricted somehow because you are in a committed relationship.",1627776194

OP (that I originally responded to) is quite literally calling for the death of the unvaccinated for political power. When attempting to show how this is a horrific statement which hasn't been thought through I noted the statistical fact that Blacks are majority unvaccinated.

You'll note that I never actually called him a racist but instead said that I don't agree that a large black population should die in his purge. My statement, apparently, made a lot of people very angry.

&gt;That's like me saying I hate anyone who plays professional basketball (which I don't, just an example). Then you saying ""professional basketball is 80%+ African Americans, therefore he hates black people"".

If you said ""I wish everyone who played pro basketball would die"" and I said ""hey, wishing for the death of all those blacks is bad"" would be more comparable.

"ApplyingToCollege","t5_2y2r8","Hi! I‚Äôm an international and someone who was really burnt out in school and didn‚Äôt score well enough to have a good GPA (2.7 converted). And while my course was one of the most rigorous in the world, I don‚Äôt expect AOs to factor that in. I‚Äôve since taken time to reflect and regained my motivation; took my first ACTs, scored decently (30), and will take it again for a better score. My understanding is that GPA is just about as important as test scores are for US University applications (my country doesn‚Äôt do holistic review). I also plan on a career in computer science. With that in mind, my questions are:

1) Does a good essay in the ‚Äúadditional information‚Äù section in the common app help extenuate my horrible GPA?

2) Can you recommend some paths to University that I can take with my current GPA? 

3) Incomplete transcript: I have a few missing semester progress reports. No way to obtain it from the school either as it is now merged twice over and they probably no longer keep the records (due to plummeting birthdates, many schools are consolidating and merging to form a single school that serves the whole district). Is there anything I can do? 

Thank you for answering my questions. Uni apps here are quite straightforward and opaque, very unlike US applications so there is a huge information gap for me. Hope your answers can help me bridge that gap :-)",1627776197

2) Review each cards listings/sold prices and add inclusion/exclusions where needed. This includes looking at the cards images etc.  
3) Look at cards with irregular standard deviations of price and update inclusions/exclusions.  
4) Get crowd sourced/community reviews of the listings and update accordingly.  


So far, this has been really successful for determining card values and the plan is to open this up more to the community to crowd source validity of pricing. We currently have 1.5 million listings in our database so community feedback is essential.",1627776197

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Not the same person, but common misconceptions that I can think of:

-Yevon is the god of the Yevon religion.

Yevon is not a god, in fact, there are no ""gods"" that Spirans believe in. Yevon was an exceptionally talented summoner a 1000 years ago whose followers started the temple of Yevon to spread his teachings after he died. People pray to Yevon to show respect, not because they think Yevon is listening to their prayers akin to Christianity. People in Spira believe that if enough people follow Yevon's teachings Sin could be prevented from being reborn, not because Yevon is divine and can have such an effect on the world, but because they believe he had discovered something about how the world works.

-Dream Zanarkand is a ""dream world""

Dream Zanarkand shares geographic continuity with the rest of Spira, but it is made out of pyreflies due to a mass summoning rather than of natural matter. If the summoning stopped, then the city would turn into pyreflies and disappear. No one in Spira knows Dream Zanarkand exists because it is far out on the ocean and people only use chocobo-powered ships that only stay near the coast (machina is banned) and sailing is dangerous because of Sin anyway. People who live in Dream Zanarkand believe it is the entire world and that nothing else exists beyond it. (Maybe the fayth make them believe that, because it seems a bit preposterous no one ever thought to explore.)

-Sin is an aeon summoned by Yu Yevon

Yevon only summons Dream Zanarkand. Sin is not a result of a summoning; it is a living armour Yevon makes to protect itself to ensure his summoning never halts. (In a Japanese guide it is explained Yevon makes it with ""gravity magic"", which is why when you fight Sin it also has these kinds of attacks, and why it can defy gravity itself and fly.) Sin can't be an aeon because it has no fayth. An aeon is always a dream of a petrified soul (fayth) that is made physical out of pyreflies that just float around invisible everywhere in the world naturally when ""inert"".

-Is Anima a Final Aeon?

Anima is Seymour's ""Final Aeon"", but he never used it to fight Sin. Final Aeon is not any different from any other aeon, just when a summoner has a super strong bond with an aeon it can result in an exceptionally strong summoning. When Seymour summons Anima it doesn't look very powerful, though (I mean, we the player party can defeat it)! Anima's fayth doesn't share his goal, which you can find out from a sidequest, so maybe their bond is ""damaged"".",1627776199

Scholarship

School Visit

I think it‚Äôs fair to say I was a Duke fan before I was born. My fanhood started the day my parents met at RDU Airport, headed toward the business school at Duke. Eventually they got together, fell in love, got married, and had me, and the rest was history. I was wearing Duke gear in my baby pictures. When we moved to North Carolina, I talked all of the trash to anyone who‚Äôd hear it whenever we beat Carolina. My freshman year of high school we filled out a time capsule-type questionnaire that asked about where we hoped to go to college, and I said Duke. Four years later, that dream came true. I spent four of the best years of my life at Duke, going to every basketball and football game I could. I got my degree there. And seven years after beginning my coaching career at Colorado State, I was lucky enough to get the offer to come back home and be the head coach here. For the last 36 years, I‚Äôve lived my dream. I get to coach the program I‚Äôve always been a fan of. I get to help set a culture here that lives up to the values I grew up admiring. I get to be a leader in a community I‚Äôve always identified with. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always tried to do things the right way here. I‚Äôve never broken my contract, never cut a scholarship player, and I guarantee all my roster spots. I want to honor my family, my friends, and especially my players.

And I‚Äôm also proud that in my time here we‚Äôve been able to set a standard that no one else can match. We‚Äôve won more games than any other program. We‚Äôve won more NT games than any other program. We‚Äôve been to an NCBCA-record 15 Final Fours. Most importantly, we‚Äôve won three national championships. Of course, with great accomplishment comes great expectations. When you make the Elite Eight more often than not, the fans start to get restless with anything less than a Final Four. When you‚Äôre always a lock to make a deep run in the NT, the networks will pick you apart if you show even the slightest weakness. The flip side of that is that our games are on national TV a lot, our highlights go national all the time, and our players become household names.

This year is no exception to that rule. We have a deep team returning off of last year‚Äôs Elite Eight run. We‚Äôve got eight guys coming back from that team. That includes Matthew Johnson, the best rising sophomore in the country who‚Äôs poised to be one of the best bigs in the league next year. We‚Äôve already added the #3 recruit in the nation in Demetric Windler, and we‚Äôre looking to add another top-three player in Bill Brown or Toros Sanli, along with a key role player in Lamar Roberson from the juco ranks. I‚Äôve made it very clear that I believe that the squad we are building here is going to win the national championship, and your athleticism and ability to play the 4 alongside Matthew is the missing piece we need to get over the hump.

I expect you to play a huge role in that. You can earn a starting role at the 4, especially since we don‚Äôt have much depth there in the first place.

I also expect you to have your eye on off-the-court opportunities. A Duke degree is incredibly valuable; we‚Äôre a top-10 institution with brilliant professors and a 6-to-1 student-faculty ratio. Plus our campus is gorgeous, from the architecture to the Duke Gardens. We have three dozen Greek organizations and 400 clubs, so there‚Äôs always something to do.

Plus we‚Äôre just a five-hour drive away with games against nearby Dayton and Pitt, and we can add road trips to WVU as well.

This program is special to me. I hope it can be special to you too. Come join the Brotherhood.",1627776200

Obviously Amazon employs union busting:

- Threaten workers
- Fire organizers
- put mailboxes for votes to be mailed directly on Amazon property and monitor them (also super illegal) 
- successfully expand the number of workers in the possible union group from the initial ones who voted yes, to a much larger group with people whom are not in the same job class. For example, if truck drivers wanted to unionize, and you include a bunch of white color people in their vote, white color people typically are anti union.
- endless media campaigns
- change traffic laws near the facility to prevent organizers from organizing workers leaving the site.
- and much more.

Don't just say ""oh the workers didn't want it"". There's two fucking voted that happen, an initial one and a later one. The time between those is when amazon pulls all this shit. If the workers who wanted a union didn't actually have the votes, it would never get a second vote.

Ffs.

Title: **Landlord and renter (myself) mutually agreed to not continue forward.**

Original Post: 

&gt; Long story short, I started renting a shop from this guy, the deal was laid out with a year long lease. I paid for the first month up front. 7 days into the the month I paid for the previous tenant finally got their stuff out. 5 days later (before I had a chance to get anything in to the shop) my employee and myself went in to the shop and found out the roof had multiple leaks (it was raining). I let the landlord know about this to which he told me he was on vacation and wouldn‚Äôt be back til the 27th and had the roof patched a few months ago and was surprised. After contacting me on the 28th he told me the roof would not be replaced because it‚Äôs just something he won‚Äôt do, but he would have a roofer patch it again with no guarantees. I told him with our sensitive materials in the shop, that wouldn‚Äôt work if it leaks again. He told me that this isn‚Äôt a good fit for what we do given the shape of the shop and we should consider if we should even move forward. I thought about it and agreed with him. Sent a letter at his request to rescind the contract with the stated reasons and a request to return the months rent. He is refusing to refund the money, we never even got into the shop due to the issues, and is saying we‚Äôre on the hook for the rest of the year if I continue to press matters. Should I push for small claims or just cut my losses? It‚Äôs more about principal than the money honestly, but I want to make sure we move forward in the correct way. TIA

I don't think anything I wrote today suggested otherwise. I know the landscape and the difficulties that come with it. That's why I don't think progressives will beat them in the inside game. They need to be more aggressive on the outside. Leadership has already set up mechanisms to withstand the rise of leftists within their structure. There's a reason why Bernie was defeated twice, and it certainly wasn't because of policy, but rather dirty politics. So forgive me if I'm skeptical of working within a party that has no desire to move an inch to the left. I mean, look at the effort to defeat Nina Turner in a safe democratic seat. 


So without an aggressive push, regardless of who's involved, we're not going to see any positive changes from Washington. Millions are about to be evicted from their homes and we might be on the path to another minor lockdown. So many factors can change the dynamics that simply relying on electing progressives will be a major mistake.

See now, his strength is in his hips, and his power is in his stomach muscles. He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.
His bones are like beams of bronze, his ribs like bars of iron.
He is the first of the ways of God; only He who made him can bring near His sword.
Surely the mountains yield food for him, and all the beasts of the field play there. 
He lies under the lotus trees, in a covert of reeds and marsh.
The lotus trees cover him with their shade; the willows by the brook surround him.
Indeed the river may rage, yet he is not disturbed; he is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth,
Though he takes it in his eyes, or one pierces his nose with a snare."" Job 40: 15-20

It will be easier to learn the off-hand than it was to learn the main hand, so if you decide later on that you do want to strike left-handed, then it will be an easier transition than starting from scratch.  Many arts approach both sides equally (or somewhat equally).

I feel traditional footwork (especially that from Taekwondo) might be helpful here.  We train both sides, and we have a lot of footwork involving stance changes or foot switches.

&gt;However, I now want to learn to shoot (wrestling) without tying up. People at my MMA gym have quickly begun to learn that if I establish an upper body clinch I am going to launch them, and have thus decided to play the ""I'm going to strip all your grips and run away"" game which is negating my ability to clinch or at the very least taking the fun out of it. I also just want to learn how to wrestle in general.

Title: **Important Question**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hey guys,I have a question about whether or not this would be considered a crime. If someone talks to someone about an item over a local online marketplace like facebook and comes to an agreement over message so they willingly send the seller money online on a completely unrelated application and the seller never sends the item. Is this considered wire fraud? Is this punishable by law? If so what laws?

I don't know if you'll like more than Ergo. One thing that gets people with Elfen Lied is how well they can empathize with the characters or not. Many of the characters are written specifically for empathy, not sympathy. So If you dont have that emotional response to the characters, it'll be more difficult to see it's themes and perspectives.

Elfen Lied has 3 characters who directly relate too or capture the abuses trauma and mentalities that I had experienced in my life, so it hit very hard for me.

For some people, Elfen Lied can hit really hard and deep and affect their personality. Some people just dont get it and never will. 

Elfen Lied is definitely one of those series though, that no matter who you are, you wont catch everything its doing in one or two watches. It takes a few rewatches before somethings start showing up because of the way the series is detail dense and written to handle perspectives and emotional experiences.

 The narc ex did this to me and it pretty much made me feel like shit. Basically exactly what you described.
So I sent him a text saying ' Hey, I couldn't be more pleased to know that you are in therapy/counseling and working on yourself. I think you will find it very rewarding and when you do enter a relationship it will really help you be a better person to your next partner. Keep up the good work! '
Ooo... KEY words 'NEXT PARTNER'! 
It let's them know you have moved on and harbor no resentment. It basically flips it ALL back on them. Sets them free and most importantly, you free.  Your free. Your are so free.
 Literally drove him nuts I flipped it right back on him and wished him well. No supply. No let's work it out. No pouting. (Though I know it hurts like hell, DONT LET HIM KNOW! )
Guess what? He's not in therapy. Lol.

No matter if you showed it on the phone. That doesn't matter. You can flip it on him. 
It will mess with his head. 
Then go silent again. 
Trust me it works.
Remember who your dealing with. A liar. A fraud. A con artist. Someone laking basic empathy. 
 And someone that needs any kind of supply. 
 Narcissists don't like to be set free because by doing that you give them the clear message that you'll never want them agian. It freaks them out.

I'm sorry you had to deal with that. I'd really consider flipping that script and no contact again.

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","Everyone's comments so far have been spot on but one piece of advice you need and many veteran teachers need, is to set boundaries. 

Set boundaries on your time. Set boundaries on personal priorities. Part of the frustration and overwork teachers experience is the result of not keeping firm boundaries. 

There is always more work to be done. There are always more assignments and lessons to tweak and design. But you have to have balance that against you as a person. Sometimes you just have to let that stuff go like Jack in Titanic. Just let it go. It's gone. Move on. You are one person doing a job. 

You're a teacher, not a hero. You are not a pillar of society. You are not a saint. You are not superhuman. You're a teacher, a person who does a very important job, but it's still a job. You don't have to have lessons and projects that take five hours and $100 of prep to be a good teacher. You don't have to bend over backwards and work three extra hours to put the finishing touches on a lesson that is fine and gets the standards across. A lot of that superhero talk is just trying to guilt trip teachers to spending time and money on stuff parents and admin don't want to. 

You have basic info to teach and find ways to get that across as simply and easily as possible. 

I have often found so many teachers who are over stressed and over worked because they have too much grading that THEY assigned and spent too much time designing. 

Students don't care what you know until they know that you care. And if they know that you care, and feel listened to, then they will listen to you. And if students listen to you then you don't need to break the bank and sacrifice your life for them to learn . 

Build relationships with your students. If you do that, then the rest will fall into place. I have so many letters from so many kids that felt I changed their life and all I did was teacher them English. But when I did it, I listened to them and responded. And that was what made the difference. 

Also know your contract. If you have a union, join it. A massive stressor for many teachers is unreasonable admin demands and dictates. Once I knew my contract I knew what they could and could not require of me. I knew that ""it is the expectation"" was code for they wanted me but can't make me. Knowing what I could be made to do and not do helped clarify. 

And don't argue with people. Silence is golden. For you. Why didnt you do this or that or the other? ""Because I didn't, but now I understand your expectation. Thank you for the feedback"" then move on. 

1. Set boundaries
2. Build relationships with your kids
3. Know what you can and can't be forced to do

You do that and you will be fine.",1627776204

I think between the ages of 5 and 9 at the most and I think I was closer to 5, hell may have been less than 5 even. Anyways. My family used to go to the big country fair. When I say big I am talking about the Eastern States Exposition. Frggin' place his huge. (It is also called The BIG E) Every year for the past 10 yrs (except 2020 when it was canceled.) there have been over 1 million visitors. Anyways long story short, My family had a stand there. We lived there for the time of the festival. Overnights and all that. One of the days part of my family thought I was with my other part of my family and the others thought I was with the other half. I had wandered off or gotten lost in the shuffle or something I am too young to remember it. Some hours later I was ""found"" in the lost and found, eating ice cream talking off the ears to the lost and found people about whatever a little kid talks about and really I guess had no clue I was lost, how dangerous this all was, and how lucky I was. I assume I was on the younger side of my numbers because I don't believe I could tell them who I was or who I should have been with. I also know it was a more innocent time in life sometime in the 80s. I don't remember being scared but I do remember being lost kinda. I am talking about looking for someone familiar and wondering looking up at people and not finding my people.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","I am a huge Joel Klatt fan but he is so far off the mark with this it's kind of insane and I think even Joel would acknowledge that. CFB doesn't need a Commissioner of Board now. They needed a Commissioner of Board thirty years ago. At this point it does nothing because the NCAA has no power or respect from anyone or anything at this point. 

 I said this yesterday but the media members are being the most massive hypocrites about this entire thing in ways I didn't even think was possible. They helped create this entire mess. For the last decade plus they all had a giant circle jerk about the SEC and helped them create a media empire that in turn printed fat stacks. Obviously not every media member was like this but how many of them would go on some stupid ass hot take show and rant about how a 8-4 Tennessee would beat up on anyone from the Big 12 because they played in a ""harder"" conference. How many media members dared to expose how absolutely filthy collegiate athletics is in recruiting? Especially the SEC? Saban is the best coach in college football history but he's also the best cheater in college football history. 

 And I don't blame Alabama or the SEC or any school for cheating at this point. It's been around since the 60's. I do blame the media heads who cry about tradition and the honor of the sport. How a school can succeed even though they're in a small midwest town and yada yada yada. College Football has been filthy for years and has only gotten severely worse with the help of the media members who salivate at the thought of writing or talking about how Vanderbilt would spank Iowa State and the Shitty Big 12 because ""It just means more""

 Again I don't blame Oklahoma &amp; Texas or the SEC for doing what they're doing. It sucks massive balls for the rest of the country and universities but I do blame the media morons for crying foul and acting like they care about college football for years when they'd shit all over every conference that wasn't the SEC when given the opportunity. 

 Ugh. I needed to rant. Still love Klatt and understand what he's saying but the NCAA is dead and the Commissioner of Board is going to be some SEC puppet when they inevitably take over CFB. The time for this was not when the emergency was happening. The time for this was years ago.",1627776208

"LivestreamFail","t5_38jf0","&gt; WoW has tokens and that WoW is completely p2w

Huh? I've been playing WoW since Vanilla. Since when did WoW become pay to win? WoW tokens are used for game time or in game gold that could potentially be used to buy some stuff off the Auction House. However, most player power comes from doing the actual content. Or if it's PvP, doing the actual content and having some level of skill as a player.

You can buy some gear and other items to boost a fresh max level to a relatively weak (but stronger than fresh) power level. But I wouldn't consider this Pay 2 Win in the slightest.

Example: if end game content drops gear that has a power level of 100, you can buy gear and other items to put you at around a power of 70-75. You will be able to enter the end game content have a chance at the power level 100 gear, but you can't just buy that gear outright without doing work.",1627776208

"religion","t5_2qh39","When a true seeker determineth to take the step of search in the path leading unto the knowledge of the Ancient of Days, he must, before all else, cleanse his heart, which is the seat of the revelation of the inner mysteries of God, from the obscuring dust of all acquired knowledge, and the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy. He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the abiding love of the Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from all that pertaineth to water and clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that hate repel him away from the truth. Even as thou dost witness in this Day how most of the people, because of such love and hate, are bereft of the immortal Face, have strayed far from the Embodiments of the Divine mysteries, and, shepherdless, are roaming through the wilderness of oblivion and error.  
That seeker must, at all times, put his trust in God, must renounce the peoples of the earth, must detach himself from the world of dust, and cleave unto Him Who is the Lord of Lords. He must never seek to exalt himself above any one, must wash away from the tablet of his heart every trace of pride and vain-glory, must cling unto patience and resignation, observe silence and refrain from idle talk. For the tongue is a smoldering fire, and excess of speech a deadly poison. Material fire consumeth the body, whereas the fire of the tongue devoureth both heart and soul. The force of the former lasteth but for a time, whilst the effects of the latter endureth a century.  
That seeker should, also, regard backbiting as grievous error, and keep himself aloof from its dominion, inasmuch as backbiting quencheth the light of the heart, and extinguisheth the life of the soul. He should be content with little, and be freed from all inordinate desire. He should treasure the companionship of them that have renounced the world, and regard avoidance of boastful and worldly people a precious benefit. At the dawn of every day he should commune with God, and, with all his soul, persevere in the quest of his Beloved. He should consume every wayward thought with the flame of His loving mention, and, with the swiftness of lightning, pass by all else save Him. He should succor the dispossessed, and never withhold his favor from the destitute. He should show kindness to animals, how much more unto his fellow-man, to him who is endowed with the power of utterance. He should not hesitate to offer up his life for his Beloved, nor allow the censure of the people to turn him away from the Truth. He should not wish for others that which he doth not wish for himself, nor promise that which he doth not fulfil. With all his heart he should avoid fellowship with evil-doers, and pray for the remission of their sins. He should forgive the sinful, and never despise his low estate, for none knoweth what his own end shall be. How often hath a sinner attained, at the hour of death, to the essence of faith, and, quaffing the immortal draught, hath taken his flight unto the Concourse on high! And how often hath a devout believer, at the hour of his soul‚Äôs ascension, been so changed as to fall into the nethermost fire!  
Our purpose in revealing these convincing and weighty utterances is to impress upon the seeker that he should regard all else beside God as transient, and count all things save Him, Who is the Object of all adoration, as utter nothingness.  
These are among the attributes of the exalted, and constitute the hall-mark of the spiritually-minded. They have already been mentioned in connection with the requirements of the wayfarers that tread the path of Positive Knowledge. When the detached wayfarer and sincere seeker hath fulfilled these essential conditions, then and only then can he be called a true seeker. Whensoever he hath fulfilled the conditions implied in the verse: ‚ÄúWhoso maketh efforts for Us,‚Äù he shall enjoy the blessings conferred by the words: ‚ÄúIn Our Ways shall We assuredly guide him.‚Äù  
Only when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker‚Äôs heart, and the breeze of His loving-kindness is wafted upon his soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and the lights of knowledge and certitude envelop his being. At that hour will the Mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of the Spirit, shine forth from the City of God resplendent as the morn, and, through the trumpet-blast of knowledge, will awaken the heart, the soul, and the spirit from the slumber of heedlessness. Then will the manifold favors and outpouring grace of the holy and everlasting Spirit confer such new life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed with a new eye, a new ear, a new heart, and a new mind. He will contemplate the manifest signs of the universe, and will penetrate the hidden mysteries of the soul. Gazing with the eye of God, he will perceive within every atom a door that leadeth him to the stations of absolute certitude. He will discover in all things the mysteries of Divine Revelation, and the evidences of an everlasting Manifestation.  
I swear by God! Were he that treadeth the path of guidance and seeketh to scale the heights of righteousness to attain unto this glorious and exalted station, he would inhale, at a distance of a thousand leagues, the fragrance of God, and would perceive the resplendent morn of a Divine guidance rising above the Day Spring of all things. Each and every thing, however small, would be to him a revelation, leading him to his Beloved, the Object of his quest. So great shall be the discernment of this seeker that he will discriminate between truth and falsehood, even as he doth distinguish the sun from shadow.",1627776210

I tried to address this argument later on in my reply:

&gt;&gt; FSD neural networks do have a certain limit as well - over which they'll fall back to ""this is a crowd, gotta be careful"" simplifications. Why does Hotz believe that the ability to count more objects than humans is a sign of ""modernist thinking""? His arguments make no sense whatsoever ...

I.e. my point is that **there is always a limit**, and Hotz makes the flawed &amp; baseless argument that because FSD Beta can deal with bigger groups, it doesn't want to deal with groups at all.

The people high up in the educational government positions just make up random rules and tell us we have new things to teach. So next year my 8th grade science class is switching from an earth science/physics focus to a biology focus. Why? I have no idea.

On top of that every year is different. The last two years have been chaos, so everything we did was different to try to make it accessible for virtual students.

So nope. It‚Äôs not been boring. New advances like computers in classrooms and virtual learning are constantly giving us new things to do. I love science so I never get tired of teaching it. As long as the kids keep changing I have nothing to get bored about.",1627776211

"AcademicBiblical","t5_2w28m","There's a lot going on here, but the simple answer that the special hidden meanings many people with an... unnuanced understanding of Scripture are things that they have read into the text that are probably not there originally. The ancient scribes recording the name of God would not have been thinking forward to a doctrine of Trinity they did not believe in nor would they have ever thought up.

The letters in the name of God likely do not have an intrinsic meaning native to the original authors and interpreters of the text.

The use of Elohim (or literally, gods) rather than YHWH is evidence of two different written traditions in the text that were then edited into one document. This is called the documentary hypothesis, which includes the possibility of even more sources of the text we now have. The God describes by the term YHWH tends to be a more personal, direct, and intimate God, and so it makes sense that that would have been seen as God's personal name, while Elohim was perhaps a title.

In most modern translations, the word YHWH is translated as ""Lord,"" with perhaps a special kind of capitalization to indicate it's presence. The ""Lord God"" is generally the title either ""Adonai,"" or ""Elohim Adonai.""

For more on these questions, I'd recommend John Collins' *Short Introduction to the Hebrew Bible.*",1627776211

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","Yes, I do. And I cited some in a previous post. Additionally, I worked for the federal government in a GS-13 position and was never drug tested. As with teaching, it was only done if there was suspicion of being under the influence at work. According to a former Director of Engineering at Google (2007-2021), Google does not require drug tests of its employees as a condition of employment or once they are employed. Again, unless under suspicion at work.  
   With your argument that drug testing should be done because we work with children, does that then carry over to pediatricians or to **parents themselves**?

Your previous quote ""*Right..... and my argument is that literally any other profession.""*

As state above, I think if you came with arguments for your claim and actual evidence and sources, as opposed to citing your own personal experience, you might find people more willing to engage in a dialogue on the issue. Also, the way it was stated made it seem denigrating to teachers. I don't think people are upset because they are secret meth users, but the reasons that I just stated.

Incomprehensibly large and powerful leviathans that lurk in the depths of what we know as the deep warp, under the multilayered veil that is the immaterium. What drives such an entity/entities is probably utterly inscrutable to not only mortals obviously, but the seemingly ageless Ruinous Powers themselves.

Or maybe Tzeentch/Karios actually encountered such a fundamentally elemental part of the universe even beings as powerful as them would be infinitesimally tiny by comparison. Imagine making an immortal being like Tzeentch experience the linearity of time as mortals experience it, (amongst other things it might have gone through down there) would be unfathomably horrifying from their point of view.

edit* something just occurred to me- perhaps Kairos didn't experience the linearity of a single timeline as we know it in our reality, (even though it's subject to change as we understand it) but all multiple realities/timelines in our plane simultaneously to the point where he saw both nothing and everything at once.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Now see that is entirely reasonable. OP was asking to have it announced over the speakers, that, as well as just not sending anyone at all to clean, is what I was objecting to. 

It also should be noted that this doesn‚Äôt read much as a gender issue but more of a religious issue. I‚Äôm sure that most women wouldn‚Äôt have given a second thought to this. And I‚Äôm sure that the employee probably had no idea of OPs friends religious needs. Honestly I didn‚Äôt know that seeing a woman without her hijab was that big of a deal and if I was the gym I would like to know of those needs right away. The truth of the matter is that it‚Äôs 100% legal, and for security reasons, most gyms have cameras in their weight rooms so chances are she was seen on camera  without her hijab too.

I totally get wanting to give them the heads up. All I‚Äôm saying is that nobody is an *asshole* in this situation. The worker was doing their job, probably the same way they always have done their job. The patron had religious needs that the gym was unaware of (and they probably would have been more than accommodating had they known). The whole situation is uncomfortable, doesn‚Äôt mean anyone was an asshole. I‚Äôll say it again, NAH.",1627776213

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Unfortunately things have been heading that way for a while now, and with DDR5 on the horizon discrete GPU's are likely on the way to become a premium/HEDT only product.

With DDR5's changes like DFE, a 32-bank structure spread with same bank refresh, and doubling of burst length, APU's should achieve the memory throughput to become viable 1080p60 replacements for low to mid-end discrete GPU's, and I really think that looks to be the plan.

Depending on the success and viability of AMD's 3D v-cache, my bet is that over the next few years we will end up with $350-$500 APU's capable of 1080p60 med/high gaming. If 3D v-cache doesn't make it into the highest end APU's, JEDEC specs DDR5 up to 8400MHz eventually. Even 6200MHz quad channel DDR5 would be well into the 100GB/s+ RAM bandwidth territory which is plenty for 1080p60 in most cases.",1627776213

It went from 3 different clinical days during the week (with 1 night shift group) to 4 days of the week to include Saturdays (one night shift group remained). I believe the max was 6 students per instructor. We were divided to three med-surg floors with one of them containing COVID patients, the ‚ÄúCOVID floor‚Äù. I don‚Äôt really think we had a choice.

As for the language, I'm not familiar with people learning it during colonialism, but it still exists. It's intertwined and used alongside modern day Spanish, but not in all areas.

I was really nervous about our inspection, we just had on Monday.  I was debating all the scenarios that would cause me to back out, even though I loved the house.  It would be so hard!  But all of our issues were small, though we are going to have to address a similar bathroom vent issue.  In fact, there is mold growth in the attic - the inspector thinks it's only because of the fan and nothing more major than that.

But the issues your place has sound scary.  The thought of the furnace in a crawlspace that floods?  And electric panel?  Yikes.  I don't know much but I've always been told water and electricity don't mix, lol.",1627776215
"Aliexpress","t5_2uq32","&gt; I am aware of that part, but the problem is... you can still be highly taxed by the customs service. Like I said, they will tax how much they feel like and whatever they feel like. You bought a 300 dollar item? They could chard you 150 dollars to get your item out of custs or even more than the product itself, it's a lottery and honestly not worth it.

Yeah you may be fucked then RIP :(. Surface shipping in my country actually skips customs around %75 of the time so most of the time I don't even have to pay tax. Many proxies also allow you to declare your $300+ item as being worth $75 or something so you pay less tax however if that makes customs angry then you will be responsible.

&gt; I was planning to buy an i7 10700k from USA, brand new from an official store, it costs 990 converted to my currency while it costs practically 3000 here, so even if I was taxed to hell, I would still be saving money compared to buying it directly in my country. But if I get lucky and not get taxed, I still run the risk of having my product stolen or lost, it happens a lot, it is a lawless country and package stealing is MASSIVE and widespread. Your packages simply disappear or never get to you, or they can take up to 6 damn months to arrive at your door. We have the worst postal service on the planet. I am waiting for more than 2 weeks for a t-shirt to come from the neighboring state, meanwhile in USA in 3-4 days you get a package from 5000 km away through a Z train service or plane. It's ridiculous. What could be worse would be taxed, and then getting my i7 lost ot stolen along the way.
&gt; 
&gt; This has happened to my brother a few times. He lost around 7k+ dollars in a single package of professional working equipment coming from Canada and USA, MULTIPLE times, and it always happened the moment it arrived in Brazil.

Most proxies put insurance on whatever they ship so you get a refund if the package is lost, e.g. the rate you see the ZenMarket calculator I linked actually includes insurance. It's still a pain to file a claim and everything though.

&gt; I still remember the PS4 meme in Brazil, it was so expensive that it was cheaper to fly to USA, do a bunch of stuff, go to Disneyland, buy the PS4 and fly back to Brazil and still have spare money compared to directlying buying it inside the country.

That is crazy man WTF lol.",1627776215
"Padres","t5_2s8d6","Alternatively those that follow baseball and the Padres farm closely know how short teams windows can be and how difficult it is to win a World Series and are concerned. The Dodgers finally got one while having the best team in baseball for almost a decade.

"75HARD","t5_1npu72","Take care of yourself, friend! I feel your pain in trying everything and feeling like you're not getting anymore. Have you talked to your doctor about how to lose weight with PCOS? 

Andy isn't an expert, and it's great that this works for him and your husband, but that doesn't mean it's going to work with you. There's so little research and evidence-based weight loss studies for women, and even more so for women with hormone imbalances. I am also not an expert, but I've always heard pushing yourself too hard when you have PCOS has the opposite effect?   
I found a functional medicine doctor who has worked with me to find a diet and exercise regime that works for my hormonal imbalances. It can be pricey, but I feel the best I've ever felt and feel like I can finally do 75 hard now that I have taken the time get my body in a place where it can actually handle that physical stress. A functional medicine doctor could probably also help you get down to why you always end up with a cold or such too! 

I think as women we can get down seeing how easily men can lose weight, and I understand wanting to complete a challenge for yourself. I just recommend finding a way that works for your body and recommend not comparing yourself to your husband :)",1627776215

"OCD","t5_2qvqm","So, I would say in this instance, regardless of OCD, if you‚Äôre accusing someone of hurtful things despite knowing the person is ‚Äúnot like that,‚Äù specifically because you‚Äôre upset ‚Äî that seems to me to be the most significant aspect of this scenario. This is genuinely not meant to be insulting, but from an objective perspective that does feel like the most disordered behavior described. 

The tricky part about speaking to someone else‚Äôs OCD is that almost anything CAN present as OCD, what matters is the way the person is invisibly thinking in regards to the visible behavior. So unless your boyfriend were to describe the reasons he did certain things, it would be very hard to know it was compulsive. Could be, though. Anything really could be. 

ROCD typically manifest either in worrying about being a bad partner or, more commonly in my experience, worrying your partner is behaving improperly and you‚Äôre unaware of it. Some common compulsions for the former would be confessing any ‚Äúimmoral‚Äù thoughts or behaviors, asking for reassurance that they are a good partner, doing things excessively nice in an attempt to prove their worthiness, breaking up or reducing contact out of guilt, etc. Some examples of common compulsions of the former might be accusations of cheating or improper behavior despite lack of evidence, testing their partner to see if they will respond in an inappropriate way (eg ‚Äúwhat do you think of that attractive man?‚Äù), snooping, and researching improper behavior (‚Äúsigns people cheat,‚Äù ‚ÄúQuiz: Does my partner really love me?‚Äù, ‚Äúquestion: if she does this does it mean something bad?‚Äù).

As of July 29 we are sitting at about 279. You must be looking at the 30-day trends, but looking at a shorter time interval will not tell you the overall trend. When you look at two months, deaths are trending downwards, same when you look at 3 months, and so on. Short term fluctuations are to be expected, specially as we navigate seasonal holidays.

Example: polkadot shows 8 numbers behind the dot, but Ethereum only shows 5.
While in the history you can see all the details, so it's clear that the numbers are rounded up or down.

I don't want it rounded up or down, I want all the numbers on my funding and earn page to make it easier to update my portfolio. Besides that, I like precision.


Another thing I would like to see is the ability to halt staking rewards.
After unstaking my FLOW a while back, I am now gaining a 0.000000 FLOW reward each week (which is actually 0.0000005652) and this annoys me a lot :P

One last thing: just 5 transactions on the earn page is not a lot. Also takes a lot of time if you want to go through that list like this.


These are my suggestions, I hope you will take this into consideration :)

&gt;""Agatha Christie meets Groundhog Day . . . quite unlike anything I‚Äôve ever read, and altogether triumphant.‚Äù - A. J. Finn, #1 New York Times-bestselling author of The Woman in the Window
&gt;
&gt;Aiden Bishop knows the rules. Evelyn Hardcastle will die every day until he can identify her killer and break the cycle. But every time the day begins again, Aiden wakes up in the body of a different guest at Blackheath Manor. And some of his hosts are more helpful than others. With a locked room mystery that Agatha Christie would envy, Stuart Turton unfurls a breakneck novel of intrigue and suspense.
&gt;
&gt;For fans of Claire North, and Kate Atkinson, The 7¬Ω Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle is a breathlessly addictive mystery that follows one man's race against time to find a killer, with an astonishing time-turning twist that means nothing and no one are quite what they seem.
&gt;
&gt;This inventive debut twists together a thriller of such unexpected creativity it will leave readers guessing until the very last page.

&gt;
&gt;There‚Äôs a secret in Silicon Valley. A discovery. An invention. One so startling and surprisingly sinister that it needs to be kept‚Äîat any price.

&gt;Tim Tigner takes a step back from his bestselling Kyle Achilles series to introduce Zachary Chase and Skylar Fawkes in a fresh standalone novel that‚Äôs bound to keep you glued and guessing. With secluded meetings, sudden disappearances and strange murders; secret agents, skillful assassins and sexy locations; The Price of Time is packed with fast-paced action and first-class intellectual intrigue.
&gt;
&gt;Propelling the thrills and perched at the middle of the mystery is one of humanity‚Äôs great questions: Would finding the Fountain of Youth be a blessing?
&gt;

""Though the CIA piloted these safe houses as a stage for testing the effects of LSD, White‚Äôs interest shifted to another element of his observations: the sex. The San Francisco house became the center of what one writer called ‚Äúthe CIA carnal operations,‚Äù as officials began asking new questions about how to work with prostitutes, how they could be trained, and how they would handle state secrets. The agency also analyzed when in the course of a sexual encounter information could best be extracted from a source, eventually concluding that it was immediately after sex.

&amp;#x200B;

But perhaps unsurprisingly, much of White‚Äôs actions were driven by pure voyeurism: ‚ÄúI toiled wholeheartedly in the vineyards because it was fun, fun, fun,‚Äù White later said. ‚ÄúWhere else could a red-blooded American boy lie, kill, cheat, steal, rape, and pillage with the sanction and blessing of the All-Highest?""",1627776218

This causes more snow and, maybe more importantly, snow storms which add an amount volatility that prompts immediate layers of salt for people to get to work. Rust belt cities are known for proximity to great lakes.

I think it also plays a part that these rust belt cities are industrialized, so you have population dense areas with highly trafficked city streets (and parking lots) and the level of ""care"" with salt scales up. Maybe exposure, too - more taxis, food delivery, landscaping, etc.

But also, characteristically places of economic downturn, leading to more poverty, more people trying to ride every last steel flake of a car's frame, and underdeveloped but much needed public transit that means cars that shouldn't run are called upon to.

I know I keep saying rust belt when we're saying salt belt is the real term. But as I've presented I think the association of the term with cars is more than just geography and the word rust. When I was shopping for a car I ended up getting the one I went a couple hours outside the city for after being shocked how rust free it was.

Gender is a cultural and social construct, that‚Äôs why in different countries there are different stereotypes for how genders behave and in many cultures there are more than two gender expressions. 

And no one says you cannot say women. That‚Äôs not even the situation JK was replying to. There was simply an article that said ‚Äúpeople who menstruate‚Äù and she took offense because she wanted to make a grand political gesture. It made her look bad - because she said that only cis women who menstruate are real women and as I explained that‚Äôs pretty shitty to say for many reasons. So the issue isn‚Äôt saying women, the issue isn‚Äôt saying most women menstruate - the issue is saying that ONLY CIS women who can menstruate are REAL.

Tiffany is borderline emotionally abusive the way she keeps reminding Fonald about his gambling addiction and saying shit like she was a blessing in his life like he's a piece of trash. Yes he sucks, but leave him. Marriage is about building each other up, not tearing each other down.

I think Tiffany and Yara are different because Tiffany has low self esteem. I think she picked Ronald on purpose so she could put him down to feel better about herself. Same as Angela and Michael, but Angela is seriously actually abusive. Angela can hold US over Michael's head, but since Ronald doesn't care, Tiffany holds the gambling addiction and economic situation over Ronald's. 

Yara complains about legitimate things about Jovi (but God yes it was dumb of her to marry him), and Tiffany complains about valid things about Ronald, but she focuses on the things he can't change. 

If Ronald stepped it up and stopped being a shitbag, she would still complain and bring up his gambling addiction or whatever else she could grab onto. Like how Angela makes up things to blame on Michael so he's always on the back foot. 

I don't think Yara would complain if Jovi acted like a good father and husband or got a well-paying 9-5 so he could be home every night.",1627776224

"punk","t5_2qjx5","No specific order.

1 - Free show at the Federal Building on Wilshire Blvd in LA, 1983. Black Flag played along with a bunch of other bands. It was a weed smoke out for the California Marijuana Initiative. LAPD would not step foot on Federal land because they had zero authority and the FBI didn't give a shit. Was just a fun day...drinking, smoking weed and watching bands. Was there with a bunch of LADS and Quake and I walked through a dozen Suicidals and they would just look away.

2 - Bad Brains at Devonshire Downs in Northridge, CA. in 1982. I was so stoked to see them. Saw them a week or so before at the Ukrainian Culture Center, but this show was special. HR was going off the rails. Pit was insane and everyone was being cool to each other. Bad Brains would break into their Reggae songs and the crowed would just chill and the pit turned into a flowing sea of punks. Then they would jump into their punk shit and the pit would explode.

1- Bad Brains again...this time later in 1982 at the Santa Monica Civic. They opened for Discharge along with the Circle Jerks and Bad Religion. I was there for Discharge, but jazzed the Bad Brains were on the bill.

Before the show my buddy James and I were smoking weed behind some trailers next to the Civic and HR sees us and invites us into their trailer. HR smells my weed and laughs his ass off and throws it out the window, then he packs us each a bowl of some shit that fucked us up. We hung with them for about an hour and then went into the show. All the bands killed it, but Discharge was epic. I was up against the stage and Cal knelt down in front of us during ""Never Again""....it was almost a religious moment.",1627776224

COVID is definitely screwing up our plans, but we'll be able to stay outside for the most part if needed. We love hiking and there will be lots of pools and patio spaces. Even if we cancel our fancy dinner plans and just go somewhere with a patio, it will be ok.

If you're interested, we booked with Cactus Collective Weddings and it's been great so far, plus it's easy to postpone if you need to (we did). They have other locations besides Las Vegas. You just have to choose a few things (color of flowers and provide info for your officiant) and they arrange everything else. You can have add on elements too, were doing cake and champagne after the ceremony and added a videographer so that works we didn't invite can still see it. It's a good compromise for us.

I say go for it! There have been some beautiful pictures on this sub in they least week from elopements. I was inspired after looking at what was possible, it made it easy to make the decision for me. 

Good luck!

Furthermore, there were several metrics related to rebuild time within this review that I really keyed in on that convinced me to move to the 1621: [https://www.techpowerup.com/review/synology-ds1621-6-bay-nas/13.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/synology-ds1621-6-bay-nas/13.html)

It will make that Blues Jr. sing and I have no doubt you'll love it. 

A little tip from experience with Blues Jr's when dimed, If it gets flubby sounding just turn the volume down a bit on your amp and turn the attenuator up a little more to make up for the volume being turned down on the amp and also don't be afraid to turn the treble up a bit if needed. 

If you're running the stock speaker it can sometimes but not always sound a little flubby when pushed all the way. But like guitars and all other gear it varies from amp to amp and speaker to speaker. 

Ultimately a speaker upgrade sometime down the road fully resolves that if you even find it a problem or want a little more from the amp. 

But you may not even get the flubby sound. I always suggest and personally use Celestion Vintage 30 V12's. Everyone has their own personal tastes and there are lots of choices that aren't bad and you should alway go with what you like. They just work and sound the best to me for 12 inch speakers. 

I usually dime all my amps as I play with a classic rock level distortion most the time and just roll the volume back on my guitars to clean it up if desired. 

If I use single coils and they are getting the amount of  bite that I like I'll often use a simple clean boost pedal to push the amp harder without coloring the sound and tone of the guitar and amp. 

If you want feel free to message me on here and let me know how you like it once you dial it in! I nerd out on this stuff and like hearing others perspectives and experiences with gear.

It has been the cause of a lot of confusion and a way to get talent to do more than what they are being paid for.

This role would have to pay 400k a year just to make it worth it.  It's not something that Google or Amazon made up. This is something a manager and a recruiter who got together made up to get talent to work beyond their means to develop a shitty product.

1'st of all, &gt;!the ending with Asuka with the mind of a child, while quite off-putting, is what would happen if Shinji ceased being an angel, and while being a possible ending, as many others, it is not  the note on which the manga actually ends on.!&lt;

2'nd of all, &gt;!while I also originally thought that god appearing was an asspull deus ex machina, if you take a moment to think about it, Asuka (being human) and Shinji (being an angel)  would have a daughter that would be God or have god-like abilities, because it is often shown in the series that when Adam/life from Adam unites with Lilith/life from Lilith, the result is essencially God, as we see in EoE.!&lt;

&gt;Cesar Picton (c. 1755 ‚Äì 1836) was presumably enslaved in Africa by the time he was about six years old. He was bought and brought to England by an English army officer who had been in Senegal, and in 1761 was ""presented"" as a servant to Sir John Philipps, who lived at Norbiton Place, near Kingtson upon Thames in Surrey. Picton later became a wealthy coal merchant in Kingston.

&gt;Julius Soubise (1754 ‚Äì 25 August 1798) was a freed Afro-Caribbean slave who became a well-known fop in late eighteenth-century Britain. The satirized depiction of Soubise, A Mungo Macaroni, is a relic of intersectionality between race, class, and gender in eighteenth-century London. His life of luxury as a free man of colour allowed him to excel in elite activities such as fencing and made him notorious in London‚Äôs social scene as an exception to norms.

&gt;George John Scipio Africanus (c. 1763 ‚Äì 19 May 1834) was a West African former slave who became a successful entrepreneur in Nottingham, England.

&gt;Joseph Antonio Emidy (1775 ‚Äì 23 April 1835) was a Guinean-born British musician who was enslaved by Portuguese traders in his early life. He was later freed and resided in Portugal before being impressed into the Royal Navy. He was eventually discharged near Cornwall and later became a notable and celebrated violinist and composer in the region, passing away in 1835.

A separate but distinct species, *Storeria victa* occupies peninsular Florida. It has two fewer midbody scales (15) than *Storeria dekayi* and is more likely to have yellow collar markings on the neck.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom and are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.

""Retard"" is a common insult in England

Retardation or (formally) being mentally retarded is the mental illness. Simple.

I was saying that you seem young if your being offended by someone using a common insult, as kids nowadays are insulted about anything and adults aren't that touchy and don't give a shit. And you liking a game that is AIMED at children kind of cements that idea that you're young. Simple.

I didn't actually know it had been changed legally, so that's new information, but then why are you insulted about something that has been legally changed to ""intellectual disability"". Someone just used a insult then, that's like me calling someone a bitch and you getting pissy as they called them a girl dog.",1627776229

Many of our big city governments last year bailed on their responsibilities and thousands of people were victims of crime. The function of police is to protect our individual rights. As a society, most people will give up some freedom as a trade off to prevent anarchy. This is entirely consist with conservative values. The defund the cops crowd also aligns themselves with the people who think burning cities are nothing more than peaceful protests. Law enforcement also tries to push the envelope and expand their roll. Small things like seatbelt laws and bigger ones like gun control laws, the Patriot Act, and the TSA do limit people‚Äôs freedom. That is why there is little pushback in making murder illegal but people agree less and less as leaders continue to try to control society more. You called me a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù earlier. Btw, that really isn‚Äôt an insult to boomers. I am old enough to remember our society being much more free than it is now.  Over time, more rules and limits as to what you are allowed to do and people get used to being less free. There is a growing number of people who think socialism will fix their lives. It doesn‚Äôt , never has and never will because people are imperfect.

Because the original comic quotes it as a panel at the end of the same scene and used it as the title of that issue. Except, of course, Snyder used the Hendrix cover of the song while the comic, only really concerned with the lyrics, attributed it to Bob Dylan, the actual author. All of the issues have titles that are derived from quotes and include said quote at the end. The majority being purely textual: poems, a biblical passage, etc. But Snyder throws in the song, using the most well-known version of it instead of what would arguably be the ""correct"" one, despite it not really fitting the scene.

It's only one instance among many of Snyder completely missing the point, but it stands out for just how thoroughly he doesn't get it. He's copying without understanding. As soon as he has to start making his own decisions he reveals that.",1627776230

I‚Äôm the helpful type and learned finally that people do use/exploit that quality to their own weird enjoyment instead of actually being helped.   


But i really don‚Äôt know if your mother is doing that.  Or just knows she needs to move and can‚Äôt quite deal with the implications, real or imagined.

But your change in response will be better for you, and that is important too, always keep that in mind.

My dad was not the one who used my kindness against me, but he could be kind of passive-aggressive.  But sometimes when things were calm he might respond to something like ‚ÄúWell what‚Äôs holding you back...what are your concerns...what are you thinking‚Äù kind of questions, and though he wasn‚Äôt as direct as one would hope, there would be enough honesty of his mind and feelings to get a realization about what was really going on with the yo-yoing.    


So maybe try broaching the subject when there doesn‚Äôt seem to be pressure to move and she isn‚Äôt upset about things. You know by now how honest she will be, or if she will only give you clues, or no honesty at all and only games.

Astrology is based on ancient, spiritual beliefs that the stars and planets in the sky have some effect on our lives down here on Earth, and it has many forms across various cultures.

MBTI is a pseudo-science based on the Jungian (a psychologist, Carl Jung) psychology's model of the ""cognitive functions"", labels for different mental procsses (i.e, Fe = extroverted feeling, sympathizing with people and understanding social cues). It has some basis in observation, but I **must** affirm that **MBTI is pseudoscience, and has never been scientifically proven.**

That being said, many other people and I have used the ideas of MBTI to understand ourselves and how to improve our lives. We may be experiencing the Barnum Effect\*, but I still believe these models have use for ordinary people. (\*sorry for big words, TL;DR it's a bias that people experience)

TL;DR: Astrology is spiritual, MBTI is pseudoscience, just wanted to clarify the difference. \^\^

I was supposed to get a full refund according to the ""Manager"" i spoke with but all they gave me was a partial. I actually had to contact an Attorney.

So, this automatically entitles you to be assholes and control the event even other peoples looks? Does anyone else have to significantly alter their natural appearance, or is it just your sister you're unkind to?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It confuses me because I know the Military has really high standards for hygiene and hair and looks

Just not as high as yours, also having or not having hair has nothing to do with of hygiene, she has a condition outside of her control, she is not diseased and dirty for not having it. The military has rules of appearance, and my understanding is this year it was updated to remove minimum length but even prior to the update and having a minimum length it was stated unless exempt due to a medical condition or injury. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But apparently they don't care because she's been in for 8 years and just signed up to stay in more so IDK

Does part of you wonder if this is because she has found acceptance there, a sense of family, and a place where she is not judged on how she looks, because just reading this makes me wonder.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I want her to wear a wig and make up so she would not look so weird and fit in better

So lovely of you to have unconditional love for your sister and for accepting her for who she is and how she looks without having to change herself.  Oh wait....   no, my bad, thats what the army offered her.

Alif never joins with other letters. In words it is always by itself. Symbolizing Ahad.
 
Waw symbolizes sujood, worship.

Waw also is the way how babies are curled up in their mothers stomach.

Some say in order to be straight as Alif you need to bend like Waw.

We start in the shape of waw when coming to this world and we grow into the position of Alif.

There are more meanings attached to it from a Sufi standpoint but other than that there is no significance to them. It is a Turkish Sufi thing as far as I'm aware.",1627776233

If these don't work, you may have to shave off the clump! This is what I ended up doing when I had a similar situation to yours. 
Afterwards, I've kept up with ensuring there aren't any more clumps by brushing more thoroughly behind her ears.

I hope she gets used to the brushing! Try giving lots of treats while she's young! I don't think my puppy particularly enjoys being brushed so I just give her distractions like a bullystick. Works out pretty well for me.

Even if they are motivated.

I like what u/ayemyren said - the most important thing is work ethic and thirst. Those traits are relatively rare, though. Most people want to get paid the most amount of money by doing the minimum amount of work. People who currently have those traits are partners at large companies, staff engineers at FAANG, or starting their own companies.

When I see pandering, I can see it a mile away. Besides, it could make some interesting scenarios. I already came up with a few theories like everyone in the cast of the show are the kids of the originals or some kind of next generation terms. Kinda like Star Trek the next generation. I also compared this to comic books as comics do a similar practice of making new versions of the same character, etc. If they constantly preach about politics and what not, then it would be a tad annoying as I don't want to think about politics when watching anything HB.

Well there may be some murmurs of ""where's Stokes? Scared I guess"" but otherwise a pretty accurate assessment of the average casual Australian cricket viewer.

However, I'd be extremely shocked if the government didn't just allow whatever exemptions are necessary for the tour to go ahead as per usual. As Lemon puts it elsewhere:

&gt;it would be more foolish to be the government that cancels the cricket than to be the government that lets it go ahead

To be honest I'm kind of wondering where this little media storm has come from. We've pretty much only got headlines from English media about England players not wanting to tour without families, with no mention of where the players are getting the indication that families might not be allowed.
